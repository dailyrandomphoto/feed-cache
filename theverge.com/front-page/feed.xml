    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy S21 phones come with plenty of features — but not a charger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8tMlYAWrgwOjf4cGvYDKrfx8tgw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667031/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L4sDMU"&gt;It’s official: Samsung’s new flagship phones will ship without a charging brick in the box. The phones will include a USB-C to USB-C cable, but no way to plug it in to the wall. If it helps take the sting out of it at all, Samsung has dropped the price on its 25W charger from $35 to $19.99. If you don’t have a USB-C charging brick, or don’t have a high-powered one and want fast charging, you’ll have to add $20 to the price of the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9XpMu"&gt;The fact that it’s a standard cable means that many techy people will have something kicking around that can charge it — but it’s not hard to imagine a buyer who doesn’t. While last year’s Galaxy came with a USB-C charging brick, the one before that didn’t — and it’s the people who don’t upgrade every year who are less likely to have a free USB-C charging brick laying around. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pdYK6HS-V1e74ca0LKyVWpYbr54=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22234153/Eri_jZsXcAcUSv1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349037682555572226?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This leaked image of the S21 Plus 5G’s box shows the potential slimming effects that not including a charger could have.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7rWnUs"&gt;The writing was on the wall for the omission: last year’s iPhone 12s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;come without a charging brick in the box&lt;/a&gt;, and Samsung has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197394/samsung-deletes-ads-mocking-apple-charger"&gt;rolling back the ads it ran poking fun at that fact&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also a move &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317304/samsung-smartphone-chargers-2021-cost-environment"&gt;that’s been rumored for a while&lt;/a&gt;, but it’ll still be a bit of a sting the first time you unbox your new phone and have to use an old charger with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uD3ENE"&gt;It’s worth noting that this isn’t all for naught — for every person who would actually need a charger in the box, there would’ve been another who wouldn’t have, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307463/apple-iphone-12-power-adapter-charger-rumor-usb-c"&gt;it’s always good to reduce the amount of e-waste that tech generates&lt;/a&gt;. It just seems like companies could've found a way to make sure that people who need the chargers would have them, or included compatible chargers for one more year to better serve the people who aren’t upgrading every year (by the way, isn’t that the most ecologically friendly path anyways?)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the Samsung website, which includes a picture of the phone and a caption reading “Galaxy S21+ 5G comes packaged with just what you need - USB Type-C data and charging cable, ejection pin, and Quick Start Guide. Just another way of being good to the environment.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jg55BlqEVlJS3XFxW1Vso-Y792Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233617/slack_imgs.com.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung cites environmental concerns, saying that the S21 comes with “just what you need.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ljbg21"&gt;Speaking of things not being included in the box, the S21 will also ship without a pair of wired headphones (except, presumably, &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/10/21/heres-how-apple-is-shipping-earpods-with-iphone-12-orders-in-france"&gt;where it’s required to by law&lt;/a&gt;.) As with the charger, this is one less thing that will go to waste if you already have a pair of headphones or were looking to pick up the Galaxy Buds Pro, but it’s a bummer for people who don’t already have a pair and would’ve been just fine with keeping it simple. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how Samsung’s S Pen works with the new Galaxy S21 Ultra</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0TPXpD8cjqgxASTxtfF6epuoFmo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667023/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jkJS2j"&gt;Samsung’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21991813"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; supports the company’s S Pen stylus. Support for the accessory has been a staple of Samsung’s Galaxy Note smartphones for years, but this is the first time it’s been supported in the company’s Galaxy S-series. The stylus will be available as an optional $39.99 accessory, and Samsung says the S21 Ultra will also work with S Pens from other Galaxy Note or Galaxy Tab devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afNUJ4"&gt;As for what you can use the stylus to do on the S21 Ultra, Samsung has outlined a range of familiar use cases. These include drawing, note-taking, photo editing, and signing documents. Physically, the new stylus is a little bigger than previous Galaxy Note S Pens, but it retains the side button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZFJi11aO2QYYkS4ivp8fF5cVP8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233318/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When not in use, the stylus can be stored in the S21 Ultra’s case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RdEXJg"&gt;Unlike Galaxy Note phones, the Galaxy S21 Ultra doesn’t have a built-in slot for storing the stylus. Instead, Samsung is selling cases with S Pen carrying slots, which cost $69.99 when bundled with the stylus. Having to use a case to carry the accessory doesn’t sound as convenient as being able to slot it in the phone directly, but it’s a compromise given there’ll be plenty of Galaxy S21 Ultra owners who won’t bother with the optional accessory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDp54E"&gt;In the new lineup, stylus support is exclusive to the Galaxy S21 Ultra. You won’t be able to use an S Pen with either the Galaxy S21 or S21 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEPyMe"&gt;Rumors of the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s stylus support have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754983/samsung-galaxy-note-21-2021-smartphone-discontinued-stylus-s21-foldable-rumor"&gt;around since last year&lt;/a&gt;, and the feature was essentially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22196897/s-pen-uwb-comfirm-galaxy-s21-ultra-fcc"&gt;confirmed in an FCC filing&lt;/a&gt; at the end of December. Now that the Galaxy S series is inheriting one of the Note series’s biggest features, there are rumors that the latter could be discontinued. However, this has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22177972/galaxy-note-21-still-happening-yonhap"&gt;reportedly been disputed&lt;/a&gt; by one Samsung official.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag is a $29.99 Tile competitor </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZYSsXWTb8bv7LwYvOLnEfHPHX3k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667022/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FwK9H7"&gt;Alongside the new Galaxy S21 phones and Galaxy Buds Pro, Samsung is announcing a small Bluetooth gadget you can use for locating lost items, just like Tile. It’s called the Galaxy SmartTag, and it will ship beginning on January 29th. It will retail for $29.99, but there’s a decent chance that people who buy a Galaxy S21 phone will end up with some sort of bundled deal that gets it included with purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DscW7F"&gt;The Galaxy SmartTag works much like a Tile tracker. It’s a small Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) dongle you attach via a key ring. It pairs with a smartphone via Samsung’s SmartThings app, which can show its last known location on a map. When you’re searching for the tag, the SmartThings app can show a proximity indicator depending on the strength of the BLE signal, and you can tap a button to make the tag emit a chime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwYVpW"&gt;One strange decision, though: Samsung tells me the SmartTag will &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; work with Samsung Galaxy devices. It will not work if you have another Android phone or an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ab_CwBB8alpg1qWMVSNvKCzDcBE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22231217/Screen_Shot_2021_01_12_at_1.40.46_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Gmh8BW"&gt;Unlike the rumored AirTags from Apple or the rumored next-gen Tile tracker, Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag doesn’t support Ultra Wideband (UWB). One of UWB’s features is helping objects locate each other in space, so you’d get more data than a proximity meter. It’s a weird miss, too, because Samsung has been including UWB in its phones but hasn’t yet done much to take advantage of that radio (and neither, it should be said, has Apple). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GiRBLR"&gt;Samsung says that a UWB version of the device, called Tag+, will arrive later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VSxQnS"&gt;The biggest potential loser in all this is Tile, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274709/apple-tile-european-commission-eu-complaint-app-store-iphone-response"&gt;already accused Apple of engaging in anti-competitive behavior&lt;/a&gt;. With Samsung also making a directly competitive product, it could put even more pressure on the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TD6tqt"&gt;Once upon a time, all Bluetooth headphones worked about the same no matter what phone you used, but lately, both Apple and Samsung have enabled custom features if you buy one of their headphones. It seems possible that the same trend could apply to tracking devices in the not-too-distant future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces Galaxy Buds Pro, its most premium earbuds yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e8yieDFz5hbCm0symQREM1Ryhas=/0x34:1682x1155/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667019/BudsPro.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xOCcBb"&gt;Samsung is announcing the $199.99 Galaxy Buds Pro today, its most premium set of true wireless earbuds yet. They feature an in-ear design similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; but are aesthetically inspired by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt;. The Buds Pro aren’t bean-shaped, but they’ve got the same metallic-looking style and a similar charging case. The tweaked design “reduces the contact area between your ear and the bud, improving comfort and minimizing any clogged-up feeling,” according to Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e5x7Rk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rw-ZBoczHu4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nErj8y"&gt;More important is that Samsung says they deliver the “best audio experience yet” of any of the company’s earbuds thanks to an 11mm woofer and 6.5mm tweeter. The active noise cancellation should also be much improved since these earbuds now create a full seal with your ear. Samsung has also refined its ambient sound mode, which now lets you &lt;em&gt;amplify&lt;/em&gt; surrounding noise by up to 20 decibels. The Galaxy Buds Pro are able to detect when you’ve started speaking, and they can automatically switch into ambient sound mode and lower music volume when you do. We’ve seen this convenient trick on headphones like the Sony 1000XM4, but it’s still relatively rare in earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_NIKP-EzjOckc2tEQFhMwV9yG08=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233208/budspro.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e3HVfR"&gt;Samsung says the Galaxy Buds Pro also offer the best microphone performance yet from the earbuds lineup; they’ve got three built-in microphones and a voice pickup unit to help you come through clearly on phone and video calls. “One of the outer microphones also has a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) rating, further eliminating background noises,” the company said in its press release. “In addition, Samsung has integrated its new Wind Shield technology into the Galaxy Buds Pro. While a less protrusive shape minimizes the wind contact area, specially designed chamber with mesh filters out wind interference.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aQ21fmItS8rb8jj8Ak3SGPMRtIw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233203/budswater.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Buds Pro offer excellent IPX7 water resistance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oYSDKW"&gt;Some features of the Galaxy Buds Pro seem to take after Apple’s AirPods Pro: there’s 360 audio “featuring Dolby Head Tracking technology” when watching videos on a Samsung phone or tablet — a clear answer to Apple’s spatial audio. And the Buds Pro will also switch between Samsung mobile devices automatically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Rtsiq"&gt;Battery life is about on par with other premium ANC earbuds: Samsung says you can expect up to five hours of continuous playback with noise canceling enabled (eight if it’s off), and enough juice in the case for an additional 13 hours (20 hours with ANC off) of listening time. The Galaxy Buds Pro are rated IPX7 for water and sweat resistance, so they should be able to handle even your sweatiest workouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUYh0Y"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Pro will come in black, silver, and purple colors to match the new Galaxy S21 lineup. You can preorder today, and they’ll be available from retailers as soon as tomorrow, January 15th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra first look: polished design (and prices)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ohf7aS0VQJIX1JrQynhe9j-YDms=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667033/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Starting at $799 and available on January 29th&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Bcr1Iv"&gt;Samsung’s latest flagships are here: the Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21 Plus, and the Galaxy S21 Ultra. The first two — which start at $799 and $999, respectively — mark some of the least expensive flagship phones that Samsung has made in years, while the $1,199 S21 Ultra aims to be not just the top-specced phone in Samsung’s lineup, but also the best phone, period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vasZep"&gt;I was able to briefly try out all three devices last week, and they all share a new design language that throws out a lot of what I’d come to expect from a Samsung smartphone. The internal changes are more incremental from last year’s S20 lineup, though, and in some cases, they’re an intentional step back. All three phones will be available to preorder on January 14th and will launch on January 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrknfq"&gt;The new devices can effectively be divided into two categories: the S21 and S21 Plus, which are aiming to achieve a more wallet-friendly flagship experience, and the S21 Ultra, the ultimate Samsung smartphone that cuts no corners and aims to offer the most premium phone possible — with a price tag to match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z8zSO8"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Galaxy S21|100092" data-volume-uuid="242ec3170" data-volume-id="100092" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-266" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uUOavS"&gt;Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="wQ64gh"&gt;Unlike past years, the S21 and S21 Plus are almost identical devices this time around, barring the obvious differences in screen size, battery size, and one or two other minor details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1E3Mv"&gt;But the most important change with these two phones isn’t actually the hardware itself; it’s that after years of creeping prices, Samsung has finally reversed course, with the S21 and S21 Plus actually starting at $799 and $999, respectively, this year. That’s a full $200 less than last year’s models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCtUH9"&gt;In order to accomplish that, Samsung had made a few compromises in order to reach those lower price points. The displays, while the same 6.2-inch (S21) and 6.7-inch (S21 Plus) sizes as last year’s models, have dropped the subtly curved edges that have been a Samsung hallmark for years. Those flat panel screens also feature a step down in resolution from the 3200 x 1440 panels on last year’s models to a more modest 2400 x 1080 resolution. Both phones still offer a 120Hz refresh rate, though, although it’s dynamically adjusted now. Lastly, the RAM has also been dropped from 12GB to 8GB. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/186Qtt86WK6nB5BfKlTL1m8FVvw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232929/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Plus (left) and Galaxy S21 (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1zkIHr"&gt;The smaller Galaxy S21 makes an additional pair of trade-offs: the back panel is made of polycarbonate plastic, not aluminum, and it lacks an ultra-wideband radio (which the S21 Plus and Ultra offer for better integration with Samsung’s new Galaxy SmartTag.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtYrhs"&gt;Lastly, Samsung is following in Apple’s footsteps by no longer including a charging brick or headphones in the box, justifying it with similar environmental reasons (although Samsung will also likely save a few dollars by not bundling those parts in, too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dh92Gr"&gt;The big question is: are those admittedly small changes worth the $200 price cuts? We’ll have to wait until we can put the new S21 and S21 Plus through their paces in our upcoming review. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hFe-VPqD3aWkiOZKXv6ArfBcTUA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232921/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dKXfsR"&gt;It’s not all downgrades: the processor is Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 888 chipset, which promises big improvements in overall performance. There’s comprehensive 5G integration on both devices, with support for mmWave and sub-6GHz networks on both devices. The fingerprint sensor has been upgraded to Qualcomm’s new 3D Sonic Sensor Gen 2, which should be faster and easier to use. And the batteries are still big: the S21 still offers a beefy 4,000mAh battery; the S21 Plus has been upgraded to an even larger 4,800mAh one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSt4QD"&gt;But the biggest update this year is the new design, which ditches the glass-slab sandwich that Samsung’s been using for years for an updated look. And it’s easily my favorite thing about the new phones. After years of dealing with the protruding camera bumps that have been the de facto cost of offering bigger sensors and better lenses on our smartphones, the S21 and S21 plus embrace the camera bump instead of just trying to work around it. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CMSm12v55xWzjOz-aJfp052Narg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232920/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Plus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s7ZVWo"&gt;The S21 and S21 Plus still have a camera bump, but they make it look good by making it a seamless piece of metal that flows out naturally from the matching sides of the phone, with smooth edges and a spiffy two-tone design that just looks really nice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzyCMU"&gt;Largely unchanged from last year, though, is the camera system itself. Both the S21 and S21 Plus offer a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 64-megapixel telephoto lens, along with a 10-megapixel selfie camera. (The S21 Plus no longer has a depth sensor.) If those sound similar, it’s because the hardware is virtually identical to the cameras found on last year’s Galaxy S20 and S20 Plus phones. Samsung has made some improvements on the software side of things, including the 30x “Space Zoom” mode, a new “Director’s View” mode for video that makes it easy to swap between lenses while filming, and additions to Samsung’s “Single Take” mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSpguD"&gt;Samsung has told us that it will no longer over-smooth faces by default, instead making it an option. It’s high time that happened.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HQ0IYBxvlbiKR_MsSYaoiVtoPgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233312/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra, with S Pen and case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XUq3vN"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dd9LV2"&gt;If the S21 and S21 Plus are more restrained steps back in smartphone design, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a phone that imagines what it would look like if you never had to make any compromises. It’s a phone that promises the very best of what Samsung’s hardware and Android can offer — if you’re willing to pay for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2M8tJB"&gt;Starting at $1,119 (a price that doesn’t include any extras like an S Pen stylus or a case), the S21 Ultra is Samsung’s third superlatively named phone, the successor to last year’s S20 Ultra. And it has a lot in common with the original: a massive screen, a 108-megapixel camera, and top-of-the-line specs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKLqix"&gt;But the S21 Ultra is a more refined version of last year’s model, one that looks to smooth out some of the sharp edges of the old model for a better experience — literally, in some cases, thanks to Samsung’s new rounded design language (which is similar to the S21 and S21 Plus).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QV-3wxNRI7HBzVVRk76GjemWaqw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233319/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMPRS-gX4duxcdGclOLU06cKzNU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233310/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZFJi11aO2QYYkS4ivp8fF5cVP8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233318/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0009.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uVjfvZ"&gt;And looking at the spec sheet, the S21 Ultra checks almost every box: a 6.8-inch 3200 x 1440 OLED display, with refresh rates up to 120Hz (a refresh rate the S21 Ultra can hit at full resolution, unlike last year.) There’s 12GB of RAM, a 5,000mAh battery, up to 512GB of storage, and Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 888 processor — it’s hard to imagine Samsung cramming more in here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGPnxT"&gt;Of course, just because Samsung can’t fit it into the phone doesn’t mean it’s done adding features. The S20 Ultra will be the first Galaxy S phone to support Samsung’s S Pen stylus, which does S Pen things. If you’ve used a Galaxy Note recently, you’ll have a good idea of what to expect. The only quibble: the stylus isn’t included in the box with your $1,199-plus phone: it’ll cost an extra $40, or $70 in a bundle that includes a case that can store both the phone and the stylus. And those cases are pretty bulky, too, adding extra width to an already pretty big phone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x1fJYPTkfuKz2n_hkJlD-KKe9uo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233315/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ah66N0"&gt;And then there are the cameras. The original S20 Ultra’s camera tried to shoot for the moon, with its 108-megapixel sensor and 100x zoom mode that promised photography that could live up to the “ultra” moniker of the rest of the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u27L7L"&gt;The technology was incredibly cool, but it had plenty of issues. The S21 Ultra promises to offer a more refined experience for the second time around: the camera has a new focal length for slightly wider shots, a new laser autofocus system (similar to the Note 20 Ultra) that should help with the focusing issues on last year’s model, support for 12-bit color depth, and a more refined demosaicing process. Samsung is also working to give users more control over things like its AI-based photo enhancements, allowing you to adjust the level of smoothing, for example. Whether that’s all enough to solve the issues of the original or not, though, is something that will have to wait for further testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6f9jF"&gt;The S21 Ultra isn’t just about that big 108-megapixel sensor, though. It has an additional three rear cameras. There is a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, of course. Then there is not one, but two separate 10-megapixel telephoto cameras: one with a 3X zoom and one with 10X zoom, which Samsung says is designed to give users more flexibility in how they approach shots. The downside of all those added sensors is that it expands the camera array to almost twice as wide as the regular S21 and S21 Ultra models, which spoils the look a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sGrZtm1pLAsx2jJyW9c6328_C-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232923/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0008.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Yv4rEt"&gt;The Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra are a more deliberate lineup than Samsung’s past offerings. It’s a balancing act: with one hand, the devices show that Samsung has started to internalize the idea that not every phone needs every aspect of its spec sheet ramped up to the absolute max; with the other, it offers the Galaxy S21 Ultra, a phone that does just that for the power users who truly want that kind of device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZEQIK"&gt;It’s a philosophy that we started to see last year with the $699 Galaxy S20 FE, an intentionally cheaper Samsung phone that aimed to offer a premium experience at a more affordable price. The $799 and $999 S21 and S21 Plus feel like extensions of that philosophy, expanded from a niche “fan edition” device to the most mainstream of Samsung’s hardware. Factor in the almost omnipresent Samsung sales, and the S21 could be the most affordable Galaxy S device in recent memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHMNCu"&gt;For years, Samsung has focused on making the best phones on paper that it could. The S21 lineup feels like an attempt to make the best phone for the different needs of different customers, rather than simply the most excessive phone it can muster. It might be the right strategy in the midst of a struggling economy, but it means that its smaller phones aren’t quite as impressive. With the S21, if you want the best thing Samsung has to offer, you are going to have to buy the biggest thing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s refurbished Pixel Buds are $80 off at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MfT2kK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21400695/google-pixel-buds-2-2020-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Google’s latest Pixel Buds wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; don’t go on sale often, but Best Buy has knocked $80 off their normal $179 cost for today only. The catch is that these are refurbished and only available in the white color. Still, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729328917697804696" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 is a good deal&lt;/a&gt; if you wanted to try these out without paying close to full price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtdD6W"&gt;Best Buy cleans these models and includes all original accessories, but like buying anything refurbished, it’s a roll of the dice in terms of what condition your order will be in — particularly when we’re talking about in-ear headphones. You could get a like-new product with no issues, or you might run into a few issues like the folks who left reviews for these Pixel Buds. If you have a bad experience, Best Buy will swap them out for you if it’s within the window for returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Pt960a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10283614"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FhxH7R"&gt;There’s a solid deal happening on the 40mm-sized Apple Watch Series 6 (GPS) at Walmart and Amazon. At Walmart, the model with a space gray aluminum case and black sport band usually costs $399, but it’s down to $339 for a limited time, presumably. Amazon is offering the model with the red case and band, as shown in the &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;review video above, for the same price. Other retailers are offering these colorways for $379, at best.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google completes purchase of Fitbit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jXBcssWgF-USIIGT1DtsnondlJQ=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68666859/20200919FitbitSense5.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitbit’s recent Sense smartwatch.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Brent Rose for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A4B4AT"&gt;Google has completed its $2.1 billion acquisition of Fitbit, the &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/devices-services/fitbit-acquisition/?utm_source=tw&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=og&amp;amp;utm_content=&amp;amp;utm_term="&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The news follows the EU’s announcement late last year that it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22158271/googles-fitbit-deal-eu-regulator-approval"&gt;approved the deal&lt;/a&gt;, after Google made a series of commitments about its planned operation of Fitbit and use of the its health data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0MrBR"&gt;In its announcement, Google’s hardware chief Rick Osterloh said the acquisition was “about devices, not data.” Emphasizing this point, he reiterated Google’s commitments about how it will handle the acquisition in markets around the world. These pledges include not using Fitbit users’ health and wellness data for Google’s ad tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpfaO5"&gt;Osterloh also said the deal won’t affect how third-party fitness trackers work with Android, or how Fitbit works with other non-Google services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VMdlIS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The acquisition was announced back in 2019&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eyrHrc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/2021-update/?utm_source=go_mar&amp;amp;utm_medium=glacier&amp;amp;utm_country_code=en_US&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog"&gt;In a statement&lt;/a&gt;, Fitbit’s CEO James Park welcomed the news, and said the acquisition would let the company “innovate faster, provide more choices, and make even better products.” However, he added emphasized that Fitbit’s products and services would continue to work across both iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmJ4xr"&gt;“We will maintain strong data privacy and security protections, giving you control of your data and staying transparent about what we collect and why,” Park said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfcI0S"&gt;It was data concerns like these that have prompted regulators around the world to investigate the deal. Late last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22158271/googles-fitbit-deal-eu-regulator-approval"&gt;EU regulators gave the deal their approval&lt;/a&gt;, completing an investigation they began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353947/google-fitbit-acquisition-eu-investigation-antitrust-health-tracking-data"&gt;back in August&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vqsKYU"&gt;The approval came with a number of conditions, including that Google cannot use Fitbit data from users in the European Economic Area (EEA) such as GPS and health data for ad targeting. As part of the approval, EEA users must also be able to opt-out of having their health and wellness data shared with other Google services, and Google has agreed to continue to support third-party wearables with Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JCUJu"&gt;Google’s announcement appears to have been made prior to the Australia’s Competition &amp;amp; Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) final decision on the acquisition. In late December, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/dec/22/google-faces-400m-fine-over-fitbit-takeover-if-it-doesnt-wait-for-competition-watchdogs-approval"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Google risked a $400 million fine if it proceeded with the deal without the regulator’s approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3B7Jyt"&gt;At the time, the ACCC &lt;a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/accc-rejects-google-behavioural-undertakings-for-fitbit-acquisition"&gt;rejected Google’s proposed conditions for the deal&lt;/a&gt; over data concerns as well as fears that it could force Fitbit’s rivals out of the wearables market because of their reliance on Google’s Android. Although ACCC Chair Rod Sims acknowledged the concessions Google had offered, he expressed concerns that they could not be “effectively monitored and enforced in Australia.” The Australian regulator said its investigation would continue, ahead of a new decision date of March 25th, 2021. We’ve reached out to Google for more clarity on the ACCC’s pending approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJDcIG"&gt;Google announced its acquisition of Fitbit over a year ago &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943318/google-fitbit-acquisition-fitness-tracker-announcement"&gt;in November 2019&lt;/a&gt;, when Osterloh called it “an opportunity to invest even more in Wear OS as well as introduce Made by Google wearable devices into the market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="737HxE"&gt;In his letter announcing the acquisition, Park said Fitbit has now sold more than 120 million devices across over 100 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DisplayPort 2.0 monitors are delayed until later this year due to the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="DisplayPort cable" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_f2FSXf8c8-e3Z9A4o3dqp9Htvw=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68666854/twarren_displayport_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A DisplayPort cable.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PcGeCX"&gt;It has been nearly two years since the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) first published its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18760897/vesa-displayport-2-spec-standard-features-8k-monitors"&gt;DisplayPort 2.0 specifications&lt;/a&gt;, promising support for 8K monitors, higher refresh rates, and more. The first monitors with DisplayPort 2.0 were supposed to arrive in late 2020, but VESA now says it expects devices to ship later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8OFX5"&gt;“Monitors supporting DisplayPort 2.0 are currently in development, but none have been released to market yet,” explains a VESA spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “DisplayPort 2.0 is working now in new system chips that should appear in products later in 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xc6EIM"&gt;The delay is due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Hardware developers and engineers typically convene together a few times a year at a Plugtest event. These events are where multiple companies test systems and work out interoperability issues. “In 2020 VESA had no PlugTests, which has slowed the deployment of DisplayPort 2.0,” explains a VESA spokesperson. “VESA is now planning our next PlugTest for this Spring in Taiwan, so we expect to get this process rolling again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcHCrQ"&gt;DisplayPort 2.0 is important not just for 8K, but also to usher in improved refresh rates and HDR support at higher resolutions. The new standard will technically support up to 80Gbps max, nearly three times what is currently available in the DisplayPort 1.4 spec. In reality, this will allow for gaming monitors to run at full 4K resolution with 144Hz or more, and HDR support without compression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgHfiR"&gt;A number of gaming monitors are starting to bridge the gap with Display Stream Compression (DSC), which compresses UHD streams without a noticeable drop in visual quality. DisplayPort 2.0 will also support the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJw7ci"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-display resolutions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0xEWPe"&gt;One 16K (15360 x 8460) display @ 60Hz and 30 bpp 4:4:4 HDR (with DSC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hJrL8M"&gt;One 10K (10240 x 4320) display @ 60Hz and 24 bpp 4:4:4 (no compression)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="gMadSp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual-display resolutions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="k07vIw"&gt;Two 8K (7680 x 4320) displays @ 120Hz and 30 bpp 4:4:4 HDR (with DSC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GrCWpN"&gt;Two 4K (3840 x 2160) displays @ 144Hz and 24 bpp 4:4:4 (no compression)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="4ijhcR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Triple-display resolutions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="j6Aq4q"&gt;Three 10K (10240 x 4320) displays @ 60Hz and 30 bpp 4:4:4 HDR (with DSC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YJLBug"&gt;Three 4K (3840 x 2160) displays @ 90Hz and 30 bpp 4:4:4 HDR (no compression)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="NFKx9O"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242445/vesa-displayport-alt-mode-2-0-usb-4-4k-144hz-hdr-8k-16k-displays"&gt;DisplayPort Alt Mode 2.0&lt;/a&gt; also brings all of these capabilities to USB Type-C connectors, just as the industry prepares for USB 4. While we await DisplayPort 2.0’s arrival, HDMI 2.1 monitors are starting to appear more regularly. A number of manufacturers have unveiled new displays at CES this week, but most have opted not to price their HDMI 2.1 monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEgKYc"&gt;Acer is the single exception, with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22216979/acer-gaming-monitors-nitro-predator-xv28-xb27-xb32-ces-2021-may-price-specs-hdmi-21"&gt;$899 price tag for its Nitro XV28&lt;/a&gt;, a 28-inch 4K monitor with an IPS display, HDMI 2.1 support, and a 144Hz refresh rate with FreeSync Premium. The HDMI 2.1 spec is also capable of 8K video at 60Hz, along with support for video at 10K resolution. 8K monitors are still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16293326/dell-8k-monitor-review-ultrasharp-up3218k"&gt;incredibly rare&lt;/a&gt;, though.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>From fanfiction to Netflix hits</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Wattpad’s plan to become the A24 of teen dramas&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="2LtUbY"&gt;Kate Marchant was in the kitchen of her childhood home, standing across the room from her mother, when she got the email: Robbie Amell, who appeared on the CW’s &lt;em&gt;Flash&lt;/em&gt;, was &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/robbie-amell-float-film-kate-marchant-wattpad-1234776309/"&gt;interested in adapting her book&lt;/a&gt; into a feature film he would produce and star in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZ2eXK"&gt;For Marchant, a recent graduate of the University of Southern California who got her start writing &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter &lt;/em&gt;fanfiction, learning that Amell wanted to adapt something she wrote was a dream come true. Her novel, &lt;em&gt;Float&lt;/em&gt;, a teen romance set in a beach town, had been released chapter by chapter online over the course of seven years — far from the traditional process of writing a manuscript and hoping it finds its way into an editor’s hands. She had started it when she was just 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nGtSU"&gt;“That was probably the best email that I’ve ever been able to read to my mom,” Marchant told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; over Zoom from her family home. “She was very close to tears, which is always something that kind of moves you — to see your mother cry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RCzs5Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wattpad wants to work with its authors to create an empire that expands beyond its webpages&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7qvaRe"&gt;Marchant is one of a growing number of successful authors who have emerged from &lt;a href="https://www.wattpad.com/"&gt;Wattpad&lt;/a&gt;, a free-to-use platform that allows authors to publish their original work or fanfiction online. The company launched in 2006 and now has more than 90 million monthly users, with more than 400 million stories published that generate 22 billion minutes per month in total reading time. Like LiveJournal and Tumblr before it, Wattpad allows burgeoning authors and fans of different shows, books, movies, or celebrities to find a place to celebrate their shared fandoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIb6w5"&gt;Now, Wattpad wants to work with its authors to create an empire that expands beyond its webpages. Executives are turning their eyes to the burgeoning streaming industry, where platforms like Hulu and Netflix need a consistent flow of movies and TV shows to keep people watching. Teen romances, dramas, and comedies are in high demand, and Wattpad is sitting on a treasure trove of IP just waiting to be adapted. Young authors who start using Wattpad to experiment with their own writing could soon find themselves navigating the intricacies of Hollywood at a time of industry revolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ENZGam"&gt;Marchant has some help. She has a talent team now, working with an agent and talent manager through &lt;a href="https://books.wattpad.com/"&gt;Wattpad Books&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wattpad.com/writers/opportunities/studios/"&gt;Wattpad Studios&lt;/a&gt;. She’s also currently working on her next book. With an education in entertainment business and creative writing through the University of Southern California, she’s also prepared to enter the studio space to ensure her work gets adapted the way she sees the story playing out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHAcZv"&gt;“I was preparing to buckle down for the next three years and query agents and scour the publishers marketplace and really try super hard to prove that my audience on Wattpad was worth something — but Wattpad already knows how much that audience is worth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PjY981"&gt;Executives at Wattpad realized years ago that they were sitting on a treasure trove of intellectual property. In 2016, Wattpad decided to launch its own in-house production company, &lt;a href="https://company.wattpad.com/blog/2016/04/26/introducing-wattpad-studios-aron-levitz-will-lead-new-division-as-head-of-wattpad-studios"&gt;Wattpad Studios&lt;/a&gt;, to find stories on the site that it could sell to major entertainment companies, including major studios like Paramount and Sony or streamers like Netflix. Initially, Wattpad Studios would option the rights to books that came from Wattpad Publishing and then hand control over to whichever producer paid for the rights. In 2020, Wattpad expanded its Studios &lt;a href="https://company.wattpad.com/blog/2020/5/14/wattpad-studios-announces-two-film-projects-as-part-of-a-new-development-fund-to-fast-track-hit-stories-for-screens"&gt;business to start producing films&lt;/a&gt; on its own based on the works that appear on its site, possibly generating more revenue for Wattpad and giving the company more control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8esEr"&gt;As more people turn to streaming and as more streamers compete for constant attention, one group of viewers sits at the center: teens. Teenagers spend more time watching Netflix than almost anything else, according to a research team at investment firm Piper Jaffray, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/teens-in-us-spend-more-time-on-youtube-than-netflix-2019-10"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In turn, Netflix tries to find the next big teen movies (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134580/netflix-to-all-the-boys-ive-loved-before-release-stream-subscriber"&gt;&lt;em&gt;To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80143556"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kissing Booth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and TV shows (&lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/outer-banks-review-1290064"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outer Banks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) to keep people tuned in. Netflix, WarnerMedia, NBCUniversal, Paramount, and Sony are all buying. Before HBO Max launched, WarnerMedia pitched a portion of the platform to shareholders and investors as a go-to for the teen demographic. HBO might have adults cornered; HBO Max would help bring teens in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Gy4l4a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The decision makers can no longer ignore the power of YA.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tYUcuq"&gt;“The decision makers can no longer ignore the power of YA,” Aron Levitz, the leader of Wattpad Studios, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “When you have streamers, their metric is audience — it’s not awards, it’s not what I, as an executive, personally like. It’s, ‘We have to grow our subscriber base.’ They are being forced to listen to their audience, an audience who likes YA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZgjYg"&gt;Netflix and Paramount’s &lt;em&gt;The Kissing Booth, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X00f5S8S-wA"&gt;Hulu’s &lt;em&gt;Light as a Feather&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Aviron’s &lt;a href="https://after.wattpad.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;After&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are some of the higher-profile titles that have come from Wattpad authors. In October, Netflix announced that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixFilm/status/1318645585654599680"&gt;66 million people watched&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Kissing Booth &lt;/em&gt;within the first four weeks of the film’s release, putting it up there with new seasons of &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqzpY3"&gt;To find out what stories might be worth Wattpad licensing, the team uses a machine learning tool called StoryDNA. StoryDNA allows executives like Wattpad to look at micro and macro trends emerging in stories on the platform. On one hand, Levitz can see if a story is being read, shared, and engaged with by tens of millions of fans — and those figures alone can sometimes prompt Wattpad to start a conversation about adapting a writer’s work. That’s the micro trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fTGZKU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We don’t use the term ‘I like this.’ We use the term ‘they like this.’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NREoK6"&gt;The macro trends, Levitz told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, are far more interesting. These are subcategories of stories that are popping up in different languages and countries around the world — stories that Hollywood may be missing but Wattpad can see from a straight data perspective are bubbling up. Then, executives “dive in from a machine learning standpoint and deep learning standpoint” to understand exactly &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;’s connecting. That can be “Muslim romances” or “fantasy series about gay wizards,” Levitz gave as some examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z862IB"&gt;“What are the emotional ups and downs? What paragraphs do users really love?” Levitz said. “We don’t use the term ‘I like this.’ We use the term ‘they like this.’ It’s about what audiences are in love with, and our job is to understand why they fell in love with it in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WrJ7EO"&gt;Studio and network partners will sometimes come to Wattpad and say they’re looking for a project that’s “X, Y, or Z,” Levitz added. He and his team will go through their collection of stories to see if there’s something that might fit, but they will try to address the more concrete story they’re looking to develop. &lt;em&gt;Float &lt;/em&gt;is just one example of how it works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaloGZ"&gt;“For us, we go, ‘Okay, we hear what you’re looking for, but the underlying reason you’re looking for this is because you want a story that talks about a found family instead of the family you’re born with,” Levitz explained. “A story like &lt;em&gt;Float&lt;/em&gt; meets that specifically, and we get the process rolling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J5A87nFg2ErgtErzAMfKIMo5QPs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232967/laaf_212_al_0535r_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Hulu&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hulu’s Light as a Feather, now in its second season, started as a Wattpad novel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="W2dNjQ"&gt;Many Wattpad authors’ careers started in their bedrooms. Marchant would work late into the night, typing out chapters in bed while her sister tried to sleep just a couple of feet over. Another writer, Deanna Cameron, would sit in her bed in Kingston, Ontario, not too far from Toronto, typing on her laptop, typing late into the night as she worked on sending out individual chapters into the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cox3ee"&gt;Cameron started writing on Wattpad in 2011, after moving over from “another website” where she mainly wrote &lt;em&gt;Lost &lt;/em&gt;fanfiction. She started writing her novel &lt;em&gt;What Happened That Night &lt;/em&gt;when she was 18 and quickly noticed a difference: millions of people were paying attention. As she wrote, Cameron’s audience would let her know what they liked, what they didn’t, and would beg to know when more would be available. She started connecting with those strangers, Cameron told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;over Zoom&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;from her place in New York City, hinting about big reveals in upcoming chapters. Eventually, “people started posting, ‘I can’t wait for chapter 16! Chapter 16 is coming out in a couple of days!’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rD0FaF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘What Happened That Night’ &lt;/em&gt;is chock-full of character descriptions that scream teenage angst&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XrzwZK"&gt;In May, it was announced that Cameron’s &lt;em&gt;What Happened That Night &lt;/em&gt;is &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/05/wattpad-studios-what-happened-that-night-the-hound-david-arata-angela-lamanna-1202933820/"&gt;being made into a film&lt;/a&gt;. David Arata, a longtime Hollywood screenwriter who wrote the Oscar-nominated script for Alfonso Cuarón’s &lt;em&gt;Children of Men&lt;/em&gt;, is set to &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/david-arata-pen-what-happened-night-adaptation-1294505"&gt;pen the adaptation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s still in the earliest stages, and Cameron doesn’t know how much control she’ll have over the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUn8Mb"&gt;It’s easy to see why the story blew up. &lt;em&gt;What Happened That Night, &lt;/em&gt;a young adult murder mystery,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is chock-full of character descriptions that scream teenage angst (“black skinny jeans, black hoodies, black beanies, even a black winter parka with a faux fur-line that she chopped away with scissors into a black mesh trash can”) and typical teenage behavior (“They gazed down at the screens of their oversized iPhones, and used their manicured thumbs to scroll down, tribal print hats on their heads and texting gloves on their hands.”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JK9TLE"&gt;While writing the story, Cameron connected with fans through every new chapter published. She had full control over what happened and could work with the audience — if she wanted — to figure out the story. There was time to answer questions and respond to excited guesses about what happens next. Cameron told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;she sometimes worries about her work getting lost in translation as it goes through the adaptation process, saying “I’m a bit of a control freak.” For writers who have spent their entire careers with full autonomy over their work, ceding that control over can be difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXAqHb"&gt;“When it’s your own creative thing, you don’t know if you want to give it to somebody else,” Cameron said. “I kinda want to just do it all myself, please.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="woQNdt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you didn’t set out to be one of the most influential writers in the world ... the industry comes at you fast and furious.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cj0p1A"&gt;Levitz and his team try to work with Wattpad authors, especially young ones, to help them understand how the optioning and adaptation processes work. Wattpad Studios has all of the data it needs to help sell a title on the business end — it can bring figures and numbers to the Netflixes and Sonys of the world — but it still relies on Wattpad’s authors and their communities to parlay just how much these stories travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAJNMN"&gt;“To exclude the writer from the [adaptation] process would be a loss of one of the most important tools we have,” Levitz said. “With that being said, part of the studio’s job is helping those writers understand what it means to be in the industry.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxpwiC"&gt;Each project is different, Erik Feig, a longtime Hollywood producer and former head of Lionsgate Films (he oversaw the &lt;em&gt;Twilight, Hunger Games, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Divergent &lt;/em&gt;series adaptations), told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. On &lt;em&gt;After&lt;/em&gt;, one of Wattpad’s biggest success stories, the author, Anna Todd, was heavily involved. She appeared on set often and helped to produce, Feig said. His production company, Picturefirst, is currently adapting &lt;em&gt;Along For The Ride &lt;/em&gt;by Rachel Meinke as a feature film. However, Meinke hasn’t been closely involved. Feig wouldn’t say if that will change going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5WcwF6"&gt;Marchant doesn’t call herself an adult yet, and that helps her connect with the young adult audience reading her work. Having a room full of adults trying to make sense of what is authentically a teenage story, and trying to figure out how to make that work for as many people as possible, runs the risk of losing some of the authenticity. As producers on all of the projects that get picked up from Wattpad, Levitz said it’s their responsibility to ensure all notes studios pass on to them get to the writers, and they attempt to ensure writers’ concerns are heard if it’s a traditional studio working on the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4di2eD"&gt;“If you didn’t set out to be one of the most influential writers in the world, like a lot of our writers become, the industry comes at you fast and furious,” Levitz said. “We have a responsibility to take a moment to educate them, and help them make sure they really understand what happens next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pClymZpThLQTKQMnDjKnXuBY-kM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232999/126866607_1781483032008933_7991615642394760692_o.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After started as One Direction fanfiction on Wattpad. It’s since spawned two movies, including After We Collided (above).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TrSnIG"&gt;Now, Wattpad’s goal is to become &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549724/horror-movies-streaming-blumhouse-amazon-netflix-shudder"&gt;the next A24 or Blumhouse&lt;/a&gt;. To make that transition work, the company has brought on Feig in a new advisory role. It’s that connection between writers and fans that attracted Feig to Wattpad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYjWsm"&gt;“When you go to Wattpad, wildly different genres exist, there are different authors, different fandoms, different levels of execution, and yet you know what Wattpad feels like,” Feig told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “There is an opportunity to have some analogous version of that in adapted media as well, whether it’s film or TV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UHJkud"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Teen creators are the future of YA, and that’s a future these streaming sites want to build on.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7YmuJO"&gt;With more networks, studios, and streamers trying to find stories to turn into films, Marchant feels like “it truly is the future of the way that creative industries are going to have to go,” noting that it’s hard to “trust a boardroom with old white men in suits making decisions about what teens want. It doesn’t work.” Studios, networks, and streamers know they want: franchises or stories with huge built-in audiences. That’s why Netflix is partnering with game studios like Ubisoft to adapt worlds that millions of people know and Hulu is ready to pounce on any popular YA novel. For Feig, seeing Wattpad authors build that kind of excitement and long-lasting fandom on a website, and moving it over to streamers, is the goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYhvpT"&gt;“I really, really love that it’s not just passive reading, but a lot of the fan engagement around the channels on Wattpad are kind of interactive — something is created, where something is consumed, where something is ripped on by fanfiction, that’s a kind of fuzzy virtuous circle,” Feig told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iO9UCl"&gt;Levitz and his team have plans to tap even more writers to publish books or option out their online works, while writers like Cameron and Marchant are preparing to move into the next phases of their careers — all while keeping their Wattpad presence as active as possible. The script for Cameron’s book is being written, and Marchant is writing her next novel — one, she hopes, might also be adapted into a series or movie.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXTA1K"&gt;“Teen creators are the future of YA, and that’s a future these streaming sites want to build on,” Marchant said. “It’s undeniable. We’re undeniable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6BywyZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction January 14th, 9:50am ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story said Robbie Amell starred in &lt;/em&gt;Arrow&lt;em&gt;. He was in &lt;/em&gt;The Flash&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; regrets the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="keKjwg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294077/pokemon-snap-nintendo-switch-new-n64"&gt;a sequel to the 1999 N64 classic&lt;/a&gt; that tasked you with taking pictures of pokémon,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is coming to Nintendo Switch on April 30th, Nintendo announced today in a new trailer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfG4LZ"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;, players control a pokémon photographer who traverses through Lental, a region full of beautiful scenery from lush jungles to sandy beaches. Players collaborate with the region’s pokémon expert, Professor Mirror, and his assistant Rita to conduct ecological surveys, photographing and observing pokémon in their natural habitats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIBgwq"&gt;Gameplay remains similar to its predecessor, in which players travel in an auto-driving vehicle while visiting various locations in the region taking pictures to build their “Photodex.” Points are awarded based on the quality of the photos you take, and just like the original game, players can use items such as apples to lure pokémon in closer for a better shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3usPI"&gt;2021 is a big year for &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; as the series celebrates its 25th anniversary. Yesterday, the Pokémon Company International announced it was launching a series of musical events. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228760/pokemon-25th-anniversary-katy-perry"&gt;collaborating with pop singer Katy Perry&lt;/a&gt; along with other “rising artists to award-winning global superstars” to celebrate the franchise’s major milestone. &lt;/p&gt;
