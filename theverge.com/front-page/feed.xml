    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You now interact with coworkers through a flat rectangle — let’s get you a larger, better one&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="wGPX49"&gt;The shift to remote work has sent millions scrambling to improve their home office. There are many ways to do this, but the most important upgrade is the most obvious: the monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSkgqT"&gt;A monitor is key. You’ll use it hour after hour, day after day, year after year. Monitors even have the audacity to resist obsolescence, so the monitor you buy today might be the one you’re still using in a decade. (My editor and I both have decade-old Dell U2412 monitors that are still going strong.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90T38A"&gt;It’s an important decision, but not a difficult one, as there are dozens of great monitors to choose from. This guide will help you pick the best for your home office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lAypjJ"&gt;The sweet spot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UAHB2f"&gt;I’ve reviewed monitors and laptop displays for over a decade. While different monitors suit different owners, I believe the &lt;em&gt;ideal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;home office monitor has a 27-inch screen and 4K resolution. It uses an IPS panel, reaches a brightness of at least 250 nits, and can display 99 percent of the sRGB color gamut. Around back you’ll find a USB-C port that can deliver enough power to charge a laptop, along with HDMI and DisplayPort, plus an ergonomic stand that can adjust for height and attaches to a VESA mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EEg3lHG7XgzIvGr8zuzCeOUU9No=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161216/lg_ultrafine_27_inch.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;For $550, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fmonitors%2Flg-27up850-w-uhd-monitor%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22877788%2Fbest-monitor-work-from-home-screen-choice-4k-qhd-refresh-rate-ultrawide" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s 27UP850-W&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a 27-inch 4K IPS monitor that can also provide 96W of power to a USB-C connected laptop. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gDDTkS"&gt;Finding a monitor that ticks most of these boxes won’t be too difficult. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fmonitors%2Flg-27up850-w-uhd-monitor&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22877788%2Fbest-monitor-work-from-home-screen-choice-4k-qhd-refresh-rate-ultrawide" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s UltraFine line&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100009682-12839518?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fmonitors%2Far%2F8141%2F25-27%3FappliedRefinements%3D24271%2C43205%2C40619%2C19973" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell’s USB-C hub monitors&lt;/a&gt;, BenQ’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/BenQ-PD2720U-Thunderbolt-Reproduction-Professionals/dp/B07N4M92P1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PD2720U&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/BenQ-PD2725U-Thunderbolt-Mac-Ready-Accurate/dp/B0918QXTGN?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PD2725U&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=Verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-u28-4k-hdr-monitor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP’s U28&lt;/a&gt; can check them all. Only the price may be higher than you hope; snagging any of the above will cost at least $450. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwQwzH"&gt;But like I said, different monitors suit different owners. These monitors are ideal for work, but they’re expensive. They also lack features you’ll crave when it’s time to clock out and fire up a round of &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;. This guide will help you navigate the monitor world’s many caveats and find one that’s a fit for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vI4kHK"&gt;Size: 27-inch is best for most&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iiJpVl"&gt;A monitor’s most important trait is its most basic: the size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcjDKI"&gt;Most standard-width monitors come in one of three sizes: 24-inch, 27-inch, and 32-inch. Bigger is not necessarily better. A large display may look more impressive, but I find it uncomfortable when placed close to my eyes. There are also practical considerations like perceived pixel density. A big monitor will look fuzzier than a smaller monitor of the same resolution unless you move it further away — which isn’t always an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYLzYk"&gt;That’s why a 27-inch monitor is my go-to recommendation. It’s large enough to look impressive on a typical home office desk but isn’t excessive. In my experience, 32-inch monitors should be reserved for unusually large and deep desks, or corner setups where it’s possible to position the display around four feet away from your face. This is especially true for 32-inch monitors with a resolution below 4K, which look grainy to me at a distance of three feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t9XBWjLFFLhrg0E8lTn-K88eV6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161224/e1be7ffa_52fb_4a42_9454_64f151c20698.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BF4CZSV/?tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP 24mh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a decent entry-level 24-inch 1080p monitor for $175. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P9Fuwg"&gt;For the same reasons, 24-inch monitors work better if you have a small, slim desk (say, around 24 inches deep or less) or otherwise bring the monitor closer to your face. A 24-inch monitor may sound small, but it’ll look reasonably large because it’s so close. They’re also a great way to save money. You can buy a decent all-around monitor &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BF4CZSV/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;like the HP 24mh&lt;/a&gt; for less than $200. It won’t wow you, but it works in a pinch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qT8Q1a"&gt;You can be creative with size if you mount a VESA-compatible monitor to an arm, as this will let you move it to your preference (including the proper ergonomic height). If you’re just doing it to move a large monitor farther away, though, give it a second thought. Why spend more for a larger monitor, and a monitor arm to position it farther away, instead of buying a smaller display to start? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7XdTt"&gt;If you’re looking to stretch more screen across your field of view for multitasking, you might consider an ultrawide monitor instead. There, I think the choice is clear: go for a 34-incher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAwLT4"&gt;Smaller models lack vertical space. A 29-inch ultrawide &lt;a href="http://www.displaywars.com/29-inch-21x9-vs-24-inch-16x9"&gt;has less vertical display space than a 24-inch widescreen&lt;/a&gt;. Larger models generally have the opposite problem. Many are too big for a typical home office desk, not only because of their screen size, but because of the large stands used to stabilize them (some are several feet wide). You might need to rearrange your desk around a 38-inch or 43-inch monitor or add a top-tier monitor arm to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnfeQk"&gt;What about super-ultrawides, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;like the 49-inch Samsung Odyssey G9 series&lt;/a&gt;? These monitors can offer a commanding view and are a good alternative to a double or triple monitor setup but, like big ultrawides, you’ll need to build your setup around it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SnGk8XSIJDiK16hoGSTwflnPp4k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22026746/shollister_201030_42850003.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You might need to rearrange your entire desk around a super-ultrawide like the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Odyssey G9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eXO4Nl"&gt;Resolution: 4K is great, 1440p is practical&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7heyE7"&gt;Resolution is key. A higher resolution means more pixels, and more pixels means a sharper, crisper image. More pixels also adds flexibility. You can use scaling features in Windows and MacOS to increase content size for readability, or crank it down to show more content at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LPxN1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4K resolution&lt;/strong&gt; (3,840 x 2,160) looks fantastic and is widely available on 27-inch and 32-inch displays. It’s not that expensive, either. Budget 4K 27-inch monitors like &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=Verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-27-4k-uhd-monitor-s2721qs%2Fapd%2F210-axlg%2Fmonitors-monitor-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Dell S2721QS&lt;/a&gt; can get you 4K for $350 or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8AJmp_FpuoWrmUpNum1lOFE7lWk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161240/dell_s2721qs.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-27-4k-uhd-monitor-s2721qs/apd/210-axlg/monitors-monitor-accessories" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dell S2721QS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a solid budget pick for a 27-inch 4K IPS monitor at under $350. A USB-C version costs a good bit more.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5lrhOK"&gt;With that said, settling for &lt;strong&gt;1440p (2,560 x 1,440)&lt;/strong&gt; can save money. It’s a bit disappointing on a 32-inch display, unless you move it far away, but it’s workable. A 27-inch 1440p display can look reasonably sharp and is a good choice if you personally don’t care about having the sharpest picture possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7eFOt"&gt;You should probably avoid &lt;strong&gt;1080p (1,920 x 1,080)&lt;/strong&gt; in a 27-inch or 32-inch monitor, however. It will look grainy and pixelated. Small fonts and interface elements (such as buttons) can become difficult to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Vqort"&gt;Twenty-four-inch monitors are a different story; 4K is rare, and 1440p is often the premium option. In fact, most monitors of this size are 1080p. It’s not ideal but it’s acceptable, as decreasing size increases pixel density. A 24-inch 1080p monitor is noticeably sharper than a 27-inch 1080p monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sU3Oi5"&gt;Want a 34-inch ultrawide? Look for 3,440 x 1,440 resolution. This leads to a pixel density nearly identical to a 27-inch 1440p monitor (about 109 pixels per inch). A handful of super-budget ultrawides use 2,560 x 1,080 resolution which, like 1080p on a large monitor, isn’t pleasant. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/21/16804850/lg-hdr-5k-ultrawide-monitor-ces-specs"&gt;LG’s 5K Ultrawide line&lt;/a&gt; is the sole option if you want 4K-equivalent pixel density in a 34-inch ultrawide, but you’ll typically pay $1,500 or more. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0892MHG9H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s well-reviewed 38-inch with 3,840 x 1,600 resolution&lt;/a&gt; costs even more at $1,600 and, though it might offer more screen, is equal in pixel density to a 3,440 x 1,440 ultrawide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTbpHk"&gt;Super-ultrawides also don’t offer much choice. All 49-inch super-ultrawides I’m aware of use the same 5,120 x 1,440 resolution which, again, roughly equals the pixel density of a 1440p 27-inch display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4iOM4R"&gt;Connectivity: USB-C is excellent but expensive &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BgYTLi"&gt;Most monitors have HDMI and DisplayPort. There’s no great reason to prefer one over the other for remote work. The huge majority of monitors sold today offer both, so the port you use will likely come down to what’s available on your PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yXUJwca70nDbgIfTLAQ98BHSdg4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161266/lg_monitor_connections.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This LG monitor has four video inputs, from top left to bottom left: Thunderbolt / USB-C, DisplayPort, and a pair of HDMIs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lIL7K9"&gt;What about HDMI 2.1? It’s not necessary for remote work, and productivity monitors with HDMI 2.1 aren’t yet a thing. Be warned that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22833233/hdmi-2-1-fake-marketing-brand-frl-vrr-allm-bandwidth"&gt;HDMI 2.1 could get messy in 2022 due to the standard’s lax certification&lt;/a&gt;. It’s key only if you want to connect a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X game console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUIXtw"&gt;If you’ve got extra cash to spend, the galaxy-brain move is to ignore HDMI and DisplayPort entirely and leap to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/usb-c"&gt;USB-C&lt;/a&gt; and/or Thunderbolt. USB-C and Thunderbolt are great because they allow a single-cable solution for modern laptops that support the standard. You can plug in the laptop and charge it from the monitor while sending video to the monitor simultaneously. The best USB-C monitors even act as a hub with multiple extra ports like USB-A, USB-C, and ethernet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q8ScKeVeijxOihxafdrXZjLz7iI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161289/dell_hub_monitor_27_inch.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The underside of this 27-inch Dell USB-C Hub Monitor is bristling with connectivity, much of it accessible via a single USB-C cable that also provides 90W of charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c8MGb1"&gt;Just make sure you check the fine print. Look for USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and Power Delivery, or Thunderbolt with Power Delivery (the standard has DisplayPort baked in). Those sorts of USB-C ports aren’t exactly uncommon on laptops: even the modest ThinkPad E545 I bought a few years back includes them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFZlY2"&gt;But you’ll also need to make sure the monitor you buy provides enough electricity. Power Delivery currently maxes out at 100 watts, so even the most powerful monitors can’t fully power laptops like a top-spec Razer Blade or high-end MacBook Pro 16, but a monitor that delivers 60 watts or even 45 watts might be enough if you have a thin-and-light laptop like a Dell XPS 13 or MacBook Air. The higher the better, but if the USB-C monitor doesn’t deliver as much power as your laptop’s power brick, your battery might only charge when it’s idle or even powered off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5youF"&gt;USB-C monitors are also expensive. The benefits often add several hundred dollars to the price when compared to an otherwise similar monitor that lacks USB-C. It’s worth the money, though: in 2019, I purchased a Viewsonic VG2455-2K for a sweet one-cable connection to USB-C capable laptops, and find it ideal for swiftly connecting my laptop to a larger screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0U3Lel"&gt;Ergonomics: The height has it &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ox8h7l"&gt;Any monitor worth your attention will have a stand that at least adjusts for height, usually along a range from 100 to 150 millimeters. Sure, you can stack it on books or buy a plastic riser, but that’s added hassle and clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CC5Gs6"&gt;Many monitors also adjust for tilt and swivel, and some pivot 90 degrees into portrait orientation. That can be particularly handy when a monitor is used as a second display. For example, you could swivel a monitor to directly face you while doing detailed work, like editing a photo, and swing it away when it’s just displaying Slack or Discord. Tilt is similar but on the vertical axis, and especially handy if you have a standing desk, as you may need to tilt the monitor up while the desk is standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cao8nRaGJLy_0rHQwAXJSPJI-L0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161307/fully_jarvis_monitor_arm.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fully&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fjarvis-monitor-arm.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22877788%2Fbest-monitor-work-from-home-screen-choice-4k-qhd-refresh-rate-ultrawide" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;$129 Fully Jarvis Monitor Arm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a well-reviewed arm with a 15-year warranty.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yrkdaa"&gt;But if your monitor doesn’t have enough range of motion, or you want to free up space on your desk, you could instead add a VESA-compatible monitor arm to get it off the ground. Look for monitors with a 100mm x 100mm VESA spacing pattern. This is an extremely common feature found in all but the most affordable monitors, and you only need to worry about the 100mm spacing pattern. Others exist, but are relevant to other types of displays (like televisions). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mabdrf"&gt;A monitor arm is rarely a necessity, but it’s great for multi-monitor setups that place secondary displays around and above your main monitor, or for positioning an especially large and bulky monitor. Unfortunately, monitor arms can also be a bit expensive. A basic monitor arm off Amazon can run $30 to $50, but I’ve been burnt on their quality in the past. A good arm like those from Jarvis or Ergotron will start around $130. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3bJ6Ic"&gt;Larger, heavier monitors will need a beefier, more expensive arm: &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ergotron.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fproduct-details%2F45-647%23%3Fcolor%3Dwhite&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22877788%2Fbest-monitor-work-from-home-screen-choice-4k-qhd-refresh-rate-ultrawide" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the model Ergotron recommends&lt;/a&gt; for the 49-inch Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is currently $379 (and, at the time I wrote this, sold out!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="N4eOu0"&gt;Color accuracy and gamut&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6vzW0r"&gt;Color accuracy is critical to image quality. An inaccurate monitor will look unnatural, flat, and dull, with strange swings in quality depending on what you’re viewing and the precise colors that are inaccurate (it’s common for monitors to be less accurate in blue or cyan than other colors, for example). A monitor with terrible color will disappoint you every time you sit down to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0v7qBg"&gt;The good news? Accuracy is low-key the greatest advancement in monitors over the last decade. Noticeably inaccurate displays were common when I began testing monitors well over a decade ago. Today, most midrange monitors have reasonable accuracy straight out of the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aq61gYhXRcpliCv8GgXSKn5VR7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161335/Datacolor_SpyderX_5_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Datacolor&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;If color is key for work, you probably already know you can buy a calibration tool like &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Datacolor-SpyderX-Pro-Calibration-Photographers/dp/B07M6KPJ9K?tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;this $160 Spyder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6qnFAV"&gt;Still, there is a difference between midrange and premium monitors. Those who want great color accuracy should look for a “factory calibrated” monitor, which typically includes a calibration report in the box. This doesn’t guarantee color accuracy is perfect, but it at least shows the company put the monitor through an extra layer of quality assurance. Also check reviewers to see if the monitor lives up to its claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkYFhz"&gt;Color gamut, which describes the spectrum of colors a monitor can display, is also good enough on most monitors. The majority of content on a computer targets a color gamut called sRGB. Modern monitors display at least 95 percent of this gamut, and many display it all. Other gamuts also exist. DCI-P3 is the most advertised, though you may see Rec.709 or Adobe RGB as well. These gamuts are important if your work requires them, though if that’s the case, I’m guessing you know that. As with color accuracy, buyers concerned about gamut should read reviews to verify a monitor lives up to its claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OZjl76"&gt;Brightness and HDR: 250 nits or bust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kdrkF0"&gt;Odds are your home office has some form of light control, whether it’s shades or simply a room that’s naturally a bit dim. The ideal brightness will vary based on the lighting in your home office, but a monitor’s brightness rarely needs to exceed 200 nits. In fact, most monitor calibration tools (like a SpyderX Elite I use) have a built-in luminance sensor used to recommend a brightness based on ambient light. I’ve never seen it recommend more than 200 nits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJbR8D"&gt;That’s not a big ask, but budget monitors can’t always manage it, so be careful if you’re shopping on a tight budget. Manufacturers also tend to choose a best-case scenario when quoting brightness, so the listed brightness may not always be available. Buy a monitor that promises a maximum brightness of at least 250 nits (aka cd/m2). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRd08W"&gt;Why would you want a brighter monitor? Well, if you’re viewing SDR content, there’s no particular reason (aside from using a monitor in a very, very bright room which, though rare, does happen). Viewing SDR content at a high brightness (say, 300 nits or more) might look nice at a glance, but can cause image quality issues like disappointing dark levels and reduced overall contrast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Wy9en"&gt;High Dynamic Range, aka HDR, is a different story. This standard supports a way higher range of luminosity than SDR. HDR10, the most common standard, technically allows for a peak brightness up to 10,000 nits. Brightness does matter for HDR because the content includes additional luminance data that only HDR-compatible displays can show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-8J1DXnEoyBKjQj7zI4HAhBeZco=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161359/display_hdr.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are looking for an HDR monitor, DisplayHDR certification labels could help, but know that “peak luminance” means “a tiny region on screen can get that bright,” and DisplayHDR 400 is barely HDR at all. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i6nGwE"&gt;However, HDR is a bit of a minefield on the PC and can be counterproductive for work. Turning on HDR in Windows will often block a number of monitor controls you may need, including brightness, color gamut, and color temperature settings. The resulting image can appear eye-searingly bright and you’ll have less leeway to adjust it to your preferences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHzZxH"&gt;Also, most content viewed in Windows or MacOS is not designed for HDR. You can still view it, but the result will be less accurate than if you stuck with SDR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wA1sJ"&gt;Entertainment and gaming is where HDR redeems itself. Most streaming platforms now offer a method for viewing HDR content on a PC and many new 3D games include HDR support. Windows 11 even has an auto-HDR feature that can add HDR to games that don’t officially support it. This makes HDR a nice addition to a monitor that you’ll use for work and play — though I’d recommend leaving HDR off until you clock out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ViS8Xv"&gt;Panel type: IPS rules the office&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LdNhyo"&gt;Nearly all monitors sold today use an LCD panel based on one of three technologies: twisted nematic (TN), in-plane switching (IPS), and vertical alignment (VA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfnpKQ"&gt;The least expensive monitors often use a TN panel. Avoid them. TN panel monitors will display an image, but that’s about it. They look achingly dull next to IPS and have astoundingly bad viewing angles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vfYHTG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10972881"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5P315m"&gt;A majority of monitors use IPS. Monitors based on IPS have very accurate color and can support a wide color gamut at a reasonable price. IPS struggles with dark scenes, however, because it can’t achieve a convincing shade of black. This is the dreaded “IPS glow” you may have heard of, which can look unappealing when watching movies or playing games. However, gamers still enjoy IPS monitors because some IPS panels have low response times and very high refresh rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lgp0Oc"&gt;What about VA? This panel type has the best contrast ratio and dark scene performance of the three, which makes VA a great go-to choice for entertainment and gaming. This is especially true of high-quality, modern VA panels, which have mostly solved the color accuracy and motion smearing issues of some past VA monitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8cy3S"&gt;The choice between IPS and VA has no clear answer, as both have their perks. When it comes to work, though, you may find the choice is made for you. A huge majority of productivity monitors use an IPS panel. VA is an option, but you’ll want to lean your search toward gaming monitors if you crave the high contrast a quality VA panel can provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fTKjWK"&gt;Refresh rate: Higher is better, but there’s a compromise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="a8tZWb"&gt;AMD and Nvidia have successfully convinced gamers that a 360Hz monitor is ideal. But what if your day includes more Excel than &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt;? You might still see some benefits from a refresh rate higher than the traditional 60Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvLvLB"&gt;Gaming is often &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;reason to buy a monitor with an enhanced refresh rate. Higher refresh rates lead to smoother, more fluid motion and reduces input lag. That said, the benefits of refresh rate are not restricted to games. Higher rates make motion feel more fluid on the desktop as well, which is why Apple’s newest MacBook Pro 14 and 16, and many Windows laptops, now offer a refresh rate of 120Hz or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKoTfK"&gt;I feel it’s nice to have, but far down on the list of features you need to consider. Also, you probably shouldn’t pay extra for a 75Hz monitor — it’s not much gain over 60Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGvD6q"&gt;High-refresh gaming displays aren’t especially expensive, with 24-inch, 144Hz models sold for as little as $200. But you’ll typically trade something away for refresh rate: that $200 monitor might use an iffy TN panel (rather than IPS or VA) or feature a low resolution. It’s possible to snag a 4K display for a reasonable sum, or one with a high refresh rate, but going for 4K at 144Hz means looking at monitors that cost as much as big televisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFBvhd"&gt;Also, USB-C with Power Delivery is rarely found in gaming monitors, and I haven’t seen a USB-C gaming monitor that doubles as a USB-C hub. That could be an issue if your work setup involves a lot of wired peripherals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x9XJnN"&gt;Mini LED and OLED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gPsTP7"&gt;Nearly all monitors sold today use an LCD panel with an LED backlight behind it, a tried-and-true setup that has existed for decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMwskl"&gt;Mini LED adds a twist. The fundamentals remain similar, but the backlight is divided into hundreds of zones that can turn on and off independently. This allows extra brightness but also convincing contrast in shadowy scenes. Mini LED is also outstanding for HDR movies and games, where its class-leading brightness provides an edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ko6WMo"&gt;OLED? It flips the table, using an array of organic elements that create their own light. This provides pixel-level lighting control for truly unparalleled contrast you have to see to believe. OLED is also susceptible to burn-in, though there are ways to mitigate it from affecting a display prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TVNZUbmRtKaTOijhZ2dVAn4zaUU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23040339/shollister_211124_4893_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We tried a 48-inch OLED TV as a monitor this past year &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;with mixed results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ho3Efk"&gt;Neither of these are necessary for working from home, and you’ll likely have to spend thousands to snag a monitor with either tech. Alternatively, you could buy a television with Mini LED or OLED technology, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv"&gt;but televisions still have their downsides as monitors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZspQlB"&gt;If you demand the very best from a monitor, however, I recommend Mini LED. OLED’s burn-in worries are legitimate on the PC which, compared to a television, will display static images more frequently. Mini LED can’t match OLED’s contrast, but it’s still a major upgrade over a backlit LCD screen. There’s also the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865220/sony-a95k-qd-oled-qdoled-4k-tv-announced-features-explainer"&gt;emerging&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855531/alienware-curved-34-inch-qd-oled-samsung-gaming-monitor-specs"&gt;category&lt;/a&gt; of quantum dot OLED (QD-OLED) screens, but manufacturers haven’t announced prices for those yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WGugUM"&gt;What about monitors with built-in webcams?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0qMFfY"&gt;Do not buy a monitor with a built-in webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1YHiM"&gt;Webcams are small, easy to move, and can be used with multiple devices. Attaching a webcam to a monitor removes these perks. It also means you can’t upgrade your webcam in the future; you’ll have to replace the entire monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BH1Uyy"&gt;Our webcam guide has several recommendations. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652783/best-webcam-camera"&gt;Most are less than $100&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon reverses decision to ban Visa credit cards in the UK over fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="VISA" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0E7Swrfg_tE0QVJf3fYtnldIb60=/38x0:4963x3283/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70399286/1237281038.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5vY4gi"&gt;Amazon says it will continue to accept payment in the UK from Visa credit cards, reversing a decision to ban the cards that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22786966/amazon-visa-credit-card-ban-alternatives-fees"&gt;announced last November&lt;/a&gt; and due to kick in this week on Wednesday, January 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjWQn1"&gt;In an email to customers, Amazon said it was “working closely on a potential solution that will enable customers to continue using their Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk.” The company did not say what the solution was or how long it might be in place, but added that “should we make any changes related to Visa credit cards, we will give you advance notice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5P5yYf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Visa raised interchange fees five-fold after the UK left the EU&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pl1lPT"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22786966/amazon-visa-credit-card-ban-alternatives-fees"&gt;original decision&lt;/a&gt; to ban Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk arose from a dispute over payment fees levied by card issuers. The European Union sets limits on these particular fees, but when the UK left the EU it gave issuers free rein to increase them. Visa &lt;a href="https://thepaypers.com/online-payments/visa-raises-interchange-fees-for-uk-based-cardholders--1247923"&gt;raised its interchange fees&lt;/a&gt; from 0.3 percent to 1.5 percent, which evidently annoyed Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmEBRL"&gt;Although it’s not clear what deal has been brokered between Amazon and Visa and who it favors, it was Visa’s &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/visa-stock-tumbles-amazon-plans-stop-accepting-its-u-k-issued-credit-cards/"&gt;stock that dropped&lt;/a&gt; after the ban was initially announced. As &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/amazon-drops-date-to-stop-accepting-visa-credit-cards-for-uk-payments-12518264"&gt;per &lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Visa said in a statement: “Amazon customers can continue to use Visa cards on Amazon.co.uk after 19 January while we work closely together to reach an agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft lets you follow YouTube creators in Edge browser test</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fn78VxzmVwXFqnwZtUPpDWLxsF4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70399206/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DAfS61"&gt;Microsoft has started testing some deeper YouTube integration in its Edge browser. The latest Canary developer builds of Edge include a new “followable web” feature that lets you easily follow your favorite content creators on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EiL86G"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftEdge/comments/rz71jh/edge_canary_now_lets_you_follow_some_of_your/"&gt;Reddit user Leopeva64 spotted&lt;/a&gt; a new YouTube follow button that appears in the address bar of YouTube pages. Following creators will add them to a feed that’s part of the Collections feature in Edge. The feature is clearly in the early preview stages, and it doesn’t support all YouTube content creators just yet. The feed that’s created in Collections lets you see recent posts from creators that you follow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PoVZ9FMhXwl0bYfS5SmQUDUnK_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23174192/edgefollowing.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftEdge/comments/rz71jh/edge_canary_now_lets_you_follow_some_of_your/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; (Leopeva64)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new web following feature in Edge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NrwDMG"&gt;This deeper integration with YouTube will likely extend to other parts of the web, too. Microsoft’s Edge followable web feature looks similar to Google’s &lt;a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/05/an-experiment-in-helping-users-and-web.html?m=1"&gt;experimental feature in Chrome&lt;/a&gt; that lets people follow blogs and creators to get the latest content when it’s published. This is essentially an extension of RSS inside Chrome, and it includes a follow button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olz5SS"&gt;Microsoft is only trialing this new Edge feature with a limited number of Edge Canary testers, as part of what the company calls “controlled rollouts.” The software giant hasn’t officially detailed its plans for the followable web feature in Edge, but we’re expecting to hear more about this modern RSS feed in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple digital keys reportedly coming to some Hyundai cars this summer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Launch Of Hyundai Motor Company’s All-New Genesis In Seoul" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SfdEivnIMZV3kc1Edqsn1Bhzhyg=/95x0:2906x1874/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70399186/452075859.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyundai’s Genesis cars could soon get access to the feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WTe4XF"&gt;Hyundai and its Genesis brand are reportedly close to adding support for Apple’s digital car key feature, which lets you unlock and start compatible vehicles using the iPhone’s Wallet app, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-01-16/what-will-apple-aapl-call-its-new-ar-vr-headset-apple-vision-apple-reality-kyhmibia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;. According to Gurman, the so-called “CarKey” feature is set to come to Hyundai’s Genesis lineup this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bOF2SK"&gt;Hyundai already offers proprietary iOS apps, including &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/myhyundai-with-bluelink/id893514610"&gt;MyHyundai with Bluelink&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genesis-intelligent-assistant/id867941329"&gt;Genesis Intelligent Assistant&lt;/a&gt;, which include the ability to remotely start, or unlock the doors of compatible vehicles. But adding support for Apple’s implementation of the digital key feature should make the functionality more seamless, and benefit from system-level Apple Wallet shortcuts. &lt;a href="https://owners.hyundaiusa.com/us/en/resources/technology-and-navigation/frequently-asked-questions-about-hyundai-digital-key.html"&gt;Hyundai’s site&lt;/a&gt; notes that its NFC-based digital key feature is currently only available on Android phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JdaKwA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;References to Hyundai have previously been discovered in iOS code&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MnE6MA"&gt;Apple first announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299182/apple-carkey-ios-14-13-digital-key-unlock-car-iphone-wwdc-2020"&gt;digital car key feature in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but so far it’s only available on select BMW models. Reports that it would be coming to Hyundai’s cars date back to at least January 2021 when &lt;a href="http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=58446"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Korea&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on the plans, and reference’s to Hyundai’s Genesis cars &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/genesis-digital-car-keys-code/"&gt;have also been discovered in iOS 15 code&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbuKMs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report doesn’t specify whether Hyundai plans to make use of recent iPhones’ ultra wideband (UWB) technology, which could allow owners to unlock their car without having to take their phone out of their pocket, or whether it will just use NFC. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230569/bmw-digital-key-plus-iphone-unlock-u1-chip-ultra-wideband"&gt;BMW previously announced&lt;/a&gt; the feature for its all-electric iX, relying on the U1 chip found in the iPhone 11 and later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dGDqG"&gt;Apple and Hyundai were previously rumored to be in discussions to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261893/apple-electric-car-hyundai-ming-chi-kuo-rumor-report"&gt;produce an electric car together&lt;/a&gt;. Hyundai later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/7/22271748/hyundai-apple-car-talks-stopped-report"&gt;downplayed these rumors&lt;/a&gt;, and said it was no longer in talks with the iPhone manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo’s next flagship leaks with OnePlus-esque Hasselblad branding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7_ICSM7Op5l5KT4vHKed6DGZn9o=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70399142/1eaf989963bd7d4e0ee82817325daf47.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uI1jRl"&gt;Details on Oppo’s upcoming flagship phone are starting to come together. Multiple leaks are suggesting it’ll be called the Find X5 Pro, with a similar design to last year’s Find X3 Pro and specs broadly in line with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22865569/oneplus-10-pro-camera-specs"&gt;the new OnePlus 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which is already available in China. (OnePlus, of course, is now treated as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543184/oppo-oneplus-merger-brand-pete-lau-bbk-memo"&gt;sub-brand of Oppo&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjJTG2"&gt;The Find X3 Pro wasn’t sold in the US, but it did make its way to Europe and was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22411538/oppo-find-x3-pro-review"&gt;one of the best phones of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Renders recently &lt;a href="https://prepp.in/news/e-509-oppo-find-x5-2022-launch-exclusive-5k-renders-expected-dates-specifications-and-more"&gt;released by OnLeaks&lt;/a&gt; show a device with a camera bump that flows into the rest of the back panel in a similar fashion to the Find X3 Pro, although the camera configuration has changed and doesn’t appear to include the previous phone’s unique ring light-equipped “microscope” camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="33Hpar"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPO?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OPPO&lt;/a&gt; Find X5 Pro&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Snapdragon 8 Gen1&lt;br&gt;- 2K 120HZ refresh rate LTPO 2.0 display&lt;br&gt;- 50MP IMX766 OIS + 50MP IMX766 + 13MP S5K3M5&lt;br&gt;- 5000mAh battery&lt;br&gt;80 watt wired charging&lt;br&gt;50 watt wireless charging&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actual Source:&lt;a href="https://t.co/IGsScfYEsN"&gt;https://t.co/IGsScfYEsN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/TTCaVuVbWZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TTCaVuVbWZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Abhishek Yadav (@yabhishekhd) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yabhishekhd/status/1482910986768031744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 17, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SyCJBJ"&gt;Alleged real-world photos that corroborate the &lt;em&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/em&gt; renders have also now appeared online, showing a white model of the phone with Hasselblad branding, just like OnePlus’ latest flagships. There’s also a shot of the device’s settings menu that says it has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, like the OnePlus 10 Pro, as well as Oppo’s own new chip, the MariSilicon X. This is an NPU used for image processing; it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22833796/oppo-air-glass-ar-glasses-announced-china-release-date"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; late last year alongside Oppo’s Air Glass AR device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJnymw"&gt;There are other specs that have been floating around Chinese social media channels that can’t be verified but don’t sound very surprising, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855743/oneplus-10-pro-android-specs"&gt;as with the OnePlus 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Oppo’s previous two Find X flagships were announced in March, so we should get official details fairly soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart is getting serious about the metaverse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6H65h2a75hlvo0cLGBbiKy2EOLI=/0x0:4603x3069/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70397592/1183648613.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Walmart’s recent trademark applications suggest that it wants to break into the metaverse. | Photo by Yichuan Cao / NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ilWdNY"&gt;Walmart appears to be getting ready for a leap into the metaverse. Recent trademark applications indicate the company is looking to establish its own NFTs and cryptocurrency, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/16/walmart-is-quietly-preparing-to-enter-the-metaverse.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBOyr3"&gt;The retail giant filed for several trademarks on December 30th, suggesting plans to start selling virtual goods, including electronics, toys, appliances, sporting equipment, apparel, home decor, and more, as noted by &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;. There’s mention of offering customers a digital currency, as well as the opportunity to buy and sell NFTs. Meanwhile, another application details possible “physical fitness training services” and “classes in the field of health and nutrition” that could take place in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality environments (VR) — the company made a separate filing for the use of its name and logo in VR and AR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Sd1bGV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Walmart also filed trademarks for “Verse to Home,” “Verse to Curb,” and “Verse to Store”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TaaFs4"&gt;As pointed out by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-16/walmart-plans-to-create-cryptocurrency-and-nfts-cnbc-reports"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Walmart also filed trademarks for the names “Verse to Home,” “Verse to Curb,” and “Verse to Store,” a hint that Walmart may be preparing a virtual shopping experience (that hopefully doesn’t look like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2022/1/5/22868323/walmart-metaverse-shopping-video-viral-old"&gt;the one created for the company in 2017&lt;/a&gt;). The filings are publicly available on the US Patent and Trademark Office’s site, some of which are listed under the name “Walmart Connect,” the retailer’s digital advertising endeavor. You can access the filings by searching for “Walmart” or “Walmart Connect” on the &lt;a href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/search"&gt;Trademark Electronic Search System&lt;/a&gt; (TESS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jI9uGl"&gt;“Walmart is continuously exploring how emerging technologies may shape future shopping experiences,” Walmart spokesperson Carrie McKnight told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We don’t have anything further to share today, but it’s worth noting we routinely file trademark applications as part of the innovation process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPpCbc"&gt;Last August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627111/walmart-cryptocurrency-payments-hire-amazon"&gt;Walmart posted a job listing for a cryptocurrency product specialist&lt;/a&gt;, one of the first signs of Walmart’s growing interest in the metaverse. Other retailers are taking part in the metaverse movement as well, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22833369/nike-rtfkt-nft-sneaker-shoe-metaverse-company"&gt;Nike looking to cash in on NFTs and virtual sneakers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22843104/adidas-nfts-metaverse-sold-bored-ape"&gt;Adidas selling out of its &lt;em&gt;Into the Metaverse&lt;/em&gt; NFT collection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/articles/2022-1/01/gap-launches-gamified-collectible-nft-experience-t"&gt;Gap offering NFTs of its hoodies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Safari 15 bug can leak your recent browsing activity and personal identifiers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q-QZjSU3L78a6LZ3zw-_6BJ96aI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70397170/acastro_200207_3900_Safari_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XYwPrx"&gt;A bug in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686070/apple-macos-safari-tab-groups-redesign-change-back"&gt;Safari 15&lt;/a&gt; can leak your browsing activity, and can also reveal some of the personal information attached to your Google account, according to &lt;a href="https://fingerprintjs.com/blog/indexeddb-api-browser-vulnerability-safari-15/"&gt;findings from FingerprintJS&lt;/a&gt;, a browser fingerprinting and fraud detection service (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/16/safari-bug-leak-browsing-history-info/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The vulnerability stems from an issue with Apple’s implementation of &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API"&gt;IndexedDB&lt;/a&gt;, an application programming interface (API) that stores data on your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQC8Ia"&gt;As explained by FingerprintJS, IndexedDB abides by the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy"&gt;same-origin policy&lt;/a&gt;, which restricts one origin from interacting with data that was collected on other origins — essentially, only the website that generates data can access it. For example, if you open your email account in one tab and then open a malicious webpage in another, the same-origin policy prevents the malicious page from viewing and meddling with your email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ixhif6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s not much you can do to get around the issue&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IhMBJI"&gt;FingerprintJS found that Apple’s application of the IndexedDB API in Safari 15 actually violates the same-origin policy. When a website interacts with a database in Safari, FingerprintJS says that “a new (empty) database with the same name is created in all other active frames, tabs, and windows within the same browser session.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHR6w5"&gt;This means other websites can see the name of other databases created on other sites, which could contain details specific to your identity. FingerprintJS notes sites that use your Google account, like YouTube, Google Calendar, and Google Keep, all generate databases with your unique Google User ID in its name. Your Google User ID allows Google to access your publicly-available information, such as your profile picture, which the Safari bug can expose to other websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1FgUpg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a huge bug. On OSX, Safari users can (temporarily) switch to another browser to avoid their data leaking across origins. iOS users have no such choice, because Apple imposes a ban on other browser engines. &lt;a href="https://t.co/aXdhDVIjTT"&gt;https://t.co/aXdhDVIjTT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jake Archibald (@jaffathecake) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1482627132903858176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 16, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9bYMxQ"&gt;FingerprintJS created &lt;a href="https://safarileaks.com/"&gt;a proof-of-concept demo&lt;/a&gt; you can try out if you have Safari 15 and above on your Mac, iPhone, or iPad. The demo uses the browser’s IndexedDB vulnerability to identify the sites you have open (or opened recently), and shows how sites that exploit the bug can scrape information from your Google User ID. It currently only detects 30 popular sites that are affected by the bug, such as include Instagram, Netflix, Twitter, Xbox, but it likely affects far more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="St7eCX"&gt;Unfortunately, there’s not much you can do to get around the issue, as FingerprintJS says the bug also affects Private Browsing mode on Safari. You can use a different browser on macOS, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22421912/iphone-web-app-pwa-cloud-gaming-epic-v-apple-safari"&gt;Apple’s third-party browser engine ban on iOS&lt;/a&gt; means all browsers are affected. FingerprintJS reported the leak to the WebKit Bug Tracker on November 28th, but there hasn’t been an update to Safari yet. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s next tablet lineup could include a 14.6-inch ‘Ultra’ model with a notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qJwOIsI9IXEFPr5hF0yw-01sgv0=/53x0:2048x1330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70396772/samsung_galaxy_s8_ultra_tab.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra may have a 14.6-inch display with a notch. | Image by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,127516.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sAqDQj"&gt;Samsung might be adding its first-ever “Ultra” model to its upcoming Galaxy Tab S8 lineup, which will also include a Tab S8 and S8 Plus, as rumored by &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,127516.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bH7WWr"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;, the flagship Ultra model could sport a 14.6-inch Super AMOLED display with a 2960 x 1848px resolution, a refresh rate of up to 120Hz, as well as a notch with two 12-megapixel (MP) cameras. It may also come with the option of up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, along with a 11200mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/30F2KvIVz7ydyYWgg42-oKNdhPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23172714/galaxy_tab_s8_plus.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,127516.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Galaxy Tab S8 Plus is rumored to have a 12.7-inch display with no notch.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yUmooi"&gt;When compared to the Tab S8 Ultra, the Super AMOLED display on the Tab S8 Plus is a bit smaller, potentially measuring at 12.7 inches with a resolution of 2800 x 1752px. &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; says the midgrade model may not have a notch and could come with a 10090mAh battery. The base Tab S8 model will obviously be the smallest of the bunch and is rumored to have an 11-inch LTPS TFT display with a resolution of 2560 x 1600px, a notch-less design, and an 8000mAh battery. Both the Tab S8 and S8 Plus have smaller memory and storage options, offering up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpzpVj"&gt;As for what’s powering the devices, &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; notes that each tablet in Samsung’s new lineup may come with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22809687/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-chip-smartphone-processor-specs-details"&gt;Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip&lt;/a&gt; and the Adreno 730 GPU. All models will also have a 13MP dual camera and 6MP ultra wide-angle lens on the back, a 12MP camera in the front (except for the Ultra, which has two), S-Pen compatibility, under-display fingerprint scanners, optional 5G connectivity, as well as quad speakers that support Dolby Atmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJPzVP"&gt;There’s no confirmed pricing information for any S8 Tabs just yet, but a leak from &lt;a href="https://appuals.com/samsung-tab-s8-prices-leaked/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Appuals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; might provide a hint at what to expect. &lt;em&gt;Appuals&lt;/em&gt; claims pricing for the Wi-Fi-only Tab S8 Ultra begins at 1,040€ to 1,060€ (~$1,187 to $1,210), with additional storage and 5G connectivity adding to that price. The Wi-Fi-only Tab S8 Plus could start at 880€ to 900€ (~$1,004 to $1,027), with the base Tab S8 potentially starting at 680€ to 700€ (~$776 to $799).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GiRAC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; predicts that Samsung will either introduce its Galaxy Tab S8 lineup at its February 8th Samsung Unpacked event (potentially alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S22&lt;/a&gt;), or at the Mobile World Conference (MWC), which begins on February 28th. Samsung last released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;Galaxy Tab S7 lineup&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, which only consists of two tablets: the Tab S7 and Tab S7 Plus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Tyw6yh"&gt;This leaves plenty of room for &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-pulls-wordle-knockoffs-app-store-2022-01-12/"&gt;fake &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; apps to crowd app stores&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to leech off of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22881995/wordle-emoji-results-auto-generated-tell-a-story"&gt;the word puzzle game’s sudden rise in popularity&lt;/a&gt;. But there’s one app coincidentally called &lt;em&gt;Wordle!&lt;/em&gt; that’s not a clone — it actually existed before the browser game itself. That’s why its developer is teaming up with the mind behind the browser-based &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt;, Josh Wardle, to use its accidental success as an opportunity to give back, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dev-with-unrelated-five-year-old-wordle-app-is-donating-proceeds-to-charity/1100-6499675/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7L33cC"&gt;The story unraveled in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StevenCravotta/status/1482056565867696128"&gt;a thread on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;em&gt;Wordle!&lt;/em&gt; app developer, Steven Cravotta, detailing how his coding project blew up five years after its creation, unknowingly riding on &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt;’s coattails. He developed an iOS app called &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordle/id1095569891"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wordle!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 to brush up on his coding skills, and while it got around 100,000 downloads, it wasn’t as successful as a previous game he built, called &lt;em&gt;Grid&lt;/em&gt;, so Cravotta decided to stop updating and promoting the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w4L6YM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Can confirm this is true. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StevenCravotta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@StevenCravotta&lt;/a&gt; reached out to me unprompted and asked about donating the proceeds. He's a class act and you should follow him. &lt;a href="https://t.co/7Xeixe6VHh"&gt;https://t.co/7Xeixe6VHh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Josh Wardle (@powerlanguish) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/powerlanguish/status/1482007797437014020?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5B5V4"&gt;Cravotta says that downloads for &lt;em&gt;Wordle!&lt;/em&gt; slowed to around one to two per day, but when the browser-based &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; started taking off, so did his app. The app racked up 200,000 downloads in a single week, albeit from confused users who mistook it for the browser-based &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt;. Cravotta reached out to &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; app developer, Josh Wardle, and let him know about his plans to donate the proceeds from his app to charity — Wardle sent out a tweet of his own to acknowledge the gesture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThoNvQ"&gt;Cravotta later confirmed that he and Wardle decided to donate any money earned by &lt;em&gt;Wordle!&lt;/em&gt; to BoostOakland, a charity geared towards tutoring and mentoring young people in Oakland, California. When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Cravotta, he told us that he has collected a little more than $2,000 so far and that he’ll donate the total amount earned at the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The trials and tribulations of turning a real camera into a webcam</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not a Sony A7 III, but it will do.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Samar Haddad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A mirrorless camera should just work; it did not&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4wV0En"&gt;My colleague Dieter Bohn is one of the nicest people I’ve met, but every time I’d hop onto Zoom to record &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; there would be just the tiniest, most minute twitch of displeasure on his face. Dieter was too kind to address the big, camera-obscuring elephant in the room: how for several minutes, instead of my face, he’d see a giant reversed Sony Imaging Edge webcam logo — a huge white W on an orange square set against a not-quite-black background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXvElb"&gt;Finally, after at least four months of the big W, he politely asked, “Alex, what’s your address?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="doJ5r6"&gt;“Why?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lqc6Ga"&gt;“So I can send you an HDMI adapter.” He said it with that unique Midwestern clip that says, “I am being very polite and gracious, but you should know I may also commit a murder in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cS3rNE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I’d already collected more “HDMI to X” cables than I think Monoprice even knows exists&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d9vbVJ"&gt;Dieter, and indeed all my colleagues at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, had been forced to stare at that ugly W because I wanted to convert my very expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/30/17176246/sony-a7-a7r-iii-alpha-3-mirrorless-camera-review-specs-price"&gt;Sony A7 III&lt;/a&gt; mirrorless camera into a webcam. I was feeling frugal, and I’d already collected more capture cards and “HDMI to X” cables than I think Monoprice even knows exists; I was sure I could figure out a way to give my Zoom experience a gorgeous boost with minimal cost. Who doesn’t want to control the ISO and aperture and have all their colleagues ask why you’re in high definition when they’re firmly in standard? While some of my colleagues might rather tinker with phone settings or CPU voltages, I could happily spend weeks — months — perfecting my Zoom look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="95xpJ1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"I refuse to care about the quality of my webcam","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22858876/built-in-laptop-webcam-zoom-video-conferencing"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GCrjv0"&gt;It’s supposed to be easy. You buy a mount for your camera. (Deputy editor Dan Seifert recommended this &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1015864-REG%2Fimpact_3_section_double_articulated.html%3Fcnxclid%3D16418337913438427578510070301008005&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22841507%2Fmirrorless-webcam-sony-a7-iii-imaging-edge-overheating" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$60 arm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F824360-REG%2Fimpact_cc_106r_super_clamp_with_ratchet.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22841507%2Fmirrorless-webcam-sony-a7-iii-imaging-edge-overheating" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$20 clamp&lt;/a&gt;, which worked great.) You download some software to your computer. You plug your big expensive digital camera into your computer and you have &lt;em&gt;magic&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0WsOO"&gt;Sony’s A7 III had other plans for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PQPV5"&gt;In the early days of the pandemic, webcam shortages led to many people requesting software that would let them use their expensive cameras as webcams. Camera makers happily obliged. Sony was one of the last, but that additional time feels ... poorly spent. The Mac version, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517673/sony-imaging-edge-webcam-digital-camera-webcam-software-mac"&gt;which launched in October 2020&lt;/a&gt;, is more driver than app. Sony’s software does little more than tell my computer that my camera is a camera, and throws up the W whenever the video feed isn’t ready. There’s no controlling of settings or any of the other things that, say, Sony’s tethering app can do (like ISO and aperture). There’s simply installation and prayers. You install it, restart your computer, and pray Sony Imaging appears in the camera choices for apps you use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="uZqJ0a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s simply installation and prayers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YEWqne"&gt;Importantly, you then have to open an app that uses your camera, and then turn on the camera, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; wait for Sony Imaging Edge Webcam to start running before your video will actually, finally appear on the screen. If you turn on the camera &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you open, say, Zoom, you may be faced with an error message saying the camera is already in use. Only restarting the physical Sony camera itself will resolve it — and while you’re busy fixing things, other people on the Zoom call (probably Dieter) are stuck looking at that big ugly W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKvzzw"&gt;Mastering the order of operations is key. So is remembering to reboot it periodically during the day. When I walked away after a call and came back to do another one, I found myself staring at the W because the camera decided to power itself off again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e9CAsq"&gt;Eventually, I did &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexhcranz/status/1462803898675175425?s=20"&gt;buy that adapter Dieter had been begging me to buy for months&lt;/a&gt;, and it instantly resolved my great orange W issue. But it revealed that while I’d laid a lot of blame at Sony Imaging Edge Webcam’s feet, the software didn’t deserve all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZFG43ReMCsGvS8jQzSYhHu4tAlA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160196/gygvusba7iii__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not pictured: a viable webcam power source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vpR8D3"&gt;Those automatic shutdowns? With that big orange W glaring at me I’d naturally assumed they were a software problem. But my coworkers (and I) soon learned it was a &lt;em&gt;heating &lt;/em&gt;problem. The &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fgygvusba7iii.html&amp;amp;subid1=Verge011322"&gt;USB-powered dummy battery ($45.95)&lt;/a&gt; I used was overheating my entire camera, forcing it to shut down again and again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fue1K8"&gt;I’m now on a quest for an adapter that will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; overheat my entire camera. But so far, I’ve already spent $80 on a stand, $46 on a battery pack, and $25 on an HDMI adapter. That’s $151 I’d sunk into trying to cheaply turn my DSLR into a high-powered webcam. For the same price, I could have picked up a webcam from Newegg or Micro Center and avoided the shame of the W. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="La4bye"&gt;And after spending all that money trying to have the very best fidelity webcam, that’s when Opal launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22834196/opal-c1-webcam-camera-dslr-video-quality-performance-review-price"&gt;the $300 Opal C1&lt;/a&gt;. My co-workers love it, probably because it does everything I’d spent $151 on, but in a tiny package that doesn’t also require investing in a costly camera. I try to be a savvy enough tech shopper that I rarely regret purchases, but reading &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22834196/opal-c1-webcam-camera-dslr-video-quality-performance-review-price"&gt;Cameron Faulkner’s review of the C1&lt;/a&gt; while my expensive and not very reliable webcam literally loomed over my head gave me some powerful regret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HuJ1yD5Y1CPqGlp6jjxIFBWdTYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067802/cfaulkner_141231_4911_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Opal C1, quietly mocking me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EmLZFg"&gt;Soon after, I edited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22858876/built-in-laptop-webcam-zoom-video-conferencing"&gt;Allison Johnson’s piece about refusing to care about her webcam&lt;/a&gt; because she has no interest in tinkering with that part of her work setup. I wildly disagree with her (that’s okay! She also likes Android phones!) — a big reason I spent so much time trying to perfect this setup was because it was something I wanted to tinker with. I wanted to be finicky and tweak things and produce the best image I could even if it was only visible to Nilay, Dieter, and Andru during a &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; recording on Zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHNYnj"&gt;I probably won’t get the Opal C1 or even just a budget webcam at Micro Center. I probably &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;continue to refresh &lt;a href="https://support.d-imaging.sony.co.jp/app/webcam/en/"&gt;the Sony Imaging Edge Webcam page&lt;/a&gt; hoping for a better update, while buying and returning scores of USB dummy battery adapters as I hunt for one that doesn’t exacerbate the Sony A7 III’s well-known heating problem. I’ll continue to tinker even as Dieter’s eye twitches and I inevitably get roasted on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1FrLu"&gt;Trying to turn a real camera into a webcam will not be worth the money or time I’ve spent thus far and will probably continue to spend. But one day I will have that perfect video quality and a keen satisfaction with all the effort I’ve put into this relatively needless task. No one will acknowledge my webcam and I’ll feel immense pride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pgnRwx"&gt;And then I’ll probably start working on my Zoom background.&lt;/p&gt;
