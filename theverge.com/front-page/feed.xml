    <title>It may be curtains for Arclight and Pacific, the theaters I’ve only dreamt of attending</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Daily Life In Los Angeles Amid Coronavirus Outbreak" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i1Gc25N1dYbXtDeEc8kqWokGuSg=/181x0:4665x2989/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69116853/1219631225.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="shBPHs"&gt;The owner of famous movie theater chains Arclight Cinemas and Pacific Theaters has revealed that the theaters will never reopen from their COVID shutdowns, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/arclight-cinemas-pacific-theatres-covid-1234949832/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Decurian, the company that operates both chains, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/arclight-cinemas-and-pacific-theatres-wont-be-reopening-1234732936/"&gt;gave a dire statement to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: it includes phrases like “exhausted all potential options” and “does not have a viable way forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3Sa4j"&gt;I don’t live in California, and I’ve never seen a movie at either an Arclight or Pacific, but their shuttering hurts me deeply: I’ve always hoped to see a movie at an Arclight and experience Pacific’s Cinerama Dome, and it seems like I may never have the opportunity. (Those aren’t my only movie dreams in distress: the dinner and a show chain I’ve hoped to visit, Alamo Drafthouse, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/alamo-drafthouse-bankruptcy-chapter-11-sale-1234920558/"&gt;has recently filed for bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s854rK"&gt;I’m aware that most people probably don’t dream of traveling to other states just to see a movie, but these chains have long been considered the gold-standard in the online filmmaking community. I’ve long heard about Arclight Cinemas’ top-tier picture and sound, and many of them were located in the heart of Hollywood. Tinseltown is feeling the loss too, with many actors and filmmakers tweeting in despair (or in the hopes that someone else will buy the theaters and restore them to operation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aa7It6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Difficult to process this news.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wKNxYC"&gt;There’s also the matter of the Cinerama Dome. The famous Hollywood theater is named after a famous 70mm film format (one of the many that came about as theaters tried to lure in viewers with ever-increasing spectacle). As &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i12oWm3v6Ho"&gt;any film nerd will tell you&lt;/a&gt;, 70mm is pretty much the ultimate in movie-exhibition, whether you’re watching &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Hateful Eight&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;It’s A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6WbNPN"&gt;The latter is a movie my dad introduced me to, and I would’ve loved to see it in its original format — getting my eyes on original film prints has kind of been an obsession ever since I got to watch Disney’s &lt;em&gt;The Aristocats &lt;/em&gt;back in college, but now &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinerama#Legacy"&gt;the list of US theaters&lt;/a&gt; that can even play Cinerama movies is vanishingly small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4ZREc"&gt;What will happen to these theaters remains unknown. The buildings won’t instantly crumble just because the company that owns them is shutting down, but without someone to take care of them they may not last. This would be an additional tragedy in the case of the Cinerama Dome — Silicon Valley &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/21/5628202/sunset-on-the-domes"&gt;got rid of the rest of its dome-shaped theaters&lt;/a&gt;, and partly justified it with the fact that Cinerama would still be around to keep the tradition alive. While the Cinerama Dome and Silicon Valley’s Century 21 dome are both historical landmarks, that doesn’t always mean preserving its purpose: &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/07/30/federal-realty-investment-trust-santana-row-office.html"&gt;last we checked&lt;/a&gt;, the Silicon Valley dome was slated to become an “innovation hub” inside a new tech office campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICbkki"&gt;Speaking of tragedies, it’s worth keeping things in perspective: while I may not get to experience these theaters, there are many Pacific and Arclight employees who have just lost their jobs, according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;. If I had one wish (that was, hypothetically, strictly limited to this specific situation), it’d be that those people could find good jobs at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22326343/los-angeles-la-movie-theaters-reopen-movie-capitol"&gt;other theater chains&lt;/a&gt; that are opening back up. But if I had two, I’d love to make sure that these theaters somehow survive, so I could someday visit them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s follow up to the Z Fold 2 could be smaller, but maybe not in the dimension you want</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l5HaK0iuv9C7whGTmTMSI2pFSaY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69116445/vpavic_200907_4181_0010_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u8ZMiY"&gt;Samsung’s next Galaxy Z Fold folding phone might have a slightly smaller screen than its previous models, feature a smaller battery, and quite possibly launch in July alongside a new Galaxy Z Flip, &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=11865"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elec &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-3-will-reportedly-be-smaller-than-the-galaxy-z-fold-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CmxEB"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 will reportedly have a 7.5-inch main tablet screen and a 6.2-inch screen on the front cover of the phone, &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; writes, which would be virtually the same as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;the Fold 2’s&lt;/a&gt; 7.6-inch main display and 6.2-inch cover display. &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; says these screen sizes come with the added benefit of “zero bezels,” so even though the screens may be the same size, the third Fold could feel slightly smaller because the actual body of the phone might shrink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBiiEB"&gt;In comparison to the Fold 2’s 4,500mAh battery, the Fold 3 will reportedly make do with a slightly smaller 4,380mAh battery. Again, not a dramatic change in size and it might not even noticeably impact battery life, but it’s interesting to note if it effects other changes to the Fold’s design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uujIi-TwtsLqEJjklQdTF3pllPs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439698/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_4.30.23_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even with a slight taper, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 is still almost as thick as two phones back to back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hwzwyn"&gt;There’s other rumored changes to the Fold line, including the possibility of S Pen support, just like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra got earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. For the Fold, a stylus could also pose additional challenges if Samsung tries to integrate stylus storage directly in the phone rather than using an add-on case like the Ultra. A hole for a stylus could take up space that could be filled with extra battery capacity or removed entirely for an overall thinner phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MF37JS"&gt;And — though &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t mention it at all, so don’t expect a change — thinness is the dimension that might actually matter when it comes to a new Galaxy Fold. Including the extra gap created by its hinge, the Fold 2 is about two S21 Ultra thick when folded. If Samsung isn’t thinning out the rumored Fold 3 to make it easier to hold and fit in a pocket, I hope they’ll consider that the next time around: it could also help Samsung compete with newcomers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;Huawei’s Mate X2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;Xiaomi’s Mi Mix Fold&lt;/a&gt; which both use similar folding designs and are already thinner than the Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6H3DQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PC market isn’t slowing down after an amazing 2020, despite chip shortages  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wz2tdsJ1oqgQY-io0AdhW15c594=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69116431/akrales_190930_3689_0120.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bc9WpY"&gt;The PC market had a great first quarter, despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22363232/global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-pandemic-consoles-cpus-graphics-cards-cars"&gt;the global shortage of semiconductor chips&lt;/a&gt;. Research firm &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-12-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-grew-32-percent-in-first-quarter-of-2021"&gt;Gartner estimates&lt;/a&gt; that shipments of “traditional PCs,” meaning laptops and desktops, are up by 32 percent compared to Q1 2020 (&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/12/pc-market-had-best-q1-since-2015-fastest-growth-in-20-years-gartner.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS47601721"&gt;IDC puts the number even higher&lt;/a&gt;, estimating 55 percent growth year-over-year. This seems to be the continuation of a trend — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;the PC market had a great 2020 as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpJGl8"&gt;Both firms agree that the growth is atypical — Gartner says that the growth is the fastest it’s seen since it started tracking the market in 2000, and IDC says that the drop in shipments from Q4 to Q1 is the smallest it’s seen since 2012. The raw numbers are also impressive — Gartner estimates that just under 70 million PCs were shipped, while IDC estimates around 84 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sxVCmi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The return to normalcy on the horizon may affect people’s buying habits in the future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P253JZ"&gt;Of course, these numbers don’t exist in a vacuum — you may have already realized that the time period being compared against, Q1 2020, was rough for... well, everything, which includes the manufacturing and shipping of PCs. But while the growth comparison is definitely tilted in favor of Q1 2021, both firms estimate that the numbers could’ve been even higher, had it not been for the chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gfFfq"&gt;The silicon shortage has affected almost everything, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;trucks and cars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;consoles&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;gaming PC component&lt;/a&gt; market. There are even reports that Apple has had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373281/chip-shortage-apple-macbook-ipad-delay-nikkei"&gt;delay production of MacBooks and iPads&lt;/a&gt;. IDC points out that the shortage has contributed to higher average prices in the PC market, and that the shortages are likely to make PCs more difficult to get for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id1pNg"&gt;It’s also worth noting that the pandemic is also likely affecting demand, and the return to normalcy on the horizon may affect people’s buying habits in future quarters. Whether demand will stick around or not isn’t certain, but both IDC and Gartner seem to think it will. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three reasons why Epic Games can give away $17.5 billion worth of games for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LvfU3GQnahA-iOIcb3mplYLk_yU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69116402/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CkT5Sc"&gt;The Epic Games Store gives away free games every week — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258043/epic-games-store-down-gta-5-grand-theft-auto-free-pc"&gt;often good ones&lt;/a&gt; — and yet the company has never explained how it’s managed to dole out 749 million copies without going bankrupt. Until now. New documents published as part of the legal discovery process for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;Epic’s major antitrust lawsuit against Apple&lt;/a&gt; were published last week, and between those and a series of tweets from Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, we’re getting our best look yet at how the company’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; throwing billions of dollars away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8g7ypF"&gt;It’s not spending as much as you’d think &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7qeuGW"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/405/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/"&gt;Apple’s “proposed findings of fact” document&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-10-epic-is-burning-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-on-epic-games-store-exclusives-in-its-war-against-steam"&gt;credit to &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for spotting some of this over the weekend), Epic Games &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; losing cash — hundreds of millions of dollars in “minimum guarantees” it pays many developers to give away their games and constantly offer new ones to keep players coming back. That money also covers Epic’s infamous exclusivity deals, so it’s not clear how much goes to the free games alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVoUqn"&gt;Either way, it’s a sizable fraction of a billion dollars that Epic’s losing here: $330 million, it seems. “Epic committed $444 million in minimum guarantees for 2020 alone,” reads Apple’s legal filing. “That includes at least $330 million in unrecouped costs from minimum guarantees alone.” But both of those numbers are far, far less than the retail value of those games: $17.5 billion, if you do the math based on Epic CEO Tim Sweeney’s chart below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eNKwyk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple spins this as “losing money”, but spending now in order to build a great, profitable business in the future is exactly what investment is! It’s equally true whether you’re building a factory, a store, or a game.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1381021998692892676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ksaWxb"&gt;How is it paying only a fraction of a billion for both exclusives &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;freebies, when the freebies alone should cost many billions? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1381109913112489987"&gt;Sweeney revealed on April 10th&lt;/a&gt; that Epic doesn’t actually pay a fee per game at all, much less the full amount: “Our free game giveaways are negotiated with developers where we pay them an agreed dollar amount, not per copy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AEqyBH"&gt;Epic, and Sweeney, are willing to invest hundreds of millions of dollars into the platform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bR88ap"&gt;As you can see in Sweeney’s other tweet above, Epic isn’t expecting to make that money back: the studio has intentionally set aside that huge, nearly half-billion pile of cash to entice developers, and the company thinks it’s working just fine. Sweeney publicly declared his support for those costs on Twitter over the weekend: “[The Epic Games Store] has proven to be a fantastic success in reaching gamers with great games and a fantastic investment into growing the business!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnsHrF"&gt;Theoretically, the constant stream of new games may keep more players using the Epic Games Store and, eventually, maybe even spend their own money on games there. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254901/epic-games-store-accounts-daily-monthly-active-concurrent-users-storefront-2020-data"&gt;claims it’s already seen that borne out in the store’s rapid growth&lt;/a&gt;, saying players have spent more than $700 million on the store, with $265 million of that spent on games &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; made by Epic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EVhmUo"&gt;Fortnite is a cash cow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QYNrGw"&gt;While we don’t know exactly how much &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has made for Epic, it almost certainly is &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of money: Epic earned more than $700 million on iOS alone &lt;em&gt;in just two years&lt;/em&gt;, according to Apple’s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7lGzyU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is pretty much how any company looks to disrupt an existing market. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Worth noting that while Epic Store loses $330m, Epic still generated approx $3.85bn in revenue and $1.54bn in gross profit (Thanks to Fortnite) according to a recent court document. &lt;a href="https://t.co/VZrbsFkyme"&gt;https://t.co/VZrbsFkyme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1381632911141654528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0ptMb8"&gt;And although the game is no longer available on iOS because of Apple and Epic’s ongoing feud, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is still on many other platforms, and it seems like a safe bet that it’s still raking in a lot of cash everywhere else, giving Epic income as it gives away games on the Epic Games Store. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A robotic spacecraft just latched onto an active satellite in orbit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jWy4EvQBqvP6LPydjpDpNUXuIfI=/0x85:510x425/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69116010/vis_nfov1_20210223T093001edit.000Z.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An image of Intelsat’s IS-10-02 satellite taken by Northrop’s MEV-2 as it approached for docking. | Northrop Grumman&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K4Fk6e"&gt;A robotic spacecraft from Northrop Grumman latched onto an old communications satellite in deep orbit and extended its lifespan by five more years. The Mission Extension Vehicle-2 (MEV-2) marked Northrop’s second successful docking of an object in space. The mission is part of the company’s efforts to kickstart an industry of life-extension services for dead, dying or errant satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0qCZW"&gt;MEV-2 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21366674/northrop-grumman-space-logistics-mev-2-satellite-servicing-life-extension"&gt;launched in August last year&lt;/a&gt; from French Guiana in South America. It spent six months raising its orbit to rendezvous with Intelsat’s 17-year-old communications satellite in geosynchronous orbit, more than 22,000 miles from Earth. That satellite was running out of fuel and was getting old; it had operated far beyond its expected lifespan while still providing broadband communications to three continents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjKNew"&gt;On March 12th, the MEV-2 craft started a month-long docking process with the Intelsat satellite. Docking was completed and confirmed successful by Northrop Grumman today at 1:34PM ET. It “was every bit as exciting and successful as the docking of MEV-1,” Joe Anderson, vice president of business development at SpaceLogistics, the Northrop subsidiary that launches MEVs, said during a press conference on Monday. Now, Intelsat’s IS-10-02 satellite can carry on beaming broadband communications to South America, Europe, Africa and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N2zgDU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21154426/commercial-satellites-docking-space-northrop-grumman-intelsat"&gt;MEV-1 was Northrop’s first docking success&lt;/a&gt; last year, a breakthrough in its goal to spruce up dead or dying satellites and save satellite operators the cost of replacing them altogether. Extending the lifetime of satellites also helps tamp down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20991798/space-debris-low-earth-orbit-satellites-mega-constellations-collisions-graph"&gt;space junk&lt;/a&gt; — a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17906158/nasa-spacex-oneweb-satellite-large-constellations-orbital-debris"&gt;growing problem&lt;/a&gt; in orbit as the world launches record amounts of satellites to space each year. De-orbiting a satellite from geosynchronous orbit could take decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYZDgQ"&gt;The Northrop-Intelsat servicing contract was a “win-win situation,” said Jean-Luc Froeliger, a vice president at Intelsat, during a press conference on Monday. The IS-10-02 satellite was performing well, Froeliger said, but without Northrop’s MEV-2, they would’ve had to deorbit it because it was running low on fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhMjHa"&gt;MEV-2 is currently clamped to the back of IS-10-02, serving as the satellite’s life support by providing renewed power and navigation control. The two will operate as a “combined stack” for the next five years. After that, MEV-2 will undock from IS-10-02 and set off to rendezvous with another client satellite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PmrI1"&gt;IS-10-02 will die after MEV-2 leaves. A company spokeswoman said the satellite will retire to a “graveyard orbit,” or the place in space where old satellites can turn into space junk without getting in the way of younger satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XC05l"&gt;Northrop is also building an upgraded satellite servicing system called a Mission Robotic Vehicle (or MRV). That spacecraft will meet up with aging satellites to install orbital first-aid kits called Mission Extension Pods, designed to provide propulsion and power. Each MRV can carry six pods. MRV’s debut launch is slated for early 2024, Anderson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3zXaC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Monday 7:10PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This story was updated to add Intelsat’s response to a question regarding the fate of IS-10-02 after MEV-2 leaves. It will die.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is removing its Play Movies and TV app from every Roku and most smart TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A warning message about the changeover to YouTube on an LG Smart TV" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JwVA2CymoFgnNxRYMT0b0TmSwQg=/0x0:4032x2688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69115989/IMG_1181.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yDOt7M"&gt;The Google Play Movies and TV app will no longer be available on any Roku set-top box or any Samsung, LG, Vizio or Roku smart TV starting July 15th, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/thread/102498448?hl=en"&gt;Google has announced&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/12/google-play-movies-roku-samsung-lg-vizio/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you have movies or TV shows purchased or rented through the service, you’ll still be able to access them through the “Your movies and shows” section of the YouTube app on those devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSkCjI"&gt;This change will also affect you if if you used the Movies and TV app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/13/16464000/how-to-use-movies-anywhere-app-features"&gt;to access Movies Anywhere&lt;/a&gt;, the service that allows you to redeem codes from DVDs and Blu-rays so you can access your media digitally. Google has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that users who relied on Play Movies and TV to access that content will be able to do so through YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phbyYj"&gt;There are a few other caveats to note in the transition to YouTube. Your Watchlist will no longer be viewable in the app (though it can still be seen on the web by &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=my%20watchlist"&gt;Googling “my watchlist”&lt;/a&gt;), and while your family can still share the content you bought from the Movie and TV store, any purchases made in the YouTube app won’t be shared with your family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xsSFks"&gt;If you have movies or TV content purchased through the Play Store, here’s how you’ll be able to access them after July 15th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="8GHnkC"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On Android phones/tablets: &lt;/strong&gt;using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21492549/google-tv-app-play-movies-name-change-chromecast"&gt;the Google TV app&lt;/a&gt; or the YouTube app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nXvYjF"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On iPhones/iPads:&lt;/strong&gt; using the Google Play Movies and TV app, or the YouTube App&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JMy9en"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On Roku devices: &lt;/strong&gt;using the YouTube app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="re2aJ5"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On Samsung, LG, Vizio, and Roku smart TVs:&lt;/strong&gt; using the YouTube app &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8Fkiq6"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On Chromecast:&lt;/strong&gt; using the Google TV app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bglTXt"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On the web: &lt;/strong&gt;using the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/movies"&gt;Google Play Movies and TV website&lt;/a&gt; or YouTube website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6c1Vsf"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On Android TV: &lt;/strong&gt;using the Google Play Movies and TV&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;app (&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/androidtv/answer/6111147?hl=en"&gt;according to Google’s documentation&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="4L4h1l"&gt;To view your content on YouTube, log in, go to Library, then tap “Your movies and shows.” There, you’ll see your Google Play Store movie and TV purchases, your Movies Anywhere content, and any content purchased from within the YouTube app itself (with the family sharing caveat noted above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFx7S4"&gt;Transitioning from one app to another can be tough, but Google is hoping to take some of the sting away for users &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/liliputingnews/status/1381704020826451974"&gt;by offering&lt;/a&gt; them a gift code that can be applied to their next movie or TV purchase — though you’ll have to redeem it on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E2GdWg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Google is shutting down the Google Play Movies &amp;amp; TV apps for Roku, Samsung, LG, and Vizio smart TVs on June 15, but past purchases should be available in the YouTube apps for those platforms, and you can use Play credits with YouTube. Watchlists won't transfer though. &lt;a href="https://t.co/WJh0qAYTPg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WJh0qAYTPg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Liliputing (@liliputingnews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/liliputingnews/status/1381704020826451974?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>The first trailer for Samsung’s new branded Hulu show is suspiciously light on Samsung</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ox1mR3B-WY45qE0fZsmJX0veA_8=/249x0:1980x1154/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69115757/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_5.45.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eXFOAD"&gt;The first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;/em&gt; — the upcoming, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362153/samsung-s21-ultra-hulu-exposure-show-branded-content"&gt;Samsung-branded reality TV show&lt;/a&gt; from Hulu that’s one part photography competition, one part Galaxy S21 Ultra advertisement — is here. But for a show that’s been paid for by Samsung explicitly to highlight the power of the cameras on Samsung’s phones, it’s almost &lt;em&gt;suspiciously&lt;/em&gt; light on Samsung branding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lciBi9"&gt;If you just gave &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;/em&gt; a cursory glance (or, more likely, stumbled across it on Hulu one night) there’s nothing about it that immediately betrays its status as Samsung branded content. There’s no Samsung logo on the title card, no mention of the Galaxy S21 Ultra or its 108-megapixel camera system, or the various software add-ons that help Samsung’s smartphone stand out from the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5lRhJ2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JKHEpyTJZRE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5bMVzg"&gt;In fact, &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;/em&gt;’s trailer just gives the impression of being a photography-centered competition series, like &lt;em&gt;The Great British Baking Show&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Chopped. &lt;/em&gt;Look more closely, of course, and the cracks start to show. A photography contest without any DSLRs or mirrorless cameras? Why doesn’t anyone have a bag full of lenses or a holster with a secondary shooter handy? And yes, I suppose all the contestants &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; appear to be using the same phone, now that you mention it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0Lpzj"&gt;Which is, of course, the point: &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;/em&gt; is, after all, still meant to highlight the S21 Ultra’s camera — even if its trailer isn’t exactly shoving that fact in your face. This either makes it the subtlest and best piece of branded content ever, or the worst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZO8ew"&gt;It’s possible that &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;/em&gt; will lean more heavily on its Samsung pedigree in the actual series itself; reality TV isn’t exactly known for its subtlety even in the most ordinary of circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ttpynq"&gt;But there is the chance that the limitations of only using Samsung’s latest smartphone could add some interesting wrinkles to the show. Any trained photographer that’s good enough to make it to &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;/em&gt;’s level can almost certainly take great photos with their own equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJSsPf"&gt;But by introducing a common variable (the S21 Ultra’s hardware, for better and for worse), the show can theoretically be about who can use that specific tool the best with things like staging, lighting, and editing; similar to how cooking shows tend to make contestants work within the limitations of the dish or ingredients of the week, rather than just making the thing that they’re most comfortable preparing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3I8ZdP"&gt;We’ll find out when &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;/em&gt; arrives on Hulu on April 26th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYbYts"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb is trying to preemptively cancel post-pandemic bacchanals </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Airbnb Flag" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q_7ueDkb4YHDiFO41ZyaA7ah0gM=/41x0:1268x818/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69115588/Airbnb_Flag.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sEGKZb"&gt;Airbnb is attempting to put the kibosh on disruptive post-vaccine summer parties by launching its &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-launches-summer-of-responsible-travel/"&gt;“Summer of Responsible Travel”&lt;/a&gt; plan, focused on offering more support to hosts and their neighbors, and adjusting its policies to prevent Airbnbs from being used for things other than calm, socially distanced stays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXHbib"&gt;Airbnb’s most noticeable change is a ban on one-night or last-minute stays on the Fourth of July, at least for those guests who &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; have a history of receiving positive reviews from Airbnb hosts. The company is targeting the Fourth because it says the holiday is viewed as a “reopening date” for the US and potentially an occasion for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/large-gatherings.html"&gt;large gatherings that could spread COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PsxcYL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Airbnb already has a 16-person limit on gatherings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="96nXUQ"&gt;As the policy stands now, there are still some loopholes that might allow big Fourth of July celebrations to happen. If you’ve already booked before today, those reservations will be honored; the same is true if you have several positive reviews but just now decided to have a blowout gathering. But if you’re new to the platform and don’t have a review history, you might have a harder time booking a one-night stay. The policy is similar to what &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fresources%2Fhosting-homes%2Fa%2Fhow-were-helping-to-protect-against-parties-this-halloween-273&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F12%2F22379885%2Fairbnb-summer-responsible-travel-community-support-fno-parties-pandemic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Airbnb tried on Halloween&lt;/a&gt;. On that holiday, it canceled already-booked one-night reservations and refunded hosts, but it doesn’t seem to be taking the same tack with the Fourth of July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpCrI1"&gt;Airbnb previously announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21377408/airbnb-global-ban-house-parties-coronavirus"&gt;a global ban on house parties&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 and currently caps gatherings at 16 people. It’s not clear how often those policies are enforced or if more people show up to an event that only had 16 people invited to it. The last time Airbnb &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228798/airbnb-washington-dc-inauguration-reservations-blocked-cancelled"&gt;blocked and canceled reservations&lt;/a&gt; for an event was during President Biden’s inauguration week, but its Fourth of July policy is more lenient. Even still, Airbnb is potentially impacting people who planned to book a spot and cutting itself out of reservation money in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rs6UWQ"&gt;Airbnb will also begin to offer discounts on noise detection devices through &lt;a href="https://www.minut.com/"&gt;a company called Minut&lt;/a&gt;. Airbnb doesn’t specify the discount amount, but sensors cost $129 and monthly subscriptions can cost as much as $14.99 per month. Minut’s sensors don’t record anything, but they do track motion and loudness and automatically send notifications to guests when they pass certain decibel levels. It’s not as creepy as it could be, but it still might make guests uncomfortable. Airbnb says hosts will be required to mention if they use Minut’s devices on their listing pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jAYDkB"&gt;Airbnb is also expanding its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fneighbors&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F12%2F22379885%2Fairbnb-summer-responsible-travel-community-support-fno-parties-pandemic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Neighborhood Support Line&lt;/a&gt; to cover Spanish-language calls. Neighborhood Support is a 24/7 service neighbors can use to complain about Airbnbs, sort of a first layer of protection to keep hosts and guests from necessarily having to deal with local authorities over something like a noise complaint — assuming an annoyed neighbor knows to call the hotline number (855-635-7754) to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8y9YO"&gt;Airbnb filed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21376338/airbnb-ipo-s1-filing-going-public-confidential"&gt;to go public&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic, and in the process, it revealed an almost $700 million loss in revenue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570416/airbnb-coronavirus-pandemic-travel-hospitality"&gt;during 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Everything Airbnb has done since has happened in the shadow of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232769/airbnb-bloomberg-businessweek-chesky-venture-capital"&gt;whether it can bounce back&lt;/a&gt; after a hard year. Airbnb is in a tricky situation; it wants to encourage travel, but it also has to keep guests safe without completely preventing them from using its service. It seems like the “Summer of Responsible Travel” is as much about encouraging guests to stay responsible as it is about actually laying down the law.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel hopes to start making chips for car companies within six to nine months</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7-IJ5RCX96HWRNkNqL4LjqMdVLs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69115321/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NXdULp"&gt;Intel could start producing in-demand semiconductors for car companies within six to nine months, CEO Pat Gelsinger said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, commenting that the chipmaking is already being discussed with companies that design chips for cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkQqjE"&gt;“We’re hoping that some of these things can be alleviated, not requiring a three- or four-year factory build, but maybe six months of new products being certified on some of our existing processes,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-semiconductors-idUSKBN2BZ2C4"&gt;Gelsinger told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ve begun those engagements already with some of the key components suppliers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m796lz"&gt;Even if Intel is unable to meet that six to nine month goal, the news highlights the importance that Intel is placing on its new business as a producer of chips for other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GpZjLI"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “We’ve begun those engagements already with some of the key components suppliers.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0cJuP6"&gt;Gelsinger unveiled the new business — called Intel Foundry Services — as a “standalone foundry business unit” last month at his “&lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/idm-manufacturing-innovation-product-leadership/"&gt;Engineering the Future&lt;/a&gt;” announcement, with promises that the company would put its fabs to work producing x86, Arm, and RISC-V core chips for external clients. As part of that announcement, Intel also planned to invest $20 billion into expanding its fabs in Arizona to help it better meet demand from external partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKsYs7"&gt;The automotive industry has been one of the areas that’s been hit hardest by the ongoing global semiconductor shortage, with car companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331766/gm-pickups-semiconductor-shortage-fuel-economy-emissions"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; forced to shut down production or make changes to their trucks due to a lack of parts. If Intel is able to start producing automotive chips within the year, it could provide a much-needed new avenue of supply to alleviate those shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OS2dwQ"&gt;The global shortage has reached the point that the Biden administration is looking to intervene: the president has called for a review of the semiconductor supply chain in an executive order and hosted the executives of companies including Intel, Google, Ford, GM, TSMC, and Dell at the White House for today’s “CEO Summit on Semiconductor and Supply Chain Resilience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tNpeTx"&gt;“We’ve been falling behind on research and development and manufacturing, and, to put it bluntly, we have to step up our game,” Biden said at the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kyndryl is IBM’s wacky new name for its dry IT spinoff</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ibK9ox1dZb7gKtwIxZvDqWmzQUo=/40x0:1240x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69115271/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wdrUBq"&gt;Meet &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibms-independent-managed-infrastructure-services-business-to-be-named-kyndryl-301266347.html"&gt;Kyndryl&lt;/a&gt; — which, despite the name, is not a new legendary pokémon or a futuristic fake pharmaceutical from &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. No, Kyndryl is the new name for IBM’s legacy IT infrastructure business, which the company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508974/ibm-split-into-two-companies-newco-hybrid-cloud-legacy-it"&gt;spinning off into a new company&lt;/a&gt; to allow the main company to focus on its newer (and more lucrative) areas of emphasis, like AI and cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z12AZW"&gt;I’ll let IBM’s press release explain: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ipQyeq"&gt; ”Kyn” is derived from the word &lt;em&gt;kinship&lt;/em&gt;, referencing the belief that relationships with people — employees, customers and partners — are at the center of the strategy, and that long-lasting relationships must be built and nurtured. “Dryl” comes from &lt;em&gt;tendril,&lt;/em&gt; bringing to mind new growth and the idea that — together with customers and partners — the business is always working toward advancing human progress.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="PMCSVM"&gt;“Kinship” and “tendrils” — two of the first words that come to mind when one considers managed infrastructure services. Except, of course, with extra y’s added, “y” presumably being the letter that most conveys “the spirit of true partnership and growth” for which Kyndryl’s corporate IT setups stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTaNxJ"&gt;In reality, it feels like the wholly bizarre branding is meant to be SEO bait. “NewCo” — the original placeholder for the branch of the company that is now known as Kyndryl — is the sort of name that fades into the background, while Kyndryl, bizarre as it may be, is at no danger of being confused or lost in a sea of similar Google results (mostly because there are none).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGqgzh"&gt;“Customers around the world will come to know Kyndryl as a brand that runs the vital systems at the heart of progress,” said Martin Schroeter, Kyndryl’s CEO. And with a name as... unique as the one selected here, he’s probably correct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdbqzF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
