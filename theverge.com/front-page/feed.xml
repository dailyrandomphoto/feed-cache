    <title>Nacon Rig Pro Compact review: compact with caveats</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;There’s a crowd for a mini Xbox controller, but this one doesn’t get everything right&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="o2oP8U"&gt;Accessory brand Nacon recently put out its $50 RIG Pro Compact wired controller for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X / S&lt;/a&gt; (and Xbox One) consoles and PC, and I was immediately drawn to it. It doesn’t try anything revolutionary, but I have a thing for controllers that drastically alter the shape of the console maker’s reference design. In this case, Nacon’s is a tinier, shorter take on Microsoft’s latest controller, but the analog sticks and triggers feel just as large — some of the buttons are actually larger. There’s less distance between where your thumbs lie on the sticks and where the triggers are, which should be a boon for people with small hands or those who just want to feel like everything is easily within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrglXo"&gt;It’s a good-looking little controller. But setting the form factor to the side momentarily, one of the main features of the Rig Pro Compact is that it has a 3.5mm audio port for headphones and that it unlocks access to the Dolby Atmos app on PC and Xbox once you plug it in. With it, you’ll get Dolby’s spatial audio advancements through wired headphones or headsets you connect to the Pro Compact. It’s a nice incentive if you’re looking for a wired controller, but I don’t consider this to be a must-have feature.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nacon Pro Compact" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y7a2SGm82U79FeuWs2p8FlOhwuA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521465/cfaulkner_20210511_4581_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This all-plastic controller has a slightly grippy texture on its underside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XkNfdG"&gt;Whether you should buy the Pro Compact depends mostly on the size of your hands. As I mentioned, it’s a shorter controller from top to bottom than Microsoft’s, so there’s less distance between the triggers and buttons. That change, while beneficial for many, has a few knock-on effects that might negatively impact your experience with it, as it did for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xqXIdD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10629929"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cInoon"&gt;I have medium-sized hands and their small grips tuck comfortably into my palms, but the rear section of the controller’s housing for the triggers gets in the way of where I’d normally rest my index finger knuckles on Microsoft’s controller. This likely won’t be problematic if you’re someone who keeps both sets of pointer and middle fingers at the ready on shoulder buttons (though, I have yet to meet anyone who uses a controller like this). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0K6unc"&gt;Another change that might be an issue for more people is the relocation of the view, menu, and share buttons. They’re much closer to vital controls on the Pro Compact than they are on Microsoft’s controller. This one’s more nitpicky than the last, but it leads to accidental presses during gameplay. The menu button is &lt;em&gt;so &lt;/em&gt;close to the X, A, B, Y buttons that it looks and feels like it belongs in that cluster of inputs. On the topic of buttons, the tactility of each face button feels spot-on compared to Microsoft’s controller, though around the back the rear triggers feel like they have a shorter pull, which makes them less satisfying to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nacon Pro Compact" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M2wu910mmY5kfGJ-htNBFLcpoaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521467/cfaulkner_20210511_4581_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything is within reach, for better or worse. I accidentally tapped the menu, view, and share buttons during gameplay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nacon Pro Compact" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q15YyYBl0008U5xhxEaY97skqkk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521464/cfaulkner_20210511_4581_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I usually like to rest my middle fingers around the grips, but the rear trigger housing gets in the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bIHcBI"&gt;One of my favorite things about the Pro Compact is its companion app available for Xbox and PC that lets you tweak the sensitivity of both sticks (in addition to their respective dead zones). It also allows you to remap every button on the controller to your liking, change the actuation distance of the triggers, and toggle the directional pad between four-way inputs to eight-way for more control options. The vibration can be toggled on or off in the app, as well. Microsoft lets you adjust many of these settings with its own controllers, but not every third-party company goes through the effort of making their own app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVSS1V"&gt;If most of the controllers on the market for Xbox or PC are too big for your hands, the Nacon Pro Compact is fairly easy to recommend giving a try at $50. It’s one less thing to connect wirelessly or manage battery levels for, and its 9.8-feet braided cord is lengthy and has a breakaway connector to let it safely detach if there’s force applied to the cable. That’s all great, but if you don’t have any issues using Microsoft’s own Xbox controller from an ergonomic standpoint, there isn’t much here that’ll make your time gaming more enjoyable. I fit into the latter group, and while I could enjoy casual gameplay with the Pro Compact, it’s tough to turn away from the more familiar, comfortable curves of Microsoft’s model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A second exploit has emerged in the sad WD My Book Live data deletion saga </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5QMSH74zA-isuK65T4ZQOvwBtoQ=/0x0:1488x992/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69520638/Screen_Shot_2021_06_29_at_12.19.15_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The WD My Book Live and My Book Live Duo&lt;/em&gt; | Image: WD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UlZ8MU"&gt;It looks like there may have been more than one exploit used to cause the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549677/wd-my-book-live-data-deletion-unplug-lan-cable-threat-actor"&gt;mass deletion of data&lt;/a&gt; from WD My Book Live NASes last week, according to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/hackers-exploited-0-day-not-2018-bug-to-mass-wipe-my-book-live-devices/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When news broke that people were finding that their data was missing, some (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.westerndigital.com%2Fsupport%2Fproductsecurity%2Fwdc-21008-recommended-security-measures-wd-mybooklive-wd-mybookliveduo&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F29%2F22555959%2Fwd-my-book-live-second-exploit-authentication-factory-reset-without-password-root-control" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;including WD itself&lt;/a&gt;), pointed to a &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18472"&gt;known exploit from 2018&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed for root access of the device. However, it appears as though there’s more going on than was initially suspected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqfxjK"&gt;If you have one of these devices, you should unplug it from the internet before reading any further — it’s clear at this point that your data is at risk if the device is online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOZl9M"&gt;The second exploit, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/hackers-exploited-0-day-not-2018-bug-to-mass-wipe-my-book-live-devices"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, doesn’t give an attacker full control over the device like the other exploit. It just allows them to remotely wipe the device without having to know the password. Tragically for those who lost data, it seems that code that would’ve prevented this &lt;a href="https://censys.io/blog/cve-2018-18472-western-digital-my-book-live-mass-exploitation/"&gt;was actually present&lt;/a&gt; in the WD My Book Live’s software, but it appears to have been commented out (or deactivated) by WD at some point — because of this change, the software didn’t run authentication when asked to do a factory reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9qV8X"&gt;WD had stopped supporting these devices in 2015. While the exploit has been around since at least then, it’s not necessarily a scenario where an obvious security issue persisted through years and years of updates. The question still remains, though, as to &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; hackers decided to factory reset the devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlURsY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; has a wild theory, based on &lt;a href="https://censys.io/blog/cve-2018-18472-western-digital-my-book-live-mass-exploitation/"&gt;analysis by security firm Censys&lt;/a&gt;: the data deletion happened as the result of a fight between hackers, with one botnet owner potentially trying to take over or disrupt another’s. One hacker (or group of hackers) was using the known exploit to control the devices for some nefarious purposes. Then, another entity used the unknown remote wipe exploit to erase those devices. It likely would’ve removed the first entity’s access to the hardware — but users’ data was caught in the crossfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0zoEK"&gt;The theory does make sense, given the competing nature of the exploits used. (Why would a hacker burn a previously unreported exploit to factory reset the machines after already having root access?) For its part, WD told &lt;em&gt;Ars &lt;/em&gt;that it could confirm that both exploits were used, at least in some cases. The company said it was “not clear why the attackers exploited both vulnerabilities,” but noted that it would update its security advisory about the second exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5GOXz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; didn’t immediately receive a response when it reached out to WD for comment on the findings.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla Model 3 gets safety recommendation back after ditching radar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gXLeZRfxW-ROyzyw43eUrcICGio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69520405/jbareham_180213_2301_0077.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dSuc4K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/tesla-model-3-regains-cr-top-pick-status-iihs-safety-award-a1085318072/"&gt;is restoring its “Top Pick” recommendation&lt;/a&gt; to the Tesla Model 3 after the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) released a new evaluation of the car’s camera-based advanced driver assist system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZrkPi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iihs.org/ratings/vehicle/tesla/model-3-4-door-sedan/2021#front-crash-prevention-vehicle-to-vehicle"&gt;The IIHS was able to show&lt;/a&gt; that the Model 3 with &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/transitioning-tesla-vision"&gt;Tesla Vision cameras&lt;/a&gt; featured effective automatic emergency breaking (AEB) and forward collision warning systems (FCW), two criteria for &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt;’ Top Pick decision-making. Combined with the IIHS awarding the Model 3 its own “Top Safety Pick” title, &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; decided to once again recommend the EV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IwKSz"&gt;The publication maintains a contemptuous relationship with Tesla. It last &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/tesla-model-3-loses-cr-top-pick-status-and-iihs-safety-award-a2421791602/"&gt;revoked its recommendation&lt;/a&gt; earlier this May when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453518/tesla-vision-radar-autopilot-model-3-y-fsd"&gt;Tesla began shipping&lt;/a&gt; the Model 3 and Y without radar sensors and warned some safety features weren’t yet rated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397546/tesla-autopilot-consumer-report-test-no-driver"&gt;has also been critical of Tesla’s Autopilot system&lt;/a&gt; and its ability to be triggered without someone in the driver’s seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnJOwJ"&gt;Tesla Vision passing the test adds some weight to Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s claim that cameras can be an adequate substitute for radar and lidar sensors in self-driving cars. Musk has gone as far as describing modern car companies’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18512580/elon-musk-tesla-driverless-cars-lidar-simulation-waymo"&gt;focus on lidar as a “fool’s errand,”&lt;/a&gt; and the announcement that new Model 3s and Model Ys would favor cameras was essentially the company forcing the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9DlR9Y"&gt;Recently, Tesla test cars &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451404/tesla-luminar-lidar-elon-musk-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;were spotted sporting lidar sensors&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to suggest the company might be reconsidering its stance, but for now the IIHS and &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; are satisfied with what Tesla Vision is able to achieve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cl21rj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8B7pO8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVLoyO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to block and report text spam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4L-IfKtQ76K7Il4nXctrhDAQtl4=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69520154/texting_lumia.0.1437583471.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xS9Cl4"&gt;Spam texts can be incredibly irritating — you get a notification and stop what you’re doing to check your phone, only to find somebody is trying to sell you something you don’t want. How can you prevent it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cz3VXk"&gt;Unfortunately, there are no absolutes in preventing text spam. But there are some ways you can at least minimize the number of spam texts that get through. Here are some strategies to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kZBYfb"&gt;Do not answer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6jYMm1"&gt;Top of the list is — as you probably already know — never reply to a spam text, and never &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; click on a link within a spam text. If you’re not sure whether a text is spam or legitimate, hold off on replying until you’ve done a bit of research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6qez8i"&gt;Use the spam filter on your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rIeftn"&gt;Android phones and iPhones have spam-filtering features that you can enable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NuvT8Q"&gt;If you have an Android phone:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aZycxQ"&gt;Open the Messages app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Aitn1H"&gt;Click on the three dots in the upper-right corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AcwIN3"&gt;Select “Settings” &amp;gt; “Spam protection”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Qw3pYw"&gt;Make sure “Enable spam protection” is toggled on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="LIp4DO"&gt;If you want to see what numbers you’ve marked as spam, you can go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Spam &amp;amp; blocked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To set up spam blocking, go to “Settings” &amp;amp;gt; “Spam protection.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FXwdP2ahVxd3OAOhvklYwpyG92s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688826/Screenshot_20210629_115526.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Spam protection.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle on “Enable spam protection.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N95yPCbJSuhETaseeQ-cGaSctgw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688921/Screenshot_20210629_115223.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle on “Enable spam protection.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Bhbi4Z"&gt;If you have an iPhone:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lVIqKL"&gt;Apple’s spam blocking is a little more basic than Android’s: it blocks phone numbers that you &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099"&gt;don’t have saved in your contacts list&lt;/a&gt; and haven’t been in contact with before, which could be an issue (say, if you’re expecting a call from a car service). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mT9Wfz"&gt;Open the Settings app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cON9RE"&gt;Scroll down to and select “Messages” &amp;gt; “Unknown &amp;amp; Spam”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9DWUaL"&gt;Toggle on “Filter Unknown Senders”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Scroll down to “Unknown &amp;amp;amp; Spam.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQ5MN3_pe8P_1cEcmcKEuXpe4ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688833/IMG_DE165A8C72D3_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scroll down to “Unknown &amp;amp; Spam.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle on “Filter Unknown Senders.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/54lBOdOA3HP0fjky5doQXJanBug=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688834/ios_spam_filter.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle on “Filter Unknown Senders.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OAOftX"&gt;Block specific texts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CPlAZi"&gt;When you get a spam text, you can block that individual number from contacting you again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CHYvJs"&gt;If you have an Android phone: &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="y9iZCr"&gt;When you tap on a message that Android tags as suspicious, the OS will often give you the opportunity to report it as spam (or verify that it’s not spam). But if you get a spam text that wasn’t flagged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YMRXxv"&gt;Tap the three dots in the upper-right corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gj3lEy"&gt;Select “Details” &amp;gt; “Block &amp;amp; report spam”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wNHf6y"&gt;You can just block that number if you want, or you can check “Report spam” to send the number to Google and possibly your carrier as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JC7myw"&gt;Note that this process can differ depending on which Android phone you’re using.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EdU9wB"&gt;If you have an iPhone:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9x3Rtt"&gt;Open the spam text and select the user icon on top of the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BjzvjY"&gt;Tap on the “info” icon and then on the “info” button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pWO3eN"&gt;Select “Block this Caller”&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H2JCJ1"&gt;If you want to report an iMessage that you received as spam, then look for the “Report Junk” link under the message, tap it, tap “Delete,” and then “Report Junk.” Note that this doesn’t automatically block that phone number; you’ll have to do that separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AEFlot"&gt;Forward the text to 7726&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F8kP0O"&gt;If you’re using one of the major carriers (Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, or T-Mobile), you can report a spam text by forwarding it to 7726. (Note that this spells “SPAM” on your phone keyboard.) This may also work with other carriers as well; to find out if it’s possible, check with your carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rxUjrU"&gt;Block spam using your carrier’s services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4EbKlM"&gt;Most major carriers these days offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327304/spam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android"&gt;spam-blocking services for phone calls&lt;/a&gt;, and these can carry over to texts. Carrier sites will offer details about free and for-pay security services offered by &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/security/security-apps/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fplans-features%2Fblock-unwanted-calls&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22555521%2Fspam-text-block-security-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/call-filter/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;; if you use a different carrier, check its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AbbBTq"&gt;Use a third-party spam-blocking service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cz49nD"&gt;If you’re really frustrated and the above strategies aren’t working for you, you can try using a third-party anti-spam service. These are not free. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.robokiller.com/"&gt;RoboKiller&lt;/a&gt; costs $4.99 a month or $39.99 a year after a seven-day trial, while &lt;a href="https://nomorobo.com/"&gt;Nomorobo&lt;/a&gt; costs $1.99 per month per device after a 14-day trial. If you do decide you need a third-party service, you can use the trial to see if it works for you before committing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Remedy’s Project Condor is a multiplayer spinoff of Control</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Control" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7wGlR4Pehmx_yBeKdRARoYscaj8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69520041/control.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oBRa20"&gt;Developer Remedy Entertainment announced that it’s making a new game, codenamed “Condor,” a multiplayer spinoff of &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;. No release date, price, or story beats have been shared for Project Condor, but all we know so far is that &lt;a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-signs-a-co-publishing-and-development-agreement-with-505-games-for-a-multiplayer-spin-off-game-of-the-award-winning-control/"&gt;Remedy’s press release&lt;/a&gt; says it will be a four-player cooperative PvE (player vs. environment) game. It’ll be built with Northlight, the same engine used for &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;. It will release on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X / S consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBSKet"&gt;The game will be published by 505 Games. “As a multiplayer game, Project Condor&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has the potential to engage the gaming community in the long run, contributing to 505 Games’ product revenue stream longer than traditional games,” shared the co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group, the company that operates the publisher, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Project Condor" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UOEE2FsNsWFdnzXuV4etl6AFI0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689231/Condor_waitingroom.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Control&lt;em&gt; game director Mikael Kasurinen says this concept art “tells pretty well what Condor is about.”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8Eow22"&gt;Remedy and 505 Games shared that they are also collaborating on a “bigger-budget” &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;title coming in the future. According to &lt;a href="https://www.remedygames.com/the-future-of-control-remedy-505-games/"&gt;the press release&lt;/a&gt;, the companies have “outlined high-level collaboration terms,” so it could be a while before we see the next installment in action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYzfCr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;isn’t the only franchise that Remedy Entertainment is focused on. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21334562/crossfirex-remedy-trailer-xbox-one-series-x-smilegate-fps"&gt;It’s working on &lt;em&gt;CrossfireX &lt;/em&gt;alongside Smilegate&lt;/a&gt;, the Korean developer that created the popular FPS &lt;em&gt;Crossfire&lt;/em&gt;. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195152/epic-games-publishing-label-control-last-guardian-inside"&gt;the developer joined Epic Games Publishing as a partner&lt;/a&gt;, and as of late March 2020, it said that the publishing deal “covered two titles; one larger-scale production, and a smaller game set in the universe.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is offering iPhone owners no-hassle network ‘test drives’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-1kBqP2Ll5BefEiR2iNNntXf0eY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69519885/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you own a compatible iPhone, you can try out T-Mobile just by downloading an app.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gMRljy"&gt;T-Mobile is offering a new, low-stakes way to try out its network for free for 30 days with no additional equipment required. &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/ossbsscx/t-mobile-taps-esim-tech-for-free-network-test-drive/d/d-id/770535?"&gt;Identified by &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile’s existing &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Ffree-trial&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F29%2F22555810%2Ft-mobile-test-drive-iphone-esim" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Test Drive program&lt;/a&gt; now works over eSIM with compatible iPhones. All you need to do is download an app, follow the instructions to start the trial with eSIM, and you’re up and running — no billing information required. There’s no change to your current carrier plan or phone number, but you’ll be using T-Mobile data on your device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyeTK3"&gt;The Test Drive program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/15/17693228/t-mobile-free-30-day-trials-network-cities"&gt;has been around in one form or another&lt;/a&gt; since 2014. With the most recent iteration — which is still available to those who can’t use the eSIM feature — T-Mobile will send you a free Wi-Fi hotspot you can connect to with your current phone to try out the network. This new eSIM version offers the same kind of trial (30 days or 30GB, whichever you reach first) with less hassle. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pwsLJWL1Bz9EiIpop6RzCgoKj0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689051/Tmo_trial.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images: Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download the app, enter some information, follow the prompts, and you’re good to go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LXRjoU"&gt;T-Mobile says the eSIM option is a pilot program that it introduced last week. Currently, it only works with unlocked iPhones starting with XS and newer devices that are running iOS 14.5 or higher. If you have an iPhone 12-gen device, you’ll also have access to T-Mobile’s 5G network during your trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pr4ZsC"&gt;We gave it a shot and it actually is as easy as it looks — just follow the set-up prompts and you’re good to go. It definitely beats visiting a store or carrying a Wi-Fi hotspot. It is, of course, particularly beneficial for T-Mobile, too; the carrier is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425022/verizon-t-mobile-att-phone-promotion-magenta-max-5g-c-band"&gt;looking to flex its relatively strong 5G spectrum holdings&lt;/a&gt; before Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T start catching up later this year with newly acquired C-band frequencies. Getting more customers to try the network and convert now would help it make the most of its 5G “lead.” But in any case, this is one of the easiest ways we’ve seen to try out a new network without ditching your current provider, and if you’re curious what T-Mobile service is like in your area, it’s not a bad way to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook announces Bulletin, its Substack newsletter competitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XdLlxKSY1z7DEsCgohXILrcVmzE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69519835/acasto_180123_1777_0003_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wQyY65"&gt;Facebook is getting into the subscription newsletter game. It’s launching a new service today, called &lt;a href="https://www.bulletin.com/"&gt;Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;, that allows writers to publish free and paid newsletters that can be posted to the web, sent to subscribers’ inboxes, and shared across Facebook. Perhaps the biggest perk for now: Facebook says it won’t take a fee from writers “at launch,” and writers retain full ownership of their work and subscriber list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kvMq4U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Malcolm Gladwell, Tan France, and Erin Andrews are among the debut writers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SbxrPr"&gt;The new platform is “focused on empowering independent writers, helping them reach new audiences and power their businesses,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a live audio call discussing the launch. At launch, Facebook has signed up Malcolm Gladwell, Tan France, and Erin Andrews, among others to cover a range of topics, from sports and finance to science and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tofYVs"&gt;Bulletin is a direct answer to the growing popularity of Substack and other newsletter products. Substack is used by a number of major writers, including Glenn Greenwald and Anne Helen Petersen, and the company has been courting talent with guaranteed payments. Twitter also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250156/twitter-revue-newsletter-acquisition-email-service"&gt;recently purchased Revue&lt;/a&gt;, another newsletter platform, though it hasn’t done very much to integrate it into the social network yet. Substack takes a 10 percent cut of subscriptions, while Revue takes a 5 percent cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fzAra"&gt;Zuckerberg says Bulletin is part of Facebook’s mission to continue growing its creator monetization tools. “The goal here across the company is to support eventually millions of people doing creative work,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMlsiU"&gt;Bulletin isn’t accepting signups yet. Facebook has brought on a number of writers for a beta period and says it will add more “over time.” It isn’t currently adding new writers, though.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Exposure notification apps could be more effective if they’re better at assessing risk</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Contact Tracing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5TThXBcRdZIpwz9X0T925XR31ag=/0x28:5435x3651/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69519617/1229459475.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8aU2lo"&gt;Joanna Masel is quick to recognize that the contact tracing apps built to track cases of COVID-19 aren’t as good as they could be. The apps, built on a framework offered by Apple and Google, aren’t used by many people in the United States and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22168473/coronavirus-contact-tracing-apps-exposure-notification-covid-google-apple"&gt;didn’t seem&lt;/a&gt; to make a big difference in the spread of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zr783g"&gt;But Masel, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona and advisor to the team behind the Arizona exposure notification app, thinks there are ways to make the apps more useful. In &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/risa.13768"&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; published last week with colleagues, she outlined one possible improvement: adjust the apps so that they could better recognize situations where people who are exposed to the virus have a lower risk of catching COVID-19. Then, they may not need to quarantine for a full 14 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqEjxv"&gt;“The possibility of this technology is way better than the best implementation so far,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUKS6Q"&gt;Most of the apps used in the US alert someone to a potential COVID-19 exposure if they were in the same area as someone who was potentially infectious for greater than 15 minutes. It’s a crude metric for figuring out how risky that interaction was, and recommendations from the app tend to be similarly broad: they instruct people to isolate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5UzIq"&gt;It’s possible to add more nuance to that process. Masel’s paper outlined a method for including information on where someone was in relation to a sick person, which could be a proxy for how much virus they may have been exposed to. Someone closer or directly in front of a person with COVID-19 would inhale more virus than someone a few steps back and to the side. Combined with other information (like how long the sick person had shown symptoms before the interaction, or whether the exposed person develops symptoms), the app could make more specific recommendations for how long the exposed person should isolate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Q5rLe"&gt;“The idea is personalized public health,” Masel says. Rather than treat interactions as equally risky, it could help people understand how serious their risk of contracting COVID-19 from an interaction was. “Then you have the ability to simplify it down to very straightforward things like get tested on day x, and stay home on day y,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqe5tD"&gt;The way Google and Apple set up the framework for the exposure notification system makes that hard, but not impossible, Masel says. It can be done using the privacy-preserving framework. Developers would have to combine different elements of available data (like the Bluetooth readings and the amount of time someone was sick) to figure out which interactions were more likely to result in infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YD9EOp"&gt;Providing personalized risk assessments and recommendations is one thing that exposure notification apps might actually be better suited to than traditional, manual contact tracing. “It’s too hard for content tracers over the phone to apply extraordinarily complex algorithms,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ5gcQ"&gt;Boosting the app’s ability to figure out the risk of an interaction could also make it more effective at slowing the spread of COVID-19. In the United Kingdom, where around a quarter of the population used an exposure notification app, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03606-z#Sec2"&gt;one analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that the program prevented hundreds of thousands of cases of the disease. Most of the benefits were concentrated in the few months after the app got an upgrade to its risk assessment function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKdM6B"&gt;Masel thinks the exposure notification technology, with modifications, could be useful even after the pandemic. COVID-19 isn’t going to disappear, and people will still get sick with it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22445906/social-end-pandemic-covid-adjustment-death-vibes"&gt;after the pandemic phase&lt;/a&gt; of the outbreak. Outside of an active pandemic, the apps may not ask people exposed to a virus to isolate — maybe they’d just encourage people to get tested or point them toward treatments, Masel says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qG0bsp"&gt;But the decision to keep the tech in place isn’t a public health call. Google and Apple said last year that they plan to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21234457/apple-google-coronavirus-contact-tracing-tracker-exposure-notification-shut-down"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; the exposure notification program after the pandemic ends, cutting off the resource for public health officials. Masel says that shouldn’t be their call. “Why is that decision Apple’s?” she says. “Apple and Google should not be making public health decisions. I’m not saying the decisions are lazy or that my views are the only views, but I don’t think that should be the decision-making process.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZ43pb"&gt;Instead, she says, experts should figure out ways to make the system better. Even the team behind the United Kingdom app doesn’t consider itself to have done the best possible job because it was created in a rush, Masel says. “We should have learned lessons on how to increase the uptake, and do better risk assessment, and designing user interfaces — we can improve on every front.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GitHub and OpenAI launch a new AI tool that generates its own code</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iFJizpoKHMw5A4ub9ZyVeK0Nr1M=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69519597/GitHub___Day_1_Keynote_NatFriedman_1_.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jbociH"&gt;GitHub and OpenAI have launched a technical preview of a new AI tool &lt;a href="https://copilot.github.com/"&gt;called Copilot&lt;/a&gt;, which lives inside the Visual Studio Code editor and autocompletes code snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ysVT8"&gt;Copilot does more than just parrot back code it’s seen before, according to GitHub. It instead analyzes the code you’ve already written and generates new matching code, including specific functions that were previously called. Examples on the project’s website include automatically writing the code to import tweets, draw a scatterplot, or grab a Goodreads rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VoIFNX"&gt;It works best with Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, and Go, according to a &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2021-06-29-introducing-github-copilot-ai-pair-programmer/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OmrBtU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A descendant of GPT-3&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bLDmqr"&gt;GitHub sees this as an evolution of pair programming, where two coders will work on the same project to catch each others’ mistakes and speed up the development process. With Copilot, one of those coders is virtual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ziYOan"&gt;This project is the first major result of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20703578/microsoft-openai-investment-partnership-1-billion-azure-artificial-general-intelligence-agi"&gt;Microsoft’s $1 billion investment&lt;/a&gt; into OpenAI, the research firm now led by Y Combinator president Sam Altman. Since Altman took the reins, OpenAI has pivoted from a nonprofit status to a &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/openai-shifts-from-nonprofit-to-capped-profit-to-attract-capital/"&gt;“capped-profit” model&lt;/a&gt;, took on the Microsoft investment, and started licensing its GPT-3 text-generation algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUHTGk"&gt;Copilot is built on a new algorithm called OpenAI Codex, which OpenAI CTO Greg Brockman &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/29/microsoft-github-copilot-ai-offers-coding-suggestions.html"&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; as a descendant of GPT-3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uAJOS"&gt;GPT-3 is OpenAI’s flagship language-generating algorithm, which can generate text sometimes indistinguishable to human writing. It’s able to write so convincingly because of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;sheer size of 175 billion parameters&lt;/a&gt;, or adjustable knobs that allow the algorithm to connect relationships between letters, words, phrases, and sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntJt31"&gt;While GPT-3 generates English, OpenAI Codex generates code. OpenAI plans to release a version of Codex through its API later this summer so developers can built their own apps with the tech, a representative for OpenAI told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMCXzb"&gt;Codex was trained on terabytes of openly available code pulled from GitHub, as well as English language examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wlz8Ze"&gt;While testimonials on the site rave about the productivity gains Copilot provides, GitHub implies that not all the code utilized was vetted for bugs, insecure practices, or personal data. The company writes they have put a few filters in place to prevent Copilot from generating offensive language, but it might not be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bROgTg"&gt;“Due to the pre-release nature of the underlying technology, GitHub Copilot may sometimes produce undesired outputs, including biased, discriminatory, abusive, or offensive outputs,” Copilot’s website says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ju7dkI"&gt;Given criticisms of GPT-3’s &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/for-some-reason-im-covered-in-blood-gpt-3-contains-disturbing-bias-against-muslims-693d275552bf"&gt;bias&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922"&gt;abusive language patterns&lt;/a&gt;, it seems that OpenAI hasn’t found a way to prevent algorithms from inheriting its training data’s worst elements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqhxIm"&gt;The company also warns that the model could suggest email addresses, API keys, or phone numbers, but that this is rare and the data has been found to be synthetic or pseudo-randomly generated by the algorithm. However, the code generated by Copilot is largely original. A &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/early-access/github/copilot/research-recitation"&gt;test performed by GitHub&lt;/a&gt; found that only 0.1 percent of generated code could be found verbatim in the training set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AngWSM"&gt;This isn’t the first project to try to automatically generate code to help toiling programmers. The startup &lt;a href="https://www.kite.com/"&gt;Kite&lt;/a&gt; pitches a very similar functionality, with availability on more than 16 code editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWVJ5g"&gt;Right now, Copilot is in a restricted technical preview, but you can &lt;a href="https://copilot.github.com/"&gt;sign up on the project’s website&lt;/a&gt; for a chance to access it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With xCloud on PC and iOS, cloud gaming’s next big moment has arrived</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UaS3q7ASTCeYSQ4IXEB8MbRSDCM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69519067/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="epFErZ"&gt;On Monday, Microsoft finally delivered two &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554267/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-pass-ios-iphone-ipad-pc"&gt;long-in-the-works updates for its Xbox Cloud Gaming Service&lt;/a&gt; (xCloud) that could mark a sea change for the future of cloud gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cdylrP"&gt;One is that xCloud games are now powered by custom Xbox Series X hardware, a major upgrade from the Xbox One S consoles that have powered the service since its launch in September. This means xCloud now has faster load times, less latency, and higher-resolution 1080p streaming. But perhaps more importantly, xCloud is expanding from Android to iOS and PC via the web for anyone in 22 countries with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXhtli"&gt;Taken together, the two updates mean that nearly anyone who has access to the service can play some of the biggest games on Xbox, including next-generation Xbox Series X games, right inside a browser across phones, tablets, laptops, PCs — and all for just $15 bucks a month, no $500 console required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dH4tDH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lHDrZRd7cBc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2PPlUk"&gt;I’ve spent some more time with xCloud since the custom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546139/xbox-xcloud-series-x-hardware-games-servers-datacenters"&gt;Xbox Series X server hardware&lt;/a&gt; started rolling out last week, and I’ve been impressed with the changes. Many games load quickly and look great on my MacBook Air or my iPhone 12 Mini. There is a small amount of latency, but it often isn’t too detrimental, especially if I’m playing something that doesn’t require fast reflexes or twitch aiming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Mfltz"&gt;I should warn you that xCloud doesn’t exactly replicate the experience of playing a game on a Series X. There’s only a tiny amount of latency when I’m playing on my console, and for a close race in &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4&lt;/em&gt; or a multiplayer match in &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, I want as little latency as possible. xCloud peaks at 1080p resolution, and while that’s as high as my main gaming monitor goes (yes, I am in the market for a Real TV), if you want to play in 4K, you can’t do that with xCloud just yet. xCloud’s selection of more than 100 games, while a lot, doesn’t offer everything I might want to play. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407849/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-epic-games-block"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; isn’t on the service&lt;/a&gt; and neither is Microsoft’s own massive hit &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApyZmB"&gt;While xCloud’s technology still can’t beat the responsiveness of playing on a console, what’s been more impressive to me is the way everything syncs from my Xbox Series X to xCloud because it’s all tied to my Xbox account. &lt;em&gt;Ori and the Blind Forest&lt;/em&gt; loads right where I left off near the end of the game. I can hop into &lt;em&gt;Nier: Automata&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;overworld just to hear the game’s excellent music. If I want to play &lt;em&gt;Psychonauts&lt;/em&gt; to bounce around the legendary (and unsettling) milkman level just for the heck of it, I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9xTGxl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With xCloud, it’s easy to sample games quickly&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lw4I7Y"&gt;I don’t have any of those games installed on my Series X right now, but with xCloud I can sample them all in the span of a few minutes right from my laptop or phone. And I could easily see myself testing something I’m interested in on xCloud before going through the process of installing a game onto my Series X for a full playthrough later. Browsing xCloud reminds me of cruising the vast amount of experiences in &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; in that it’s easy to jump into anything that piques my interest, and if I don’t like it, I can quickly move on to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rh0NqM"&gt;This ability to dip in and out of games from the cloud isn’t particularly novel. It’s also easy to move from game to game on the collections of titles available on Amazon Luna’s channels or Google’s Stadia Pro subscription. But those platforms want you to invest in &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; playing via the cloud, which I don’t always want to do. (And after a certain amount of time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;I’d probably hit a data cap&lt;/a&gt;.) xCloud, on the other hand, is more of an add-on to Xbox Game Pass that lets me play games that I already own or ones that are included as part of the subscription, and if I don’t want to play them streamed from the cloud, I can boot up my Series X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8snJoN"&gt;I’d also argue that xCloud has a major leg up on Amazon and Google by offering a far more impressive selection of titles. And with big Xbox games like &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; and Bethesda’s &lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;, which will both presumably be available on xCloud, the service will only become a better value. Stadia’s roadmap is more bleak, especially since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;Google shut down its in-house development studios in February&lt;/a&gt;. I’m not aware of any exclusive games in the works for Luna, and Amazon already has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/17/22389533/amazon-canceled-lord-of-the-rings-game-tencent"&gt;rather&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta"&gt;dismal&lt;/a&gt; track record with video games so far.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nRzyYK"&gt;I won’t be moving full time to xCloud gaming quite yet. The latency is enough of an issue that I think I’ll usually want to play Xbox games directly on my Series X. But after the upgrades to xCloud announced Monday, the service is an excellent perk to the already great Xbox Game Pass subscription that makes it easier to play Xbox games over the cloud &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547334/cloud-gaming-xbox-xcloud-microsoft-streaming-google-stadia-amazon"&gt;without having to think about it&lt;/a&gt;. The updates could be a big step toward bringing cloud gaming to more people after years of unfulfilled promise.&lt;/p&gt;
