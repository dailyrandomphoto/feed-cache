    <title>The best gaming TV to buy for the PS5 and Xbox Series X</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The latest TVs can really showcase what these consoles are capable of&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="NztlxY"&gt;We’re several months into the next generation of console gaming with the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. And if you didn’t upgrade the TV that you’re playing on &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; buying a new console — first off, congrats on finding one — now is as good a time as any. The latest 2021 TV models from LG, Samsung, Sony, and other companies are now shipping, and many of them are optimized for HDMI 2.1 and gaming features like variable refresh rate (VRR), auto low latency mode (ALLM), and buttery-smooth 120Hz action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAk1Ab"&gt;HDMI 2.1 was still experiencing early growing pains last year, with some TVs offering a mixed bag of features that omitted things like VRR or ALLM. But it seems like TV makers have done much better with their 2021 lineups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1BJFj"&gt;Our top picks for the best gaming TV for PS5 and best gaming TV for Xbox satisfy two main criteria: they stand out from the pack for their gaming chops and next-gen feature support, but they also put out a phenomenal picture for video entertainment like Netflix, Disney Plus, or whatever else you’re watching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zEUMFNw11NJZPLYyPF6hopwqPoM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470211/Screen_Shot_2021_04_26_at_8.41.29_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s G1 OLED is the best gaming TV for the Xbox Series X / S and PS5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zMvIRP"&gt;1. LG G1 OLED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bI7dCv"&gt;The absolute best gaming TV for the PS5 and Xbox Series X&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xY5p0W"&gt;Thanks to its more efficient inner workings and panel advancements, the G1 can get brighter than any of LG’s past OLEDs. This results in brighter HDR highlights for movies, TV shows, and gaming. But it still retains the perfect blacks and phenomenal viewing angles that OLED is known for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uw2yyP"&gt;In 2021, LG has also put a bigger focus on gamers in the TV’s settings menu. There’s a new “Game Optimizer” dashboard that provides quick access to settings like VRR — and you can pick between different game genres for the TV to automatically apply the ideal picture optimizations. Vincent Teoh at &lt;em&gt;HDTVtest&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/05meraExYc4"&gt;did a great review of the G1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5Olsl9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462536"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AVXos2"&gt;The G1 is meant to be mounted on a wall; it doesn’t come with traditional stands by default. But it sits practically flush with the included specially designed wall mount that efficiently routes attached cables, so the mounting process is definitely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="PW4LFD"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG CX was ahead of its time in how well it showcased the next-gen consoles. And yes, I know I need to mount it and get the soundbar out of the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jUPAVQ"&gt;2. LG CX OLED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7GwAgu"&gt;Best deal on a gaming TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LdxVq1"&gt;Last year’s CX-series OLEDs from LG were the best bet for people who wanted a TV that could get the most from their new PS5 or Xbox on day one. The CX line has since been succeeded by 2021’s C1 models, but I think “settling” for the 2020 LG OLED is a much smarter move for the money. You get all the key gaming features: 120Hz, VRR (including G-Sync and FreeSync), and ALLM. And every HDMI port on the CX is HDMI 2.1, which still can’t be said for some of 2021’s best TVs. That means you can plug in both an Xbox Series X or S and PS5 without losing any next-gen enhancements on either machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nmRlCu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462552"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5PFK2W"&gt;You’ll save a lot of money choosing the CX over something like the G1 or C1. And unless you’re a stickler for brightness, I think you’ll be very pleased with the fantastic OLED picture quality of last year’s mainstream LG set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="audHUQ"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tq-7QVKOY7dmwRW9Xa_IUK_-nVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217046/DSCF2777.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s QN90A, the best LCD gaming TV, has a Game Bar that includes important features for PS5 and Xbox gamers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hOYel4"&gt;3. Samsung Neo QLED QN90A&lt;br&gt;The best LCD TV for next-gen PlayStation and Xbox gaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRmKyc"&gt;Samsung’s new QN90A series is the company’s first TVs to use Mini LED technology, which swaps out the standard full-array backlighting system for a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; more smaller LEDs crammed into the same space. This results in dramatically better contrast, even higher brightness — and LCD TVs were already beating OLED here — and less “blooming” around white objects on a dark background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="O5pdBm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462562"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L2yXzC"&gt;Like LG, Samsung is also paying special attention to gamers this year with a “Game Bar” that lets you quickly adjust the screen’s aspect ratio (for a wider, more encompassing view in supported games), monitor the TV’s incredibly low input lag, and check to make sure other settings like HDR and VRR are enabled to help get the most from your new console. Samsung supports all the crucial next-gen features, but unfortunately, despite the QN90A’s premium price, the HDMI situation isn’t as good as I’d like: only one of this TV’s four HDMI ports is HDMI 2.1. That said, &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/tv-reviews/samsung-qn90a-neo-qled-4k-hdr-tv-review/"&gt;reviews paint the QN90A&lt;/a&gt; as one of (if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;) best LCD TVs on the market today. So if you’ll be gaming in a bright room and have the cash, it’s still a top recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="nRb9vy"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRdksmurtkGIFudd6F-n7wHydZY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464910/Screen_Shot_2021_04_23_at_11.42.52_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Vizio&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want excellent OLED picture quality for less than LG, Vizio offers the best cheap OLED gaming TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TEjc5v"&gt;4. Vizio OLED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QNTsw6"&gt;A cheaper OLED gaming TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="m7h5BK"&gt;Vizio’s first OLED TV has needed some firmware updates to resolve bugs and get to where it should be in terms of performance, but the company has done a good job of keeping at it in the months since the TV shipped last year. It’s now a fully capable next-gen gaming set with several HDMI 2.1 ports and all the key features (120Hz, VRR) checked off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WbNdEv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bA8ssG"&gt;Its input lag is a bit higher than LG’s, but not enough to become a problem unless you’re the ultra-competitive gamer type — especially when you consider how much less expensive Vizio’s OLED is compared to those from Sony or LG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="eOR6W7"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DEXn_PVqUavOSR-ibiai7xqqWHA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464931/TCL.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL’s 6-Series TV offers a nice mix of next-gen gaming features at an attractive price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oCzSSZ"&gt;5. TCL 6-Series&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gk3TLQ"&gt;The best budget gaming TV for the Xbox Series X&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="p9b52x"&gt;TCL’s 6-Series is the most affordable TV among our recommendations, but that comes with a trade-off: though this is a 4K TV, it doesn’t support 4K gaming at 120Hz. Instead, that fluidity tops out at a resolution of 1440p. (The Xbox consoles can take advantage of this resolution, but the PS5 currently cannot and falls back to 1080p for 120Hz gaming.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N80sV7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462612"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ousNRu"&gt;If you can live without 4K at 120Hz — and remember that many games reduce resolution to even hit 120 frames per second — you’re getting a terrific 4K HDR LCD TV with impressive local dimming, Roku’s intuitive software built in, and a price significantly lower than any of our other top picks for next-gen gaming TVs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get the Microsoft Surface Headphones new for just $82 at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FmVo6lpvWKyH_cxTZtxfiBUnU-U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69186658/jbareham_181114_3083_0085.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bqu74z"&gt;Microsoft’s first-gen Surface Headphones might not be the latest set of noise-canceling headphones, but they’re still a stellar value — especially today. They have good sound quality, USB-C charging, a comfy fit, and they can block out a considerable amount of noise. Today at Woot, you can get them new for just over $80. To get this price, you’ll need to download the Woot app (&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/woot/id571457538"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.woot.android.main&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;), then find the deal there. Doing that alone will save 15 percent on the price it’ll cost everyone else, &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13142085?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fmicrosoft-surface-headphones-10" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which is $96&lt;/a&gt;. These headphones used to cost $250 (and most competitors cost more than that), so you’re getting a good deal either way. If you have Amazon Prime, you’ll get free shipping on this order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N5Nl0g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10373885"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tcdJsZYVwcnrPjY_HZu2WoF6GH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989891/dseifert_201025_4263_0009.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sCXhYQ"&gt;Amazon’s latest Echo Dot smart speaker that’s more spherical than previous models (and better-sounding, too) is 40 percent off through Amazon, Target, and Best Buy. Normally $50, you can snag one for $30 in blue, white, or black. My colleague Dan Seifert noted in his review that these have “surprisingly good sound quality” and that it’s just as capable as other Alexa-powered smart speakers, but for a cheaper price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YrKvdp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="clNmTB"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522700/beats-flex-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;Beats Flex&lt;/a&gt; wireless earbuds are even easier to recommend when they’re $10 off, as they are now at Amazon. Normally $50, you can get either the all-black or the neon yellow colorways &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08L6ZYW21?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $40&lt;/a&gt;. These are Beats’ first headphones that charge via USB-C, which makes them a great set of earbuds for Android users. Though, if you’re on an iPhone, these can quickly pair to your device with its W1 wireless chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GbLGhz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591203"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s miniplayer for Facebook launches today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n-Z3dM5JzR2DtIRSyYKmQS5Apvg=/319x0:1420x734/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69186325/Boombox_banner_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify’s miniplayer will allow people to stream music and podcasts from their Facebook News Feed. | Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PTzO1j"&gt;Facebook is making it easier to never leave its app. The company’s partnership with Spotify is coming to fruition today in the form of a miniplayer for the News Feed that’ll allow people to play music and podcasts from within Facebook. Audio content can be shared from Spotify to Facebook, and once on Facebook, listeners can press play and listen to it even as they scroll around. It’ll be available on both iOS and Android and in 27 markets, including the US, at first. More will follow in the coming months. Users will also see the miniplayer on shared videos that have music in the background. A play button will surface after the video finishes where people can play the song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wS3Sf8"&gt;Facebook listeners will hear the shared track, and once it ends, Spotify will continue to play music on shuffle, as it usually does. Free users will hear ads, too. The ads will come directly from Spotify, but Facebook will receive “limited data” about users trying the integration, including subscription type and metrics to assess the miniplayer’s performance. It won’t use this information to target ads, Spotify says, and listeners will have to consent to the data sharing when they first start the player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9UoZoe"&gt;This partnership comes along with a larger audio push from Facebook. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391551/facebook-audio-podcasts-clubhouse-competitor-spotify-live-rooms"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; multiple new features last week, including its Clubhouse competitor Live Audio Rooms as well as shareable, short sound clips called Soundbites. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also emphasized an interest in podcasts, and this partnership is one way people will be able to listen to shows without sacrificing any Facebook time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom’s Immersive View could make video calls feel a bit more in-person</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/44KiOG5EevYrkeeFSUOVpeHSxeg=/45x0:1395x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69186353/Zoom_Immersive_View_Image.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Zoom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q8Bvsf"&gt;Zoom is rolling out a video background feature called Immersive View that could make video calls feel a bit more like an office meeting — or at least look a lot more like one. Zoom announced the feature last year at its &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/ucaas-platform-whats-new-for-meetings-phone-webinar-zoomtopia-2020/"&gt;Zoomtopia conference&lt;/a&gt;, but now it’s actually available for Free and Pro accounts attending meetings and webinars with up to 25 participants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X50q5s"&gt;Immersive View builds on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21173608/zoom-video-conference-how-to-virtual-background-greenscreen"&gt;virtual background features&lt;/a&gt; Zoom already has, but focuses on actually placing meeting attendees &lt;strong&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt; a realistic-looking location, rather than just switching out a flat background. Meeting hosts can enable Immersive View from the same menu where you can find Speaker View and Gallery View; from there, Zoom will automatically place attendees in a variety of built-in virtual scenes like a board room or auditorium, or the meeting host can manually place them themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9HWPGjvTvRUr_zzw-JE3nJf98rA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22466146/Screen_Shot_2021_04_23_at_4.11.13_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zoom&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoom includes some more out-there options for Immersive View backgrounds, including an art gallery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="18eQ9U"&gt;Zoom says hosts can also resize attendees, move them around the scene, and upload their own scenes if they get bored of Zoom’s options. Theoretically any image could be used as an Immersive View background, but Zoom says matching the &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/210707503#h_01ED77TMFJXBJGY9KKJBC916FK"&gt;file type, aspect ratio, and resolution recommendations&lt;/a&gt; it has for virtual backgrounds will produce the best results. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AXkCnrTLI2SrpGJZ_EDX5ZHgO5M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22466306/classroom_immersive.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Zoom&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoom originally introduced Immersive View with an example featuring students in a virtual classroom scene.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w3c4lg"&gt;Immersive View also features some notable limitations. For calls larger than 25 people, the remaining participants will hangout in a strip of video thumbnails at the top of the scene.  Also, for anyone not running the latest version of Zoom on desktop or mobile, the background will default to whatever setting it was on before Immersive View was turned on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdwXio"&gt;So if you’re not using an updated Zoom client, your friends could be meeting in an art gallery, but all you’d see is the usual grid of boxes, with black backgrounds behind the other attendees. Recordings of Immersive View meetings run into a similar issue; they’ll be recorded in Zoom’s standard Speaker or Gallery View, rather than a fun virtual scene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4noeqp"&gt;Zoom became &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21207053/zoom-video-conferencing-security-privacy-risk-popularity"&gt;the go-to video call service&lt;/a&gt; of the pandemic, but both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317526/microsoft-teams-together-mode-dynamic-view-new-features"&gt;Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189010/skype-together-mode-microsoft-teams-feature"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; beat it to background options like Immersive View. Microsoft updated both Teams and Skype with a feature called Together Mode in 2020 that places meeting attendees in the same virtual scene together, using computer vision to cut out faces and shoulders for easier placement in a virtual scene.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Luminar’s LIDAR will take flight in new partnership with Airbus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Prime Minister Markus Söder visits Airbus Helicopters" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cdx1xohsX9LXyfbPnnunYH6Pweg=/87x0:4893x3204/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69186212/1227702915.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Karl-Josef Hildenbrand/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YfPgSq"&gt;Luminar, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21398974/luminar-lidar-startup-spac-ipo-reverse-merge-blank-check"&gt;newly public&lt;/a&gt; LIDAR company, is teaming up with the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world to bring its laser-guided mapping and perception technology to new heights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYmUzu"&gt;LIDAR, the laser sensor that sends millions of laser points out per second and measures how long they take to bounce back, is seen as a key ingredient to autonomous driving. But it hasn’t seen as much traction in the world of aviation. Luminar and its new partner, the French aerospace giant Airbus, are out to fix that by applying the laser sensor’s 3D mapping capabilities to the aerospace company’s helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft in the hopes of making flying a lot safer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CGg3Mf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“making overall transportation safe and autonomous”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mFrA9Z"&gt;Specifically, Luminar’s work with Airbus will fall under the aircraft manufacturer’s two innovation-focused projects: its &lt;a href="https://www.airbus.com/innovation/innovation-ecosystem/airbus-upnext.html"&gt;UpNext subsidiary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.airbus.com/innovation/innovation-ecosystem/airbus-flightlab.html"&gt;FlightLab&lt;/a&gt;, which uses flight testing as the “principal means of achieving proof of concept for a variety of future technologies developed at Airbus.” Engineers from both companies will work together to “enhance sensing, perception, and system-level capabilities to ultimately enable safe, autonomous flight,” the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvNVn8"&gt;This will be Luminar’s first foray into anything outside the world of autonomous vehicles, Austin Russell, the founder and CEO of Luminar, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Russell said he sees linking up with Airbus as an extension of his mission of “making overall transportation safe and autonomous — it’s the same exact story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IrbKm4"&gt;While the number of airplanes that crash every year has been steadily dropping, helicopter crashes — like the one that killed NBA star Kobe Bryant in 2020 — are becoming more common. The rate of fatal helicopter accidents per 100,000 flight hours jumped from 2016 to 2018, according to data &lt;a href="https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/general-aviation/2019-03-05/fatal-helicopter-accident-rate-climbing"&gt;released in March 2019 by the US Helicopter Safety Team&lt;/a&gt;, a volunteer team of government and industry leaders. The number of fatalities per 100,000 hours also rose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBj7wj"&gt;Russell is convinced that Luminar can help prevent some of those fatal crashes. “A double-digit percentage of helicopter crashes happen by just landing on things like wires that are totally avoidable,” he said. “If you can actually just have a 3D map and see what’s going on hidden underneath you would be an improvement. Even some of the best pilots have a hard time being able to see these kinds of things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahlS6L"&gt;Luminar was founded by a then 17-year-old Russell in 2012 and counts among its backers Peter Thiel and Volvo, which will begin using Luminar technology to power autonomous driving in its cars &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248415/volvo-luminar-lidar-self-driving-highway-pilot-spa2"&gt;beginning in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Luminar also supplies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18144506/audi-self-driving-car-volkswagen-luminar-lidar"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16849422/toyota-self-driving-car-platform-3-lexus-lidar"&gt;Toyota Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, and it has announced partnerships with &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east-africa/mobileye-looks-build-its-own-lidar-drive-down-self-driving-costs-2020-12-15/"&gt;Mobileye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-30/daimler-isn-t-relying-solely-on-waymo-for-self-driving-trucks"&gt;Daimler’s trucking division&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhsI3X"&gt;In addition to making giant passenger planes, Airbus also has an interest in small, battery-powered air taxis that are commonly referred to as “urban air mobility.” These would essentially be small helicopters with electric powertrains that could be used for short-hop flights within cities, such as Manhattan to JFK airport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4j68lE"&gt;The aerospace company has funded several electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) projects over the years, including Vahana and CityAirbus. The former was an egg-shaped single-pilot eVTOL demonstrator, while the latter can carry four passengers and has a range of 60 miles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWmCHZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces new $1 billion North Carolina campus and $80 billion additional US spending</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BA4XXy5oykpjVDYUdVabyCqF1Qs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69186197/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HctfLO"&gt;Apple has announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F26%2F22403407%2Fapple-us-spending-new-north-carolina-campus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new spending plans&lt;/a&gt; for the US, including the establishment of a 3,000-employee “campus and engineering hub” in North Carolina and the commitment of an additional $80 billion in investment across the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVTPiv"&gt;Back in 2018, the firm said it would spend more than $350 billion in the US over the next five years, but today, it announced it is increasing that figure by 20 percent to $430 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuMnJs"&gt;“At this moment of recovery and rebuilding, Apple is doubling down on our commitment to US innovation and manufacturing with a generational investment reaching communities across all 50 states,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a press statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBGFeQ"&gt;And why not? Like many big tech firms, Apple has done &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/technology/tech-company-earnings-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html"&gt;very well during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, when other industries have suffered and investors have sought safe places for their money. The company likes to spin these investment announcements as a sort of largesse, but they are, of course, par for the course for a hugely successful and ambitious firm like Apple. As today’s press release notes, the $80 billion will go toward “direct spend with American suppliers, data center investments, capital expenditures in the US, and other domestic spend — including dozens of Apple TV+ productions across 20 states.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tA4QfA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple will invest in basic infrastructure like roads, bridges, and broadband&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rn2Ug4"&gt;The new campus in North Carolina is noteworthy and part of an ongoing trend among tech firms to look outside their traditional California homes. Google is currently &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/17/google-to-invest-1-billion-in-new-campus-in-new-york-city.html"&gt;investing&lt;/a&gt; $1 billion in a New York City campus; Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262149/amazon-helix-arlington-virginia-design-hq2-campus"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt; its second HQ in Virginia; and Oracle &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=oracle+move+headquarters&amp;amp;oq=oracle+move+headquarters&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2768j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last year it’s moving its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03fjHs"&gt;Apple’s North Carolina campus will be part of the state’s Research Triangle (named after the trio of nearby universities: Duke University, North Carolina State University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The company will invest more than $1 billion in the area and pledges to create at least 3,000 new jobs in “machine learning, artificial intelligence, software engineering, and other cutting-edge fields.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HlVqX"&gt;Notably, Apple also says it will establish a $100 million fund to support “schools and communities” in North Carolina and will contribute more than $110 million to 80 of the state’s poorest counties to help fund critical infrastructure like “broadband, roads and bridges, and public schools.” The Biden administration has made such infrastructure spending a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/economy/biden-infrastructure-plan.html"&gt;critical part&lt;/a&gt; of its plans for the US, but it seems that when government lags behind, private firms will step in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvD22z"&gt;You can read Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F26%2F22403407%2Fapple-us-spending-new-north-carolina-campus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full press release&lt;/a&gt; for further details, including the companies expanding hiring in its teams in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Texas, Washington, and Iowa, and its investments in new clean energy projects in the US and abroad. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These USB-C earbuds are a trojan horse for Deezer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/784Ijo0juGyEP5qgWaR7TYe2mA8=/157x0:1845x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69186013/deezer__2_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When used with a compatible Samsung device, the headphones launch a custom Deezer theme.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Deezer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FYRo3d"&gt;As part of a &lt;a href="https://www.deezer-blog.com/press/deezer-preinstalled-on-mobeek-hifi-earphones/"&gt;new partnership&lt;/a&gt;, Deezer will be available “pre-installed” on a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XX6ZYCK?ref=myi_title_dp&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new pair of USB-C earbuds from Mobee-K&lt;/a&gt; when they’re used with select Samsung Galaxy devices. Plugging the headphones into phones like the Galaxy S21, Note 20, or Z Flip effectively side-loads the music streaming service, without you having to visit the Google Play Store. It’s an interesting marketing tactic that could encourage listeners to give Deezer a try over bigger competitors like Spotify and Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVJZro"&gt;As well as offering access to the streaming service itself, Deezer advertises that syncing the earbuds with Samsung’s devices gives access to a “customized Deezer theme” which includes “wallpapers, exclusive playlists, and shortcuts to Deezer” via the phone’s lock and home screens. Galaxy devices going back to 2019’s S10 and Note 10 are supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSGsMb"&gt;If you’re not interested in giving a new streaming service a try, then the $22.70 headphones should still work with all of your other music sources. Mobee-K’s product listing advertises that they’re compatible with “most” USB-C devices, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inventive grandson builds Telegram messaging machine for 96-year-old grandmother</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3M1gR6q3YvOsfe5hkA--Ts-LopQ=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69185832/telegram_machine.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Yayagram looks and works like an old-fashioned physical phone switchboard. &lt;/em&gt; | Twitter: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/mrcatacroquer/status/1386318806411325440" target="_blank"&gt;@mrcatacroquer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yKcEPl"&gt;Making sure elders can keep in contact with children and grandchildren has never been more important in a time of global lockdown. That’s why Twitter user @&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mrcatacroquer/status/1386318806411325440"&gt;mrcatacroquer&lt;/a&gt;, Manuel Lucio Dallo, built the Yayagram — a DIY project that makes sending and receiving voice and text messages over Telegram a physical process just like using an old-fashioned phone switchboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0v5EU8"&gt;It’s important, of course, not to generalize about the ability of older generations to get to grips with new technology. But speaking from personal experience, I know my own grandparents struggled with the digital interfaces of modern phones and smartphones. They much preferred physical buttons and switches to apps and touchscreens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbMh2J"&gt;That’s why the Yayagram is so compelling (“Yaya” is slang for “granny” in Castillean, says Dallo, “a warm way to refer to your grandmother”). To send a message, the user physically plugs in a cable next to the recipient’s name. They then press and hold a button to record audio and speak into the integrated microphone. The message then appears on the recipient’s phone like a regular voice note. And when the operator of the Yayagram receives a text message, it’s printed off using a built-in thermal printer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VlZgMC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To send a new voice message you need first to choose the destination grandchild, the selection is made using a Jack connector, like the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cablegirls?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#cablegirls&lt;/a&gt; used to do! &lt;a href="https://t.co/raLdl0seDC"&gt;pic.twitter.com/raLdl0seDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Manu (@mrcatacroquer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mrcatacroquer/status/1386318820529217540?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="mH7dLk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And, what happens when you send a text message back to your Granny? Well, the Yayagram prints it on thermal paper so they can touch it and read it, like the old telegrams. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ljcRkBaBIM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ljcRkBaBIM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Manu (@mrcatacroquer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mrcatacroquer/status/1386318835968532482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lr8KQS"&gt;Dallo, who’s a senior engineer for software firm Plastic SCM, goes into some detail about how the device was made in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mrcatacroquer/status/1386318806411325440"&gt;this Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;. It’s powered by a Raspberry Pi 4, runs on Python, and uses several third-party software libraries to tie everything together. The microphone is a cheap USB one and the printer similar to those used in cashier tills. He notes that he chose to use Telegram rather than WhatsApp or another messaging service as it’s more open (and he doesn’t like Facebook).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f4vbIG"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;Dallo says his grandmother is 96 and lives with his parents in Burgos, a city in Spain where he also resides. He says he was inspired to build the device because of the pandemic lockdowns.  “Most of the grandchildren live outside of Burgos and because of covid movement restrictions they can’t visit us and her,” said Dallo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0Xtk6"&gt;Dallo adds that his grandmother is hard of hearing, which makes regular phone calls and video calls difficult. The Yayagram, by comparison, gives her the independence to make and receive messages by herself. “It empowers her and builds communication bridges with the rest of her grandchildren who are not lucky enough to live nearby,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDR0gX"&gt;It’s a fantastic project and you can see Dallo and his Yaya using the device below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DFaCij"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Pixel 5A camera sample leaks, hints at similar specs to the Pixel 5</title>

  &lt;p id="ljHMMa"&gt;Google seems to have accidentally shared a photo sample from its upcoming Pixel 5A, giving us some hints about what to expect from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;barely announced&lt;/a&gt; device. The photo appeared in an album posted alongside a &lt;a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/04/hdr-with-bracketing-on-pixel-phones.html?m=1"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about Google’s HDR+ Bracketing technology, which aims to reduce noise in HDR photos (via &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/23/our-first-potential-pixel-5a-camera-sample-looks-like-it-comes-from-a-very-familiar-sensor/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The EXIF data for most of the photos said they were captured by existing Pixel phones including the Pixel 5, Pixel 4A 5G, Pixel 4, and Pixel 4 XL, but in among them was one image apparently taken with a Pixel 5A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2MvhN"&gt;Google recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;confirmed the existence of the Pixel 5A 5G&lt;/a&gt; in response to rumors that the device had been cancelled. However, beyond confirming that the device will be available later this year in the US and Japan, it didn’t offer any more details about the phone’s specs or cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSjVsi"&gt;The image labeled as coming from a Pixel 5A has since been removed from &lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPILk1LAjCRKAx7mfmgr_QNQmJ4U6zqhiFTwL88eTsXic8tSeS7dfTiswq1C-nEjw?key=eHJpUFgxOVBNaHVjSFZDMFE3OE5aZmlUZ0d5R1lR"&gt;the album&lt;/a&gt;, but offered several details about the camera performance of the upcoming device while it was up. First is that it appears to have been taken with an ultrawide camera, which corroborates &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/22/google-pixel-5a-renders-leak/"&gt;previous reports&lt;/a&gt; that the 5A will have two rear cameras — a main camera and an ultrawide. That’s similar to the Pixel 4A 5G, while the Pixel 4A had just the one rear camera.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of the photo’s EXIF data before it was removed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cFpbQk"&gt;Its resolution is also listed as 12.2 megapixels, which is similar to the photos we saw from the Pixel 5. Although the sensor in the Pixel 5’s ultrawide camera is technically 16 megapixels, it produces 12.2-megapixel shots by default. The 5A’s EXIF data also shows it has the same f/2.2 aperture as the 5. Given that the photo was attached to a blog post about HDR+ Bracketing, it seems likely that the 5A will also offer support for the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxe0qu"&gt;Combined with previous rumors, it looks like the Pixel 5A could be a very similar device to last year’s Pixel 5. Reports suggest it’ll use the &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/21/google-pixel-5a-5g-chip/"&gt;same Snapdragon 765G processor&lt;/a&gt;, and have &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/22/google-pixel-5a-renders-leak/"&gt;a similar design&lt;/a&gt; with a 6.2-inch OLED display with a hole-punch selfie camera. Like Google’s previous A-series devices, however, the rear panel is expected to be made of plastic rather than glass, and the phone will also reportedly feature a 3.5mm headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qtQvBG"&gt;According to the leaked photo’s EXIF data, the photo itself was taken last October just before the Pixel 5 was released. Without official confirmation from Google there’s no guarantee it’s representative of the 5A’s final camera hardware, but the fact that the photo has now been removed suggests it wasn’t a simple labeling mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Video game industry wins first Oscar with documentary short Colette</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qib7IMgjm6ZjTnT56NdPGt23484=/0x0:780x520/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69185502/colette.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ixwc5U"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colette&lt;/em&gt;, a short film featured in the Oculus VR game &lt;em&gt;Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond&lt;/em&gt;, has won this year’s Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject). Presented by Oculus Studios and Electronic Arts’ Respawn Entertainment, and later acquired and distributed by &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, it’s the first time a video game industry project has won an Oscar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCUJ5Z"&gt;Directed by Anthony Giacchino, &lt;em&gt;Colette&lt;/em&gt; features a French Resistance survivor, Colette Marin-Catherine, returning to Germany for the first time since the end of World War II to visit a slave labor camp where her brother was killed. The documentary is presented in a traditional 2D format whether you watch it in the Oculus TV app or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cqgAxM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The real hero here is Colette herself.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pDCFsK"&gt;“The real hero here is Colette herself, who has shared her story with integrity and strength,” Oculus Studios director of production Mike Doran says in a statement. “As we see in the film, resistance takes courage, but facing one’s past may take even more. Allowing us to preserve this pilgrimage for future generations was a true act of bravery and trust. We hope this award and the film’s reach means, as Colette says, that Jean-Pierre’s memory, as well as all of those who resisted, are no longer lost in the ‘Night and Fog’ of Dora.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbSkag"&gt;“It’s true what they say: It really is an honor just to be nominated. And it’s an incredible moment to win. We’re humbled by this recognition from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and would like to extend our sincere congratulations to all of our fellow nominees. It’s a privilege to stand alongside you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jypwag"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163762/medal-of-honor-above-and-beyond-virtual-reality-vr-review-steam-oculus"&gt;was not well-received as a video game&lt;/a&gt;, with many reviews highlighting its huge system requirements and 170GB installation size — much of which was down to the inclusion of extensive historical and documentary footage. Now that one of those films has won an Oscar, the project may get more positive attention than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvwkNY"&gt;You can watch &lt;em&gt;Colette&lt;/em&gt; for free online &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7uBf1gD6JY"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2Fdeveloper-post%2F454929399107984%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus TV&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/nov/18/colette-a-former-french-resistance-member-confronts-a-family-tragedy-75-years-later"&gt;at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
