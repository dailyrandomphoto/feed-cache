    <title>Apple announces $549 AirPods Max noise-canceling headphones, coming December 15th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w5vxaUIbhtnHqnokMay3Am4fEcs=/44x0:1574x1020/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68477258/Screen_Shot_2020_12_08_at_8.33.23_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j0oG5H"&gt;It turns out Apple has one more major hardware announcement before 2020 comes to a close: after many months of rumors, Apple today unveiled its own over-ear, noise-canceling headphones. They’re called AirPods Max and come with the premium design you’d expect from flagship Apple headphones. They also come with a premium $549 and are set to go on sale December 15th. Preorders start today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCwr3m"&gt;By moving into the premium headphones space, Apple will directly compete with brands like Bose, Sony, Sennheiser, AKG, Bowers and Wilkins, and others that have years of experience and a long list of products between them. But Apple is riding the momentum of the AirPods and AirPods Pro, which have dominated the true wireless earbuds market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xuoFW"&gt;Apple has taken impressive advantage of the synergy between its hardware by introducing features like automatic device switching — AirPods and recent Beats products can switch between an iPhone, Mac, and iPad based on whichever one you’re currently using  — and, in the case of the AirPods Pro, a capability called spatial audio that replicates an immersive surround sound experience when watching movies and TV shows on an iPhone or iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YgzfBs"&gt;Apple’s Beats brand also sells higher-end headphones including the Solo Pro and Studio 3 Wireless, both of which feature active noise cancellation. More recently, with Apple firmly covering consumers invested in its ecosystem, Beats has showed a renewed interest in appealing to Android device owners; the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522700/beats-flex-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;Beats Flex earbuds&lt;/a&gt; have a USB-C connector instead of Apple’s proprietary Lightning port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvWbuS"&gt;Early December is an unusually late time of year for Apple to introduce new products. Today’s news was &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/03/applecare-memo-potential-hardware-announcement/"&gt;tipped last week by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which reported that Apple had sent out a memo to authorized service providers about imminent changes to AppleCare. In the days since, the long-in-the-works headphones have been viewed as the most likely candidate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iacwTk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hinge is about to become The Bachelor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HqSrWZIgI7IHLMEZj1OmTXBiXFE=/0x0:2923x1949/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68477041/hingestandouts.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Hinge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dsSklZ"&gt;Hinge’s newest feature takes a cue from &lt;em&gt;The Bachelor.&lt;/em&gt; In a new tab called Standouts, daters can preview potential matches’ responses to the dating app’s prompts and give anyone they’re interested in a “rose.” Users only receive one free rose per week, which refreshes on Sundays, so they’ll have to buy more to give them out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWMCeA"&gt;One rose costs $3.99, six cost $19.99, and 12 go for $29.99. Tim MacGougan, the company’s chief product officer, says the higher price point is meant to encourage scarcity and deep intention behind receiving a rose. If someone is potentially paying $4 to send a rose, you might weigh their like more heavily when deciding whether to like them back. (Any likes sent with roses are automatically sent to the top of people’s matches pile, meaning the sender will definitely be seen when people check their likes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CTmBn"&gt;“Because it’s so well-curated for the user, and because roses are so powerful at helping to reach people that you’re interested in and go on a date with them, these become tools that are worth purchasing if you want to find a relationship,” MacGougan says. “So that lives up to our mission of helping our users find relationships through both what we offer for free and what we offer to buy.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iXwWzqCB4dc7P_ey0qcmqFGitmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150427/Hinge_Standouts_Roses_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hinge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n9ZXeE"&gt;Roses can be sent from the new Standouts tab or from the usual Discover tab. The Standouts tab is refreshed daily with 10 new people, and only roses can be sent in this tab — not the usual likes. Roses can also be sent in the usual Discover tab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wh0mVL"&gt;The idea behind marking a certain like as more special than another isn’t entirely new. Tinder pioneered the idea with its Super Like feature, which accomplishes basically the same task, except with a less romantic context. It was only a matter of time until Hinge debuted this type of feature, given that both apps are owned by Match Group, and Match has been saying it’d better monetize Hinge for multiple quarters. Tinder is Match’s cash cow, so the company has a vested interest in diversifying and ensuring the rest of its dating app portfolio is as effective at making money.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit’s top post of 2020 was a Rick Astley photo, posted by Rick Astley</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8sgmIaxy7sc1W4zNH-fFJIavyJU=/0x0:1023x682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68477039/Screen_Shot_2020_12_04_at_9.12.15_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: RCA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7TibP2"&gt;Reddit shared today that its most upvoted post of 2020 was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/haucpf/ive_found_a_few_funny_memories_during_lockdown/"&gt;a picture from 1989&lt;/a&gt; posted by &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ReallyRickAstley/"&gt;Rick Astley&lt;/a&gt;, the living meme himself. Reddit’s Year in Review blogs can be a good insight into broader internet culture, and the site’s listing of the most popular topics of conversations certainly included the largest issue of the year: “COVID-19” was mentioned over 50.2 million times. But they also include other forms of virality as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPt3jp"&gt;Rick Astley is known for the single “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"&gt;Never Gonna Give You Up&lt;/a&gt;” from 1987, which was already a number one worldwide hit even before the music video for the song was used &lt;a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/an-oral-history-of-rickrolling"&gt;to create the rickrolling meme&lt;/a&gt;. Rickrolls were all the rage during the early 2000s web, and based on the interactions this r/pics post has received, even people who only know Astley as the guy who surprises you by singing “Never Gonna Give You Up” seem to have feelings about the artist. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c1N_k0ZSqumBf7rbmVT15ds0tEc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22146073/Screen_Shot_2020_12_04_at_1.01.09_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Reddit, Rick Astley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The most upvoted Reddit post of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZiUH8G"&gt;Following Astley’s, the second most upvoted post from 2020 was a short “story” posted in r/memes, progressively dunking on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/gyfedz/a_short_story/"&gt;a flat-earther’s changing YouTube video titles&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not as immediately nostalgic as a photo from the 80’s, but I think you’ll agree that clowning on people has a similar timeless quality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yM8dM-_Hk-TPvY_4iltydxaJUEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22146082/Screen_Shot_2020_12_04_at_1.06.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Reddit, rextraneous&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The second most upvoted Reddit post of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FpjZCW"&gt;The confirmation of Astley’s continued viral status comes not long after Reddit finally revealed that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754984/reddit-dau-daily-users-revealed"&gt;52 million users visit its site daily&lt;/a&gt; and that the number is growing. That’s less than other social platforms —  there’s a measly 406,000 upvotes on the Astley photo and 292,000 on the flat-earth meme — but the fact these were the posts active users wanted to push up the Reddit charts reflects an internet population looking for distraction from a bad year. It seems some people are feeling a bit nostalgic for a simpler time, online and off.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VanMoof X3: five months later</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3C9k7fVZN-_lCj3yarYNLVHIMRw=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68477026/DSC_0688.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A great e-bike, with caveats&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="5fFy5g"&gt;Five months ago yesterday, I took delivery of a VanMoof X3 e-bike. It’s up there as one of the more expensive personal purchases I’ve ever made, living as I do in Tokyo without any need for a car. But like a lot of other people this year, I felt moved to avoid public transport as the coronavirus pandemic intensified, and VanMoof’s latest models came at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhML48"&gt;I was pretty sure I’d like the X3. I’d &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/18/15657236/vanmoof-electrified-x-electric-bicycle-tokyo-japan"&gt;test-ridden the original Electrified X three years prior&lt;/a&gt;, when it was first released as a bike designed with Tokyo in mind, and I’d wanted one ever since. The $1,998 X3 is more powerful and more affordable, with a bunch of new features that sealed the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlYeWL"&gt;Five months on, I’m happy to report that I do indeed like the X3. But that’s not the same as being able to give a wholesale recommendation to everyone. More than maybe any other product I’ve ever ordered and owned, the X3 has made me feel like an extreme early adopter — even though this is the third version. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gOs9-TLz2A4fQ23TLterCJW176A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154071/DSC_0690.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xUNeAM"&gt;The X3 is essentially a smaller version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;S3 that Thomas Ricker reviewed back in April&lt;/a&gt;, with 24-inch wheels versus the 28-inch S3. The unremovable 504Wh battery is integrated into the frame, meaning you get a sleeker design than many competitors but have to plug the bike directly into an outlet to charge. Some of the key features include an automatic four-speed gearbox, a turbo boost button for a quick jolt of speed, and a kick lock on the rear wheel that secures the bike and activates its motion-sensitive alarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2bgUSb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The smaller size makes much more sense for Tokyo&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdL3xV"&gt;As far as the general riding experience goes, I mostly agree with Thomas’ impressions of the S3. I really like the design, including the integrated lights and lock. I’ve found the gear shifting to be smooth far more often than not, albeit with the very occasional clunk. The idea of an automatic gear box for a bicycle is sort of odd to me, as someone who prefers to drive manual cars, but you mostly forget about it when riding. While there are definitely times when you’ll find yourself in the “wrong” gear for your intended speed or level of exertion, you can normally force a shift up with a quick burst of the turbo button, or a shift down by just stopping pedaling for a few seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5GEG8"&gt;I am glad I got the X3 over the S3, and I say that as a six-foot-four guy who would probably look and feel more natural riding the larger model. It takes living with the X3 to realize how much more sense the smaller size makes for Tokyo. I appreciate it every time I park in a tiny alleyway squeezed between two Shinjuku buildings, or whenever I wheel it into my apartment’s elevator — which happens to be the exact length of the X3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avDxiw"&gt;Wheeling the X3 into my elevator is a pretty important use case, because I’d have no way to charge the thing otherwise. I live in a sixth-floor apartment that fortunately has a power outlet directly outside the front door, which is invaluable as a VanMoof bike owner. It would be much less convenient to have to wheel the bike inside every time I needed to charge it. Of course, it would also be much more convenient if I could just remove the battery myself and leave the bike downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ELOH1KMs-eBhl5IbyYCsUv3wy9c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154072/DSC_0700.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="EZjcYI"&gt;I haven’t attempted to carry out measured range testing because in practice, it isn’t really something I think about. I charge the bike once or twice a week and that’s fine for what I use it for. VanMoof claims between 60 km (37 miles) and 150 km (93 miles) of range depending on how hard you push the electric motor. I can say I’ve ridden a little more than 60km in a single day, using the turbo boost a lot to get to the other side of the city and return home quickly with about 12 percent battery remaining. But this is a bike designed for everyday use, and I think the point is really that it’s not going to unexpectedly die on you once you’ve worked out your charging routine. The caveat is how easy that will be for you and your personal living situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="IafIOI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I truly love riding the X3&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IzqfDD"&gt;I do have a few nits to pick. I found the Android app consistently more reliable than the iOS version, which I occasionally had to force-quit in order to get it to unlock the bike. The optional front-mounted metal basket (10,000 yen, or $89) looks good but functionally kind of sucks, with huge gaps between each “wire” in its “mesh.” (It did at least make me swear off plastic shopping bags once and for all, since all my groceries would just fall through the holes.) The dot-matrix display is also very much form over function, since it’s near-impossible to see in sunlight — especially set against the lighter paint option I went for on the bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2MAf8"&gt;The most important thing to say about the X3 is that I truly love riding it. It’s by far my favorite way to get around Tokyo and I use it whenever practical, including on journeys that I otherwise would never have considered a bicycle for. It’s often faster than driving or taking the subway, and it’s always a whole lot more fun than either option. It’s liberating to ride a vehicle that feels equally suited to roads and side streets, taking in the city at ground level as you travel. I’ve learned so much about my neighborhood and beyond this year just because it’s trivial to get anywhere within a 5-mile radius. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnPfqA"&gt;Overall, I’m happy with my purchase. Owning a bike like this has honestly made a huge difference to my quality of life, which is not something I would often say about the things that I buy. But I also feel lucky that things worked out for me, because that hasn’t been the case for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3FPvtKPRgM5osNN0aHfc_RGqEL4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154073/DSC_0692.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="QIZ5RV"&gt;I ordered my X3 on April 22nd, the day preorders went live. I was given a delivery date of June 27th, which wasn’t ideal, but I didn’t mind waiting for something that I knew I wanted. (I spent that period riding around Tokyo on Docomo share bikes that almost invariably turned out to have nearly depleted batteries upon unlocking, which did make me further anticipate owning a bike I could charge myself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfCIWV"&gt;While I was waiting for the bike to ship, I joined a Facebook group of other VanMoof customers, many of whom had also preordered an S3 or an X3. Alarmingly, a lot of people seemed to be receiving S3s in poor condition, with the boxes and bikes having been damaged in transit. It’s hard to know what proportion of people were affected by this, but VanMoof’s co-founders Taco and Ties Carlier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;confirmed the issue in a September interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, saying that the cheaper, smaller boxes initially didn’t offer enough protection. The company expected around 1 percent of bikes to have issues “important enough for a customer to give us a call,” according to Ties, but the actual figure ended up being “closer to 10 percent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6M1Edq"&gt;I was a little worried about what state my X3 would eventually arrive in, because it’s no small inconvenience to return something that large for repair or replacement. S3 bikes were being sent out ahead of the X3, and no-one in the Facebook group had reported receiving their X3 yet. Fortunately, I had no problems at all when my bike did show up. It was covered in protective foam, an additional measure VanMoof took to protect the bikes inside the box, and I couldn’t fault the condition it arrived in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CuhDRy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"VanMoof founders on S3 e-bike issues, delays, and new at-home support","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1RPDoX"&gt;It was, however, delayed from the initial June 27th date I’d been given. I got in touch with VanMoof in May to confirm the date, since I noticed my card had been charged, and I was told the June 27th date still held. On June 25th I got an automated email saying my order was “still on track and scheduled to ship within your delivery window,” but two days later I hadn’t received any shipping notification. VanMoof responded to another email on June 29th saying that they would “start shipping tomorrow,” and I got a shipping confirmation on July 4th. The bike ultimately showed up on July 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qhoSPh"&gt;This wasn’t a huge deal to me. There’s an unprecedented pandemic going on. Things happen. But I saw lots of online reports of far more extensive delays, and it’s clear that VanMoof didn’t have its supply chain and customer support altogether in place at launch. The company told us as much. It’s something to bear in mind if you’re considering ordering a bike and need it to arrive on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOiUGL"&gt;Once mine did arrive, all was good. The packaging was well-designed, if only for a bike protected in additional foam, and setup was easy barring one fiddly cable cover that took a lot of effort to attach. The X3 quickly became an important part of my daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmalZZ"&gt;Then in October I got a worrying email titled “Action needed on your VanMoof X3 bike.” I’ll just reproduce the body here for full clarity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JcPwrC"&gt;Hi Sam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWM0iB"&gt;We’re getting in touch because you own (or have owned) a VanMoof X3 bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tEBd0Q"&gt;Recently we’ve had some riders report that the bolts on the rear fender of their VanMoofS3 or X3 bike came loose in use. Upon further analysis we’ve ascertained that these incidents are linked to an early batch of bikes – where it appears that on some bikes, the rear fender bolts were not tight enough. This issue does not exist on later batches of bikes. Our initial analysis did not show that loose fender bolts could cause a safety risk to our riders. We are however now investigating what caused a serious accident involving a VanMoof S3. We have not determined what caused that accident to occur, but while we conduct that investigation we want to take further precautionary measures now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nYszb"&gt;Unfortunately, your bike with *frame number XXXXXXXXXX* came from that early batch (around 1,600 bikes). As an extra safety precaution, we’re asking you to have your rear fender bolts checked before your next ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1FZlGV"&gt;The email recommended that I go to a VanMoof brand store to have the fender bolts tightened, or take it to a regular bike mechanic. There was a link to a video showing what to do, and VanMoof offered to reimburse any repair costs. Not wanting to get involved in a “serious accident,” I took my bike to the Tokyo store, where the helpful staff took it to the back and gave everything a checkup. 15 minutes later I was back on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mcuDb"&gt;I should say here that I definitely would not have bought this bike if there wasn’t an official VanMoof store nearby. This fender issue was relatively simple to fix, if a little scary to find out about, but I don’t think many local bike shops here would have much idea what to do with the X3’s battery or automatic gears. This is a complicated enough product that I would never have risked the possibility of needing to ship it back. On the other hand, I appreciate that VanMoof stores in cities around the globe are even a thing in the first place. It made the X3 a much more viable option for me than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507889/fiido-d11-chinese-e-bike-review-price-us-europe-250w"&gt;some of the cheaper e-bikes&lt;/a&gt; you can find for sale online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaOnaT"&gt;Life with my X3 and its newly-tightened fender bolts continued. In November, however, I got another email from VanMoof alerting me to an upcoming change to its mobile apps that would remove the ability to change region settings. The default top assisted speed is 25kph, but there’s an option in line with US regulations that lets you boost up to 32kph. The email didn’t mention what the settings actually do, but a &lt;a href="https://support.vanmoof.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002099229-why-are-you-doing-this-?utm_campaign=201110_speedsettingsjp_en&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=201110_speedsettings&amp;amp;_ke=eyJrbF9lbWFpbCI6ICJzYW1ieWZvcmRAZ21haWwuY29tIiwgImtsX2NvbXBhbnlfaWQiOiAiUUNoNU1xIn0%3D"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; on VanMoof’s support site says that the move was made in response to some owners in the EU being stopped by authorities for being able to exceed the speed limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyCMtK"&gt;I’m not going to litigate the ins and outs of regional e-bike speed limits here, but this whole situation really struck me as an amateur move on the company’s part. The bikes should have just been sold with the appropriate speed settings for each region. You would probably not be very happy if you bought a car that the manufacturer unilaterally decided to restrict to your local highway speed limit after you bought it. VanMoof isn’t accepting returns over the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Hqb2mpIEgdmUYvghGk8iIMzRnI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154074/DSC_0695.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1bvkyi"&gt;The whole reason I’m writing this story is because it’s hard to get a sense of real ownership in a short review period, particularly when it comes to a product with the potential to have a major impact on your day-to-day life. Most of what Thomas wrote about the S3 applies to my experience with the X3, which is to say I think it’s a great bike and I don’t regret the purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGGg6c"&gt;But that’s not the whole story. It’s also the first $2,000-plus purchase I’ve made that involved shipping delays, feature removals, and warnings about potential bodily harm. I’m used to being an early adopter of technology — it comes with the territory in this job. However, I would have preferred a smoother onboarding experience with a product that I ride on actual roads next to real cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ccRgIe"&gt;VanMoof does have a great product on its hands, and the company has been open about the changes it’s making to the customer experience. I love my own X3 and can’t imagine a time when I won’t own a similar e-bike in the future. But I would just strongly advise potential buyers to work out which e-bike company is the right one for their own situation, bearing long-term service and safety in mind. While I’ve had an overall positive experience with my X3, it’s shown me that it may not be the right fit for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Christopher Nolan isn’t happy with Warner Bros. over HBO Max releases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sink Or Swim (Le Grand Bain)’ Red Carpet Arrivals - The 71st Annual Cannes Film Festival" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xf2YlAD_oOYaTdt9sHue_PjISvc=/0x0:5616x3744/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68476849/1268224692.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="54aCmL"&gt;Director Christopher Nolan has fiercely criticized Warner Bros.’ surprise decision to release its 2021 lineup of films &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;simultaneously on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, which he called “the worst streaming service.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AO4CZZ"&gt;“Some of our industry’s biggest filmmakers and most important movie stars went to bed the night before thinking they were working for the greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were working for the worst streaming service,” the director &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/christopher-nolan-rips-hbo-max-as-worst-streaming-service-denounces-warner-bros-plan"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He added that the studio “had an incredible machine for getting a filmmaker’s work out everywhere” but claims it’s dismantling it in a move which “makes no economic sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="stbgbY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s such controversy around it, because they didn’t tell anyone”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0t1sQb"&gt;Although Nolan has long been a fierce defender of watching movies on the big screen, his criticism of Warner Bros.’ decision appears to have a lot to do with how it was handled. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/business/media/warner-bros-hbo-max-movies-pay.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that major agencies and talent management companies associated with the 17 films were kept in the dark about the news until around 90 minutes before it was made public in an attempt to stop details from leaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oz1HwD"&gt;“There’s such controversy around it, because [Warner Bros.] didn’t tell anyone,” Nolan &lt;a href="https://www.etonline.com/christopher-nolan-reflects-on-tenet-release-reacts-to-warner-broshbo-max-deal-exclusive-157414"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;ETOnline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “In 2021, they’ve got some of the top filmmakers in the world, they’ve got some of the biggest stars in the world who worked for years in some cases on these projects very close to their hearts that are meant to be big-screen experiences. They’re meant to be out there for the widest possible audiences... And now they’re being used as a loss-leader for the streaming service — for the fledgling streaming service — without any consultation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2Q8lR"&gt;Films affected by Warner Bros. announcement include &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad, Tom &amp;amp; Jerry, Godzilla vs. Kong, Mortal Kombat, In The Heights, Space Jam: A New Legacy, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Matrix 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZI3dP"&gt;“There’s a lot of controversy,” Nolan added, “It’s sort of not how you treat filmmakers and stars and people who, these guys have given a lot for these projects. They deserved to be consulted and spoken to about what was going to happen to their work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EY94Gl"&gt;As well as ruffling feathers with a surprise announcement, Warner Bros.’ decision has also raised concerns about the amount of compensation filmmakers could get for their work. &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; notes that many contracts assumed that studios were trying to maximize box office profits, leading to potentially huge payouts for stars who get a portion of ticket sales. Under the new model, streaming subscribers may become a more important target for studios, with potentially big implications for pay packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foC1Y8"&gt;Nolan’s &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; was one of the highest profile films to go ahead with a cinematic release this year. Although the director said he was “&lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/11/christopher-nolan-tenet-box-office-thrilled.html"&gt;thrilled&lt;/a&gt;” with its box office performance, the film reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/09/tenet-mulan-global-box-office-numbers-struggle-domestically.html"&gt;struggled to make much of an impact in the US&lt;/a&gt; during its opening weekend. Many theaters across the country were closed during its release, while others were operating at limited capacities. In contrast, other high-profile 2020 films &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354593/mulan-release-date-disney-earnings-warner-bros-tenet-theaters"&gt;released on streaming services&lt;/a&gt;, or were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21437889/black-widow-delayed-release-date-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-streaming-mulan"&gt;delayed &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-54396415"&gt;entirely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe5MSm"&gt;Despite the upset, Nolan is confident that people will return to cinemas when it’s safe to do so, telling &lt;em&gt;ETOnline &lt;/em&gt;that “the movie theater experience will bounce back and be a very important part of the ecosystem long-term.” But big questions remain about how willing customers will be to pay for cinema tickets after getting used to watching these big releases from the comfort of their own homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlEvWz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VW-backed QuantumScape says its solid-state batteries will enable EVs to travel farther and charge faster</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UUYwMMuNlG-9e2ewLmgF_qGnZkg=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68476799/QuantumScape_Lab.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jxuh5L"&gt;After nearly a decade in operation, QuantumScape, a San Jose-based startup backed by Volkswagen and Bill Gates, is finally breaking its silence. In a virtual “battery day” event for investors, the recently public company announced that its “solid state” batteries for electric vehicles will charge faster, hold more power, and last longer than traditional EV batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XCpdZ"&gt;Solid-state batteries have eluded researchers for decades. Most EV companies use “wet” lithium-ion batteries, which use liquid electrolytes to move energy around. But these batteries can be slow to charge, can freeze up in subzero temperatures, and contain flammable material that can be hazardous in the event of a crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnlYr5"&gt;QuantumScape claims to have developed a production-ready solid-state battery with cells that are made of solid and “dry” conductive material. And while most startups pursuing solid-state batteries remain mired in the lab, QuantumScape says it will be ready to go into production in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zQvm87"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We don’t see anything on the horizon that’s going to be close to what we’re doing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Di6jwy"&gt;“We don’t see anything on the horizon that’s going to be close to what we’re doing,” said Jagdeep Singh, founder and CEO of QuantumScape, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzzXrM"&gt;QuantumScape says its solid-state batteries will represent a significant improvement over conventional lithium-ion batteries, enabling electric vehicles that can travel 80 percent further than an electric vehicle with a traditional battery. There are other advantages too. They retain more than 80 percent of their capacity after 800 charging cycles. They’re noncombustible. And they’ll have volumetric energy density of more than 1,000 watt-hours per liter at the cell level, which is nearly double the density of top-rate commercial lithium-ion packs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BC_F53T2ZK3R1pI7LVONxRULnFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22152274/QS_Singe_Layer_Pouch_Cell.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;QuantumScape&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;QuantumScape’s key breakthrough: a ceramic separator to replace liquid electrolytes. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SCpj5J"&gt;The key breakthrough is the use of a ceramic “separator” to replace the liquid electrolyte used in conventional battery cells to act as the medium through which positive and negative ions move around. It’s not like any ceramics that you may have at home, in so far as they are designed to be flexible, not rigid. Energy can continue to move throughout the cell in extremely cold temperatures of -30 degrees Celsius — a temperature that renders other solid-state designs inoperable or seriously degrades wet lithium-ion batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHLgQu"&gt;The separator is around the size of a playing card and as thin as a human hair. “At the heart of it all is this new separator,” Singh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4JDwo"&gt;QuantumScape says its batteries last a real long time, perhaps “hundreds of thousands of miles of driving,” by eliminating the “side reaction” between the liquid electrolyte and the carbon in the anode of the conventional lithium-ion cells. And the batteries will charge at a much faster rate too, up to 80 percent capacity in just 15 minutes, an amount that typically takes 40 minutes or longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vcT79K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Electric cars could use another big battery breakthrough — this CEO says he’s got it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/16/17695866/henrik-fisker-solid-state-batteries-electric-cars"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="H15dzx"&gt;Solid-state lithium metal batteries are considered “the holy grail” in the battery industry, said Venkat Viswanathan, an associate professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and a technical advisor to QuantumScape. He pointed out that Stan Whittingham, key figure in the development of lithium-ion batteries and a winner of the &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2019/whittingham/facts/"&gt;2019 Nobel Prize in chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/192/4244/1126"&gt;published a paper in 1976&lt;/a&gt; about lithium metal anodes, calling it the “basis for a new battery system.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfOCIX"&gt;“This problem is over 40 years old,” Viswanathan told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If lithium metal batteries are successful, this would mean that for mass-market EVs, for the same weight of the battery pack, you can get about 50 percent additional range for EV or additional battery time in the context of consumer electronics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGSvwt"&gt;Whittingham himself is endorsing QuantumScape’s solid-state batteries. In a statement, Whittingham described the hardest part about making a working solid-state battery is “the need to simultaneously meet the requirements of high energy density (1,000 Wh/L), fast charge (i.e., high current density), long cycle life (greater than 800 cycles), and wide temperature-range operation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVkWB1"&gt;“This data shows QuantumScape’s cells meet all of these requirements,” he continued, “something that has never before been reported.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qvwNC4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This problem is over 40 years old”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dSBG1A"&gt;Singh said that consumer electronics like smartphones and laptops would be an obvious application for solid-state batteries, but the demand for the technology is far greater in the auto industry, which is in the midst of a seismic shift away from combustion engines and toward batter-powered propulsion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRD7h2"&gt;“Ordinarily, I would say that we would be pursuing this space as well for consumer devices because, you know, it’s easier,” Singh said. “But we’re finding so much demand. The automotive case is so massive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="25fO47"&gt;QuantumScape, which was spun out from Stanford University in 2010, has formed &lt;a href="https://themobilist.medium.com/vw-one-ups-tesla-with-a-revolutionary-battery-breakthrough-be51849ea092"&gt;a joint venture with VW&lt;/a&gt; to produce solid-state battery cells for the German automaker’s electric vehicles, and eventually for other carmakers. The deal isn’t exclusive: VW’s recently released ID 4 electric SUV will initially use batteries made by South Korea’s LG Chem, before eventually shifting to ones produced by SK Innovation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BwPg11"&gt;QuantumScape recently became &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-quantumscape-m-a-kensington/vw-backed-u-s-battery-maker-quantumscape-to-go-public-at-3-3-billion-valuation-idUSKBN25U1JH"&gt;publicly traded after completing its reverse merger&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special acquisition company&lt;/a&gt; called Kensington Capital Acquisition. The deal was received well by investors. At a recent price of $42.50 a share, QuantumScape stock is valued at roughly $19 billion, making it one of the top five most valuable automotive suppliers in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHuVyJ"&gt;The race to achieve huge improvements in battery technology is one of the most expensive and hotly contested on the planet right now. Practically every automaker is betting that electric vehicles will be the future, with some of the largest countries (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;largest auto markets&lt;/a&gt;) in the world moving to phase out gas-powered cars and trucks. To ensure that shift, batteries need to more powerful, last longer, and be cheaper to make in order to attract entice enough customers to make the switch to battery-powered vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtMmon"&gt;QuantumScape will be going head-to-head with some of the biggest and best capitalized companies in the world, including China’s CATL (valued at $85 billion), LG Chem ($62 billion), Samsung ($37 billion), Panasonic ($33 billion), and most recently, Tesla ($608 billion). Elon Musk’s electric car company recently announced that it would begin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449238/tesla-electric-car-battery-tabless-cells-day-elon-musk"&gt;manufacturing its own battery cells&lt;/a&gt;, and even mine its own lithium, in a massive effort to drive down the cost of its electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwYLwH"&gt;Singh said he’s aware that his competition will be fierce. But there’s no reason why QuantumScape’s current rivals won’t become future customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LohWcC"&gt;“Tesla, probably even more than any other company, is completely opportunistic,” Singh said. “If this battery works, they’re gonna want to use it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azOj7u"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s SmartThings can finally control your Google Nest devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/anxbVe1gVD-MHpDhle6PYRBNVE0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68476647/dseifert_201115_4301_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yJB0r7"&gt;Google and Samsung are bringing their smart home platforms together for the first time. Samsung’s SmartThings will support Google Nest devices starting in January 2021, building a bridge between one of the industry’s leading ecosystems for managing smart devices like cameras and thermostats with one of the leading companies developing those products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkeSPv"&gt;Prior to this, owners of devices that qualified for the “Works With SmartThings” (WWST) certification had to use separate software to manage any Google Nest products they owned. Following the launch of the integration next month, all Nest products will be controllable from the SmartThings platform and will qualify as WWST devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NVyU7F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google Nest devices can be managed from the SmartThings app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IsaduM"&gt;The partnership further bolsters Samsung’s smart home platform, which is one of the leading hub makers for managing smart home devices on the same network. Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/14/6004013/samsung-buys-smartthings-to-gain-a-foothold-in-home-automation"&gt;purchased SmartThings in 2014 for $200 million&lt;/a&gt; due to the company’s proficiency at helping smart home products communicate across various protocol standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgAaGs"&gt;Since then, SmartThings has grown to &lt;a href="https://www.smartthings.com/products"&gt;support thousands of products&lt;/a&gt; as Samsung has pushed to integrate the platform with virtually every smart home brand on the market, with Google remaining a notable exception until today. Samsung says its platform now has more than 120 certified brands and more than 63 million active users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mE1vz"&gt;Samsung says its new Google partnership means Nest devices can be incorporated into SmartThings Scenes for setting up automated controls for multiple devices at the same time, and the integration will also mean Samsung TVs and its Family Hub fridge will support streaming from Nest cameras and other devices. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="pLAjaz"&gt;The Australian white supremacist who killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand was radicalized by YouTube, according to &lt;a href="https://christchurchattack.royalcommission.nz/the-report/"&gt;a 792-page report&lt;/a&gt; on the March 2019 shooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmwIax"&gt;“What particularly stood out was the statement that the terrorist made that he was ‘not a frequent commentator on extreme right-wing sites and YouTube was a significant source of information and inspiration’,” said Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s Prime Minister, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/dec/08/christchurch-shooting-royal-commission-report-to-be-released-live?page=with:block-5fcee6ea8f084f47a8a41296#block-5fcee6ea8f084f47a8a41296"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; “This is a point I plan to make directly to the leadership of YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gEWAm"&gt;This is not the first time YouTube has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/8/28/20836019/youtube-ceo-quarterly-letter-radicalization-pipeline"&gt;linked to radicalization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/mbzzzx/youtube-decides-to-leave-neo-nazi-propaganda-online"&gt;white supremacist content&lt;/a&gt;. There has been an ongoing argument about whether YouTube’s algorithm pushes people &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html"&gt;toward more extreme views&lt;/a&gt; over time. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/30/critics-slam-youtube-study-showing-no-ties-to-radicalization.html"&gt;Although this is not a universal conclusion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/how-youtubes-algorithm-distorts-truth"&gt;some researchers say&lt;/a&gt; that the combination of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/19/17876892/youtube-extremism-report-rebecca-lewis-data-society"&gt;a business model that rewards edgy content&lt;/a&gt; and a personalized algorithm meant to keep viewers hooked is a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/youtube-politics-radical.html"&gt;recipe for radicalization&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKHQLs"&gt;The YouTube citations are part of a larger inquiry into the hate crime to see if it could have been prevented. The shooter &lt;a href="https://christchurchattack.royalcommission.nz/the-report/part-6-what-public-sector-agencies-knew-about-the-terrorist/evaluation-of-what-public-sector-agencies-did-with-the-information-they-had-about-the-individual/"&gt;sent an email&lt;/a&gt; to Parliament, the Prime Minister’s office, and news outlets eight minutes before he began his attack, according to the report. His manifesto was attached to the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HT1RwS"&gt;The authorities weren’t the only ones the shooter alerted. His manifesto was also posted to 8chan, &lt;a href="https://splinternews.com/meet-the-man-keeping-8chan-the-worlds-most-vile-websit-1793856249"&gt;a message board that often hosts far-right content&lt;/a&gt;; included in the post was a link to a Facebook page, where the poster said a livestream of the attack would be broadcast. (Facebook later removed the page and video.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w17pnw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The shooter also modified his firearms before the attacks using YouTube tutorials&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uipKCb"&gt;A 17-minute video that appeared to show the shooting was uploaded to Facebook YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266859/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media-manipulation"&gt;The video and the manifesto were mirrored worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and re-uploaded to platforms repeatedly over the following days, often faster than platforms could take them down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keau0x"&gt;The report &lt;a href="https://christchurchattack.royalcommission.nz/the-report/firearms-licensing/general-life-in-new-zealand/"&gt;goes on to say&lt;/a&gt; that though the shooter frequented far-right message boards on 4chan and 8chan, the evidence shows a more substantial use of YouTube. The shooter also  modified his firearms before the attacks using YouTube tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h83SCS"&gt;The shooter also used his Facebook account to discuss Adolph Hitler’s &lt;em&gt;Mein Kampf, &lt;/em&gt;particularly the parts about propaganda that could draw in new extremists, in a group called The Lads Society Season Two. He often posted Islamophobic rhetoric in the group, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now use Waze on CarPlay’s home screen instead of flipping between apps while driving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo showing CarPlay Dashboard with Waze showing directions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P1EO1ZuMtd6WBDDy3fg3DBYbs80=/0x0:2200x1467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68476259/20201208_Mitchell_Clark_Verge_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hlh2tm"&gt;If you use Waze and ever needed to take your eyes off the road to control your music alongside your maps, a new update is starting to roll out that should let you spend more time driving and less time fiddling with that touchscreen. &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; is reporting that &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/06/waze-carplay-dashboard-goes-live/"&gt;Waze has started rolling out&lt;/a&gt; Apple CarPlay Dashboard support, which will allow you to see directions on CarPlay’s home screen, alongside media controls, calendar events, and more. When I heard about it, I ran out to my car and sure enough, Waze’s directions showed up on the home screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Apple CarPlay with Waze directions on the left half and top right of the screen, and media controls in the bottom left" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ovvaa1ZZonqS_DZccSkQ065K3gc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22153560/IMG_0241.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Waze directions and music controls, all on one screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cUVvUV"&gt;The company started beta testing the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591151/waze-carplay-split-view-dashboard-apple"&gt;late last month&lt;/a&gt;, but CarPlay Dashboard has been around for Apple Maps users since the launch of iOS 13 (though it’s only been open to third-party developers since iOS 13.4). The integration is a win for driving safety, as the golden rule for car UI is basically “look at and touch the screen as little as you possibly can.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwyfBf"&gt;Before this update, if you wanted to change the song that was playing, you’d have to go to the Music app, press the next button, then make your way back to Waze. That could be anywhere from 3 to 6 taps on the screen, depending on if Waze was in the app launcher on the side. That’s a lot, especially if you’re going 70 miles an hour. Now, you can have both Waze, the next turn you need to take, and the music controls on the same screen, and changing the song will only take one tap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cYiwL"&gt;In keeping with the safety theme, the update also includes lane guidance, a feature that lets you know in advance what lane you should be in for your next turn or freeway exit. This should help reduce those “I have to be four lanes over in a quarter mile” moments that trip me up on occasion. Happy (and safe) driving!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia will let all users livestream games directly to YouTube tomorrow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d0zhwxV8Jt91kcL208LFAOYm6Qg=/0x0:1475x983/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68475868/stadia.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jvALho"&gt;From the very beginning, Google Stadia and YouTube were supposed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18274184/google-stadia-youtube-streaming-future-gaming-cloud"&gt;to work together&lt;/a&gt; — thanks to the magic of cloud computing, you’d be able to click a YouTube ad to instantly begin playing a game, YouTubers would be able to invite their viewers to instantly join their game, and — perhaps most importantly — creators would be able to instantly, effortlessly be able to livestream their Stadia games to YouTube just by pressing a button on the controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKvmnJ"&gt;None of those things happened at Stadia’s launch last November, but the biggest one is apparently arriving tomorrow: every Stadia user will be able to livestream directly to YouTube starting tomorrow, a representative confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FX6kPM"&gt;This afternoon, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/07/stadia-youtube-streaming-rollout/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;noticed&lt;/a&gt; that the feature appeared to be rolling out, and we spotted the ability to link a YouTube account in our Stadia accounts as well — though not the ability to actually stream yet. I guess we’ll try that tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wyI6QqpcHzBw5rNHI0j_QeHPpEs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22153571/stream_to_youtube_stadia.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Zu9VPy"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll still have to give your stream a title and tweak a few settings, like whether your stream is appropriate for kids (to comply with children’s protection rules). It’s also not clear whether you’ll be able to stream in 4K quite yet, as Stadia originally promised. You’d also likely need a $9.99 a month Stadia Pro subscription for that, like you do for 4K gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uJJSt"&gt;The feature couldn’t come at a more important time for Stadia: the service’s most important game yet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is arriving this week, at a time when next-gen consoles and the latest graphics cards to build your own powerful PC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;are incredibly difficult and expensive to buy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575100/google-stadia-one-year-anniversary-cloud-gaming-cyberpunk-2077-launch-test"&gt;biggest test for Stadia yet&lt;/a&gt;, and one the company is banking on: buying &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk &lt;/em&gt;on the service comes with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/19/21572301/cyberpunk-2077-google-stadia-free-premiere-kit-preorder-deal"&gt;a full set of free Stadia hardware for a limited time&lt;/a&gt; — not unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558820/youtube-premium-subscribers-free-stadia-premiere-edition-bundle-deals"&gt;the set it gave free to YouTube Premium subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpFaHl"&gt;People streaming &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; from Stadia to YouTube could be the single biggest opportunity yet for Google to prove what its service can do.&lt;/p&gt;
