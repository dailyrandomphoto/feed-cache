    <title>Ghost of Tsushima is getting a movie adaptation from the director of John Wick</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wr6rw9"&gt;Sony and Sucker Punch’s PlayStation 4 hit &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; is being adapted into a movie with John Wick director Chad Stahelski at the helm, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/sony-playstation-productions-ghost-of-tsushima-movie-john-wicks-chad-stahelski-directing-1234721342/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; first reported on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Sony confirmed the film’s development &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/03/25/a-ghost-of-tsushima-movie-is-in-the-works/#sf244299110"&gt;in a blog shortly after&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbXueC"&gt;The game, which stars samurai warrior Jin Sakai as he fights a huge Mongol army to protect the island of Tsushima, is heavily inspired by classic samurai films like those from Akira Kurosawa, so it seems like natural fit for the big screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4iYhvy"&gt;“We’re excited to be partnering with Chad and 87Eleven Entertainment, to bring their vision of Jin’s story to the big screen,” said Asad Qizilbash, head of PlayStation Productions, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;. “We love working with creative partners like Chad, who have a passion for our games, ensuring we can create rich adaptations that will excite our fans and new audiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruEndz"&gt;“We are happy to partner with Sony Pictures to make this happen,” Nate Fox, game director at Sucker Punch, said in a statement on the PlayStation blog. “And Jin is in very good hands with the film’s director. Chad Stahelski created something special with &lt;em&gt;John Wick&lt;/em&gt;. His vision for what could be, backed up by years of experience, combined to create some of the finest action scenes ever created. If anyone could bring to life the razor-sharp tension of Jin’s katana combat, it’s Chad Stahelski.” Fox also confirmed that the &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; game has sold 6.5 million copies since its release last July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcIDxW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; is Sony’s latest game franchise to be adapted into a movie. Tom Holland is starring as Nathan Drake in a movie adaption of the &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt;-like &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; series that’s &lt;a href="https://collider.com/uncharted-movie-release-date-2022/"&gt;set to release on February 11th, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Sony’s upcoming big-screen take on &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22153341/metal-gear-solid-movie-oscar-isaac-solid-snake"&gt;will star Oscar Isaac as Solid Snake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbbDJx"&gt;Sony is also working on a TV adaptation of &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us &lt;/em&gt;for HBO, which will star &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277687/mandalorian-star-pedro-pascal-joel-hbo-the-last-of-us-tv-show"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian’s&lt;/em&gt; Pedro Pascal as Joel&lt;/a&gt; and Bella Ramsey, known for her role as Lyanna Mormont in &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277372/the-last-of-us-ellie-game-of-thrones-bella-ramsey-hbo-lyanna-mormont"&gt;as Ellie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Your million-dollar NFT can break tomorrow if you’re not careful</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lRtqJEcC9_WcsMkUsIG5LoDS1gw=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69024754/VRG_ILLO_4489_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Without maintenance, an NFT’s art could disappear&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="S0Au5z"&gt;Open up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;the $69 million NFT&lt;/a&gt; that Beeple sold at Christie’s, and you won’t find much. The name of the artwork isn’t there. The name of the artist is missing. And crucially, you won’t even find the actual piece of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEl9jj"&gt;That’s not a flaw in Beeple’s NFT — it’s just how the system works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCGdNm"&gt;It turns out, the house of cards that is the NFT system is even more precarious than it first appears. NFTs are fundamentally built on trust — trust that a seller won’t screw you over, trust that these tokens magically have value — and that holds true even at the deepest level of the system. Ultimately, you’re buying a collection of metadata defining what you own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="z2AoPw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s an awfully expensive 404 error for buyers of these NFTs.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aIlf3j"&gt;But there’s one significant gap in the system ensuring that an NFT is held together: NFTs use &lt;em&gt;links &lt;/em&gt;to direct you to somewhere else where the art and any details about it are being stored. And as anyone who has browsed the internet before should know, links can and do die. So what happens if your NFT breaks down and points to nothing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8IQUF"&gt;“That’s an awfully expensive 404 error for buyers of these NFTs,” Aaron Perzanowski, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University and co-author of&lt;em&gt; The End of Ownership&lt;/em&gt;, wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4M8SMt"&gt;NFTs are digital tokens used to buy and sell digital art. But unlike a painting, which can be placed in a buyer’s home, an NFT is more like a piece of paper saying you own something — generally, a digital illustration or a video. Sometimes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;a weird-looking cat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="Xq62cC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XeZqHb"&gt;The system usually relies on the Ethereum blockchain, which ensures a few things: it keeps an unalterable record of everyone who has owned the NFT, and it keeps the NFT from ever changing. That means someone who buys an NFT and then resells it can’t misrepresent what they own. It’s all there in the NFT, just how it was when they bought it. You can think of it like the papers that authenticate a thoroughbred: they’re not the horse, but they certify the provenance and history of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Seb2x8"&gt;Very little data is stored directly inside an NFT, though. The NFT includes information on where you can &lt;em&gt;find &lt;/em&gt;a description of the artist’s name and the title of the work, but that information is not typically on the blockchain itself. NFTs include information on where you can &lt;em&gt;find &lt;/em&gt;the artwork they represent, but the actual artwork is still a link away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="US3RZY"&gt;Traditional URLs pose real problems for NFTs. The owner of the domain could redirect the URL to point to something else (leaving you with, perhaps, a million-dollar Rickroll), or the owner of the domain could just forget to pay their hosting bill, and the whole thing disappears. The animation that Grimes sold for $389,000 is &lt;a href="https://api.niftygateway.com/warnymphvolume1/27300010001/"&gt;primarily sourced&lt;/a&gt; to a pair of traditional URLs, which could break down if either of the two different companies (Nifty Gateway, the auction site; or Cloudinary, the web host) went under. As the buyer, this is something you’d have no control over, unless you’re wealthy enough to buy out the entire domain and pay to keep it online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="us7vX5"&gt;To solve that problem, many NFTs turn to a system called IPFS, or InterPlanetary File System. Rather than identifying a specific file at a specific domain, IPFS addresses let you find a piece of content so long as &lt;em&gt;someone &lt;/em&gt;somewhere on the IPFS network is hosting it. Grimes’ NFT uses this as a backup, and &lt;a href="https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz"&gt;Beeple’s NFT&lt;/a&gt; uses this primarily. That means a multitude of hosts, rather than a single domain owner, could be ensuring these files remain online. This system also gives buyers control. They can pay to keep their NFT’s files online. They still have to remember to pay the hosting bill, but they can host it anywhere in the IPFS network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tC3jyu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“One hard drive crashing could lead to permanent loss of the assets.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kcx5Gv"&gt;Still, the system has flaws. The team behind Check My NFT has been looking inside of NFTs to see if their IPFS addresses actually work, and in several cases, they’ve found files that just won’t load. The team found artworks that were temporarily missing from major artists, including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CheckMyNFT/status/1369802069729812483"&gt;Grimes, deadmau5, and Steve Aoki&lt;/a&gt;. The files came back online eventually, but only after the team called attention to their absence. The files have to be actively available on the network for the system to work, and unlike with a domain owner, no host has a singular responsibility to do that for files on IPFS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4njrj"&gt;“One hard drive crashing could lead to permanent loss of the assets,” the Check My NFT team warned in a message to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6dDlJ7"&gt;Like a painting, NFTs need to be maintained. If a buyer purchases an NFT that relies on IPFS, it’ll ultimately be on them to ensure the file continues to be hosted and available to the system. If the NFT relies on a traditional URL, then buyers would be in a more precarious position, having to hope that whatever third party currently hosts the file — often the auction site, like with Grimes’ NFT — stays online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpzeDx"&gt;So there’s a very real chance that, some years from now, an NFT will point to a missing file. If that’s the case, how do you prove what it is you actually own? “You’re still at this stage of evolution of blockchain where you need to have a traditional written contract that tells you what you are getting and that’s enforceable against the seller of that asset,” David Hoppe, managing partner at Gamma Law, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="tSco7t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even if the NFT falls apart, there could be value as long as the artwork still exists&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5hZGVa"&gt;But most buyers don’t exactly have that. Despite the buzz around Ethereum’s “smart contracts,” NFTs typically do not include the &lt;em&gt;literal contract &lt;/em&gt;a buyer agrees to with the seller of a work detailing what they’re getting and how they can use it. Those rights are typically just built into an auction site’s terms of service. “In many cases, NFTs offer very little beyond a bare claim of ownership of the NFT itself,” Perzanowski wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6vugi"&gt;Buyers could end up in one of two situations: in one case, they own an NFT with a broken link, but they and the rest of the world understand what artwork it used to represent — say, an extremely expensive collage. So long as that image exists &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; in the world, it’s possible the NFT would retain value as long as the artist, owner, and prospective buyers all agree on what the token is meant to represent. It is, after all, a system built on trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="8IRtga"&gt;In the other scenario, the image has gone missing, and no one can tell what artwork the NFT was originally tied to. If that’s the case, it’s hard to imagine the NFT would have had much value anyway. You can’t sell a painting that’s been burned or a statue that’s been lost. And an NFT with missing art is just that — nothing to look at.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi teases camera with liquid lens on upcoming Mi Mix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GcAEpsXkImSJuHJtGqvM_FqLWBI=/114x0:1256x761/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69024652/msedge_w9Th5ctGTx.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A4EZXC"&gt;Xiaomi’s upcoming Mi Mix handset will include a camera with a liquid lens, the company teased in a pair of &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4618643268962302"&gt;Weibo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4618645768244225"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; today. As its name implies, the lens typically includes a layer of liquid, and the lens’s focus and focal length are changed by applying an electrical voltage. Xiaomi says the lens will allow one camera to take everything from telephoto to macro shots as well as offer fast autofocus. The phone is due to be unveiled on March 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ysMNvI"&gt;Liquid lenses have been around for a number of years, but they’re typically found in industrial applications where traditional lenses with moving mechanical parts might wear out too quickly. But their compact size and versatility make them an appealing prospect for smartphones. In theory, one camera with a liquid lens could combine several of the cameras that are found on the backs of most flagship smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c5RKhl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Xiaomi's mysterious MIX phone will use liquid lens for the first time in the world &lt;a href="https://t.co/73ob6uBsyn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/73ob6uBsyn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ice universe (@UniverseIce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1374970048444502017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KyYqLw"&gt;As well as Xiaomi, there were rumors last year that &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_to_use_liquid_lens_in_its_flagship_devices_next_year-news-46480.php"&gt;Huawei is also exploring&lt;/a&gt; using the technology in its smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMPTBH"&gt;A liquid lens feels fitting for Xiaomi’s Mi Mix line, which has featured some pretty experimental designs over the years. In 2018, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18201055/xiaomi-mi-mix-3-slider-no-notch-phone-design"&gt;Mi Mix 3&lt;/a&gt; was among the first phones to offer a mechanical sliding selfie camera, and the following year, it showed off the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/24/20881378/xiaomi-mi-mix-alpha-announced-wrap-around-screen"&gt;Mi Mix Alpha&lt;/a&gt;, which had a screen that wrapped around almost the entire device.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter’s ‘unofficial mayor’ Chrissy Teigen quits platform after years of harassment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Chrissy Teigen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H3o7C64JjinL2mrLpgtsXwy-0yA=/234x0:2766x1688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69024194/1231632327.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: NBC / NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hgqRM5"&gt;Chrissy Teigen, a prolific tweeter the company once called the mayor of Twitter, quit the social media platform Wednesday night. In a series of &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210325015153/https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/1374898752545169409"&gt;now-deleted tweets&lt;/a&gt;, Teigen said Twitter “no longer serves me as positively as it serves me negatively, and I think that’s the right time to call something.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96AZxT"&gt;The model and media personality who is married to singer John Legend was a witty presence on Twitter, and she had 13.7 million followers on the platform, which she joined more than a decade ago. Teigen tweeted about everything from her kids to her &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cravings"&gt;cooking projects&lt;/a&gt; to personal challenges in her life, including a &lt;a href="https://chrissyteigen.medium.com/hi-2e45e6faf764"&gt;miscarriage she suffered last October&lt;/a&gt;. She was famously &lt;a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/07/165013/chrissy-teigen-donald-trump-twitter-fight"&gt;blocked on Twitter by former President Trump&lt;/a&gt; (who was himself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned from the platform&lt;/a&gt; in January) and was one of a handful of accounts followed by the &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/joe-biden-twitter-potus-follows-chrissy-teigen-1234889200/"&gt;official POTUS account&lt;/a&gt; when President Biden took office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIdBKT"&gt;Twitter even promoted her as its unofficial mayor, doing a “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/behindthetweets"&gt;behind the tweets&lt;/a&gt;” video segment in 2019 where she gave some backstory about several of her higher-profile tweets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m3tCH1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Go &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BehindTheTweets?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#BehindTheTweets&lt;/a&gt; with the unofficial mayor of Twitter, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@chrissyteigen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/oCf9UMtL5O"&gt;pic.twitter.com/oCf9UMtL5O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter (@Twitter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1092845570694307842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 5, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DREi8v"&gt;But Teigen was also the target of vitriolic abuse and ongoing harassment both on and off of Twitter. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2018/01/01/chrissy-teigen-fights-back-after-twitter-user-drags-model-into-the-false-pizzagate-conspiracy-theory/"&gt;Pizzagate conspiracy theorists&lt;/a&gt; baselessly claimed Teigen and Legend were part of the nonexistent pedophile ring supposedly run out of a Washington, DC pizzeria. She said she &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/chrissy-teigen-blocked-million-twitter-accounts-deleted-tweets-epstein-1518008"&gt;deleted thousands of tweets&lt;/a&gt; and blocked more than a million Twitter accounts last July after ongoing harassment by QAnon followers. “For years I have taken so many small, 2-follower count punches that at this point, I am honestly deeply bruised,” she tweeted Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5H9bxv"&gt;This is a very bad look for Twitter, which despite all of its efforts to reduce harassment on its platform, was unable to protect a woman of color — and arguably one of its best-known personalities — from being targeted and harassed. The company declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWLhJv"&gt;Here’s the full statement from Teigen, which she tweeted out before deleting her account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RkzJps"&gt;Hey. For over 10 years, you guys have been my world. I honestly owe so much to this world we have created here. I truly consider so many of you my actual friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qtj7HO"&gt;But it’s time for me to say goodbye. This no longer serves me as positively as it serves me negatively, and I think that’s the right time to call something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1qhZM"&gt;My life goal is to make people happy. The pain I feel when I don’t is too much for me. I’ve always been portrayed as the strong clap back girl but I’m just not. My desire to be liked and fear of pissing people off has made me somebody you didn’t sign up for, and a different human than I started out here as! Live well, tweeters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Vivo X60 flagship series announced with Zeiss-branded camera system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jEV6tL8QcY4DGjvLaJYlxo_z9A4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69024156/DSCF7692.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RgiJzL"&gt;Vivo has announced its latest international flagship phones, the X60 series. The highest-end model is the X60 Pro Plus, which is coming first to India, while the X60 and X60 Pro are also launching in the UK and several other markets. Vivo previously launched the X60 series in China but with substantially different specs to these new global models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NtRkq"&gt;Vivo’s main focus with the X60 series is the cameras. The company has started a new partnership with Zeiss that it says includes the use of T* optical coating and swirly bokeh simulation based on the lens maker’s classic Biotar design. These kinds of collaborations tend to be more marketing hype than genuine selling points, but the X60 Pro Plus’ formidable camera bump at least looks the part.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZYlEe9ldzVQZsbFpCA_qZAVmHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22396445/DSCF7696.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ak9i5g"&gt;Whether Zeiss had anything to do with it or not, the X60 Pro Plus has some impressively versatile camera hardware. Its quad-camera setup consists of a 50-megapixel Samsung GN1 primary sensor, a 48-megapixel ultrawide with Vivo’s gimbal-style stabilization, a 32-megapixel 2x telephoto, and an 8-megapixel 5x periscope telephoto, as well as a 32-megapixel selfie camera. We’ll have to see how the system performs in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNgWrF"&gt;The rest of the X60 Pro Plus’ spec sheet is suitably flagship-level. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and comes in a single blue vegan leather model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The display is a 6.56-inch 1080p OLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate. The battery is 4,200mAh and fast-charges at up to 55W, though unfortunately (as is universally the case for Vivo) there’s no wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ldUGXhV7cDteShRU434B9NMZ2vI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22396444/DSCF7693.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1dYiCn"&gt;The X60 and X60 Pro step down to a triple-camera system with a 48-megapixel main sensor, a 13-megapixel ultrawide, and a 13-megapixel 2x telephoto. They both use a Snapdragon 870 processor, which is paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage on the X60 Pro and 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage on the X60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="je0qnb"&gt;The X60 Pro Plus will cost Rs. 69,990 (~$960) in India, while the X60 Pro is Rs. 49,990 (~$690) and the X60 is Rs. 41,990 (~$580). Preorders begin today and the phones will be available on April 2nd. Details on the release in Europe and other markets will be announced later.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy VIII is now on iOS and Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LUCHZe0su5-4nZRYaB4_XOI7l9A=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69024060/ss_978887f770227fdd7c54bf8216677b51fcb294a8.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kDL5rn"&gt;The oft-forgotten &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VIII&lt;/em&gt; has made its way to smartphones, just a few decades after it originally debuted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXT0Mn"&gt;Today, Square Enix launched the classic roleplaying game on both &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-fantasy-viii-remastered/id1326740784"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.FFVIII"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;; it’s available for $16.99 right now, but that price will jump to $20.99 starting on April 5th. &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VIII &lt;/em&gt;first launched on the original PlayStation back in 1999, though this version is the more recent remaster, which hit consoles like the Xbox One, PS4, and Switch in 2019. The game is also available on Steam. In addition to improved visuals, the remaster includes some quality-of-life tweaks, like the option to speed up combat and world exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S61gjI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We decided to take on the challenge to focus on ‘love’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sbb8ZK"&gt;And while &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; tends to garner much of the franchise’s nostalgia — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207441/final-fantasy-7-remake-ff7-review-ps4"&gt;and the big-budget remakes&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;em&gt;VIII&lt;/em&gt; is a notable entry in the series, one that saw &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; expand into more adult storytelling. It was still full of battles and monsters and magic, but the core of the experience was on a budding romance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URTczi"&gt;“The &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; series always placed emphasis on drama, and with &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt;, from a broad perspective, I believe we reached the pinnacle of depicting a story where ‘protagonists face a large force of evil,’” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20847283/final-fantasy-8-remaster-switch-xbox-ps4-yoshinori-kitase-interview"&gt;director Yoshinori Kitase told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1R4fdm"&gt;“On the flip side, the series has evolved on a more granular level since &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy IV&lt;/em&gt;, as it began to include narratives that focused on characters’ emotions. With the advancement of CG technology allowing for a more delicate expression of characters’ emotions, we decided to take on the challenge to focus on ‘love,’ which delves deeper into the internal aspect of humankind, as our theme.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart will have the Xbox Series X / S available at 3PM ET today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TyufjeA9rSs3VHiHMtnCN-XipQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69024003/vpavic_4275_20201030_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Series S and Series X consoles. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FlmZ8E"&gt;If you have been keeping up with the news, you probably know that the Xbox Series X and S consoles are some of the most difficult things to buy currently. If you are looking for another opportunity to buy either console, Walmart will have both the Series X and S available at 3PM ET today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPE4nz"&gt;Unlike previous restocks at Walmart, the retailer is limiting purchases for both consoles by paying for the gadget with an Xbox All Access plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PjTBTm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="E7Eydo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10384596"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YVYN0M"&gt;Once you’ve secured your next-gen Xbox, you’ll likely be looking into some new accessories that will take advantage of your new console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCLUlt"&gt;You could always buy some new games for your console, although the pool of true next-gen games for Series X / S is a bit thin. There’s a ton of third-party titles worth picking up, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-Xbox-One-Standard/dp/B087XR383W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VXFTPBK/ref=twister_B08WQ75YMZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SJ2T3CW/ref=twister_B07SW1PC5K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs Legion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, older titles released on Xbox, including &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fgears-5%2Fc2kdnlt2h7dm%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fhalo-the-master-chief-collection%2F9MT8PTGVHX2P%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; received updates that take advantage of the next-gen hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbMwbi"&gt;Also, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF248LD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a second controller&lt;/a&gt; is good for players who are likely buying this console to share with someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z0emiA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10367357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="thARky"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sGVDrM"&gt;If you are in the market for a new TV that has fantastic picture quality and contrast and includes support for HDMI 2.1 to help you get the most out of your Xbox Series X / S, Best Buy has a deal on Vizio’s 4K OLED TVs. You can buy a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735893593609578015#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model for $1,200&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735893770235738791#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,500&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola phones will now include endangered languages from Latin America</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tnUjdxZaikZ4omNhSQJosnT0WH8=/71x0:832x507/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69023912/Motorola_Picture_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motorola is adding Nheengatu and Kaingang to its language menus in Android.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ESvkqF"&gt;Motorola has added support for two new indigenous languages spoken in Latin America as part of a larger effort to make technology more accessible. Beginning today, Kaingang and Nheengatu will be among the language options available on Motorola Android devices. Any Motorola phone updated to Android 11 will be able to access the new language options, not just its most expensive models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLteUH"&gt;“We believe that this initiative will raise awareness towards language revitalization, not only will impact the communities that we’re working directly with, but right now we’re in the process of open sourcing all that language data from Android into Unicode,” Janine Oliveira, Motorola’s executive director for globalization software, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And by doing that we believe that we’re going to pave the way for more endangered indigenous languages to be added, not only on Android, but also on other smartphones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2nnKF"&gt;The Kaingang language comes from an agricultural community of people in southeastern Brazil, and only about half of the community still speaks it, Motorola found. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has designated Kaingang “definitely endangered.” This means that children no longer learn it as their first language at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DyE2D8"&gt;The Nheengatu community of about 20,000 people lives mostly in the Amazon, but only about 6,000 people in the region still speak that language, so UNESCO considers Nheengatu “severely endangered.” That’s the &lt;a href="http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/"&gt;second-most serious category&lt;/a&gt; before a language is considered “extinct.” UNESCO classifies a language as severely endangered if it’s spoken by grandparents and older generations, who may not speak it among themselves or to children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uqwhK"&gt;Both of the indigenous communities rely heavily on mobile technology, even though they may not always have reliable internet access, said Juliana Rebelatto, globalization manager and head linguist at Motorola’s mobile business group. “Teachers use their mobile phones in their classroom to teach their curriculum, so now that the phones will be in Kaingang and Nheengatu this will really help with the learning process,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tNOdNBatIVB63zbNbj6A4RCZKz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395638/Motorola_Picture_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Motorola&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kaingang welcome screen on Motorola.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vai8wT6Q0jQBlLVJc-E20X-gAcc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395639/Motorola_Picture_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Motorola&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nheengatu welcome screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yU6MN8"&gt;It makes sense that Motorola has a focus on Brazil: as of &lt;a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile/brazil"&gt;February, it had 21 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the market share in the country among smartphone manufacturers, ahead of Apple and second only to Samsung. Rebelatto acknowledged there isn’t necessarily a big return on investment for Motorola by incorporating the indigenous languages into its system; the move isn’t likely to add a huge number of new users for its products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ0cih"&gt;“We know that for most people it will be just another language in a drop down menu but for the people who speak that language, it’s a big innovation. It is part of the bigger mindset we have about digital inclusion,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hCcX7"&gt;Rebelatto said it was their colleague Robert Melo, Motorola’s internationalization lead, who first realized that there were no Latin American indigenous languages represented in any form of digitalized technology. “We started researching ways that Motorola could change that story,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0nSWD"&gt;The company partnered with the University of Campinas in São Paulo, Brazil, and worked with Professor Wilmar D’Angelis, a researcher in cultural anthropology and indigenous languages. “He has dedicated his life, 40 plus years, into researching languages,” Rebelatto noted, and he proved vital in helping the company narrow down which indigenous languages it would choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8qyPo"&gt;Motorola’s linguistics team worked with native language speakers of both languages throughout the project, which meant training them on the company’s tools and practices while on a multinational schedule. “We had to ship Lenovo PCs to communities where the mail barely got into,” Oliveira said, all during a pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcyDjY"&gt;But the native speakers were eager to help, Rebelatto added. One of the women who was a translator on the project told them she couldn’t wait for the languages to be available on phones: “She now has all the argument she needs to convince her child to learn their ancestral language, because it will be on the phones they use every day.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gG1zhJp0pn1QSvseYwRsVtuRbng=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395624/Motorola_Picture_8.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ozias Yaguarê Yamã Glória de Oliveira Aripunãguá with his daughter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4QTfaU"&gt;Nheengatu speaker Ozias Yaguarê Yamã Glória de Oliveira Aripunãguá worked with Motorola on the project and emphasized the cultural importance of the language. “You must understand that over time, Nheengatu has been weakening more and more, and today, many times, due to discrimination against the language, people are ashamed to use it,” he said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUwLJs"&gt;“But you can’t talk about the Amazon without talking about Nheengatu because the two are linked ... it’s part of the essence, it’s the core. The soul of the Amazon is Nheengatu,” he said. Seventy percent of fish names are Nheengatu names, and 50 to 60 percent of the city and river names are Nheengatu names as well, Yaguarê added. “There is no way to talk about one without talking about the other.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvKDwk"&gt;The team plans to open source all of the data it collected as part of the project, hundreds of thousands of UI strings, for anyone to use or research the Amazon languages, not only on Android, but other platforms as well. They had to customize a keyboard and are working with Google on the process of including the languages in G-board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEH5ei"&gt;“We don’t intend to stop here,” said Renata Altenfelder, Motorola executive director for brand. “We are putting this as an open source because we truly believe this should be something for everyone to join.” More endangered languages will be added to the project, she added, they just haven’t decided which ones yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmeiQ7"&gt;Rebelatto added that by digitizing endangered languages, the company hoped it would draw more attention to them and motivate other tech companies to consider similar initiatives. The Motorola project, she added, “will allow technology to have its rightful place in the preservation of not only the language but in their traditions, in their culture and their story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvHGhZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction March 25th 10:55 AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: An earlier version of this article stated that both endangered languages are spoken in the Amazon; Nheengatu is spoken in the Amazon and Kaingang is spoken in southeastern Brazil. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="2TZbFC"&gt;Qualcomm has announced its latest 7-series processor, the Snapdragon 780G, which trickles down features from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;company’s flagship Snapdragon 888 chipset&lt;/a&gt;, while still offering manufacturers (and, by extension, consumers) a more affordable phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EzR4xq"&gt;The 780G takes the new top slot in the 7-series lineup, replacing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/4/20995714/qualcomm-snapdragon-765-chip-affordable-5g-phones-processor-low-price"&gt;765G&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/11/21252114/qualcomm-snapdragon-768g-5g-processor-765g-improvements-cpu-gpu-update"&gt;768G&lt;/a&gt; (the latter being largely a frequency-boosted version of the former). Obviously, there’s the usual boost in performance: the 780G features Qualcomm’s Kryo 670 CPU, which the company says offers a 40 percent boost in performance, and a new Adreno 642 GPU for up to 50 percent faster graphics compared to the 765 model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="437hTs"&gt;But the 780G also enables some new functionality, like the Spectra 570 triple ISP (image signal processor), which, like the Snapdragon 888, allows for phones to capture three simultaneous photo or video feeds at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpoyQ6"&gt;And like the Snapdragon 888, the Snapdragon 780G features Qualcomm’s sixth-generation AI engine running on a new Hexagon 770 processor, which can perform 12 trillion operations per second (TOPS) — twice that of its predecessor, even if it still pales in comparison to the 26 TOPS that the Snapdragon 888 offers. It also features the second-gen Sensing Hub that Qualcomm debuted on its flagship chipset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2p74Z"&gt;Lastly, the 780G has improved connectivity features, with an integrated Snapdragon X53 5G modem that promises up to 3.3Gbps speeds on Sub-6 GHz 5G networks. And like its pricier sibling, the 780G adds support for Wi-Fi 6E, meaning phones with the new chip will be able to take advantage of the fastest Wi-Fi speeds around as well as Bluetooth 5.2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6TEYv"&gt;The first phones with the Snapdragon 780G are expected to release in the second quarter of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="tGDtuk"&gt;I usually prefer to highlight the best deals you can get on new tech, but sometimes a refurbished deal is good enough to make the grade. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony’s 1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; noise-canceling headphones haven’t slipped below $278 new (down from their usual $349 price), but a well-rated eBay seller is offering them in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FSony-WH-1000XM4-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Over-the-Ear-Headphones-Black-%2F274493598619%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeSonyHeadphonesDeal032521%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22350014%2Fsony-wh1000xm4-refurbished-headphones-deal-sale-ipad-air-half-life-alyx-vr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“like-new” condition with all original accessories&lt;/a&gt; included for $208. And with eBay’s offer code &lt;strong&gt;PICKCR5 &lt;/strong&gt;used at checkout, you can knock an extra 5 percent off, totaling $198 before tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2A49a"&gt;If you’re in the US, buying refurbished tech from eBay isn’t such a bad idea, as the retailer backs it with a two-year warranty through Allstate. If you encounter a problem with your purchase outside of the seller’s return window or warranty, you can file a claim to get a repair or a replacement if repair isn’t possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FaRw5Y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10411678"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="UqA2h9"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Review: iPad Air Review (2020)|96393" data-volume-uuid="6c97cb5b6" data-volume-id="96393" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-295" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K47THS"&gt;If you’ve had your eye on Apple’s latest iPad Air with a refreshed design, a fast A14 Bionic processor, and a USB-C charging port, the upgraded model with 256GB of storage is $70 off for the first time at Amazon. Usually $749, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5SYG7S?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $680 in every color that’s available&lt;/a&gt;. This is $20 lower than the previous best price, according to pricing data from CamelCamelCamel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8LRldH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10411697"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Half-Life: Alyx art" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SxsMz4J5mBiTyl8EYljQNCUoy3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19825976/CITADEL_2K.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4xIjCI"&gt;In case you missed it, &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; for VR is 40 percent off in celebration of its release about a year ago. Usually $60, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/"&gt;you can pick it up at Steam for $36&lt;/a&gt; until March 31st. You’ll obviously need a VR headset to play it. May I suggest the Oculus Quest 2 that starts at $299? The headset can be wired to your PC to behave just like a Rift, but for a wireless alternative, purchasing the Virtual Desktop app for the Quest 2 will let you play &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; over Wi-Fi without cables attached to your PC.&lt;/p&gt;
