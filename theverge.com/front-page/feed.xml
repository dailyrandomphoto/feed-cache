    <title>Panic’s Playdate handheld delayed to early 2022</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SwRWqb"&gt;Panic has delayed the first shipments of its Playdate handheld, which is kind of like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview"&gt;a Game Boy but with a crank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://mailchi.mp/popagenda/playdate-2022-delay"&gt;to early 2022&lt;/a&gt;. The company said that initial units shipped with batteries &lt;a href="https://lists.play.date/w/C1CCc0cxLPvgKc6tC8jVmg"&gt;that didn’t work as expected&lt;/a&gt;, forcing it to send the units back to Malaysia to get new batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EIAPOp"&gt;Panic also said that it has been affected by the global chip shortage in a significant way. Additional supply of the Playdate’s current CPU won’t be available for &lt;em&gt;two years&lt;/em&gt;, according to Panic. To get around that, Playdate units coming later in 2022 will have a revised main board that uses a more readily available CPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdklB"&gt;If you preordered a Playdate, you should be receiving an email that says when your Playdate is now estimated to ship. Orders have now been put into five different groups, and your email should say which group you’re in. Panic cautions that its estimates are subject to change, so there could be more shifts down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ouRold"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The global chip shortage has had a major affect on gaming hardware&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJxVH9"&gt;The news of the Playdate’s delay arrives one day after Valve’s Steam Deck was delayed by two months &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"&gt;to February 2022&lt;/a&gt; due to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;global supply chain issues&lt;/a&gt;. And they’re not the only gaming companies affected; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22762933/nintendo-earnings-q2-2021-switch-sales-forecast"&gt;Nintendo cut its Switch sales forecast&lt;/a&gt; due to the chip shortage, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22775829/sony-ps5-supply-chip-shortage-forecast-cut"&gt;Sony is reportedly making fewer PS5s&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzMpGs"&gt;Panic also shared some news about Playdate’s development software. Pulp, the company’s no-code development tool, is set to arrive in public beta in January 2022, while the full Playdate SDK is scheduled to launch in February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will let you easily share clips from its Prime Video content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/82X3-rr72UGVphGZxYkBZyuTH30=/103x0:1218x743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70128465/amazon.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HqEdCp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-unveils-interactive-clip-sharing-feature"&gt;Amazon has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll let you easily share video clips showing up to 30 seconds of some of its Prime Video content, right from the iOS app. The feature will only be available for a very limited number of shows initially, but letting users share video from shows is a very different attitude than the one displayed by some other streaming providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="piZge0"&gt;According to Amazon’s press release, its video-sharing feature will be available on iOS devices. When you’re watching a show, the Share Clip button will show up alongside the rest of your controls. Tapping it will create a 30-second video clip, which you can then fine-tune to make sure it contains the part of the show you’re trying to share. From there, you can share it using iOS’s built-in sharing feature, sending it to a friend over iMessage, or posting it on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ELNwqVoqrKxyFfg6wPJWSpjjGlM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006021/Screen_Shot_2021_11_11_at_09.53.41.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The share a clip button pops up alongside the X-Ray info and brings you to a very Overcast clip sharing-esque interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L7EUkQ"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately respond to a question about the feature’s availability on Android. Amazon’s press release says that the feature is “currently available,” but the share button didn’t show up when we looked for it using the latest version of the Prime Video app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdV2qs"&gt;It seems like an obvious feature for any streaming service to add — people genuinely like sharing clips from the shows they’re watching, and them doing so is basically free marketing for that show. However, Amazon’s competitors like Hulu and Netflix go in pretty much the exact opposite direction: when you take a screenshot while watching one of their shows, the video content just ends up blacked out, leaving you with just the subtitles if you have them turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ed-4LIQDGArfwCYyUyeUp9eCqcU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006007/IMG_3154.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out this hilarious scene from Netflix Original BoJack Horseman.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lr1L11"&gt;While this is perhaps an understandable tactic for third-party content (Netflix’s download feature also has some limitations on which shows you can download), for original shows made by the streaming services themselves, it feels like a missed opportunity to let people do marketing for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKraL4"&gt;Amazon says you can only share clips from &lt;em&gt;The Wilds&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Invincible&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fairfax, &lt;/em&gt;and season one of &lt;em&gt;The Boys&lt;/em&gt; to start, but it will add more movies and shows later. It’s unclear if we’ll end up getting this feature for any non-Amazon content on Prime Video in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MoviePass’ co-founder has bought back the company and wants to relaunch it next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IAlDPbUuAqVey3CNCeEGtWGHYZU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70128446/vpavic_180125_2283_0037.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D7EGVG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iwantmoviepass.com/"&gt;MoviePass&lt;/a&gt; might be making a comeback soon, after Stacy Spikes (one of the service’s original co-founders) successfully bought back the company out of bankruptcy earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/moviepass-cofounder-stacy-spikes-buys-back-company-and-plans-relaunch-2021-11"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Spikes is hoping to relaunch the company sometime next year, although there are few details on that yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lBA1Is"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why MoviePass really failed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20872984/moviepass-shutdown-subscription-movies-helios-matheson-ted-farnsworth-explainer"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VTrhC9"&gt;“I can confirm that we acquired MoviePass out of bankruptcy on Wednesday,” Spikes commented in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. “We are thrilled to have it back and are exploring the possibility of relaunching soon. Our pursuit to reclaim the brand was encouraged by the continued interest from the moviegoing community. We believe, if done properly, theatrical subscription can play an instrumental role in lifting moviegoing attendance to new heights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="google_ads_iframe_/4442842/business/tech/post_3__container__"&gt;MoviePass launched as original all-you-can-eat movie service all the way back in 2011, but skyrocketed to unprecedented levels of popularity in 2017, when the company sold a majority stake to Helios and Matheson Analytics. Shortly afterwards, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16150628/moviepass-pricing-subscription-fee-theaters"&gt;MoviePass dropped its monthly subscription to just $10 per month&lt;/a&gt;, a seemingly unsustainable deal that would see the company offering customers the option to see as many movies in a month as they wanted for less than the price of a single ticket in some pricier markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJUZwh"&gt;The company’s downfall only accelerated as the popularity of MoviePass grew. The idea behind the lower price (which &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-story-moviepass-rise-fall-2019-8"&gt;Spikes reportedly protested&lt;/a&gt; before he was fired in January 2018) was to leverage MoviePass’ larger user base to help negotiate favorable deals with theaters, gaining a cut of things like ticket sales or concessions. But that planed failed spectacularly, and by the end, the company was losing money on virtually every customer, stuck footing the bill for millions in tickets that it could scarcely afford. Attempts to salvage things by limiting tickets, blacking out popular films, and other restrictions couldn’t stave off the inevitable, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/13/20864873/moviepass-app-shutdown-out-of-business-movies-subscription"&gt;company shut down in September 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5yQrL"&gt;But MoviePass did help show that theatrical subscriptions could work, at least in theory, with major theater chains like AMC or Alamo Drafthouse offering their own (more expensive) services that offer similar deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVspB3"&gt;With Spikes back in charge, it seems doubtful that MoviePass’ return will feature the kind of impossible deals that the doomed service had offered before. But if Spikes actually &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; pull off a comeback, it might offer useful competition to the in-house services at theaters that have since replaced it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch is now on the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MTyO8Qha90Awtibew6HUHAa2NEQ=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70128187/screenshot02.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of Twitch on the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="owQUeh"&gt;There’s now a Twitch app for the Nintendo Switch. It’s a free download &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/twitch-switch/"&gt;that’s available now on the eShop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3oMYd"&gt;The app is pretty straightforward. There’s a Home tab with recommended streams for you to watch, a Browse tab to look for streams by game or category, and a Search tab. I checked out a couple streams, and they looked great, especially on the Switch OLED’s screen. The app is only for watching streams; you can’t use it to stream your gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wijc-cfws2Vi5JjXquAoGuFDmLo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23005969/screenshot01.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo’s profile on the Nintendo Switch Twitch app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vCeKSD"&gt;The Switch Twitch experience is somewhat more limited than what you might be used to from the Twitch website or app. One big change is that you can’t see a stream’s chat on your Switch’s screen or a TV screen, though you can scan a QR code to see chat on your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3y9wJg"&gt;If you want to sign in to your account, you fortunately won’t have to wrestle with typing your password in using the Switch’s controls or the touchscreen. You can either scan a QR code on your phone or enter an eight-digit code shown on your screen at &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/activate"&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/activate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zS77AN"&gt;Streaming options on the Switch are still fairly limited, though there is also &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/youtube-switch/"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/hulu-switch/"&gt;Hulu&lt;/a&gt; if you want to watch something in between trips to your &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; island. Here’s hoping we get Netflix someday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Russian “King of Fraud” sentenced to 10 years in prison for Methbot digital ad scheme</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LO4s8ZUqqYYjmLTIACtESAJA4rQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70128073/acastro_170621_1777_0001_fin.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d8dDsA"&gt;A Russian man convicted on wire fraud and money laundering charges for his role in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18115230/3ve-methbot-operation-eversion-online-ad-fraud-arrest-indictment"&gt;Methbot digital advertising scheme&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/russian-cybercriminal-sentenced-10-years-prison-digital-advertising-fraud-scheme"&gt;sentenced to 10 years in prison&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MF9j36"&gt;The Department of Justice said between September 2014 and December 2016, Aleksandr Zhukov, 41, and several co-conspirators made deals with ad networks to place online ads but used a bot farm and rented servers to simulate users visiting spoofed versions of websites like the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;New York Daily News&lt;/em&gt;. The ads were never shown to human users, but Zhukov raked in $7 million running the fake traffic scam (which became known as “Methbot,” after the name of his phony ad network Media Methane), according to the DOJ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfLe82"&gt;“Sitting at his computer keyboard in Bulgaria and Russia, Zhukov boldly devised and carried out an elaborate multi-million-dollar fraud against the digital advertising industry, and victimized thousands of companies across the United States,” US Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iys1OH"&gt;As part of the elaborate plan, Zhukov recruited programmers and others to help build the infrastructure that made the scheme possible. Authorities said he referred to the recruits as his developers and to himself as “the king of fraud.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sITp2K"&gt;In May, a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/russian-king-of-fraud-is-found-guilty-of-online-ad-scam"&gt;jury convicted Zhukov&lt;/a&gt; of wire fraud conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering conspiracy, and money laundering. In addition to the 10-year prison term, Zhukov was ordered to pay $3.8 million in forfeiture.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 is available now at Best Buy</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="But9MD"&gt;If you still haven’t been able to land one of Sony’s next-gen consoles, Best Buy is giving you another shot right now. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYMoENUTqt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 PS5 with a disc drive&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYMojat7P1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99 digital edition&lt;/a&gt; are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUL1fG"&gt;Unlike some of Best Buy’s console restocks, this one is available to the general public online and not just for its TotalTech subscribers. Restocks like these may happen more frequently as we get closer to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;. Still, we recommend heading to the link of choosing as quickly as possible to hop in the queue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord CEO says the company won’t add a crypto wallet — for now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YO_jlZ307pfmWuzRvGJsEfLUgzI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70127856/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q2YRKh"&gt;On Monday, Discord CEO Jason Citron struck fear (or joy) into the hearts of Discord fans by tweeting a screenshot of what appeared to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1457841222995693570"&gt;crypto wallets in the app&lt;/a&gt;, but Wednesday evening, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1458607550677405699"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt; the company doesn’t actually plan to ship what he was showing off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6QHDkR"&gt;“Thanks for all the perspectives everyone,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1458607550677405699"&gt;Citron said&lt;/a&gt;. “We have no current plans to ship this internal concept. For now we’re focused on protecting users from spam, scams and fraud. Web3 has lots of good but also lots of problems we need to work through at our scale. More soon.” Discord told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this week that the image was from an internal hackfest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8l8sbu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thanks for all the perspectives everyone. We have no current plans to ship this internal concept. For now we're focused on protecting users from spam, scams and fraud. Web3 has lots of good but also lots of problems we need to work through at our scale. More soon.&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Citron (@jasoncitron) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1458607550677405699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jAzEHp"&gt;Citron’s statement doesn’t entirely rule out the possibility of some kind of crypto / NFT integration in Discord in the future. Based on Citron’s tweet, it sounds as if the company is looking into how it can use “Web3,” which is a shorthand that often refers to a decentralized and crypto-based internet, as well as how it can protect &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683766/nft-scams-theft-social-engineering-opensea-community-recovery"&gt;against crypto / NFT scams that take place on the platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bpyzd6"&gt;The company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; something similar about its interest in crypto when we asked about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772164/discord-nft-viral-tweet-social-media-backlash"&gt;a survey mentioning NFTs&lt;/a&gt; that happened to make the rounds just hours before Citron’s Monday tweet. Though that survey was apparently just for research, “we’re always exploring and hacking away at things we think will improve Discord for all the communities we serve,” a Discord spokesperson said. “This includes research that helps us learn about what people want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lN2EKn"&gt;It doesn’t appear that there will be an official crypto integration with Discord just yet. But don’t be surprised if there eventually is.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM is building a prototype for the US military based on the Hummer EV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QTffWfHuVRGA8-88GkJr1Mf_eSI=/99x0:1169x713/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70127838/hummer_ev_reveal_suv_gal_my23_hummer_suv_VP33__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: General Motors&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5myjs3"&gt;The Hummer has been resurrected as an electric vehicle, and now its military counterpart may be as well. General Motors is making a prototype vehicle for the US military that is based on the forthcoming Hummer EV in 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/gm-plans-to-produce-military-vehicle-based-on-hummer-ev-in-2022.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;amp;par=sharebar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxryTY"&gt;The so-called “electric Light Reconnaissance Vehicle,” or eLRV, will use modified versions of the Hummer EV’s frame, electric motors, and GM’s new Ultium battery pack, though it may not look exactly like the consumer version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="su6Oyt"&gt;GM resurrected its defense unit in 2017 and said last year that it believes there’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/22/gms-defense-unit-sees-25-billion-market-in-potential-military-contracts-for-automaker.html"&gt;a $25 billion market for creating new vehicles for the military&lt;/a&gt;, including EVs. It has already nabbed a $214 million contract to build infantry squad vehicles for the Army, including one version that uses parts from the Chevy Bolt EV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HnHz4q"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/Pentagon%20Fuel%20Use%2C%20Climate%20Change%20and%20the%20Costs%20of%20War%20Revised%20November%202019%20Crawford.pdf"&gt;2019 study from Brown University&lt;/a&gt; calculated that the US military is the largest institutional polluter in the world and produces more greenhouse gas emissions than 140 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKvjoU"&gt;That has inspired a few other would-be electric vehicle manufacturers to target the military fleet in addition to GM. Both Nikola and Lordstown Motors have built demonstration vehicles and pitched them as potentially huge lines of business — though neither struggling startup has been able to strike a deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ma7Xc7"&gt;While GM sees great opportunity selling EVs to the military, it doesn’t sound like the Hummer-based eLRV will become as ubiquitous as the original gas-powered Hummer — at least not right away. Kathleen Hicks, the deputy secretary of the defense department, told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; that she believes integrating electric vehicles in the military’s fleet will be “very challenging,” especially because of charging infrastructure. But, she said, “[e]lectrifying the non-tactical fleet, that’s a no-brainer.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Patreon’s building native video hosting for creators to sidestep YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Patreon clip art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kg9VGB9PUOzifhNA4NdturY0jwY=/200x0:1400x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70127710/International_Patreon_send.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Patreon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="72fJ9S"&gt;Patreon is building a video hosting solution and native player. CEO Jack Conte confirmed the project to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, alongside news that he is joining many executives before him in &lt;a href="https://www.creatoreconomypodcast.com/"&gt;launching a podcast&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;em&gt;The Creator Economy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Q5Ib2"&gt;“We already host podcasts, and now we’re starting to host video, as well,” he says. “We’re building a video product ... So in terms of how we’ve approached our strategy, and what exactly it is that we’re building, we’re building the horizontal architecture for any creator, no matter their medium, or no matter the upload format, to be able to build a business around their work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODd0SX"&gt;Conte didn’t share more details on the product, but it’s presumably a way for creators to host and share video without leaving the platform. It’s still unclear when it might launch or how broadly it would be deployed. We’ve reached out to a spokesperson for additional context and will update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NI8h40"&gt;Still, Conte’s acknowledgment of the goal and progress on allowing creators to natively host their videos on Patreon could allow more people to avoid YouTube, or at least not rely on it so heavily. The company also &lt;a href="https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017431292-Share-my-videos-with-patrons"&gt;maintains an integration&lt;/a&gt; with Vimeo that might become less important as this feature launches. Of course, the idea of a company launching its own native video product in the year of 2021 feels bold but speaks to the broader discontent brewing over YouTube’s dominance and Patreon’s own interest in becoming fully self-reliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oAtT52"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Atgi4F"&gt;The timing of the announcement is particularly interesting because Conte’s podcast focuses on the techier side of creators. Conte won’t be interviewing Patreon creators, but rather people who are building and funding tools for them to use, like Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and Li Jin, founder and managing partner at Atelier. Conte says the idea is to put Patreon’s name next to these folks and share its vision for the creator world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BgaYry"&gt;“We want to attract the most awesome, forward-thinking, curious people who are building for the creator economy to Patreon,” he says. “We want those people to hear how we think about the world, and our vision, and what we want to build, and what we believe in, and who we are.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHMtFS"&gt;The show will be ad-free and free to access on all platforms — there’s no Patreon-funded tier — and will be released seasonally with 12 episodes planned.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Now Dollar General will do same-day deliveries via DoorDash</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dollar General is on DoorDash" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BUlQaDqJiT5kY_FqHviACovh_fw=/140x0:1660x1013/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70127486/Dollar_General_PR_Image.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Dollar General&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7zMifA"&gt;Besides its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774485/doordash-acquires-wolt-stock-europe-international"&gt;European expansion&lt;/a&gt;, DoorDash is reaching into new areas within the United States via an expanded &lt;a href="https://newscenter.dollargeneral.com/news/dollar-general-and-doordash-announce-partnership-to-offer-on-demand-delivery-of-everyday-essentials.htm"&gt;partnership with Dollar General that’s already available via 9,000 locations&lt;/a&gt;. Gig economy services initially proliferated in urban areas, using venture capital money to push the convenience of getting everything from cold medicine to a single candy bar hand-delivered within the hour. However, if you don’t live around tall buildings, the services become fewer and farther between, and so do the shops that work with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvT8YU"&gt;Now the two promise same-day delivery with no time slot or minimum order size required. A pilot program started this summer with 600 Dollar General locations, and a press release states that more than 10,000 will appear in DoorDash listings by December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tEPPH5"&gt;The arrangement highlights many realities of American life, both pre- and peri-pandemic. For some people, it could open up access and independence that otherwise wasn’t available because they live somewhere without Instacart or a fleet of electric Ubers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vTa2Ix"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sick Days: The human cost of Instacart’s grocery delivery ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21267669/instacart-shoppers-sick-extended-pay-quarantine-leave-coronavirus"},{"title":"Revolt of the NYC Delivery Workers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jj4qw6"&gt;It also puts together workers who have been among those hardest-pressed during the last two years. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/26/opinion/covid-workers-dollar-general.html"&gt;Dollar store employees&lt;/a&gt; and couriers have frequently faced &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/business/dollar-stores-struggling-pandemic.html"&gt;low wages&lt;/a&gt;, risky conditions, lack of sick leave or health insurance, and a tense customer base despite being deemed “essential.” Now they’ll combine to provide on-demand deliveries (“in under an hour on average”) across some areas that haven’t been living with the services yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uh4WTl"&gt;And even if the partnership works out perfectly for DoorDash, Dollar General, customers, and the people who deliver everything from a pack of Skittles to fresh groceries, their competition will have to deal with it. Reports over the last few years from &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/nyregion/dollar-stores-thriving.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://slate.com/business/2021/07/dollar-general-food-deserts-grocery-stores.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reflect how independent discount stores and grocery stores can struggle to compete with or operate in areas where dollar stores open. Dollar General sees itself as a solution for food and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/08/dollar-general-ceo-says-majority-of-its-stores-are-in-health-deserts.html"&gt;health deserts&lt;/a&gt;, but if other stores close, that could further impact local economies and access to healthy options.&lt;/p&gt;
