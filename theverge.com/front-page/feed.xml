    <title>Razer’s Wolverine V2 Chroma is an elegant, customizable wired controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Wolverine V2 Chroma" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9HXUZwvCL8ljeIyBRlnKHty4Fd8=/1x0:5566x3710/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69856798/wolverinev2chroma1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aWNa1N"&gt;A year after the launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21571482/razer-wolverine-v2-xbox-series-x-s-controller-pc-wired-elite-trigger-stops-price-features"&gt;Razer’s $100 Wolverine V2 Xbox controller&lt;/a&gt;, today the company has announced a $150 version with more features called the Wolverine V2 Chroma. The new name is a giveaway to one of the additions: a strip of Chroma RGB lighting near each of the two grips that can be programmed to your liking via its accessory companion app on an Xbox or PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zmj7bu"&gt;This controller is actually replacing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/8/24/16198780/razer-xbox-one-pc-pro-game-controller-price-availability"&gt;Wolverine Ultimate that was released in late 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Like the older controller, the Wolverine V2 Chroma has swappable thumb sticks like those included with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Xbox Elite controllers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22627413/scuf-instinct-pro-microsoft-xbox-controller-wireless-series-x-s-one-pc-features-price"&gt;Scuf’s Instinct&lt;/a&gt;, trigger stops to shorten the throw of triggers, and six remappable macro buttons (including four paddles on the back) that can be customized.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Wolverine V2 Chroma" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lXOiW3PZr20AmNdpathy3KFqWlQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840549/wolverinev2chroma3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The analog stick covers are swappable, though the d-pad is not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LuUkxM"&gt;There are a few improvements over its predecessor. For example, the Wolverine V2 Chroma’s LED implementation definitely looks better, and I prefer its shape and overall design over the older model. It also gets points for using USB-C instead of the Ultimate’s Micro USB port and for having the same offering of buttons as Microsoft’s latest Xbox controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DPMxHL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The older Wolverine Ultimate offers a little more customization&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BXgjgb"&gt;But the newer controller isn’t superior in every way. The older Wolverine Ultimate offers a little more customization for a lower price (currently $129.99). Namely, its D-pad can be swapped. Also, the Ultimate doesn’t require software to remap its button, instead letting you do it right from the controller. It’s not a deal-breaker, but you might prefer that solution as opposed to downloading software.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Wolverine V2 Chroma" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uo3bN27M5iiTiiG4-2FGMl-kjr8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840534/wolverinev2chroma2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wolverine V2 Chroma has six macro buttons in total, which are programmable through Razer’s accessory app for Windows 10 and Xbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SBTojE"&gt;All said, this is a fairly minor upgrade over the Wolverine V2, though there’s enough that’s new and worthwhile here that you might be interested. On the other hand, you might find yourself content with either buying or hanging onto the older Wolverine Ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The investigation into Tesla Autopilot’s emergency vehicle problem is getting bigger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Motors Inc. Tests Self-Driving Technology" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q_1MBbnUG-EL4t3dk_Ams4hhG2s=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69856289/494411536.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FvbUMx"&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is requesting advanced driver assist data from 12 automakers as it seeks to expand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;its investigation into Tesla’s Autopilot&lt;/a&gt;. The government is probing a dozen incidents involving Teslas crashing into emergency vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juy2nN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/regulation-safety/nhtsa-seeking-driver-assist-data-12-automakers-tesla-autopilot-probe"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the agency’s Office of Defects Investigation sent letters to a dozen major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Toyota, and Volkswagen, requesting information regarding their Level 2 driver assist systems, in which the vehicle can simultaneously control steering, braking, and acceleration under specific circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K89fIm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Automakers are being asked to provide the number of vehicles with Level 2 systems that have been manufactured in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MsmmAi"&gt;Automakers are being asked to provide the number of vehicles with Level 2 systems that have been manufactured in the US, as well as the total number of miles covered with those systems engaged and a recent list of any changes or updates. NHTSA is also requesting customer complaints, field and crash reports, and any lawsuits related to the Level 2 systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="elOJdR"&gt;
&lt;p style=" margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;"&gt;   &lt;a title="View NHTSA Ford letter on Scribd" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F525253207%2FNHTSA-Ford-letter%23from_embed&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F14%2F22673497%2Ftesla-nhtsa-autopilot-investigation-data-ford-gm-vw-toyota" style="text-decoration: underline;" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NHTSA Ford letter&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a title="View ahawkins8223's profile on Scribd" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fuser%2F112638498%2Fahawkins8223%23from_embed&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F14%2F22673497%2Ftesla-nhtsa-autopilot-investigation-data-ford-gm-vw-toyota" style="text-decoration: underline;" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ahawkins8223&lt;/a&gt; on Scribd&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="27HKxj"&gt;The data request comes less than two weeks after NHTSA sent an order to Tesla to provide data on the operation of its Autopilot system, including details on which of its sold vehicles are equipped with Autopilot as well as the system’s operating parameters. The agency’s investigation into Tesla could have wide-ranging implications for Tesla, which has pushed the boundaries in releasing experimental software to untrained customers in order to advance its vision of autonomous driving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zyzjza"&gt;NHTSA’s investigation covers an estimated 765,000 Tesla vehicles that were released from 2014 through 2021. The agency is looking into 12 crashes in which Tesla owners using the company’s Autopilot features have crashed into stationary emergency vehicles, resulting in 17 injuries and one fatality. Most of these incidents took place after dark, with the software ignoring scene control measures including warning lights, flares, cones, and an illuminated arrow board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgmYMg"&gt;Tesla has until October 22nd to hand over the data. US-based automakers like Ford, GM, and Stellantis have until November 3rd, and all other car companies, like Toyota, Subaru, Nissan, and Honda, have until November 17th. Automakers that fail to respond could face civil penalties of up to $115 million. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s big PS5 update with M.2 SSD support launches September 15th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ep_kjAwA4GlI2dXHRS6qXe3ImHg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855912/vpavic_4278_20201030_0234.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9bt4FW"&gt;Sony’s first PS5 beta included access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599593/sony-ps5-m2-ssd-support-beta-features"&gt;long-awaited M.2 SSD slot&lt;/a&gt;, and now the company &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/14/ps5s-september-system-software-update-launches-globally-tomorrow/"&gt;is ready to release the update to everyone&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t have a PlayStation 5 yet, then you should know that the PS4 is in line for an update, too, which will allow party owners to disband without kicking players out individually, and view trophies from PS5 games, whether it’s on your profile or someone else’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAg79S"&gt;When the second major system update for the PlayStation 5 is released on Wednesday, everyone who has managed to acquire the system will also experience 3D audio via their TV’s built-in stereo speakers, similar to how it works on compatible headsets. Sadly, there’s no word on support for Dolby Atmos audio beyond Blu-ray disc playback or new 3D audio settings for home theater systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEYROT"&gt;There’s an accompanying update for the PS5’s DualSense controller that lets players use the built-in microphone to help calibrate the audio settings to work for their TV and the room they’re in. If you own Sony’s Pulse 3D headset (it’s a good option for the PS5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;among others we can suggest&lt;/a&gt;), there will be a new equalizer settings panel in the sound controls menu so that you can tweak the audio to your liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="brDt6u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to update your PS5 controller ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22539827/ps5-playstation-controller-how-to-update-dualsense"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="PS5 3D audio room acoustics setup" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cR3R-Q8_yzKE9Slupm1z4sWfT4w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849450/51469696561_637f5081cc_h.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5 3D audio room acoustics setup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U9vQbu"&gt;Still, upgrading the next-gen system’s 825GB of built-in storage is the most pressing issue for most gamers, with fall titles starting to roll out and install sizes that are only getting larger. We have all the advice you need on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-compatible-drives"&gt;which SSDs to buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22608153/ps5-ssd-speed-test-storage-expansion-m2-playstation-5"&gt;how fast they really need to be&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to"&gt;instructions for installing the extra storage&lt;/a&gt; once the update arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IJ7dQ"&gt;You can also customize the layout of the Control Center by moving or hiding certain options, while PS4 and PS5 games are now separated in the Installed tab of your game library. In the system’s Game Base, you can view and write messages to friends or a party chat without going to another screen first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wrJWJ"&gt;The PS5 is also keeping an eye out for any time you set a new “personal best,” while it could already clip achievements that garner trophies, now games can automatically save the time when you set a new fast lap or high score. A new “Trophy Tracker” feature lets players bookmark five awards they’re pursuing to make progress easily viewable from the Control Center.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="PS5 Trophy Tracker" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U8Zpyqf0Vl-HScztw5g-rO22KsI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849717/51468939727_611119bf8b_h.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5 Trophy Tracker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DEnUVz"&gt;Now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556803/sony-ps5-remote-play-ps4-app-streaming-games"&gt;PS Remote Play&lt;/a&gt; will be available when you’re outside of Wi-Fi range for streaming games or simply browsing the console’s menus. Sony recommends speeds of at least 5Mbps to play, with a suggestion of 15Mbps in both directions for the best experience from 5G or 4G LTE connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3f0ba"&gt;One other major new feature won’t be available until September 23rd, when players can start to stream Share Screens from a friend’s PS5 in the PS App on iOS or Android. Once the feature is available, all they need to do is join your party chat, and then you can let them tune in directly to a broadcast of the game you’re playing like it’s a personal Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQ85E9"&gt;The PS5 accolades feature that has been included but underutilized since the system launched is getting better, too, as players can award the people they meet online by noting them as a “Leader.” That’s in addition to the existing commendations like “good sport,” “welcoming,” and “helpful.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZyJLh"&gt;Accessibility options are improved, with screen reader controls that players can use to pause and resume the reading by pressing the PS button and triangle or have it repeat what it said by pressing PS and R1.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Everyone will be able to clone their voice in the future</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1O0haJ0sVzZThbLO3NSO4m_813Q=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855885/acastro_091321_4752_0001.12.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;AI speech synthesis is quick, easy, and uncannily good&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="xt6UZw"&gt;Cloning your voice using artificial intelligence is simultaneously tedious and simple: hallmarks of a technology that’s just about mature and ready to go public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POs2NI"&gt;All you need to do is talk into a microphone for 30 minutes or so, reading a script as carefully as you can (in my case: the voiceover from a David Attenborough documentary). After starting and stopping dozens of times to re-record your flubs and mumbles, you’ll send off the resulting audio files to be processed and, in a few hours’ time, be told that a copy of your voice is ready and waiting. Then, you can type anything you want into a chatbox, and your AI clone will say it back to you, with the resulting audio realistic to fool even friends and family — at least for a few moments. The fact that such a service even exists may be news to many, and I don’t believe we’ve begun to fully consider the impact easy access to this technology will have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="y7XcVu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Voice clones aren’t perfect, but they’re improving fast&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4WdIl0"&gt;The work of speech synthesis has improved massively in recent years, thanks to advances in machine learning. Previously, the most &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/17/4596374/machine-language-how-siri-found-its-voice"&gt;realistic synthetic voices&lt;/a&gt; were created by recording audio of a human voice actor, cutting up their speech into component sounds, and splicing these back together like letters in a ransom note to form new words. Now, neural networks can be trained on unsorted data of their target voice to generate raw audio of someone speaking from scratch. The end results are faster, easier, and more realistic to boot. The quality is definitely not perfect when rolling straight out the machine (though manual tweaking can improve this), but they’re only going to get better in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="whIR07"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP3013427519&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X4Zgdy"&gt;There’s no special sauce to making these clones, which means dozens of startups are already offering similar services. Just Google “AI voice synthesis” or “AI voice deepfakes,” and you’ll see how commonplace the technology is, available from specialist shops that only focus on speech synthesis, like Resemble.AI and Respeecher, and also integrated into companies with larger platforms, like Veritone (where the tech is part of its advertising repertoire) and Descript (which uses it in the software it makes for editing podcasts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EQ5LYj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A vocal deepfake of Anthony Bourdain caused controversy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="818ado"&gt;These voice clones have simply been a novelty in the past, appearing as one-off fakes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629024/joe-rogan-ai-fake-voice-clone-deepfake-dessa"&gt;like this Joe Rogan fake&lt;/a&gt;, but they’re beginning to be used in serious projects. In July, a documentary about chef Anthony Bourdain stirred controversy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578707/anthony-bourdain-documentary-deepfake-voice"&gt;when the creators revealed&lt;/a&gt; they’d used AI to create audio of Bourdain “speaking” lines he’d written in a letter. (Notably, few people noticed the deepfake until the creators revealed its existence.) And in August, the startup Sonantic announced it had created an &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OSMue60Gg6s"&gt;AI voice clone of actor Val Kilmer&lt;/a&gt;, whose own voice was damaged in 2014 after he underwent a tracheotomy as part of his treatment for throat cancer. These examples also frame some of the social and ethical dimensions of this technology. The Bourdain use case was decried as exploitative by many (particularly as its use was not disclosed in the film), while the Kilmer work has been generally lauded, with the technology praised for delivering what other solutions could not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjMqwy"&gt;Celebrity applications of voice clones are likely to be the most prominent in the next few years, with companies hoping the famous will want to boost their income with minimal effort by cloning and renting out their voices. One company, Veritone, launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22432180/voice-clone-deepfake-celebrities-influencers-veritone-ai-platform"&gt;just such a service earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, saying it would let influencers, athletes, and actors license their AI voice for things like endorsements and radio idents, without ever having to go into a studio. “We’re really excited about what that means for a host of different industries because the hardest part about someone’s voice and being able to use it and being able to expand upon that is the individual’s time,” Sean King, executive vice president at Veritone One, told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;. “A person becomes the limiting factor in what we’re doing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LjqLM3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Influencers, actors, and celebrities could rent out their voices with minimal effort&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8OiHI8"&gt;Such applications are not yet widespread (or if they are, they’re not widely talked about), but it seems like an obvious way for celebrities to make money. Bruce Willis, for example, has already licensed his image to be used as a visual deepfake in &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/bruce-willis-licensed-his-deepfake-for-a-series-of-russian-mobile-carrier-ads"&gt;mobile phone ads in Russia&lt;/a&gt;. The deal allows him to make money without ever leaving the house, while the advertising company gets an infinitely malleable actor (and, notably, a much &lt;em&gt;younger&lt;/em&gt; version of Willis, straight out of his &lt;em&gt;Die Hard &lt;/em&gt;days). These sorts of visual and audio clones could accelerate the scales of economy for celebrity work, allowing them to capitalize on their fame — as long as they’re happy renting out a simulacrum of themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCcOnr"&gt;In the here and now, voice synthesis technology is already being built into tools like the eponymous podcast editing software built by US firm Descript. The company’s “Overdub” feature lets a podcaster create an AI clone of their voice so producers can make quick changes to their audio, supplementing the program’s transcription-based editing. As Descript CEO Andrew Mason told &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;: “You can not only delete words in Descript and have it delete the audio, you can type words and it will generate audio in your voice.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uakpoyUCXWw2QEj3bys4GToB-Mc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19210297/descript_2.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Descript&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Podcast editing software Descript uses AI voice clones to edit speech like a transcript. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HSBeTG"&gt;When I tried Descript’s Overdub feature myself, it was certainly easy enough to use — though, as mentioned above, recording the training data was a bit of a chore. (It was much easier for my colleague and regular &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; podcast host Ashley Carman, who had lots of pre-recorded audio ready to send the AI.) The voice clones made by Overdub are not flawless, certainly. They have an odd warble to their tone and lack the ability to really charge lines with emotion and emphasis, but they’re also unmistakably &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;. The first time I used my voice clone was a genuinely uncanny moment. I had no idea that this deeply personal thing — my voice — could be copied by technology so quickly and easily. It felt like a meeting with the future but was also strangely familiar. After all, life is already full of digital mirrors — of avatars and social media feeds that are supposed to embody “you” in various forms — so why not add a speaking automaton to the mix? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7a9QOi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cloning my voice felt like a meeting with the future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qfafn0"&gt;The initial shock of hearing a voice clone of yourself doesn’t mean human voices are redundant, though. Far from it. You can certainly improve on the quality of voice deepfakes with a little manual editing, but in their automated form, they still can’t deliver anywhere near the range of inflection and intonation you get from professionals. As voice artist and narrator Andia Winslow told &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, while AI voices might be useful for rote voice work — for internal messaging systems, automated public announcements, and the like — they can’t compete with humans in many use cases. “For big stuff, things that need breath and life, it’s not going to go that way because, partly, these brands like working with the celebrities they hire, for example,” said Winslow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njc2mH"&gt;But what does this technology mean for the general public? For those of us who aren’t famous enough to benefit from the technology and are not professionally threatened by its development? Well, the potential applications are varied. It’s not hard to imagine a video game where the character creation screen includes an option to create a voice clone, so it sounds like the player is speaking all of the dialogue in the game. Or there might be an app for parents that allows them to copy their voice so that they can read bedtime stories to their children even when they’re not around. Such applications could be done with today’s technology, though the middling quality of quick clones would make them a hard sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbfCyi"&gt;There are also potential dangers. Fraudsters have already used voice clones to trick companies into moving money &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851248/deepfakes-ai-fake-audio-phone-calls-thieves-trick-companies-stealing-money"&gt;into their accounts&lt;/a&gt;, and other malicious uses are certainly lurking just beyond the horizon. Imagine, for example, a high school student surreptitiously recording a classmate to create a voice clone of them, then faking audio of that person bad-mouthing a teacher to get them in trouble. If the uses of visual deepfakes are anything to go by, where worries about political misinformation have proven &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251736/deepfake-propaganda-misinformation-troll-video-hoax"&gt;largely misplaced&lt;/a&gt; but the technology has done huge damage creating &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/13/1035449/ai-deepfake-app-face-swaps-women-into-porn/"&gt;nonconsensual pornography&lt;/a&gt;, it’s these sorts of incidents that pose the biggest threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xXi5AL"&gt;One thing’s for sure, though: in the future, anyone will be able to create an AI voice clone of themselves if they want to. But the script this chorus of digital voices will follow has yet to be written. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lqt18u"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="foBpWk"&gt;
&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(".c-entry-hero__image").html('&lt;style&gt;.vrg-video-lede {max-width: 800px;margin: 0 auto;} .vrg-label {height: 1px;width: 1px;overflow: hidden;position: absolute;} .vrg-inner-container {height: 100%; position: relative;padding-bottom: 100%;overflow: hidden;}@media screen and (max-width:768px){.vrg-inner-container {height: 100%;}} .vrg-media {position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;width: 100%;height: 100%;} .vrg-media img {height: 100%;width: 100%;max-width: 100%;position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;object-fit: cover;} .vrg-media video {height: 100%;width: 100%;position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;object-fit: cover;display: inline-block;}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;figure class="vrg-video-lede" aria-label="media" role="group"&gt;&lt;span class="vrg-label"&gt;Video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="vrg-inner-container"&gt;&lt;div class="vrg-media"&gt;&lt;img src="https://volume-assets.voxmedia.com/production/b0785f57b36cab0acc2556986a40990d/acastro_091321_4752_0002.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;video src="https://volume-assets.voxmedia.com/production/76a583864feafa0fb620bcf522576375/acastro_091321_4752_0001.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;');&lt;/script&gt;

    <title>Sonos announces second-gen Beam soundbar with Dolby Atmos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JPejaPH1U1l97Z9RzMfJTLVKDkY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855810/beam_hand_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sonos&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T3gR8t"&gt;When Sonos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667044/sonos-speaker-price-increases-announce-september-12"&gt;announced price increases&lt;/a&gt; for the majority of its product lineup last week, some people noticed that the entry-level &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17507796/sonos-beam-speaker-soundbar-alexa-review"&gt;Beam soundbar&lt;/a&gt; was absent from the list. And indeed, that’s because the company has been at work on a follow-up. The new &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sonos.com/en-gb/shop/beam.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-generation Beam&lt;/a&gt; being announced today costs $449 (a $50 increase over the original) but adds Dolby Atmos audio and an improved external design. It’ll be available October 5th in black or white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ib0wgK"&gt;But there’s something you should know about the Atmos part right off the bat: the new Beam doesn’t actually include any up-firing speakers. In fact, the drivers inside are the exact same as before: there’s a center tweeter, four woofers, and three passive radiators to give bass some extra kick. The outside of the Beam has switched from a fabric cover to Sonos’ signature perforated plastic, but nothing about the internal layout has really changed. Sonos says the second-gen model has a more capable CPU that’s 40 percent faster. This extra horsepower allows the company to pull off more advanced audio virtualization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71jM6N"&gt;The new Beam has more “arrays,” which is what Sonos calls the software that coordinates all the playback and phase adjustments that produce immersive sound. The original Beam had three arrays, but the new model has five. The two additional arrays are used for steering surround and height audio around the room.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E0XUDGcaVPw0OEB-AnFYBu0qih0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849134/beam_credenza_white.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sonos&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Beam has a wraparound perforated plastic grille.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7aJY90"&gt;Despite a lack of actual up-firing drivers — Sonos told me it couldn’t squeeze any into the Beam’s compact form factor — the company insists the second-gen Beam will deliver a real sense of verticality when paying Atmos content. This seems like one of those cases where you’ll have to hear it to really believe it, and I haven’t had the chance to demo the new soundbar yet. Sonos claims there’s consistently an improved feeling of spaciousness with the refreshed Beam that applies whether you’re watching Atmos, regular 5.1 surround, or even stereo content. And dialogue clarity also comes through clearer than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QZPbe"&gt;In most other ways, this Beam doesn’t shake up the formula very much. It’s still got the one HDMI port, which this time has been upgraded to eARC and is thus capable of handling Dolby Atmos, Dolby TrueHD, and multi-channel LPCM. If everything else in your TV chain is also HDMI 2.1, eARC should help eliminate any audio sync issues when gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1vZyaA8jMjjBjGYicNz9Vpl-9_4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849139/beam_back_white.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sonos&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Same ports on back, same buttons on top.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YEplw7"&gt;Here’s another bit of welcome news: Sonos says it will roll out support for DTS surround later this year for all soundbars that are on its S2 platform. That extends back to products like the Playbar and Playbase, so quite a few devices will be gaining the added functionality. Sonos is also jumping on board with high-resolution audio and Dolby Atmos music streaming. The company says it’ll support both of those features from Amazon Music in the coming months; no word on Apple Music, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fBeUq"&gt;Aside from its slight design refinements, a faster processor, and the inclusion of Atmos, the second-gen Beam otherwise sticks to what made the first model work well: it’s compact and a nice match for apartment renters or anyone who wants to step up their TV and movie sound quality for much less money than the far larger, more powerful Arc. Of course, you also get a Sonos speaker out of the deal and all the multi-room audio system perks that come with buying in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCc27E"&gt;The main question that remains is how well Sonos can make Atmos work on a soundbar that lacks height speakers. The new Beam was never going to measure up to the company’s &lt;s&gt;$800&lt;/s&gt; $900 flagship Arc soundbar, but I’m looking forward to seeing whether Sonos can really trick my brain into believing the second-gen Beam is more than meets the eye. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s WF-1000XM3 are back down to their best-ever price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OJIVgWqTCXGGVFSll4nwmvMPtME=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855743/cwelch_190702_3528_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bTVQps"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfz4fSFppx7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T81554H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are hosting a deal on Sony’s WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds that offer stellar sound quality and active noise cancellation. Originally $229, they’re available from Amazon in the black or silver colorways for $148. Best Buy has them for $150. This model includes a USB-C charging case and multiple sets of ear tips to help you find a perfect fit. The XM3s have been outclassed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s own XM4&lt;/a&gt; that released in June 2021, but this older model is still a great value. We called the XM3 “the best AirPods rival” at the time of release, citing their lengthy battery life, effective noise cancellation, and seriously good sound quality. Given that their price has dropped sharply (and that the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T81554H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;XM4 cost a staggering $278&lt;/a&gt;), it’s an especially great time to consider buying these. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HBOJFx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9740037"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G8S6am"&gt;It’s “Samsung Week” at Amazon (funny timing, given it’s Apple day) and the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Platform-Computer-Processor-Long-Lasting/dp/B091VBW5SX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for its best price ever&lt;/a&gt;. Typically $1,300, today you can pick up the 15.6-inch laptop with an OLED screen, an Intel Core i7 processor, and 512GB of storage for $1,100 in either the mystic blue or mystic silver colorway (stock may sell out soon, though). Other models are also on sale, including the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Platform-Computer-Processor-Long-Lasting/dp/B0932M22JB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13.3-inch variant&lt;/a&gt;, which boasts similar specs but is selling for $1,000 instead of $1,200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFnRBa"&gt;If portability matters a lot to you, the Galaxy Book Pro laptop is ultralight — so light, in fact, that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405540/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-features-price-photos-video-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our reviewer dubbed it&lt;/a&gt; one of “the lightest laptops you can buy, period.” It‘s also one of Samsung’s first OLED Windows PCs featuring the new “AMOLED” display, which supposedly emits less blue light than other LCD panels. Additionally, the laptop boasts Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors, which we found worked nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sq3qxY"&gt;Keep in mind that Amazon is currently restocking some versions at the moment, like the 15.6-inch, 512GB configuration in mystic blue. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405540/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-features-price-photos-video-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vB8mwC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iEigBM"&gt;If you’re more of an Apple fan, the AirPods Pro are currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZPC9QD4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $180&lt;/a&gt;, just $10 shy of their lowest price to date. As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s true wireless earbuds differ dramatically from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, offering better sound quality and a bigger case. They also boast excellent active noise cancellation, seamless integration with iOS, and support for Apple’s spatial audio, a phenomenal — albeit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;inconsistent&lt;/a&gt; — feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631444/netflix-spatial-audio-support-iphone-ipad-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix now supports&lt;/a&gt; on both the iPhone and iPad. The rumored, third-generation AirPods could make their debut as soon as today during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s “California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt;, but we don’t anticipate them offering up ANC or support for spatial audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v4zy5f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XSzdz8"&gt;For those who find the AirPods Pro too expensive, there are the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836602-13527013?sid=VergeDailyDealsRoundUp091321&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fbeats-studio-anc-true-wireless-buds-1%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Studio Buds&lt;/a&gt;, which are now selling for their lowest price to date at Woot. Typically $150, Amazon Prime members can pick up a refurbished pair with a one-year limited warranty &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836602-13527013?sid=VergeDailyDealsRoundUp091321&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fbeats-studio-anc-true-wireless-buds-1%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $110 through September&lt;/a&gt; or while supplies last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0HbpB"&gt;The Studio Buds are the first pair of Beats wireless earbuds to include active noise cancellation; they also boast support for Android features, come with a USB-C charging case, and have an IPX4 water-resistant design. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted how we enjoyed the small, comfortable design while commending the sound quality, especially given the price tag. Earbuds like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Buds/dp/B085WV7635?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s second-gen Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; offer superior noise cancellation, sure, but if you’re in the market for a comfortable pair of wireless earbuds that don’t break the bank, this could be a good deal to consider — especially if you’re an Android user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iDEfJi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10693512"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zWiEn0"&gt;Finally, five months after they made their debut, Amazon is offering one of its first discounts on a four-pack of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932QJ2JZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;​​Apple AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, which launched in April. Normally $99, you can currently purchase a pack of the ultra-wideband-ready Bluetooth trackers for $95 instead, a slight discount but one of the first we’ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6z3VzQ"&gt;The AirTag is an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;impressive tracker&lt;/a&gt; that offers a number of privacy and security features, like end-to-end encryption. It’s a good buy for those deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem, as it works only with Apple devices and offers features third-party devices can’t. The coin-like trackers don’t have a lanyard hole, but, fortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932PNC7S/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s leather AirTag loop&lt;/a&gt; is also on sale in either &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932PNC7S/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;brown&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932P4DG3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; for $33 or $35, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="xGmeLl"&gt;For a limited time, Newegg is throwing in a $25 gift card when you pick up the Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap with a battery and a carrying case for &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=VergeDealsRoundUo091321&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Foculus-301-00370-01-strap%2Fp%2F26-910-019" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$129 from its site&lt;/a&gt;. The built-in battery is rechargeable and the case is capable of carrying your headset, the ergonomic strap, your controllers, the charging cable, and a power adapter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wt9jsX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Upload VR&lt;/em&gt;, a VR-focused trade publication, praised the product &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-quest-2-elite-battery-strap-review/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in its review&lt;/a&gt;, calling it the most comfortable accessory Facebook offers for the Quest 2. The publication also praised the battery life after testing it, noting it doubles your maximum playtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WjTzmt"&gt;Newegg is also offering a $10 gift card through the end of today if you prefer to purchase the elite strap or carrying case separately. Note that the gift cards will be sent four days after you make your purchase and will expire a year after you receive them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I hate the new Windows 11 taskbar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qmi-N0_jDiEJBYk0oDx7FMgkt60=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855647/windows11darkmode.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7AvFvp"&gt;Microsoft promotes itself as &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;productivity company, but the new Windows 11 taskbar removes key functionality and makes me less productive as a result. Missing features include power user elements like displaying the time and date on multiple monitors, or simple things like having small icons and being able to move the taskbar around. There’s so much missing here that I’m stunned Microsoft is shipping a new OS that takes the Windows taskbar back decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jsj1Ga"&gt;While this missing functionality initially seemed like bugs or unfinished code, it’s clear Microsoft now intends to ship the taskbar like this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649940/windows-11-release-date-features-devices-free-upgrade"&gt;on October 5th&lt;/a&gt;. I personally use three monitors on my PC, and if I’m using a fullscreen app or a game on my primary one, I can’t see the date or time on my other monitors. This sounds like a small issue, but it’s glanceable information I look at multiple times a day and rely on. I simply don’t understand why Microsoft would remove this in the name of simplification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="paxSPz"&gt;Another big missing feature is being able to drag and drop files onto taskbar apps. I commonly drag images from File Explorer onto the Adobe Photoshop icon on my taskbar, where it will bring the app into focus and open the file. This no longer works, and you’re presented with a giant red cross instead. This is basic functionality that has existed in Windows for years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5TTISQ1bKQXvL6RmPDSHVmErZV8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849280/qz7kU7v.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No more dragging and dropping on the taskbar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yTQqBe"&gt;Elsewhere, the taskbar has been overhauled to remove a lot of the customization Windows users are used to. You can’t enable small icons anymore or ungroup icons. You can’t even move the taskbar to the top or sides of your screen, or adjust its height. Many users are also missing the Task Manager not being part of the taskbar context menu, or the many other cascade and windowing options that were previously there. Instead, the taskbar context menu has been reduced to a single taskbar settings option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orZGZr"&gt;The system tray is also worse in Windows 11 compared to Windows 10. You can’t easily hide system icons, and the whole area feels a little too simplified for my liking. The modernization of Windows 11 is great, but the taskbar really lets the OS down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWWpi0"&gt;I’ve been testing Windows 11 since its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553639/microsoft-windows-11-download-available-preview-features"&gt;initial preview release in June&lt;/a&gt;, and I honestly expected the taskbar to improve in time for release. After every preview release, I boot into Windows 11 expecting to see taskbar improvements, only to switch back to Windows 10 after a few minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZiwdV9fTcEv9_sHGiUzYUSKhsp0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849276/YKc8oDJ.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is how the taskbar appears on multiple monitors in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wonAMG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Windows 11 will be the first version of Windows I won’t be upgrading to on my main PC&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JC5Kxs"&gt;Because of this taskbar, Windows 11 will be the first version of Windows I won’t be upgrading to on my main PC. I’ve lived through Windows Vista and Windows 8, but even then, Microsoft at least allowed people to re-enable the interface elements they had grown used to. In Windows 11 you’ll need to apply registry hacks or use third-party programs to get the taskbar you’re used to, and those workarounds could break after any OS update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zL4A8T"&gt;I’m not the only person complaining about the taskbar, in fact there have been countless feedback threads in Microsoft’s official Windows Feedback Hub in recent months that highlight these issues. Microsoft tells me it’s listening to user feedback, but it clearly hasn’t acted on most of it in time for release. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JEBbgflYMNnExQ5EO5GGOPCNq2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849265/OMNZhiS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows 11 taskbar has a really basic context menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vmIFTG"&gt;“Windows 11 was built on the design principles of making Windows effortless, calmer, and more personal, while still feeling familiar,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Taskbar, like many other parts of Windows 11, was redesigned from the ground up guided by these principles. As with every experience in Windows 11, we’re constantly listening and learning, and welcome customer feedback that helps shape Windows. Windows 11 will continue to evolve over time; if we learn from user experience that there are ways to make improvements, we will do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUXRdz"&gt;I still haven’t heard a good explanation for this basic loss of functionality, but I suspect most of the features are missing because Microsoft rebuilt the taskbar for Windows 10X. Windows 10X was originally going to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20889000/microsoft-surface-neo-windows-10x-hands-on-features-price-photos-release-date"&gt;run on dual-screen devices&lt;/a&gt;, before Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246561/microsoft-windows-10x-single-screens-windows-usage-demand-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;reworked it for laptops&lt;/a&gt; and then moved to Windows 11 instead. Microsoft simplified the taskbar in Windows 10X greatly, and many other parts of the OS. That hasn’t translated well back to desktop PCs, or for power users of Windows that rely on the taskbar daily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwiwho"&gt;I’m hopeful that Microsoft will once again prove that it listens to its Windows users, but until then I’m staying clear of Windows 11 for now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 may finally get features Android has had for years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZJ80i-6mzVET3bBSxNSOoqLHlxc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855600/vpavic_4243_20201017_0077.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="APrmyo"&gt;It’s new iPhone day. And as with any new smartphone announcement these days, we have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"&gt;fairly decent idea of what to expect&lt;/a&gt;. Leaks and rumors are more accurate than ever, and though there’s always the potential of a big surprise, the most likely scenario is the iPhone 13 will be what we think it will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXjXsF"&gt;Just because the rumors are clear doesn’t mean they’re not exciting, though. This year, the iPhone 13 (we assume that’s the name) will have some new technology in the same design. New designs tend to drive big upgrade cycles, but it’s the second year of the design that usually has the most interesting refinements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYQuJJ"&gt;We can list them out fairly quickly. There should be four iterations again: a Mini, a regular, a Pro, and a Pro Max. The higher-end iPhones should have an LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) display, a low-power kind of OLED screen that makes it easier to have a variable refresh rate. The processors will be faster. The MagSafe charging system will be tweaked. There may be new storage options. The camera will be better, with improvements specifically in HDR and Portrait Mode video — plus astrophotography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgAmZ3"&gt;All those specs will translate into some newer, nicer experiences. There’s one in particular I want to focus on: the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aiwNKM"&gt;The LTPO display should mean that the iPhone can finally have an always-on lock screen. It should also finally enable smoother transitions as the screen ratchets from some tiny number of Hz to some large number like 120Hz instead of being locked at 60Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlObj2"&gt;Notice the “finallys” in that last paragraph. They’re there because variable refresh rates and always-on screens have been available on Android phones since... forever. In fact, if you run down the rumored features of the new iPhones, many of them appeared first on Android. In addition to high refresh rate screens, there’s better quality wide-angle cameras, huge storage, portrait mode video, and astrophotography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZVR57R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What to expect from Apple’s iPhone 13 event","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"},{"title":"iPhone 13 might finally bring a smaller notch and faster screens ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3X0Ms9"&gt;Though the specs may be copied, the question comes back to the “experience.” The cliche with Apple is that it rarely does something first, but instead comes in later with refinements and does it &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt;. That cliche exists because it’s often right. You may have been able to turn on portrait mode for video on a Samsung phone since 2019, but believe me, you wouldn’t want to use it for anything important, because it’s bad. Apple’s, hopefully, will be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8kodL"&gt;That narrative isn’t always correct, though. In some cases, it just papers over Apple just being straight up late to including a piece of technology. I am open to being wrong, but I hesitate to believe that it’s possible to make an always-on lock screen experience so insanely great that that every one before feels broken. It’s a lock screen you can glance at! There’s only so much to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKlarI"&gt;An always-on lock screen is also super useful! Being able to quickly see the time, date, and some notification icons is the sort of low-pressure ambient information a phone should be able to provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CmqUr"&gt;Variable refresh rates are a little less useful, but so much nicer. They can preserve battery life by slowing down refresh rates. They can match the screen’s refresh rate to the content (eg. in a movie or a game). And they can make animations and scrolling look so much smoother. And yet, the only notable Apple devices to feature a high refresh rate are its high-end iPads. Meanwhile, every high-end Android phone and many midrangers have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pDPDDu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Does Apple feel competitive pressure to include small, nice-to-have features?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LOAVkN"&gt;I’m honestly a little baffled as to why it’s taken Apple this long to make such obviously nice features. One possible explanation — and maybe the most likely — is simply that Apple has felt no competitive pressure to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSKNkN"&gt;On Android, there are so many phones to choose from that the need to differentiate is urgently and keenly felt by every manufacturer. So a feature as minor as an always-on display could make the difference in somebody’s purchasing decision. But I struggle to imagine the person that would choose an Android phone over an iPhone simply because they like glancing down at the time on their phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4sDXo"&gt;So: why launch a variable refresh rate screen now? It’s gotten to the point where it’s a little embarrassing — many reviews of the iPhone 12 models pointed out this missing spec. And though iOS does still look smooth and feel fast at 60Hz, going to 120Hz has been Android’s brute force way of catching up in those departments. Switching iOS up to 120Hz could push Apple ahead again. So there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; some competitive pressure, it just takes a bit longer to show up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWjTGE"&gt;I also suspect that Apple was simply waiting for component prices to come down and manufacturing yields to go up. The scale at which Apple needs to make phones makes both a requirement. But I feel like if Apple felt a little more competitive pressure, it could have pushed more aggressively to solve those problems sooner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HkL1bU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Android vs. Android is a war of tiny differences — iPhone vs. Android is something else entirely&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xI9kyI"&gt;The point here is that there are lots of little features that iPhone users are missing out on simply because they’re not compelling enough on their own to convince people to switch. Under-screen fingerprint sensors on Android phones have gone from mediocre to great in just a few short years. Telephoto lenses are folded into periscopes that run along the lengths of the phone for even longer zooms. Screens are interrupted by only tiny little punch holes for selfie cameras (or, in some cases, not interrupted at all). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8cgbX"&gt;These are all niceties that aren’t a huge loss if you’re an iPhone user — well worth the tradeoff for the ecosystem, hardware quality, and performance you get with the average iPhone. They come first to Android because the pressure to compete against other Android phones is so intense that any little advantage matters. If there are two new phones on the store shelf that are very nearly the same but one has an always-on screen, well, that’s the one you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABsfZ0"&gt;iOS and Android are not at all the same, though. So when it comes to bringing these smaller hardware features to the iPhone, I can’t help but think that the competitive pressure Apple feels most urgently isn’t the smartphones you see on the store shelf. It’s the iPhone you’ve got in your pocket. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Apple’s ‘California Streaming’ event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Holds Event Virtually" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YJDjIb6_70pdn3aNO-UrqRaF0PY=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855414/1221930031.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m80YT8"&gt;It’s September, which means iPhone season is just nearly here. The rumor mill has been spinning about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;highly anticipated iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654621/apple-watch-series-7-new-watchfaces-bigger-screens"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;, a third generation of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534123/apple-airpods-3-pro-2-2021-chip-design-battery-life-true-wireless-earbuds-headphones-homepod"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, and the potential for new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;MacBooks&lt;/a&gt;. A new, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels"&gt;bezel-less iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; is also a possibility, as is the official release of iOS 15 and macOS Monterey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HiZ05"&gt;Since Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22648593/apple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch"&gt;sent out the invite&lt;/a&gt; for its “California Streaming” event, we’ve been able to take guesses at what hidden meanings there might be to decipher from the night sky and the illuminated Apple logo, but just when does it actually get underway and where?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MHCz0z"&gt;What time does the iPhone 13 event start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6Hw1Q3"&gt;Apple’s “California Streaming” event will go live at 10AM PT / 1PM ET today, Tuesday, September 14th. Like all Apple keynotes since the beginning of the pandemic, it will likely amount to a lengthy infomercial recorded and streamed from the Apple Park campus, with everyone from Tim Cook on down presenting. We expect the recording to become available shortly after its debut, too, in the event you miss out on the prerecorded livestream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UFZ2Pg"&gt;Where can I watch the Apple event?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0CHXFL"&gt;Apple is hosting the stream &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-events%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F14%2F22663255%2Fapple-event-iphone-13-live-stream-watch-start-time" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on its site&lt;/a&gt;, per usual, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvGOlAkLSLw"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve embedded the YouTube video above, so you can set a reminder or watch live from this very post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGebcM"&gt;Also, be sure to keep tabs on our live blog if you can’t watch the video while at work or if you prefer to follow along with our editors as announcements are made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47Wvup"&gt;Other ways to keep up:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="2y8qO6"&gt;Canon confirmed plans for its highest-end mirrorless camera yet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383187/canon-eos-r3-mirrorless-camera-development-announced"&gt;back in April&lt;/a&gt;, but that was just a notice of development — now the company is ready to announce its specs in full. As expected, the EOS R3 will sit right at the top of the company’s still fairly new EOS R range of full-frame mirrorless cameras, above last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318398/canon-eos-r5-announced-8k-price-specs-release-date"&gt;R5 and R6&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NxcnO"&gt;The 24-megapixel stacked BSI sensor is lower resolution than the 45-megapixel R5’s, but the R3 is all about high speed, fast AF performance, and low light capability. Canon says it can shoot at up to 30fps with the electronic shutter and 12fps with the mechanical shutter, and the maximum native ISO is 102,400. As for video, the R3 can shoot 6K at 60fps and uncropped 10-bit 4K at 120fps in the Canon Log 3 profile.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oUxDi_c_ju3WaVmt2ieAFGjdDrs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849228/HR_EOS_R3_7_CL.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xUJMZp"&gt;The R3 makes use of deep learning technology to improve eye and body detection and autofocus, according to Canon, and photographers can select an initial AF point with eye tracking just by looking at an area of the 5.76-million-dot electronic viewfinder. The R3 has 1,053 AF points in total, though Canon isn’t saying quite how granular the eye-input system gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8knyi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVstWLb-flM"&gt;YouTube’s CVP channel&lt;/a&gt; provides a good demonstration of the new eye controlled AF point selection, noting that it uses low-powered IR LEDs inside the viewfinder to scan where the eyes are looking. The channel calls the tech “hit and miss” for different users, but says it makes focusing “pretty simple” when it does work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="KNMrBl"&gt;As previously revealed, the R3 looks quite similar to the EOS-1D X Mark III, which essentially occupies the same place in Canon’s DSLR lineup. It uses a one-piece magnesium alloy design with a built-in vertical grip, and Canon says it has equivalent weather and dust resistance to the EOS-1D DSLRs. The body has wired LAN, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB-C built-in, as well as one CFexpress card slot and one UHS-II SD card slot. There’s also a vari-angle 3.2-inch LCD screen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7oHGEo"&gt;The EOS R3 will be available in November for $5,999,99. Canon is also introducing two new relatively affordable lenses for the EOS R system: a $299.99 16mm f/2.8 compact ultrawide prime and a $649.99 100-400mm f/5.6-8 telephoto zoom. Both of those will go on sale at some point next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkBPAO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 14th, 6:20AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added video demonstration of eye controlled AF point selection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
