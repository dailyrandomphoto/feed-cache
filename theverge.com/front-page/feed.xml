    <title>Blue Origin successfully sends William Shatner and crew to edge of space and back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r8mvnQDN2cZ3gGonQ6QTl41SBtw=/8x0:2180x1448/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988895/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_10.54.14_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Blue Origin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AGRWvk"&gt;Famed Star Trek actor William Shatner and a crew of three fellow passengers successfully flew to the edge of space and back this morning on Blue Origin’s New Shepard tourist rocket. The foursome took off from Blue Origin’s launch facility in Van Horn, Texas at 9:50AM ET, climbed to an altitude of roughly 66 miles up, and then safely landed back on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVUxrv"&gt;Flying alongside Shatner today were two paying customers and a Blue Origin employee. They included Chris Boshuizen, co-founder of small satellite company Planet Labs, and Glen de Vries, co-founder of Medidata, a software company. Audrey Powers, vice president of mission and flight operations at Blue Origin, represented the company on the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4IxzLP"&gt;This morning’s flight, lasting just a little over 10 minutes in length, marks the second successful crewed launch for Blue Origin on the New Shepard rocket. The company’s first crewed launch on July 20th carried Blue Origin’s founder and former CEO of Amazon Jeff Bezos. He flew along with his brother, Mark, a Dutch teenager, and legendary aviator Wally Funk. When Funk flew, she became the oldest person in space at 82 years old, but this morning, 90-year-old Shatner surpassed her.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The crew of today’s flight: Audrey Powers, William Shatner, Chris Boshuizen, and Glen de Vries, with Crew Member 7 Sarah Knights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MPxcXm"&gt;New Shepard is the company’s primary rocket at the moment. The vehicle is suborbital, so it cannot achieve enough speed to get into orbit around the Earth. Instead, it’s capable of launching crews to the edge of space and back so that riders can experience weightlessness for a few minutes. To get to space, crews launch strapped inside a crew capsule, perched on top of the rocket. Once high above the Earth, the capsule and rocket separate and passengers briefly float throughout the cabin. Then, both pieces of the vehicle fall back to Earth; the capsule lands under parachutes while the rocket reignites its engine and lands upright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WGa54"&gt;Though Shatner’s flight was ultimately a success, it comes amid a tumultuous time for Blue Origin. Just before the mission, 21 current and former employees published a damning essay, criticizing Blue Origin’s culture as both sexist and unsafe. A recent &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; investigation also revealed employees think Blue Origin has “an authoritarian bro culture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VEPdlb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GB6ZiL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit’s latest feature turns predictions into a tournament</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0YcCR1OERsx3MYwuIwbBopiDudk=/0x0:1158x772/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988846/ApplicationFrameHost_sgcOT2vcbX.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users pick a prediction and bet tokens on the outcome.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Reddit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IB77Sp"&gt;Reddit has officially launched its new Predictions feature after piloting it for almost a year. It lets users compete by guessing the outcome of upcoming events like sports matches or awards ceremonies. Predictions build upon, and gamify, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21191119/reddit-poll-post-type-nfl-super-bowl-survey"&gt;site’s existing Polls feature&lt;/a&gt; from last year, allowing users to bet and earn tokens based on successful predictions as part of miniature tournaments. There’s no real money involved, just bragging rights, though Reddit says Premium members “&lt;a href="https://reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407383251860#:~:text=nope%2C%20no%20purchase%20necessary.%20however%2C%20reddit%20premium%20members%20may%20get%20special%20advantages%20or%20benefits%20in%20the%20future%2C%20so%20stay%20tuned!%20"&gt;may get special advantages or benefits in the future.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SW8IQ"&gt;Predictions tournaments can only be posted by moderators and consist of a series of questions for users to bet on the answers to. This list can be expanded by moderators as the tournament progresses. Each user who participates is given 1,000 free tokens to answer the questions posed, like which film could win Best Picture at the next Oscars. If they’re right, then they get a share of the winnings; but if they make too many wrong predictions and lose all their tokens, then they’re out of the tournament. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mp-teOXHFX-IctVSCST4NUs8bEk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923340/pasted_image_0__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Reddit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example Prediction question.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9P1m22"&gt;It’s important to note that although Reddit allows users to pay for features like Reddit Premium, the Predictions feature currently doesn’t involve any real money. Tokens are distributed for free to anyone who wants to take part, and at the end of the tournament they’re used to calculate a leaderboard of its winners. Tokens are nontransferable and cannot be carried over between tournaments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhK39q"&gt;Reddit has been testing its Predictions feature in select subreddits for almost a year now and says over a million people have already taken part in tournaments. Past tournaments have involved guessing the outcomes of the Oscars, the 2021 Formula 1 Grand Prix, and this year’s Euros soccer tournament. Now, however, the feature is rolling out to any subreddit with more than 10,000 members.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gaming and apparel brand 100 Thieves is getting into hardware with its first acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XGOPlaejsEvJvyQX3jy83KS9jI0=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988746/100_Thieves_x_Higround_Collab_Keyboard.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gzFFxx"&gt;100 Thieves, a gaming organization known for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20849569/100-thieves-nadeshot-esports-supreme-drake"&gt;esports teams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21211236/100-thieves-apparel-collection-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch"&gt;apparel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372759/valkyrae-courage-100-thieves-co-owners-nadeshot"&gt;big-name streamers&lt;/a&gt;, is announcing its first acquisition: the gaming peripheral company &lt;a href="https://higround.co/password"&gt;Higround&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXb9Ic"&gt;If you aren’t familiar, Higround makes what might be best described as designer gaming peripherals. (To get an idea of what that means, check out &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/higround/"&gt;Higround’s Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, which is filled with pictures of colorful keyboards.) It releases its products in limited drops and says that every one of them has sold out. The company’s work even includes a collaboration with &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CUfbp0kplMc/"&gt;Apple’s Beats&lt;/a&gt;, though it had a limited distribution and wasn’t for sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BwhPpU"&gt;100 Thieves is a gaming brand that’s similarly well known for its designer gear (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20849569/100-thieves-nadeshot-esports-supreme-drake"&gt;in its case, apparel&lt;/a&gt;) that’s released in drops, so you might be able to see why it and Higround are something of a match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoNj4K"&gt;“For a long time, your setup was just this generic canvas that everybody had,” 100 Thieves founder and CEO Matthew “Nadeshot” Haag said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. He talked about how the differences might have just come down to how many hertz your monitor was capable of or if someone else had a lighter mouse than you. With Higrounds, though, 100 Thieves sees an opportunity to help people make a desk setup that’s more representative of who they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="visMzx"&gt;Higround co-founder Rustin Sotoodeh discussed a similar vision. “Everyone should have access to an incredible keyboard or beautiful design,” Sotoodeh said, and he hopes he can make that a reality as a result of the acquisition. (That would include offering products that are always available, instead of just in drops.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhfR3F"&gt;Haag also sees a chance to shake up the keyboard market. “From my perspective, unless you’re a keyboard enthusiast, if you’re a casual gamer and you go to the store, there’s only like two products that are offered: a black keyboard and a white keyboard,” Haag said. “And there’s a lot of brands that I have a ton of respect for, but I still think that there’s room in the market for there to be a marquee brand that everybody gravitates towards because of the stories that they tell and the image that they portray.” Higround recently brought on Baron Lee, a former HyperX executive, to head up product development, signaling that it’s staffing up to take on some of the big names in gaming peripherals. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZWSpoi8NkHVsw8pMsKK1Ya7Pkfk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923148/Sandstone.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Higround&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Higround’s Sandstone keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mv0YND"&gt;Neither Haag nor Sotoodeh commented on the terms of the deal, but Haag did discuss how Higround will operate as an independent company. “What we want to help Higround do is just accelerate their growth,” Haag said. “We don’t want to take over their identity, we don’t want to go too far deep into 100 Thieves injecting its DNA into Higround.” A press release is more explicit, spelling out that 100 Thieves will “serve as an accelerator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLcJS1"&gt;As part of the acquisition, the two companies will team up on a “special product capsule,” which includes a hoodie and the custom keyboard (which you can see at the top of this post). You’ll be able to buy the capsule on October 15th at 3PM ET on &lt;a href="https://higround.co/"&gt;Higround’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FsnVN"&gt;It doesn’t sound like 100 Thieves is jumping into the deep end with hardware just yet, though. “Higround, from a hardware and peripherals standpoint, is our bet, and we’re going to help them as they continue to grow over the next couple of years,” Haag said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCWW5l"&gt;Haag also didn’t commit to making more acquisitions anytime soon. “R​​ight now, Higround is the main focus, and we’re excited to invest all of our resources and all of our time into helping them succeed,” he said. “And then we’ll see what comes down the road in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon India allegedly rigged search results and ripped off sellers’ products</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hr6z_jiGUg19IEVXzjhVmAf-C6s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988727/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="StEPDZ"&gt;Amazon allegedly used its search system and user data to gain an edge over sellers in India, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-rigging/"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The report — based on internal emails, strategy plans, and other documents — outlines an ambitious plan to dominate the platform with its in-house brands. According to the documents, that plan included strategies that Amazon has vehemently denied using amid antitrust scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLy8TG"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; story provides extensive details about Amazon India’s alleged activity, but two key pieces stand out. The first is a claim that Amazon employees used “search seeding” (or boosting the rankings of specific product listings) to ensure that company brands like AmazonBasics appeared “in the first two or three” search results for a category. The second, more extensive allegation involves Amazon identifying “reference” or “benchmark” products that are popular with customers and then copying them. At least two high-level executives allegedly reviewed the plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hHfCbl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The claims mirror earlier accusations against Amazon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PjIAKR"&gt;Amazon’s copying process apparently went beyond simply &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20982653/allbirds-ceo-amazon-copy-shoe-environment-sustainability-steal"&gt;cloning the look&lt;/a&gt; of well-known products. The documents reportedly indicate Amazon India employees examined internal data like how often customers returned purchases and then designed products based around it. &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; quotes one 2016 report about an in-house brand called Solimo, whose strategy was to “use information from Amazon.in to develop products and then leverage the Amazon.in platform to market these products to our customers.” The report also described plans to partner with the original manufacturers of reference products to capture “unique processes which impact the end quality of the product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsHX4G"&gt;Amazon denied the allegations in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, calling them “factually incorrect and unsubstantiated.” But they mirror claims from other countries. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015?mod=article_inline"&gt;A 2020 &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; found that Amazon employees had studied detailed internal sales data to help it crush independent sellers with competing products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKAk1k"&gt;Amazon told the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; that the tactic was strictly prohibited among employees and denied the claims in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21349440/amazon-marketplace-third-party-sellers-antitrust-hearing-jeff-bezos"&gt;a US congressional hearing&lt;/a&gt;, although &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21347083/jeff-bezos-amazon-tech-antitrust-hearing-jayapal-questioning"&gt;then-CEO Jeff Bezos said&lt;/a&gt; he couldn’t “guarantee” that the policy had never been violated. Throughout questioning, however, Bezos portrayed possible violations as the actions of rogue employees — not the kind of formal strategy that &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; describes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BjNPFx"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/technology/amazon-bezos-india-antitrust.html"&gt;Amazon is under investigation in India&lt;/a&gt; for alleged anti-competitive behavior. (Regulators are also investigating its Walmart-backed competitor Flipkart.) The investigation covers potentially anti-competitive behavior around self-branded products like AmazonBasics.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose’s new SoundLink Flex speaker has a rugged design and ‘astonishing’ sound</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_1j9AV2SEpvuuG-0SlM9Q5KoFA8=/0x0:1385x923/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988678/Large_JPG_SLFBS_StoneBlue_0004_RGB.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2TQPIB"&gt;Bose is introducing its first new portable Bluetooth speaker in quite a while. The $149 &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.bose.com/en_us/pressroom/featured/soundlink_flex_bluetooth_speaker.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SoundLink Flex&lt;/a&gt; has a ruggedized design with an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, 12-hour battery life, and what Bose claims is “astonishing” audio performance for its size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTsjKG"&gt;At 7.9 inches wide, 3.6 inches high, 2.1 inches deep, and weighing slightly over one pound, the SoundLink Flex is nicely compact and has a built-in utility loop for attaching to a carabiner. It’ll be sold in three colors: there’s black, smoke white, and blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VTHocw"&gt;Inside the SoundLink Flex is a custom transducer that Bose says is “as big as could fit” and capable of producing “bass that you can feel in your chest.” Using a feature that Bose calls “PositionIQ,” the speaker can detect what orientation its in — upright, hanging, or flat on its back — and tune audio output accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/as8hJjVPfsoPXe6NCoOamt8DGfM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923469/Large_JPG_SLFBS_Black_0280_RGB.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bose&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The speaker is designed to withstand the elements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6eDLoA"&gt;The speaker has a silicone back and powder-coated steel grille, and Bose claims it’s designed to resist corrosion and fend off any discoloration from UV light. With that IP67 rating, it’s a pool-safe speaker, and Bose says it’ll float to the surface when dropped into water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q48L61"&gt;There’s nothing particularly “smart” about the SoundLink Flex, but it can be linked up with any Bose smart speakers or soundbars you’ve got at home. And you can stereo pair it with another SoundLink Flex or a different Bose portable speaker. There’s also a built-in microphone for taking calls and interacting with the voice assistant on your phone. (Bose still sells the much pricier Portable Smart Speaker for $400 with built-in voice capabilities, but you can do better for less money than that.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YybCtn_xw59-9KulHGF9JKkonQ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923499/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_9.43.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bose&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Controls are located at the top.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w3vekH"&gt;At $149, the SoundLink undercuts products like the Sonos Roam, though it doesn’t match that speaker’s wide set of features. Bose also has to contend with impressive Bluetooth speaker competition from JBL, UE, and others. Still, the company’s portable speakers have a way of sounding much better than you’d expect based on their size, so I’m looking forward to hearing what the SoundLink Flex is capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s new ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Edition laptop uses eye-tracking cameras for a glasses-free 3D display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SzP9zSjJVlMXSPyBLCrTKJ76fyE=/0x125:3000x2125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988540/ConceptD_7_SpatialLabs_Edition_CN715_73G_05.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3BtWws"&gt;Acer is finally bringing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22451850/acer-spatiallabs-3d-content-rendering-conceptd-7-pro"&gt;glasses-free 3D SpatialLabs tech&lt;/a&gt; to a laptop you can buy: the company has officially announced the ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="L6hfTo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Acer’s new SpatialLabs tech brings 3D content to laptop screens","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22451850/acer-spatiallabs-3d-content-rendering-conceptd-7-pro"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OPdIS9"&gt;Announced earlier this year, SpatialLabs combines a suite of hardware and software features. These features include a special stereo camera with two sensors that track your eyes and head, an optical lens on the display that refracts the two slightly different images to your eyes, and rendering software that adjusts the 3D images in real time as you move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylCGQG"&gt;As part of its ConceptD lineup of products for designers and developers, Acer’s pitch here is that the 3D display will allow for users to see 3D projects for CAD designs, 3D printing, architecture, or animation in three dimensions, instead of trying to approximate things on a 2D screen. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Monica Chin got to try out the hardware earlier this year and called it “quite impressive,” even if the actual usefulness of the technology still remains to be seen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z0JmW9lB68-K2gx6RYOvqVe8xH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923500/ConceptD_7_SpatialLabs_Edition_CN715_73G_Lifestyle_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer imagines developers using the ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Edition as a design tool alongside larger displays.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BlsWka"&gt;Of course, a 3D display is nothing without 3D content, and Acer is providing a few tools out of the box, like the SpatialLabs Model Viewer, which allows you to import 3D files from apps like Autodesk Fusion 360, Rhinoceros, and ZBrush. It also says that it’s working with developers on more integrated solutions for the future, although the limited availability of the tech to this single laptop (so far) means that rollout will likely be slow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1fQrt"&gt;The company is also offering a SpatialLabs Go app, with AI enhancements that Acer says will allow you to convert 2D content (including “videos, images, simple games, and the webcam feed of participants during a video conference or video call”) to stereoscopic 3D. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5r5Ni"&gt;Fancy 3D tricks aside, the rest of the ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Edition is a top-tier laptop (it has to be, in order to accomplish all the real-time rendering and 3D modeling for which Acer envisions it being used). While Acer isn’t offering exact configurations yet, it can be configured with Intel Core i7-11800H processors, up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM (which is user upgradable to up to 64GB), an Nvidia RTX 3080, and a 2TB NVMe SSD. There’s only a single display option, naturally: a 15.6-inch LCD panel that offers 3840 x 2160 resolution in 2D mode or 1920 x 2160 in 3D mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4M5dMd"&gt;That kind of hardware doesn’t come cheap, though: Acer says that the ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Edition will launch in December in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa starting at an eye-watering €3,599 (or about $4,160.32). It’ll also be available in North America sometime in 2022, but the exact price and release date haven’t been announced yet. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OCxJfKDjTJTCN_wQF1vBZpVrZLc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923502/ConceptD_3_Ezel_CC315_73_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new ConceptD 3 Ezel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c9EeNZ"&gt;Acer is also updating its other ConceptD 3 laptops today: the clamshell ConceptD 3 and ConceptD 3 Pro are getting new 16-inch displays with 16:10 aspect ratios, in addition to a new 15.6-inch convertible ConceptD 3 Ezel and ConceptD 3 Ezel (which brings the existing hinge design that Acer has offered on its convertible laptops to a more affordable price point). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kz1v7m"&gt;The 16-inch ConceptD 3 and ConceptD 3 Pro will be available in the US in January 2022, starting at $1,699.99 and $1,899.99, respectively. The ConceptD 3 Ezel will be available in November, starting at $1,899.99, while the ConceptD 3 Ezel Pro will hit the US in 2022 starting at $1,999.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s Chromebook 515 is made for business on the go</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook 515 open, to the right, on a clear table. The screen displays The Verge homepage." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yabobuRI4B85WjI3JFWzw4tSZZM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988527/akrales_211012_4789_0011.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Chromebook 515 is a new line from Acer.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nn5aUn"&gt;Like most laptop manufacturers, Acer has been courting remote workers and students with many of its new releases. I’ve spent some time with an early sample of the Chromebook 515, a new line targeting remote business users.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNtILo"&gt;Perhaps most importantly for many work-from-home customers, the 515 looks to be a solid video-conferencing tool. The speakers, with the help of a built-in smart amplifier, deliver audio that’s surprisingly loud and easily fills a room — it’s louder than the audio of many much more expensive Windows laptops I’ve reviewed recently. The webcam has a physical shutter that’s easy to slide back and forth and did a good job keeping me visible in dim light (though it delivered a somewhat grainy picture). There are two built-in microphones as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook 515 open from the front on a clear table.

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="illp8d"&gt;The laptop also has the specs to accommodate a wide range of workloads. My unit has a respectable Core i3-1115G4 — models can also come with a Pentium Gold 7505, a Core i5, or a Core i7 (which will be overkill for most consumers). It performed speedily throughout my daily workload of around a dozen Chrome tabs and had no trouble playing YouTube videos over top. Acer hasn’t provided the battery size but claims you’ll get up to 10 hours. And while the 15.6-inch display isn’t the brightest, it’s quite roomy for multitasking and matte enough not to kick back any intrusive glare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="26sa8z"&gt;The main downside of the Chromebook 515 seems to be that it’s a bit ugly. I wouldn’t call it an eyesore, but it’s got the look of something you might pull off a school laptop cart — the bezels around the panel are chunky, and there’s significant flex in both the lid and the keyboard deck. It does have a nice finish, though, which is comfortable to hold, and it’s fairly portable at 3.75 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65lTnA"&gt;There are technically two Chromebook 515 models: the regular Chromebook 515 and the Chromebook 515 Enterprise. The only difference, as far as I can tell, is that the latter ships with &lt;a href="https://chromeenterprise.google/"&gt;Chrome Enterprise&lt;/a&gt;, which includes extra security and management tools for IT departments. That’s also the only model that currently has a US release date — it’s coming to North America in January 2022, starting at $649.99, and to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa in October with a starting price of €799. The regular model is coming to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa in October and will start at €499. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VDYc7n"&gt;If you’d prefer something a bit smaller, the new 14-inch Chromebook 514 is powered by a MediaTek Kompanio 828 processor. Acer claims that one will get up to 15 hours of battery life. You’ll be able to buy it in North America in December, starting at $399, and in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa in November, starting at €399. The company’s Chromebook Spin 514 and Chromebook Spin 314 have also been updated with 11th-Gen Intel processors. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s Predator gaming projector is one of the first to support variable refresh rate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Acer Predator GD711 projector" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TuT8O579hQbg6kQCT-Sm1M9ANyc=/1x0:1972x1314/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988526/gd711hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just two people enjoying the delights of variable refresh rate on a projector.&lt;/em&gt; | Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gBAHhP"&gt;Acer’s Predator lineup of gaming products now includes two 4K projectors: the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acer.com%2Fac%2Fen%2FUS%2Fcontent%2Fpredator-gm712&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F13%2F22722888%2Facer-predator-gaming-projector-gd711-gm712-variable-refresh-rate-4k-vrr-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GM712&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acer.com%2Fac%2Fen%2FUS%2Fcontent%2Fpredator-gd711&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F13%2F22722888%2Facer-predator-gaming-projector-gd711-gm712-variable-refresh-rate-4k-vrr-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GD711&lt;/a&gt;. Focusing on the GD711 first because that’s the one Acer chose to share the most information on, it’s an LED projector that boasts up to 1,450 ANSI lumens of brightness (or 4,000 LED lumens) with HDR10 support. It supports 4K resolution in standard mode, but it stands out with its variable refresh rate (VRR) mode that’ll display a smoother image as performance fluctuates in powerful consoles, including the Xbox Series X and fast PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXSYhf"&gt;In that mode, it bumps the resolution down from 4K to 1080p resolution but boosts the refresh rate to 120Hz for consoles or up to 240Hz for PCs and notably can dynamically shift the refresh rate as needed. The PS5 supports up to 120Hz at 1080p, but it doesn’t yet work with VRR. I couldn’t find any other projectors on the market that support variable refresh rates (though several high-end TVs do), so this seems like a big feature that Acer has in its court to differentiate itself from other models. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator GD711" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ucxJmcLKvdcfcVstuVzfcPZEtXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22922159/gd711_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A close-up of the GD711.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CFWacJ"&gt;Acer says the GD711 has a wide range of possible throw sizes, though it recommends a 100-inch screen thrown from 8.85 feet away. It’ll ship with the &lt;a href="https://en.aptoide.com/"&gt;Aptoide TV app store built-in&lt;/a&gt;. This model has two HDMI 2.0 ports, an audio-out port, and three USB-A ports. It has an expected lifespan of approximately 30,000 hours in Eco mode or up to 20,000 hours in standard mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjttLj"&gt;Acer hasn’t shared an expected release window for the US, but it’s set to land in China in November for 11,999 Chinese Yuan and in December in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa for 1,499 Euros. Converting these two currencies to the US dollar puts it between $1,700 and $1,860, but keep in mind that this is an approximation on my part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A43mVT"&gt;Coming back to the GM712, it’s a lamp-based 4K gaming projector that’s far brighter than the GD711 with 3,600 ANSI lumens of brightness, and it’s a little more affordable, too. It’s coming to China in November for 10,999 Chinese Yuan, and then to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa in January 2022 for 1,399 Euros. While the slightly cheaper price is nice, it’s heavier than the GD711, and it has a more limited lifespan at about 5,000 hours in standard mode, or up to 12,000 hours in its “ExtremeEco” mode. That said, it does have many of the same features of the GD711, including variable refresh rate, HDR10, and support for up to 240Hz refresh rate for PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator GM712 projector" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lxQvIw8kuQj7zbEaWpFQvhUuGdk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22922166/gm712.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the GM712 lamp-based projector. It comes with the decal, but popcorn and energy drinks sold separately.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="j5poJT"&gt;For those who usually shop for TVs, this might have been a rude awakening that projectors can get pricey. Considering that these pack in some gaming-focused features like fast and variable refresh rates, the high prices start to make sense. If portability is paramount for your gaming setup, then you might want to stay tuned in the coming months for pricing and availability in your region.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker announces Soundcore’s first audio glasses, priced at $200</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LRcvllYVamjBpwnngrsGA3vRad4=/0x4:2040x1364/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988455/_20_Wander_frame_with_male_model.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Anker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hFY010"&gt;Anker is joining in on the trend of glasses that pull double duty as music listening devices. Today the company’s Soundcore brand announced the $199.99 Soundcore Frames. That price gets you the glasses’ temples and a frame of your choosing. The frames can be swapped out for any of the 10 different designs, but the chunky side temples always stay the same polished black style. They’re due to start shipping in mid-November and will be available from Anker’s website, Amazon, and Best Buy among other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBcCBW"&gt;The temples essentially act as true wireless earbuds, with two speakers in each one. This is a strategy we’ve seen from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314474/razer-anzu-smart-glasses-announced-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;other companies like Razer&lt;/a&gt;. In Anker’s case, it makes it simple to switch the temples to a different frame; polarized, blue-light filtering, and prescription lens options will also be available. Additional frame styles will sell for $49.99 each. The company will let people virtually try on frames through its Soundcore smartphone app for Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VW-Um2aFaVEuwZsGGvdYAWfO75A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923411/A3600012_Bluetooth_Audio_Smart_Glasses_TD02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Anker&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The frames easily detach from the temples.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fe1d2E"&gt;There are two speakers on each temple, and in most cases outside, most people won’t notice your glasses are playing music. But if you’ve got the volume up inside, there’ll definitely be some sound leakage to those nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCp9yj"&gt;Battery life is estimated at up to 5.5 hours of continuous playback, and the Soundcore Frames are IPX4 water resistant. Similar to the controls we’ve already seen from Bose and others, they use simple tap and swipe controls on the temples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zg6aHF"&gt;Anker is very much aware this is its first attempt in a category that has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22351451/bose-frames-tempo-audio-sunglasses-review-features"&gt;led by Bose&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;some extent Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and the company is hoping it can do its own part in pushing the concept of audio glasses to wider popularity. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>On The Verge is happening October 22nd and 23rd, and you’re invited</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XlYPPOHcKDl29XQcexxX6AMidVA=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69936061/Stage_2__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of The Verge’s 10-year party at Spring Studios in NYC. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Join us in New York City for live performances, amazing artists and creators, and much more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Kg9Dbv"&gt;Hello, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;friends! It’s almost been 10 years since we launched (can you believe it?), and to celebrate we’re throwing a big party. It’s happening on October 22nd and 23rd in New York City — and &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/Podcast"&gt;we hope you’ll join us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVpRtM"&gt;We’re throwing this party at Spring Studios, which has a rich tradition of bringing creative people together to show off the future of tech, art, and culture. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;will completely transform the space for two days and fill it with special guests, live performances, interactive art and games, awesome food and drink, and an opening night party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="s6d3e5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Join us at On The Verge!","description":"The Verge is turning 10, and you’re invited to help us celebrate in New York City on October 22nd and 23rd. (Hint: get $150 off the standard ticket price with code &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$99NOW&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.)","label":"Buy tickets","url":"https://voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/vergesecondary"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="naCd5g"&gt;Here’s some of what we’re excited about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mZNe56"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;exclusive premiere screening&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pFPdR85yOiM_jt1LXuZmNesYYt0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892324/Springboard_Thumb.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m1cOLZ"&gt;Everyone who attends On The Verge&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will see the debut of our biggest documentary to date, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Springboard: The Secret History of the First Real Smartphone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. A decade before Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, a tiny team of renegades imagined and tried to build the modern smartphone. Nearly forgotten by history, a little startup called Handspring split off from the mainstream tech world to try and invent the future before the present was ready for it. And though Handspring has been relegated to the margins of tech history, many of the predictions they chased in the late 90s would be correct. After the screening, we’ll hold a live Q&amp;amp;A with Dieter and Nilay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TZAiQs"&gt;Live performances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="6JlhL4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbK_dQ5wXGk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n4dwsn"&gt;Our opening night party will feature a live performance by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I73SGyUTsM"&gt;The Stickmen&lt;/a&gt;: an amazing DJ and drummer duo that will transform our expo space with light and sound. And we’ll have a great lineup of other talented DJs to bring the space to life throughout the entire event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8oDjmw"&gt;A one-of-a-kind indie arcade&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fFrKpRby46MNr5VdJ339qsI949k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890465/ef97f32612f5c2179942fd123755ab13.WONDERVILLE.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="95rs8S"&gt;We’ve assembled a wildly creative group of artists &amp;amp; creators to make On The Verge&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;fun and interactive. That includes the folks from &lt;a href="https://www.wonderville.nyc/"&gt;Wonderville arcade in Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, who will be putting together their unique lineup of games for guests to enjoy. (We’re particularly excited about The Giffinator, which will let you put yourself and your friends inside of a &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;animated GIF.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="k5WLcE"&gt;Experimental art&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/39ulcNkSY3OtkZmgjHNc5C-7cC8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890725/Studio_5.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fb72u9"&gt;We’re gathering creators working on the edge of the future, including the wildly talented &lt;a href="http://zach.li/"&gt;Zach Lieberman&lt;/a&gt;: an artist, researcher, and educator who creates performances and installations that take human gestures as input and amplify them in different ways. He’s bringing several works to On The Verge, including &lt;em&gt;Reflection Studies, &lt;/em&gt;which will transform one of the largest spaces at Spring Studios into an interactive art experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DkKPLi"&gt;The Creators Studio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="w3DW5e"&gt;We’re turning the roof of Spring Studios into a space for interactive talks, demos, and performances — including science and tech demos, a creative illustration class, and a repair school hosted by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22702324%2Fon-the-verge-event-date-tickets-guests-creators" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our friends at iFixit&lt;/a&gt;. And if you want to just hang out, you’ll be able to take in spectacular views of the city while enjoying some of the best food and drink it has to offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jVbQ7D"&gt;A special live &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="irKens"&gt;Nilay and Dieter will be joined by &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;alum Joanna Stern and David Pierce to look back at 10 years of &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and talk about their favorite memories from creating the site. Then, they’ll be joined on stage by special guest Yänjaa Wintersoul: an award-winning memory athlete. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;hosts will see if their memory of covering gadgets for a decade can stand up to the skills of a World Memory Champion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dc3rTb"&gt;All-day programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2e8oqK"&gt;On top of all that, our main stage will be packed for both days of the event with live performances and talks with special guests, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
