    <title>Want the ‘TLDR’ on a site’s terms of service? There’s a bill for that</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3MVElN"&gt;Democrats and Republicans are getting behind a new bill, introduced Thursday, that would force tech companies to simplify the language in their terms of service agreements, making it easier for consumers to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhRbZA"&gt;The Terms-of-service Labeling, Design and Readability Act – &lt;a href="https://trahan.house.gov/uploadedfiles/tldr_act.pdf"&gt;or TLDR for short&lt;/a&gt; – would require websites to provide a “summary statement” for users before they opt in to a terms of service agreement. The statement would summarize the legal jargon into something more easily understood by the average user, along with disclosing any recent data breaches (from the three years) and the types of sensitive data the site may collect. The summary &lt;a href="https://trahan.house.gov/uploadedfiles/tldr_act_one-pager.pdf"&gt;would also explain&lt;/a&gt; “whether a consumer can delete their data, and if so, provide instructions on how.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ynKda"&gt;“For far too long, blanket terms of service agreements have forced consumers to either ‘agree’ to all of a company’s conditions or lose access to a website or app entirely,” Rep. Lori Trahan (D-MA), one of the bill’s lead sponsors, said in a statement on Thursday. “No negotiation, no alternative, and no real choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ps8BqL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No negotiation, no alternative, and no real choice.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rgavg6"&gt;This bipartisan push for greater transparency into tech comes after Facebook faced months of criticism from lawmakers over how the company may harm users. Specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807909/frances-haugen-congress-testify-section-230-facebook-whistleblower"&gt;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testified&lt;/a&gt; before Congress &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721229/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-instagram-oversight-board"&gt;multiple times&lt;/a&gt;, outlining a series of leaks she released after leaving the social media company. Lawmakers used these disclosures as a means of demanding more transparency from the embattled social media company and others, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747330/snap-tiktok-youtube-facebook-papers-blumenthal-coppa-kids-child-safety"&gt;like Snap, TikTok, and YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNBIeA"&gt;It’s unclear if lawmakers have received any additional internal reports, like those concerned with mental health, from any large tech companies, as of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0veuP"&gt;While the TLDR Act applies to most large websites and apps, like Facebook and Twitter, it exempts some small businesses. The Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general would be the main enforcers of the law, and they would be authorized to seek civil action against sites that break it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1m4za1"&gt;“Users should not have to comb through pages of legal jargon in a website’s terms of services to know how their data will be used,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA). “Requiring companies to provide an easy-to-understand summary of their terms should be mandatory and is long overdue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiCGJC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWsXSr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The real beauty of Wordle is how its emoji results tell a story</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New York City Entertainment Industry Slows During Coronavirus Surge" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/joaQ7gKoOLGfDaQYAXrO2ZMw8DA=/1820x1772:7418x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383991/1364329843.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oCYxMS"&gt;Did you struggle with &lt;a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; today? I sure as hell did, racking up my second ever failure since I started playing the game at the beginning of the year. I was annoyed at myself more than the puzzle and eased that frustration by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jjvincent/status/1481580704441978887"&gt;sharing my results on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9k7lQ"&gt;As I did, I realized why the game’s auto-generated grids of emoji are so brilliant. It’s not just that they’re social (though that certainly helps), nor is it that they’re intriguing (there’s no link to the game and no explanation for the uninitiated as to what the emoji mean). No, it’s because each grid tells a story with wonderful concision. With just 30 squares and three colors, &lt;em&gt;Wordle’s&lt;/em&gt; emoji results convey narratives of luck, frustration, perseverance, and failure; each grid a miniature story, like a landscape painted in a matchbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmqWCb"&gt;Okay, okay, I get it — this sounds a little over the top! But take a look below at my failed result from today. You can see I get off to a good start, scoring two correct letters in the correct positions immediately. Then I try again, and, okay, I don’t get any more hits, but I’ve still got that solid foundation. Another try: nada. Two more: still nothing! Then the sixth and final guess, annnnd crash: I fail completely, those two unbroken lines of green emoji forming a comedic anticlimax, like a pair of skidmarks disappearing over the edge of a cliff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLf4DH"&gt;At least, that’s how I see it. In my head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jtsnqv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;had an absolute mare &lt;br&gt;Wordle 208 X/6&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ⬜⬜ ⬜&lt;br&gt; ⬜⬜ ⬜&lt;br&gt; ⬜⬜ ⬜&lt;br&gt; ⬜⬜ ⬜&lt;br&gt; ⬜⬜ ⬜&lt;br&gt; ⬜⬜ ⬜&lt;/p&gt;— James Vincent (@jjvincent) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jjvincent/status/1481580704441978887?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kgWhrk"&gt;To rationalize this a bit more, I think &lt;em&gt;Wordle’s&lt;/em&gt; emoji results work particularly well as story-telling devices for two reasons. The first is that they’re chronological. Like panels in a cartoon, you read the emoji as a narrative, each line — each guess — building on the one before. Unlike a video game high score or a finished crossword puzzle, these aren’t just trophies of skill but replays of the entire game. You know that if someone got all green on their second guess, then their win was more luck than skill. But if you see them battling through grey and yellow squares down to the sixth line, you know that win took &lt;em&gt;guts&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeYUvQ"&gt;The second reason is that each grid is something of a &lt;em&gt;roman à clef&lt;/em&gt;. By this, I mean that if you’ve played the game in question, you’ll recognize what letters the player got right and wrong, allowing you to flesh out the story in your head (and perhaps compare it to your own). That’s where the social element comes back again (as well as Wordle’s puzzle-a-day mechanic): it encourages you to play the game yourself and so better decipher your friends’ results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVOihM"&gt;The only downside of this system is that the results — like all emoji — are not particularly friendly to people using a screen reader. Instead of offering a visual snapshot, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/annaecook/status/1478409873645731840"&gt;they become a robotic dirge&lt;/a&gt; of [Green square] [Three wide large square] [Yellow square] and so on, like a tar pit of emoji description. (The best way around this, I’ve learned only recently, is to take a screenshot of the results and then add a description to the alt text.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dLZeFi"&gt;Of course, the popularity of &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; is more or less guaranteed to flame out any day now. And when that happens, all those grids of emoji will return to their natural, mute state; no longer signifying stories of grit and triumph but becoming once more, just colored squares. It’s the only proper ending to viral fame: all those moments lost, like emoji in the timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Baby Shark is the first YouTube video to surpass 10 billion views</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D8E_0SBxYFEVw5RhBo9NqfQmq6s=/12x0:1389x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383939/Baby_Shark_Dance____babyshark_Most_Viewed_Video___Animal_Songs___PINKFONG_Songs_for_Children_0_18_screenshot__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Pinkfong&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kxYgKE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w"&gt;“Baby Shark”&lt;/a&gt; became the most-viewed YouTube video of all time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546350/baby-shark-youtube-video-most-popular-despacito-masha"&gt;in November 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and just over a year later, it has achieved another huge milestone: it has become the first YouTube video to surpass 10 billion views. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ik1Wh2"&gt;“Baby Shark” is a cultural touchstone at this point. I remember singing it at summer camps as a kid growing up, and given the record-breaking popularity of the music video (which was created by the entertainment company Pinkfong), it seems I’m not the only person who will never forget this song. (I’ve been idly tapping my foot to the beat in my head the entire time I’ve been writing this post.) But the song’s impact doesn’t stop with the earworm hit. There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10518284/"&gt;a Baby Shark show on Nickelodeon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/baby-shark-movie-1235063576/"&gt;a Baby Shark movie&lt;/a&gt;, and yes, as you may have feared, &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pinkfong-unveils-baby-sharks-first-ever-nft-collection-on-makersplace-301433995.html"&gt;Baby Shark NFTs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aMFUd"&gt;If you’re curious what the other top-viewed YouTube videos are, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-viewed_YouTube_videos"&gt;Wikipedia looks to have a comprehensive list&lt;/a&gt;. The second most-viewed as of this writing is Luis Fonsi’s “Despacito,” which held the crown before “Baby Shark” did, though, with 7.7 billion views, it has a long way to go to try and catch the shark. (And I hope that by mentioning another extremely catchy song, I got “Baby Shark” out of your head for the day.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eternals’ awful sex scene is kind of clever the second time around</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qiv7_etqBK2w-2Yx1YGvByv4ecg=/988x121:6031x3483/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383847/SLH_09385_RC.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i1gq6x"&gt;Marvel’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759203/eternals-review-marvel-studios-chloe-zhao-gemma-chan-richard-madden"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;from director Chloé Zhao was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/21/17888042/the-eternals-director-marvel-chloe-zhao"&gt;a film of many firsts for the studio&lt;/a&gt;, but it would be a bit inaccurate to say that it featured the MCU’s first sex scene, as a lot of people &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/eternals-sex-scene-richard-madden-gemma-chan-marvel-1235105274/"&gt;seem to think it did&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Daredevil &lt;/em&gt;and the rest of the Netflix / Marvel gang spent seasons getting it in over in their neck of the cinematic universe, and those shows very much laid some groundwork for &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;’ much-tamer take on superpowered sex. &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;’ sex scene might not technically be Marvel’s first, or particularly “fun” to watch, but it’s one of the movie’s more clever ways of stating the obvious about how its story is going to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLUMBd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This essay contains spoilers for Marvel’s Eternals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtpvty"&gt;Throughout &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;, an emotionally-inert foray into the cosmic origins of Marvel’s cinematic universe, there are multiple moments meant to show you how the Eternals themselves grew to love and identify with humanity during the thousands of years they spent living on Earth in varying degrees of secrecy. With there only being but so many Deviants — cosmically-empowered monsters — around for the Eternals to hunt down over the millennia, it doesn’t long in the grand scheme of Earth’s history for the Eternals to find themselves with enough downtime to develop interests in… &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; things like reading, farming, picking up new languages. You know, human stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bsGf7X1p8OKU4PKEKdtF4Et1HQw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23166247/SLH_25812_RC.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ikaris and Sersi sharing a moment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRzBPP"&gt;In addition to those kinds of activities, though, a few of &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;’ heroes also find themselves gravitating toward and wanting to know one another in the biblical sense, an idea the film explores in particular with Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden). While &lt;em&gt;Eternals &lt;/em&gt;doesn’t explicitly say that romance and physical intimacy were things the Eternals learned about by watching humans, Sersi and Ikaris’ much-buzzed-about sex scene more than makes that seem like it might have been the case given how awkward the moment is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4sha9"&gt;Soon after the Eternals are first led to believe that they’re finally being given the freedom to pursue their own dreams, Ikaris, the team’s flying brick with laser vision, musters up to courage to tell Sersi, a soft-spoken mediator with transmutation powers, that he’s deeply in love with her, always has been, and always will be. Though the Eternals are alien beings with their own ways of life, Seri and Ikaris consummate their love in the most human of ways as the pair venture off together in early the film and end up naked on a sandy dune locked in what’s best described as perfunctory sexual congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQjyDn"&gt;Even though Ikaris and Sersi’s relationship plays a major role in how &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;’ story unfolds, Madden and Chan’s lack of on-screen chemistry makes the characters’ interpersonal dynamics one of the least compelling aspects of the film, which is a wonder considering how important the scene was to Zhao and how &lt;em&gt;much &lt;/em&gt;genuine on-screen chemistry there is between other Eternals like Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) and Druig (Barry Keoghan), and Thena (Angelina Jolie) and Gilgamesh (Don Lee).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ztb0mI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The pair end up locked in what’s best described as perfunctory sexual congress&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7lRpVe"&gt;By the time that &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;’ shifts its focus to the present day, when the Eternals are brought back out of hiding by the Deviants’ sudden reappearance, the world’s a drastically different place, and most of the Eternals have become different people. Where Sersi and the others all manage to find happiness in their new lives and letting their past selves go, Ikaris remains steadfast in his commitment to their &lt;em&gt;true &lt;/em&gt;mission, which only he and Prime Eternal Ajak (Salma Hayek) are privy to at first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkhmFD"&gt;Because &lt;em&gt;Eternals &lt;/em&gt;is such a busy film, some of its ideas, like how power and authority are balanced on the actual team, get a bit muddled, but when a dying Ajak chooses Sersi to become the new Prime Eternal, the story’s brushing up against the broadside of something interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/esDx5U4gUNF3mA-z0TTbr8QGjeI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23166111/SLH_33814_RC.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Marvel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Makkari and Druig playing it cool while other people are around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1rN2dG"&gt;Though neither Sersi nor Ikaris can initially understand why Ajak would choose her to be the next Prime Eternal, her reasoning’s pretty easy to grasp just from watching any of &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;’ trailers. He’s a superstrong living weapon whose gaze literally burns holes through things, whereas she’s a creator who expresses reverence and love for the material world while showing off her superhuman mastery over its constituent elements. It’s in moments where Sersi begins to piece together how and why she’s the new Prime Eternal that &lt;em&gt;Eternals &lt;/em&gt;feels as if it’s the most confident in its ability to bring something slightly new to the pantheon of Marvel’s big-screen spectacles: a feature about a woman getting a promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FJtCw"&gt;Much like Zack Snyder’s &lt;em&gt;Justice League &lt;/em&gt;before it, &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;’ family drama briefly turns brutal as everyone comes together to fight one of their own. But unlike the amnesiac Superman, Ikaris emerges from his battle with the other Eternals definitively marked as the villain of the movie who’s willing to put the entire Earth in danger in order to complete their mission. As the world teeters on the brink of destruction in &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; final act, Sersi and Ikaris are left seeming as if they’re about to tearfully fight to the death, and the movie&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;cuts to a montage in an attempt to make you feel what they’re feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ks3YhM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The two come across more as Very Good Friends, not people who’ve seen each other naked&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mn79Pl"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;’ defense, flashbacks to a sex scene during a big superhero fight might not play all that well with audiences, which is likely why it doesn’t pop up again on screen as Ikaris and Sersi reflect on all the history they share. It does feel telling, though, that the two come across more as Very Good Friends rather than people who’ve seen each other naked as they fight over the fate of the Earth. By the time &lt;em&gt;Eternals &lt;/em&gt;gets to this part of its story, the movie’s already so mired in barely explained cosmic lore and aggressive special effects that none of its emotional beats really work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2vbld"&gt;What does work, especially when you go back and watch &lt;em&gt;Eternals &lt;/em&gt;more closely, is the idea that Sersi knew on some level that her romantic entanglement with Ikaris wouldn’t last. In a movie with so many moving parts, that sort of detail’s something you really have to &lt;em&gt;look &lt;/em&gt;for, but with &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; now streaming on Disney Plus for everyone, going back to pinpoint the moment when Sersi &lt;em&gt;knew &lt;/em&gt;just got much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="4C9oZp"&gt;In case you hadn’t noticed, it’s becoming ever-so-slightly less of a maddening exercise to get your hands on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. Granted, it’s still harder than it should be, but recent retailer restocks have taken longer to sell out than they used to. So, here’s hoping that you’re able to purchase whichever console you want &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fearlyaccess&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;during today’s restock at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is specifically for paid Walmart Plus subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJbH1G"&gt;Starting at 3PM ET / 12PM PT today, January 13th, Walmart will offer the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 PS5 with a disc drive&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383%3Fathbdg%3DL1100&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99 PS5 console that can only play digital titles&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X-Video-Game-Console-Black%2F443574645%3Fathbdg%3DL1100&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. These consoles will be available to non-trial Walmart Plus members, meaning you actually have to opt-in to pay Walmart for the service to get access (&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Faccount%2Fplus%2Foverview&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here’s where you can sign up for Walmart Plus&lt;/a&gt;). Though, Walmart is calling these “early access” deals, perhaps suggesting that they’ll open up to non-Plus customers after a window of time. In the past, the window of exclusivity has been three hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEO0nO"&gt;To ease the checkout process, make sure you have your shipping and payment info ready to go ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="GyhutA"&gt;Some essentials for PS5 owners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gahs20"&gt;In case you plan to get lucky with buying a console today, there are several excellent games and accessories that we recommend. Starting with games, head over to this list to see the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22825859/ps5-best-games-playstation-5-sony-2021"&gt;PS5’s best games of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="potP0F"&gt;Getting an Xbox Series X? Check out these add-ons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3yJrjt"&gt;If you’re on team Xbox, you may already know about Game Pass Ultimate, which gives you discounts and access to an ever-expanding catalog of Game Pass games, along with online multiplayer. You may never need to pay full price for a game for your new console. Though, whether you do want to pay full price or you just need some ideas on what to play, check out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22825913/xbox-series-x-s-best-games-microsoft-2021"&gt;Xbox’s best games of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best budget laptop of 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Cheap Laptop 2022: HP Envy x360 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/91Ojp27YU24CRpqeGNGMFxMlSuQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807794/mchin_200705_4086_0001.0.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best cheap laptops under $800 from HP, Lenovo, and more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="ItC6sO"&gt;The best cheap laptops are getting better and better for less than $800. The question to ask is: what’s most important, and what are you willing to sacrifice? Even the best cheap laptops aren’t perfect in every area — they have some strengths but cut corners to achieve their price tags. You can almost certainly find a budget laptop with a touchscreen, a premium-looking chassis, an HDMI port, a backlit keyboard, or stylus support, but you may need to consider which of those features you want the most, and which you can go without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqLems"&gt;Our pick for the best cheap laptop of 2022 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;, running Windows 10. We feel that the Envy has build quality, performance, and battery life that surpass those of many premium laptops, as well as those priced under $800. But we’ve tested dozens of systems below $800, and we’ve got a number of additional models on this list from Lenovo, Acer, Samsung, HP, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVG16P"&gt;Other best cheap laptops of 2022 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these laptops also appear on our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptop&lt;/a&gt; lists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPoJxi"&gt;Many of our picks for the best cheap laptop of 2022 are currently Chromebooks. We believe that Chromebooks are, in many cases, the best-value option for shoppers seeking a laptop under $500 and tend to offer better specs, features, and build quality than most Windows laptops at that price point. We hope to add more Windows laptops under $500 to this page in the future and are keeping a close eye on those releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best cheap laptop ofof 2022&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="r62WQ4"&gt;HP’s Envy x360 13, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeBestLaptop101521&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-envy-x360-laptop-13z-ay000-8lz58av-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $860&lt;/a&gt; is the best budget laptop you can buy under $800. With a high-quality and sturdy convertible build, it looks like a device that should cost twice its price. It has plenty of other great features as well, including a really excellent keyboard and a bright, colorful screen. It’s also exceptional on the inside. Thanks to its AMD Ryzen processor, the system delivers all-day battery life and very smooth performance — it can even handle some light gaming. (Intel options are available as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ox216u"&gt;We have some minor complaints about the Envy, of course. The screen is 16:9, which is a cramped aspect ratio for multitasking. Our test unit had a somewhat limited port selection (notably, missing Thunderbolt and HDMI support) and came with some bloatware preinstalled. But none of these are deal-breakers at the Envy’s price point. Overall, budget shoppers will want for very little with this machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best laptop under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hyeIry"&gt;If you’re looking for an absurdly cheap Chromebook that absolutely gets the job done, you should definitely be looking at the $260 Lenovo Chromebook Duet. The Duet is a 10-inch aluminum alloy Chrome OS tablet that comes with a kickstand and keyboard cover. It looks sturdy and classy, and it can easily function as either a tablet or a PC. But you’re not compromising &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;much on performance for this device’s tiny size; as long as you’re not running dozens of tabs and apps, you should be fine. And we got over 11 hours of battery life in our testing, making it one of the longest-lasting Chromebooks we’ve seen in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHlVCe"&gt;The main thing to know about the Chromebook Duet is that the screen is quite small — just 10.1 inches. That’s a fine size for a young student (especially with the touch capability) and for an adult’s secondary device for note-taking, Netflixing, and the like, but it’s not an ideal size for a primary work device unless you’re fine with quite a bit of squinting. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the clamshell Chromebook to buy, and one of the best cheap laptops under $800.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SoHxJX"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best budget laptop with Chrome OS &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="N34v09"&gt;If you’d prefer a more traditional Chromebook with a clamshell form factor, the $329 Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is an affordable option that’s all-around excellent. It has a gorgeous 3:2 display that delivers a sharp picture and bright, vibrant colors with plenty of vertical space. The screen alone would make the Chromebook Spin 713 a standout, but it has a number of other strengths as well, including a great keyboard, all-day battery life, and a comprehensive port selection, including an HDMI, in addition to USB-C, USB-A, and a microSD slot. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 is the best cheap laptop with a built-in stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best cheap laptop with a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iQA7Ph"&gt;If you like the Duet’s size and detachable form factor but are willing to spend on something a bit more upscale, you may find the Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 to be a better choice. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, kickstand, and detachable screen. But the CM3’s kickstand folds multiple ways: you can crease it lengthwise to stand the tablet up like a laptop or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. Plus, it comes with a built-in USI stylus and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. Battery life was also quite impressive: we averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUYikQ"&gt;Where the CM3 lags a bit behind the Duet (and other cheap laptops you may try) is the power. Its MediaTek processor can be a bit sluggish compared to more pricier offerings. But the CM3 still offers a surprising number of perks for its sub-$400 price and makes a great student driver or secondary device. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best laptop under $800&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="o8zBHM"&gt;If you’re looking for a budget Windows laptop that’s thinner and lighter than the Envy x360 while delivering similar category-topping performance, the $669 HP Pavilion Aero 13 is a good choice for you. It has a powerful eight-core Ryzen processor, which is one of the fastest processors for thin and light laptops that you can get. Not only does it perform well, but it’s also unbelievably light at just 2.1 pounds, and it comes with a blindingly bright 16:10 screen. It’s a standout in battery life, too — I averaged almost 11 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOWROI"&gt;HP did have to cut a few corners to achieve those benefits at this price point. The audio on our model wasn’t great, and the device shipped with some cheap bloatware installed. But the Pavilion Aero 13 is excellent in almost every other way, and it won’t disappoint if you’re looking for a functional, cheap Windows PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="pT23AG"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable Chromebook that stands out from the crowd, the $549 Galaxy Chromebook 2 should be on your list. It comes in a bold “fiesta red” color (as well as a regular gray, if you prefer to blend in). It’s a touchscreen convertible with stylus support (though the stylus isn’t included). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QIDME"&gt;On top of the design, the Galaxy Chromebook 2 includes an excellent QLED panel, which is one of the best displays we’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. You also get a solid keyboard, decent battery life (we averaged 7 hours and 21 minutes of continuous work), and a port selection that includes two USB-C ports, a microSD slot, and a headphone jack. It’s easily one of the best Chromebooks you can buy and one of the best cheap laptops as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="9t4Ji3"&gt;The $399 Surface Go 2 is a 10.5-inch tablet that’s about the size of a regular iPad. You’ll have to buy the keyboard cover separately, but the overall package is still quite affordable if you’re buying a lower-priced model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hPLGr"&gt;You can configure the Surface Go 2 with a Pentium Gold or Core m3 processor. Those aren’t the fanciest or most powerful processors, but the system should still be adequate for your streaming and browsing needs, especially if you only need it to do one task at a time. It can run any Windows app, it’s easy to carry around, and it makes a solid secondary computer. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Swift 3 is one of the best college laptops you can buy, and one of the best cheap laptops under $800.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cIbAld"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21377208/acer-swift-3-review-2020-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Acer Swift 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best student laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DeUYiZ"&gt;Many of the best cheap laptops might be good choices for high school and college students, but the Acer Swift 3’s exceptionally durable build makes it an excellent choice for backpack-battering and dining hall spills. Its 14-inch screen also gives you more room for homework multitasking than some of the 13-inch machines here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVxnSd"&gt;But the highlight of the Swift 3 is its Ryzen 4000 processors. We tested a model with a Ryzen 7 4700U, which did an excellent job handling our daily multitasking workload, and delivered seven-hour battery life as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWSkuR"&gt;On the outside, the Swift 3 isn’t the thinnest or most beautiful laptop you can buy, but it’s a solid performer in most areas. It has all kinds of ports, including USB-C, USB-A, and an HDMI. The backlit keyboard has a nice click to it and has a reliable integrated fingerprint reader as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XUPL4K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351151"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Yoga C740 is a sturdy aluminum laptop for any use case, making it one of the best cheap laptops under $800.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m9IrEq"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21174917/lenovo-yoga-c740-review-laptop-specs-features-price-2-in-1-convertible"&gt;Lenovo Yoga C740&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;A cheap laptop with standout build&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HqEdaD"&gt;The Yoga C740 is as straightforward as a laptop can get. It has a sturdy aluminum build and perfectly fine 10th Gen Intel processors. We were pleasantly surprised by the device’s audio — the upward-firing speakers on the sides of the keyboard deliver a nice surround-sound experience. The keyboard and touchpad are both quite comfortable to use. There’s not much to complain about and not much to enthusiastically praise — if you’re looking for a sub-$800 Windows laptop with a well-made aluminum chassis and a sturdy frame, you’re looking for the Yoga. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGHm6c"&gt;The C740 is a year old now, but that means you can get it at very affordable prices. We’re looking forward to reviewing its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373719/lenovo-yoga-7i-6-convertible-laptops-intel-amd-processors-windows"&gt;Yoga 7i&lt;/a&gt;, shortly in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gap is launching NFT hoodie art that unlocks physical clothing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4_9C6Mu0tAes1-BM_SJ815ecnfE=/0x0:1600x1067/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383670/gap_hoodie_nft_collection_frank_ape.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Gap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gHKtoG"&gt;Gap is selling &lt;a href="https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/articles/2022-1/01/gap-launches-gamified-collectible-nft-experience-t"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, following other clothing retailers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22822143/adidas-nft-launch-into-the-metaverse-price-release-date"&gt;Adidas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22833369/nike-rtfkt-nft-sneaker-shoe-metaverse-company"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22800985/macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-nfts-auction"&gt;Macy’s&lt;/a&gt; that in recent months have jumped into the NFT space. The NFTs are built on the Tezos blockchain, which &lt;a href="https://tezos.com/carbon/"&gt;touts itself&lt;/a&gt; as a more energy-efficient option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wj9bRV"&gt;The NFTs come in the form of a series of digital hoodie art, with different levels of rarity at different price points. Common level pieces starting at roughly $8.30, or 2 tez, are on sale today. Rare, epic, and one-of-a-kind tiers will roll out over the next few weeks. Gap is partnering with artist Brandon Sines, creator of the Frank Ape cartoon character, on the designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yv7x69"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The gamified experience comes out to around $500.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrZ6TW"&gt;For shoppers who’d prefer to buy something wearable, look no further than the epic level NFTs, priced at around $415 (100 tez), which include digital art by Sines and a physical Gap x Frank Ape sweatshirt. But first, customers will need to purchase four common and two rare NFTs (priced at 6 tez, or roughly $24.90) to get the chance to buy an epic one, &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/90285/the-gap-tezos-nfts-physical-apparel-perks"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Decrypt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Gap says the “gamified experience” will encourage fans to collect hoodie art leading up to the epic level. In this case, the gamified experience comes out to around $500. If you’re not too picky about your clothing, Gap also has a 50 percent off sale right now that brings the price of a men’s hoodie to about $25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4oCqD"&gt;Gap has scaled back its physical presence over the past few years, retreating from the shopping malls it was once a mainstay in. In October 2020, the company announced it would close &lt;a href="https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/news/responds/gap-stores-update"&gt;350 Gap and Banana Republic stores&lt;/a&gt; in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="av20ev"&gt;Though the NFT-ification is noteworthy, this isn’t the first time Gap has rolled out a special edition drop. The company saw success and buzz around the Yeezy Gap Hoodie in September, which Gap says resulted in the most sales of an item in a single day. The company said &lt;a href="https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/articles/2021/11/gap-inc-reports-third-quarter-results"&gt;70 percent of shoppers&lt;/a&gt; were new to Gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PpbOCw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4IppS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2021 was hot as hell, NASA confirms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MALTA-SIGGIEWI-WILDFIRE-HEATWAVE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3HqPKLV1d0LkOQWUzYBYJaEleAw=/0x0:4176x2784/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383386/1234642957.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo taken on Aug. 12, 2021 shows burned bushes after a wildfire caused by high temperature in Siggiewi, Malta. Matla was hit by a heatwave which has swept across the Mediterranean Sea. | Photo by Jonathan Borg/Xinhua via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o3fPPM"&gt;The last eight years have been the eight hottest years on record, NASA and the National Oceanic Administration (NOAA) confirmed today. 2021 ranks as the sixth hottest year on record, the agencies said, as global average temperatures trend upward. Rankings aside, there were plenty of red flags throughout 2021 to show us how remarkable the year was for temperature extremes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEsqtU"&gt;“The fact is that we’ve now kind of moved into a new regime ... this is likely the warmest decade in many, many hundreds, maybe 1000s of years,” says Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “There’s enough change that it’s having impacts locally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zTQ1r"&gt;In North America, those local impacts included epically bad summer heat, even for typically cool regions. In late June and early July, the Pacific Northwestern US and Western Canada struggled with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602208/june-heatwave-most-extreme-summer-record-north-america"&gt;record-smashing&lt;/a&gt; temperatures that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22559961/heat-roads-washington-oregon-climate-infrastructure"&gt;buckled&lt;/a&gt; roads and melted &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/29/1011269025/photos-the-pacific-northwest-heatwave-is-melting-power-cables-and-buckling-roads"&gt;power cables&lt;/a&gt;.  In the desert further south, California’s Death Valley reached a blazing 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54.4 degrees Celsius) in July, potentially breaking the world record for the hottest temperature ever recorded on the planet — for the second year in a row. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eqr2vP"&gt;Across the Atlantic, Europe experienced sweltering heat, too. A reading of 119.8 degrees Fahrenheit (48.8 degrees Celsius) &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/mediterranean-gripped-extreme-heat-new-reported-temperature-record"&gt;in Sicily&lt;/a&gt; might have broken the European record for maximum temperature. (The World Meteorological Organization is still &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/wmo-recognizes-new-arctic-temperature-record-of-38%E2%81%B0c"&gt;working&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21395621/hottest-temperatures-verification-research-death-valley-wmo-record"&gt;vet those records&lt;/a&gt;.) All told, July 2021 was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623843/july-2021-hottest-month-recorded"&gt;hottest month humans have ever recorded&lt;/a&gt;, according to NOAA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0HpFZ7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Record-smashing temperatures that buckled roads and melted power cables&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QPt5MA"&gt;More than a discomfort, the heat took a serious toll on communities. Emergency department visits spiked in the Pacific Northwest as a result of the extreme heat wave, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580120/emergency-department-visits-spiked-june-heat-wave-us-northwest"&gt;CDC reported&lt;/a&gt;. Further north, an inferno all but &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/world/canada/canadian-wildfire-british-columbia.html"&gt;wiped out the small town&lt;/a&gt; of Lytton, British Columbia soon after it recorded Canada’s highest temperature on record. The event stood out as one of the most shocking of 2021 for Schmidt. “The scale of human tragedy there, you know, even if people don’t die, that’s a community destroyed,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dERM3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/11/oceans-hottest-temperatures-research-climate-crisis"&gt;Heat trapped in the world’s oceans&lt;/a&gt; also reached record levels in 2021, according to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00376-022-1461-3"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published this week. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882502/marine-heatwaves-oceans-united-nations-ipcc-report-climate-change"&gt;Ocean heatwaves&lt;/a&gt; are likely twice as common now as they were in the early 1980s, and they can be devastating for marine life and coastal communities. They kill coral, take a toll on fishing and crabbing industries, and can even make droughts worse onshore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkAyFF"&gt;Temperatures might have been even hotter in 2021, were it not for a La Niña event. La Niña is a &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ninonina.html"&gt;recurring climate phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; defined by cooler-than-average waters in the eastern equatorial Pacific, which has predictable effects on weather patterns worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94E50n"&gt;Earlier this week, the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service released its own &lt;a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-globally-seven-hottest-years-record-were-last-seven"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; on global temperature records, which vary slightly from NASA and NOAA because the agencies use somewhat &lt;a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/2015/01/21/why-so-many-global-temperature-records/"&gt;different methods&lt;/a&gt; to make their calculations. Copernicus determined that 2021 was fifth warmest year on record. It also confirmed that the world has warmed by more than a degree Celsius since the preindustrial era, a result of greenhouse gases released by burning fossil fuels. Experts are urging a transition to clean energy because global warming needs to stay well below two degrees Celsius to prevent catastrophic climate change — as this year’s heat extremes illustrate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1zCV7"&gt;“We are unfortunately, reaping what we have sown,” Schmidt says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUi9Pb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwQl15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite is technically back on iOS, thanks to a GeForce Now game streaming loophole</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HtyUxf0pBtgDZv_BRibCrnvuzKs=/256x0:1792x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383281/GFN_Thursday_January_13.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YlWmSf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is back on iOS today... sort of. The popular battle royale game isn’t back on the App Store (where it’s been missing since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;Apple pulled the app from its storefront&lt;/a&gt; in August 2020), but iPhone and iPad owners can now stream &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to play on their phones and tablets through Nvidia’s GeForce Now service, which opened up a closed beta today to test the new streaming version of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2L94w"&gt;Nvidia and Epic Games have been promising that Fortnite would come back to iOS through GeForce Now running through Safari’s web browser (the only way that Apple currently allows game streaming services like GeForce Now, Stadia, xCloud, or Luna to operate on iOS) &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/11/19/geforce-now-on-ios-safari/"&gt;as far back as November 2020&lt;/a&gt;, when the service first launched on Apple’s hardware. But it’s apparently taken quite a bit of time to sort out the details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PwgyeL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fortnite streamed to iOS, complete with touchscreen optimized controls&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YMVD3h"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has technically already been available on GeForce Now for Android users, but that version of the game is a streamed copy of the desktop version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. The new version that Nvidia and Epic Games are beta testing is optimized for mobile devices, with similar touchscreen controls and menus to the old native iOS and Android versions of the game. (Nvidia warns that Android users who join the beta will &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be able to play the new mobile version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and won’t be able to use a keyboard and mouse like they currently can.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1WrZP"&gt;According to Nvidia, beta sign-ups start today, with “selected members” set to get access later in January. The company says that the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;beta will be a “limited time” process but that “we do not have an exact timeline for how long it will last.” Anyone interested in trying the new streamed version of Fortnite can sign up at Nvidia’s website, with both free and paid GeForce Now customers getting an “equal chance at the closed beta.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KP7q7m"&gt;Nvidia is notably the only game streaming service that Epic Games is partnering with for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; — as a deposition in the Apple / Epic trial revealed last year, Epic deliberately isn’t allowing Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407849/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-epic-games-block"&gt;to offer &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;as part of its xCloud service&lt;/a&gt;, due to concerns that xCloud would compete with Epic’s own PC offerings. Streaming &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; through xCloud to iOS would also require that Epic pay Microsoft’s 30 percent fee for in-app purchases — similar in Epic’s eyes to the Apple fees that led to the company’s lawsuit in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vhPDK6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite isn’t on Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming service because Epic won’t allow it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407849/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-epic-games-block"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OjhX3i"&gt;Nvidia’s GeForce Now service, on the other hand, just acts as a conduit for Epic’s existing storefront, meaning that Epic Games won’t have to hand over a cent of any of the in-game purchases players make on the new streamed version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; through GeForce Now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pv6m2h"&gt;Epic and Nvidia aren’t saying how long the beta will last or when to expect the GeForce Now-streamed version of Fortnite to be broadly available for all Android and iOS users. And while game streaming has improved in leaps and bounds in recent years, it’s hard to imagine that the streamed version will be a better long-term solution than the native Fortnite app that used to be on the App Store. Still, for Fortnite fans looking to get a quick round in on the go, the GeForce Now option will probably be better than nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House hosts tech summit to discuss open-source security after Log4j</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qGTwSp6WvpPDQQbMartrYY_gVn4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383279/acastro_210708_4663_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QVdwQ2"&gt;The White House &lt;a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/white-house-log4j-open-source-software-security/"&gt;will meet with leaders of major tech&lt;/a&gt; companies including Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta, IBM, and Microsoft on Thursday to discuss the security of open-source software. The issue has become urgent in the wake of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828303/log4j-library-vulnerability-log4shell-zero-day-exploit"&gt;extremely serious Log4j vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, discovered in December 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iq5QbA"&gt;The summit will also include the Apache Software Foundation — the owner and maintainer of the Log4j library — and Oracle, owner of the Java software platform on which the Log4j library runs. GitHub and the Linux Open Source Foundation will also be represented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZhRJT"&gt;Executives from the tech companies will meet with representatives of various federal agencies, including the departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security. Other agencies include the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National Science Foundation, according to &lt;em&gt;Cyberscoop&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z05cZv"&gt;In the wake of the discovery and fallout from the Log4j vulnerability in December, White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/23/politics/white-house-log4j-tech-firms-meeting/index.html"&gt;described open-source security&lt;/a&gt; as a “key national security concern.” The open-source security summit was called shortly after as a direct response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ocRxY6"&gt;In May 2021, well before the Log4j vulnerability was discovered, President Biden issued an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/"&gt;executive order on improving the nation’s cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt;. Among other things, the order mandated that agencies of the federal government shore up their software supply chains by “ensuring and attesting, to the extent practicable, to the integrity and provenance of open source software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SD1FPb"&gt;Vulnerabilities in open-source software have led to some of the most serious security flaws in recent memory. The Heartbleed bug, discovered in 2014, affected an open-source encryption library called OpenSSL that was believed to be used in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/8/5594266/how-heartbleed-broke-the-internet"&gt;two out of three servers across the web&lt;/a&gt;. Despite its large-scale usage, the library was maintained largely by unpaid volunteers — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-13/how-apache-raced-to-fix-a-potentially-disastrous-software-flaw"&gt;as was the case with Log4j&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M0sBXX"&gt;Open-source software that is critical to the functioning of highly profitable tech companies may still struggle to attract funding, a fact that is likely to be discussed at today’s summit. Just days ago the issue was brought to the fore again when an open-source developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/9/22874949/developer-corrupts-open-source-libraries-projects-affected"&gt;intentionally corrupted two JavaScript libraries&lt;/a&gt;, potentially affecting thousands of projects. Reporting by &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt; uncovered previous posts in which the developer lamented “support[ing] Fortune 500s...with my free work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZrvv4"&gt;Writing &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2022-01-13-open-source-software-security-summit-securing-the-worlds-code-together/"&gt;on Github’s company blog&lt;/a&gt; Thursday morning, chief security officer Mike Hanley described a landscape in which open software was widely used but still poorly supported in terms of resources made available to developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avRdC6"&gt;“First, there must be a collective industry and community effort to secure the software supply chain,” Hanley wrote. “Second, we need to better support open source maintainers to make it easier for them to secure their projects.”&lt;/p&gt;
