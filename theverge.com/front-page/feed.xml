    <title>Microsoft fixes Windows 11 features failing due to an expired certificate </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ai_qQi2DlAXsIr_erIZFVPM0ORc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70101483/Hero_Bloom_Logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8GxFCI"&gt;Microsoft has fixed several Windows 11 features failing to load after an expired certificate was discovered earlier this week. Some Windows 11 users haven’t been able to open apps like the Snipping Tool, touch keyboard, or emoji panel since a certificate expired on October 31st. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763641/microsoft-windows-11-expired-certificate-snipping-tool-emoji-picker-issues"&gt;Microsoft warned Windows 11 users about the problems earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; and has now released an out-of-band update today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSAcbA"&gt;The issues also affected voice typing and the getting started and tips sections of Windows 11. Microsoft started &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/11/04/releasing-windows-11-kb5008295-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/"&gt;testing a patch&lt;/a&gt; for the problems with Beta and Release Preview testers of Windows 11 late yesterday and has now &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows-message-center#2743"&gt;released the fix&lt;/a&gt; for all Windows 11 users today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ddo3zn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft is releasing an Out-of-band (OOB) update (KB5008295) today to completely resolve a set of issues affecting the Snipping Tool, Touch Keyboard, some built-in apps and S Mode on Windows 11. &lt;a href="https://t.co/8XaFZqRH3J"&gt;https://t.co/8XaFZqRH3J&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Windows Update (@WindowsUpdate) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WindowsUpdate/status/1456677227010007046?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TW9nAt"&gt;If you’re running Windows 11, you should be offered the &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/5008295"&gt;KB5008295&lt;/a&gt; update today, and it will automatically install from Windows Update. This patch does require a reboot, and Microsoft notes it will address all of the issues from the expired certificate, including the accounts page in Windows 11 with S mode failing to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geklPq"&gt;Microsoft was relatively quick to address these problems after the company discovered the certificate issue on Monday. It’s unusual for Microsoft to issue out-of-band patches that aren’t security-related for its Windows operating systems, and this is one of the first emergency-style fixes for Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJftcW"&gt;Microsoft’s latest Windows 11 patch comes just two weeks after the company had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22732336/microsoft-windows-11-amd-cpu-performance-issues-fix-release"&gt;issue a fix for AMD CPU performance in the OS&lt;/a&gt;. A bug was slowing performance on Ryzen processors by up to 15 percent in certain games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing’s big update has sucked me back in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YIVm1XGXX7TGVR-HOkWmBYJIXIo=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70101376/2021110420240900_02CB906EA538A35643C1E1484C4B947D.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VGbgJS"&gt;It’s been a long time since I’ve been surprised by &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch"&gt;I played the Nintendo Switch game regularly for the first year it was out&lt;/a&gt;, checking in virtually every day to see how my village was progressing. I experienced every holiday and special event and spent my evenings catching fish and tending to my gardens before bed. But, despite a handful of updates, I eventually got bored. There’s only so many sea bass you can catch before it becomes monotonous. I haven’t touched the game in eight months (as my villagers have been quick to point out), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22762709/animal-crossing-2-0-update-released-early-nintendo"&gt;the latest, biggest, and final update&lt;/a&gt; has really sucked me back into island life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPPVry"&gt;Perhaps the most surprising part of this is that I haven’t even experienced the most notable parts of the update yet. I haven’t purchased the first paid expansion, which lets you help decorate other characters’ homes, and the much-anticipated café addition to my museum is still under construction until tomorrow. I’m excited for both of these — I sincerely love Brewster the barista — but it’s the smaller changes that have helped refresh a game that had been feeling stale for me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9S9HWnz74DTgxri8WXGSDE9djFY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988862/2021110420323700_02CB906EA538A35643C1E1484C4B947D.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e5inv8"&gt;For instance, &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; now has cooking. It works a lot like regular crafting: you get a recipe, collect the ingredients, and then go to a stove to put it all together. The food is adorable and detailed, and it makes my kitchen look a lot more cozy. But more importantly, it has changed my relationship with my island. At this point, I’ve caught nearly every fish and collected plenty of fruit. But now, they have new possibilities. Catching a fish could mean getting a new recipe, even if it’s &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22763373/animal-crossing-new-horizons-cooking-sea-bass"&gt;the typically unwanted sea bass&lt;/a&gt;. I finally have a reason to go diving for seaweed. I also have a new incentive to collect everything; once you complete a collection in the museum, you can buy a cool poster full of fossils or bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDbKRX"&gt;Likewise, the new camera app makes it a lot more fun to wander around the island and snap pics. There’s a first-person viewpoint that lets you see things from a new perspective, as well as a tripod so you can take cute pics with your villagers. Ordinances, which return from &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Leaf&lt;/em&gt;, let you make your island a little cleaner or ensure your animals stay up late to match your own schedule. You will also get visitors now as villagers will show up at your house unannounced to hang out. The most surprising bonus, for me, has been that I finally have a reason to visit Harv’s island because you can now set up a kind of marketplace full of folks like Leif and his plant shop and a new fortune teller.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LwtnXmmrJ6t9Jp0yQsFMWKKXEBI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988864/2021110511201300_02CB906EA538A35643C1E1484C4B947D.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F9FNBd"&gt;These changes make the game feel new and interesting again, and I haven’t even dug into many of the aspects, like growing gyroids, hanging out in a coffee shop, or collecting new furniture. It’s also nice that the game forces you to pace yourself. At Harv’s co-op, for instance, you can only add one business each day, and they all cost 100,000 bells to set up. It’ll be a while before I have a fully functioning market, but this hasn’t bothered me. I forgot how pleasant it can be to play the game for 20 minutes, get a few chores done, and then return the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apgHXu"&gt;It’s not just one feature that has me excited about &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; again. Instead, it’s all of these smaller details that make the day-to-day of playing much more interesting. I’m not sure how long it’ll last, and it’s sad that this is the game’s last hurrah. But I know I’ll be sticking around my island for at least long enough to get that fish poster.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo says its next ‘gaming system’ will release in the year 20XX</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sp6afPclqz7FRWWkTk6jzNS0Kss=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70101274/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the OLED Switch, not Nintendo’s next console.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ihvCPN"&gt;The Nintendo Switch with an OLED screen isn’t even a month old, but the company is already talking about some kind of successor to its wildly popular console / handheld hybrid — although vaguely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2QcUh"&gt;In a presentation to investors, Nintendo hints toward some of its plans in an extremely unspecific way. The company plans to “continue to expand its business around the core concept of creating unique integrated hardware-software products,” which I’m taking to mean that the company will (brace yourself) make more video games and video game hardware in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hhGvpt"&gt;On the slide, which you can see for yourself &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/211105e.pdf"&gt;on page 41 here (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo also has a timeline of some of its hardware efforts and specifically includes its “next gaming system” slated to release at an undefined 20XX date. (So sometime between now and 2099, I guess.) There are no hints as to what the hardware might look like, if it will be another hybrid like the Switch, or even just another revision of the Switch. The only image Nintendo includes is a question mark.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8M216Y8GQsu46p7-a46OIxow4R8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988754/Screen_Shot_2021_11_05_at_9.31.15_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even Nintendo wants you to forget the Wii U, which released in 2012 and isn’t included on this timeline.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="glY3ih"&gt;While I love the OLED Switch, there are some obvious ways new Nintendo hardware could improve upon it, with perhaps the most obvious upgrade being the ability to play 4K resolution games. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported a Switch that could do that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;was in development for release this year&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;official OLED Switch doesn’t support 4K games&lt;/a&gt;. Just days before the launch of the OLED Switch, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-29/nintendo-switch-4k-developers-make-games-for-nonexistent-console?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Nintendo was developing a 4K-capable Switch and said it could be released as early as late 2022, but Nintendo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701435/nintendo-categorically-denies-4k-switch-pro-development"&gt;categorically denied&lt;/a&gt; that report. If there was a feature I’d bet on for Nintendo’s next console, though, it would be 4K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlLVBH"&gt;Nintendo isn’t just investing in hardware; the company is also committing to “value-added services” for Nintendo accounts, and the upward-trending blue triangle in the image above suggests that could be a bigger part of Nintendo’s business in the future. We’re already starting to see that play out with the recently released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728113/nintendo-switch-online-plus-expansion-pack-price-n64-genesis-animal-crossing"&gt;Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack&lt;/a&gt;, a more expensive version of its paid online membership that adds Nintendo 64 games, Sega Genesis games, and access the new &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons &lt;/em&gt;DLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKzR01"&gt;The company also says it will “continue to improve and expand” both the standard Nintendo Switch Online and the Expansion Pack&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;While Nintendo doesn’t detail exactly how, one thing to potentially look forward to would be Game Boy games, which are rumored &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22656353/nintendo-game-boy-game-boy-color-games-switch-online-subscription"&gt;to join Nintendo’s online offerings&lt;/a&gt; at some point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icBKMd"&gt;In classic Nintendo fashion, the company is keeping its cards close, and it usually doesn’t reveal hardware, services, or games until it can give some concrete details. (Though I’m still waiting for &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; more about &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime 4&lt;/em&gt; since its reboot was announced &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/977978a1-07fe-4c58-8dd9-8fe68f764c04#:~:text=https%3A//www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date"&gt;nearly three years ago&lt;/a&gt;.) But it’s fun to imagine what might be in the hopper, especially now that the company has alluded to future hardware in the works. I can’t wait for 20XX.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Glow review: fun but unfinished</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to like about this intergenerational calling device, but Amazon is a bit bossy&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4RDYdT"&gt;Amazon’s latest attempt to entertain your children is an innovative effort that combines an interactive projector with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436457/amazon-kids-rebranding-freetime"&gt;Amazon Kids Plus’&lt;/a&gt; excellent catalog of child-friendly content. What it is not is an Alexa device, despite having four microphones built in and sharing a name with the Echo lamp for kids. Rather than being a part of Amazon’s growing, open smart home ecosystem, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DWNZQYM?ref=+ods_lp_day1_io_ja&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 Amazon Glow&lt;/a&gt; is an expensive, manicured walled garden for your kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GApn0k"&gt;A video calling / interactive gaming device specifically designed to make it easier for children to communicate with friends and family remotely, the Amazon Glow is attempting to make these rather forced interactions more natural, engaging, and fun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hadjHo"&gt;Where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22732472/facebook-portal-go-10-inch-2021-review"&gt;Facebook’s Portal Go&lt;/a&gt; tries to solve the problem of wriggly, distractible kids by making a portable device that lets you bring the conversation to where they are, Amazon tries to keep your kid captivated with Grandma via a stationary tabletop projector. A 19.2-inch projected play area encourages more active play, letting grandparent, aunt, uncle, or second cousin not just watch your child draw, paint, or play games but join in the fun — albeit in a slightly terrifying, disembodied head format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="agsnRK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10847665"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9XMv4n"&gt;Unfortunately, coming with an entirely new hardware platform makes the Glow too expensive, and its limitations mean it’s not likely to replace a tablet as your child’s tech toy of choice. I would also caution anyone considering investing in this as a holiday gift that Glow is part of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=21601403011"&gt;Amazon’s Day1 Editions&lt;/a&gt; program, which could mean the company is still figuring out if it wants to commit to this product. You also can’t just go and buy this; you have to request an invitation, although you do get it at the slightly discounted price of $249 for your trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2G9Esp"&gt;Adding to the initial outlay is an ongoing monthly content subscription (starting at $2.99 a month but included for the first year) and the need for whoever your child is calling to have a tablet for the best experience. (It also doesn’t currently work with Fire tablets, which can be had pretty cheap, but Amazon says compatibility is coming soon.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNOZzP"&gt;However, Amazon does offer a two-year guarantee and free replacement if it breaks — which is a good thing as this nearly took a nose dive off our kitchen counter several times. Also, there are no ads anywhere to be found in the Glow, which is a refreshing change for an Amazon device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5RoUu5bKb5I0VRahw2EZ3MQD_l8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977076/jtuohy_211027_4856_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My 10-year-old chatting with her grandma while they both draw in the Glow’s art program. The 8-inch portrait screen that displays the caller’s head is a bit awkward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h82HuW"&gt;At just over 14 inches tall, the Glow is a towering device resembling a squared-off Echo speaker with an eight-inch touchscreen on the front to show the remote caller. A 720p camera sits above the screen to capture the child and their actions, and a 10-watt speaker sits below it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBBzfP"&gt;Two-way audio is enabled by four microphones above the protruding hunk of plastic that houses a projector. This beams a 19.2-inch touch-sensitive projection screen onto a specially designed white mat where IR sensors and a second camera enable interaction. Also included are seven tangram puzzle pieces, which you can scan into special puzzles and play with both digitally and physically. All of this takes up a significant amount of space, however, and it can be challenging to find a good spot for it; plus, the device is not very portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eeVPxM"&gt;The Glow is powered by a short, removable power cord, and there is a physical privacy shutter that cuts off video and microphones, plus a power button and volume up and down button along the side. It’s designed for kids ages three to nine to chat and play with remote family and friends, and it takes advantage of Amazon’s strong parental control features (so, there’s no worry that your child is going to wander off down an internet rabbit hole, and there is no web-browser in the Glow). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oykBsow-vGyj9vlKGXjoBFPFw_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977073/jtuohy_211027_4856_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The projector sits above a 720p camera that captures what the child is doing and sends it to their virtual playmate. A physical shutter can be engaged at any time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JhrgZq"&gt;The child uses the hands-free Glow device, and the remote user plays on a tablet (iPad or Android). You can’t currently play Glow to Glow, and while there are some games you can play solo or side by side, the concept here is resolutely about interacting with someone who lives elsewhere, not about adding another personal screen into your home. In reality, this means if you want to play on the Glow with your child while you’re at home, you’ll have to sit in another room with a tablet. It feels like someone didn’t really think that through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dq7OzO"&gt;Unlike most video-calling devices, this is designed to offer two slightly different experiences for the participants. While each participant sees the same interface that consists of digital bookshelves from which you select games, puzzles, books, and activities, and each can control that interface, the adult gets more prompts and controls than the child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTN11E"&gt;It feels specifically designed for the Glow user to be a tech-savvy child who can instinctively control things with touch and would otherwise get bored and distracted by talking to a 2D face on a screen. The tablet user designation seems to be an older person who requires more text-based prompts and guidance when grappling with this new-fangled technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nK2_MmHrdS17psY1zC4Ee0fKntk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988402/A4CCD05B_EE8E_4491_A84A_F2035E345F33.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tablet interface in the Glow app shows you an inset video of the child, and the same gameplay screen but from your perspective. If you tap on the caller you can view yourself and them but not the gameplay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8d6JRQ"&gt;While I get where Amazon is coming from here, this stereotyping feels uncomfortable. And feeds into my chief complaint with the Glow: it’s too tightly controlled. I’m not talking about privacy or parental controls, those are all present and correct. I mean the gameplay. After an hour or so of testing it with my 10-year-old daughter and her 74-year-old grandmother, we ran into several restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpsYuj"&gt;For example, a game of chess (which was incredibly fun and cleverly executed) refused to let me win. It insisted the game was a draw, even though I had thoroughly checkmated my kid. It was like being told by a teacher that you’re not allowed to do that until you’re old enough to handle it. Also, while you can download books from the Kids Plus catalog, only picture books and graphic novels work, not chapter books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmAr4Q"&gt;I was also flummoxed to find out that despite the device having Bluetooth, you cannot pair Bluetooth headsets to the Glow. “[That] is not possible with Glow as part of the fun for parents is to be able to hear their child speaking with a remote family member or friend, just like a playdate in person, and joining the conversation if they choose,” Amazon PR told me in an email. Thanks, but I don’t need to be told how to have fun with my kids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/plw0w_eW4q3K3GbbNMjklj4xY88=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977077/jtuohy_211027_4856_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The art screen lets a child’s creativity roam, but beware of the vacuum cleaner icon, which either player can use to erase your work in an instant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dCcqdk"&gt;An excellent use case for this device for work-from-home parents is to pop their child on a call with a friend or family member if they need to get some work done. It’s much less guilt-inducing than sticking on another &lt;em&gt;Peppa Pig&lt;/em&gt; marathon to get through your weekly team meeting. But for that to work in a small apartment, for example, headphones on your child would be very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5fdBl"&gt;While my children aren’t the target age range here (at least not yet — Amazon told me it is planning to bring more content tailored toward older children), my 10-year-old daughter really enjoyed many of the games. Her favorite feature by far was the interactive art area, where you can let your creativity roam free from most of the device’s restraints and even scan real-life objects into your masterpieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uKnhRt"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Amazon Glow scanning|104696" data-volume-uuid="fe35039c2" data-volume-id="104696" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="true" id="volume-placement-932" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A demonstration of how the scanning feature works to add everyday objects into your art projects on the Amazon Glow. The results are fine but the colors are quite grey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6AymQ5"&gt;Setting up the Glow is straightforward, but it has to be done by an adult — it’s not a toy in itself. Plug it in, turn it on, scan the QR code displayed on the screen to download the Glow app. You can use a phone or tablet but the interactive experience is much better on a tablet. The app connects to the Glow over Bluetooth and enables a connection to your Wi-Fi network (2.4GHz or 5GHz). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKPlo9"&gt;Next, you sign in with your Amazon account (one is required to use the Glow and the companion app) and select your profile and add your children. If you already have an Amazon Kids account, they will show up, or you can create profiles for them. You can then add friends and family and choose which child they can interact with (if you have more than one). As a nice touch, you can change the family member’s name to one the child uses for them. Currently, the Glow app is only available to download in the US, so you won’t be able to chat with friends and family who live overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="eUsBmt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;My chief complaint with the Glow is it’s too tightly controlled&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WR8TqZ"&gt;When you add a contact, a download link for the Glow app is sent to them. On the other end, it gets a bit more complicated. Grandma or Grandpa has to sign in to their Amazon account (or sign up for one), add a mobile number, receive a text message confirmation code, and enter it in the app to enable Alexa calling. It’s also never made clear that it’s best to do this on a tablet, not a phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nanRUZ"&gt;Once set up, the child can call a contact by tapping on their avatar on the touchscreen, and the call comes in on the tablet like an Alexa call on an Echo smart display (although this is not an Alexa device). Once you answer it, both participants can see and control the game space and see each other. I like the interface because neither person sees themselves — you only see your playmate and the games, which helps a lot in limiting distractions. Although, this did often mean the grandparent wasn’t properly in the frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7PdFzjL1xdZd0fQ7QN_-GDZboHA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988607/jtuohy_211028_4856_0017_blurred.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chess is one of the few games you can play side by side (i.e. without being in a call) and was a favorite during our testing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FxaZCS"&gt;The Glow has an impressive amount of content at launch, leaning heavily on the Amazon Kids Plus’ books library (there is no video anywhere to be found, which is a good thing) and introducing several entirely new games and puzzles. Some of our favorites were Bubble Game (where you work against the clock and your opponent to burst bubbles holding your designated letter), Paddle Battle (a variant of the Pong arcade game), and card games Crazy 8s, Go Fish, and Slapjack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRHUPD"&gt;But it was chess that took over most of our testing time. I’d been trying to get my daughter into chess for years, and she’s always resisted. But here, with an instant setup and hints on how to play, she was quickly captivated. She also loved that you could play in different worlds (with the pieces dressed up according to the theme) and that each piece was animated. When you move a piece into a dangerous zone, it starts shaking and looking scared. When you move one to a good spot, it looks smug. Fun &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; educational. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wGu31WRLgaKy3ULjrlsqq2Xk38U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977080/jtuohy_211028_4856_0019_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The other person in the call uses the Glow app on an iPad (iOS14 or higher) or Android (OS 8 or higher) tablet to interact with the child using the Glow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HYVjG2"&gt;Perhaps the best feature of Glow overall is that the games learn your competency as you play, starting out easy but quickly escalating in difficulty as you do well, helping keep the child engaged. Each activity also starts with plenty of hints and prompts to make it clear whose turn it is and what you should be doing, taking a lot of the tiring explanation out of teaching a child (or grandparent) a new game. A lot of these do require the child be able to read, though, so for younger children the picture books from Disney, Mattel, and others are another highlight of the device, with interactive touch points for the child and conversation hints on the adult’s side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="tPco8P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon Glow is very promising but feels unfinished&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1kMuls"&gt;The gameplay was primarily smooth, but we did encounter a fair amount of freezing, slow loading, and glitches. Not surprising for a first-gen product that’s still in the testing stages, but frustrating all the same, causing my daughter to throw up her hands in annoyance and wander off during a game of Paddle Battle. (Again, this is a beta product for which you’re paying hundreds of dollars.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="OVZuHR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10847832"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kChYEW"&gt;The device is also slightly underpowered, and despite not being required to produce high-end graphics, a little more juice could help keep things flowing more smoothly. The video quality on the built-in 1280 x 800 resolution touchscreen was also often highly pixelated, and audio became robotic and garbled a few times. This was likely due to a poor internet connection on the other end, but something to bear in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uhCSJa"&gt;The Amazon Glow is very promising but feels unfinished, a bit rough around the edges, and too limiting. However, I hope Amazon keeps working on it as it has plenty of potential as a kids’ entertainment device as well as for other applications. Touch-enabled projection technology makes a ton of sense in the home when you don’t want screens everywhere. A small, voice-activated projection device tucked up under a kitchen cabinet that could project on your kitchen counter or wall when you need a recipe or to see the feed from your video doorbell could easily be the next evolution of Amazon’s smart home efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6K5h5O"&gt;But for now, you’ll probably want to pass on paying to join this beta test and wait for Amazon to fully flesh this product out before diving in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJouLL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart has PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles online today at 3PM ET</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yafvltDhCEhAYjlimngNXoncprM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70100579/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WX2inP"&gt;It’s November, and the holiday shopping season is well upon us. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;Early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; have already begun, and there’s sure to be a lot more in store for us come actual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt;. But the hottest tickets of the season, just as they were last year, are the still-hard-to-get consoles from Sony and Microsoft. Today, we bring some good news for you. Walmart is launching a restock of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;Playstation 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; consoles at 3PM ET / 12PM PT today, Friday, November 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxC1Bo"&gt;The consoles are hard enough to come by, but we don’t always get a drop of both Sony and Microsoft consoles at the same time — Walmart has been the only one doing so recently. Today’s restock will include the disc-based &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsoles110521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 for $500&lt;/a&gt; and its less-costly sibling, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsoles110521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 Digital Edition for $400&lt;/a&gt;. On the Microsoft front, Walmart’s offerings for today only include the top-tier &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsoles110521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X for $500&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CS6qwo"&gt;We strongly advise creating or logging in to your Walmart account in advance of 3PM. Make sure you already have your correct billing and shipping information added to minimize potential risk of delays or issues during the checkout process. If you don’t land the console of your choice right at 3PM, be sure to keep trying as Walmart often releases more stock in 10-minute increments until it’s all cleared out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUv6RI"&gt;Since buying a console is only one part of the equation, we have gone ahead and pulled together some key accessories, game subscriptions, and notable titles you might also consider during your purchase. Many of the options below are on sale or discounted, unlike the consoles, so you can save some money as you step into the latest gaming generation. We’ve even got an exclusive deal for &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers on a 12-month subscription to PlayStation Plus, this weekend only or while supplies last, for just &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeConsoles110521&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.proofpoint.com%2Fv2%2Furl%3Fu%3Dhttps-3A__www.eneba.com_us_psn-2Dplaystation-2Dnetwork-2Dcard-2Dpsn-2D365-2Ddays-2Dusa-2Dpsn-2Dkey-2Dunited-2Dstates%26d%3DDwMFaQ%26c%3D7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg%26r%3Dxk5KiED8BX7y2-_MCQb470KHOk8NhVXPerTCKuSIIjV9vZUa0o8dpEMoOMF_A_wF%26m%3DnV_0DHdj0FhX_webKkESlfOjCg5lBh3t9p_DUdvg5mhzeaqtP1R_v-b87nWieZeN%26s%3DrupKh2MCtibQPWxgcP1bIsJano46ZNTZUIXKXiEjHlg%26e%3D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$38 from Eneba&lt;/a&gt; (use code &lt;strong&gt;PLUSYEAR&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout). If picking up any of these accessories or titles at Walmart, add them to your cart ahead of time so you’re ready to go if you manage to nab a console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWPq1j"&gt;Good luck, and happy gaming!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EV startup Workhorse faces Department of Justice probe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tKtHqCZMKI_-OFCjyHjAJPc2q5k=/8x0:4025x2678/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70100436/workhorse.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1jQOFS"&gt;The Department of Justice has opened an investigation into struggling electric vehicle startup Workhorse, according &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/electric-van-maker-workhorse-is-being-investigated-by-the-justice-department-documents-show-11636122236"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The probe is reportedly being led by the US Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, which often investigates financial crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7uCHM"&gt;Workhorse is already part of an investigation from the Securities and Exchange Commission that first came to light in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652319/workhorse-fraud-sec-investigation-short-seller-fuzzy-panda"&gt;September&lt;/a&gt;, when short-selling research firm Fuzzy Panda released a report accusing the EV startup of fraud. It’s the third EV startup under investigation from both agencies, following Nikola (whose founder was indicted on fraud charges earlier this year) and Lordstown Motors (which Workhorse has deep ties, too). Both of those startups came under investigation after Hindenburg Research, another short-selling research firm, published reports filled with accusations of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sey47Y"&gt;The startup, an Ohio-based maker of commercial electric delivery vehicles, has struggled mightily the last few years as it fought for — but ultimately lost — the contract to build the next-generation mail truck for the United States Postal Service. That contract instead went to Oshkosh Defense. Workhorse protested the decision in the US Court of Federal Claims earlier this year, but abruptly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675630/workhorse-usps-mail-truck-bid-protest-dropped-oshkosh"&gt;dropped the lawsuit in September&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5R9ExO"&gt;Workhorse has also had trouble with its flagship vehicle, the C-1000. After finally getting it into production in August, the company immediately said it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616733/workhorse-c1000-electric-van-truck-redesign-wkhs-usps"&gt;needed to redesign the van&lt;/a&gt;. In September, it stopped shipping them altogether and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688037/workhorse-suspends-delivery-recall-c-1000-electric-van"&gt;recalled all 41 that had been delivered&lt;/a&gt;. The startup’s executive ranks have turned over recently as well, with CEO Duane Hughes departing in July and CFO Steve Schrader leaving in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGpf6K"&gt;The Fuzzy Panda report published in September contained allegations that Workhorse lied about the validity of some of the orders it had collected for its delivery vehicle, and that the startup may have also committed accounting fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QA7pI3"&gt;Throughout all this turmoil, Workhorse has largely survived on loans from hedge funds. It has put up much of its intellectual property as collateral for those loans and stands to lose a lot in the event of a default. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Dr. Brain is a bold, genre-bending thriller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="dr. brain" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bdSPZb0E9B9NJVm_kU2J-QnyLwI=/694x0:3147x1635/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70100297/Dr_Brain_Photo_010302.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A decent Korean original series debut for the platform, helmed by a seasoned director&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Z1rZU1"&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; stumbles through its world-building at times, there is something deeply bold and profoundly ambitious in this first Korean original series on Apple TV Plus. &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; takes off as a six-episode thriller starring Lee Sun-kyun (of &lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt; fame) as neuroscientist Dr. Koh Se-won. It’s an encouraging start for the streamer’s Korean debut, though the show doesn’t quite deliver on the promise of its fascinating premise and excellent cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFxyyD"&gt;We are first introduced to Dr. Koh as a young kid on the autism spectrum, struggling to understand emotions and relate to others. He is unfortunately labeled as a problem child in school, which becomes an enormous burden for his single mother. Bringing him to doctors, the (exorbitant) treatments offered don’t quite seem to work the way she hopes for. Growing up with a propensity to “take things apart to see what is inside,” Dr. Koh dives into brain research, which allows him to study the human mind and get a glimpse of how others experience the world. Presenting his research and experiments at conferences, he is portrayed as a relatively successful scientist — albeit one whose ideas are unsettling to his peers. This introduction then takes a dark, abrupt turn as Dr. Koh suffers a series of horrific personal tragedies in quick succession. Increasingly desperate to unearth what happened, he personally tests his research by undergoing “brain syncs” with the dead to pry open their memories for clues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8N3TH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; is a genre-bending piece of work, dancing between crime thriller, science fiction, and, most poignantly, a family drama. The series’ best work is in its portrait of grief, sketching Dr. Koh’s private moments as ones of anguish and gradual reckoning with his own flaws and missteps. There is a saying in academia that all research is in some part autobiographical and this rings true for Dr. Koh. His “brain sync” research becomes both a form of mourning and a type of searching, as he realizes that there is something more sinister behind the tragedies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="XHDPrQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eB9PW65kWFo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dbU7oN"&gt;Lee Sun-kyun delivers an appropriately reserved performance, getting the balance just right between playing an aloof neuroscientist and a traumatized, bereaved man seeking answers. His colleague, Dr. Hong Nam-il (Lee Jae-won), blossoms over the series, portraying a depth of character that far outdoes what the script offers him. As police officer Lieutenant Choi, Seo Ji-hye (from the immensely popular &lt;em&gt;Crash Landing On You&lt;/em&gt;) offers a refreshing steadiness throughout the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wg7MNB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s Foundation starts out big, lavish, and a little boring","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"},{"title":"Apple’s latest sci-fi drama Invasion starts out too dang slow","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22740520/invasion-review-apple-tv-plus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OgTp33"&gt;There are unshakeable marks of &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt; echoing through the six episodes, as characters wander through altered realities and layers of consciousness. &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain &lt;/em&gt;is most intriguing when its characters are unsure whether other people they are seeing are real or figments from a glitchy brain sync. Although the show fumbles through the details of the brain sync mechanism, the central story of Dr. Koh’s search for truth and redemption is resoundingly coherent. Which makes it all the more disappointing that the more philosophical explorations in &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; — on neurodiversity, ethics in brain research, and the concept of the self — are half-baked. Additionally, its treatment of female characters feels disconcertingly underdeveloped. They’re often left with little agency, abruptly enter and exit the narrative, and are ultimately relegated as untidy footnotes. With its uneven pace over six episodes, there is a gnawing sense that &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain &lt;/em&gt;could have been truly great if its supporting characters and theories were more deeply fleshed out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irGFjO"&gt;For example, though it never examines this fully, &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain &lt;/em&gt;hints at some of the most complex moral dilemmas in technology that we’re really only beginning to truly interrogate. It is gravely disturbing to see Dr. Koh lurking around the morgue to find a corpse to test out his brain sync technology or hook himself up with a cat (!!) in the name of (hopefully) solving a crime. There is a fine balance between being a user of technology and being used by technology. Here is where the concept of brain syncs in the show carries some real-life parallels. How much of ourselves do we share via technology — and do we even have control over what and how much is shared? What does privacy mean in this digital age? Can the methods of technological advancement be justified as long as the outcomes are “good”? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dr. Brain" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DnTuAzAMvTWXfCYSFw9JFSheX0U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988263/ATV_Dr_Brain_Photo_010104.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sfcGtw"&gt;These questions are all the more poignant given the fact that the show is backed by one of the biggest technology companies in the world. There is perhaps a meta-critique here somewhere about the relationship between Apple and its users and whether our lives have really been made better by its products. Perhaps the conclusion that the show offers us is one of stubborn ambivalence toward technology: Dr. Koh’s use of brain sync technology (somewhat ironically) allows him to experience the richness of life, in all of its emotions, joys and sorrows, more than he ever could without it. Yet, this comes at a cost. He sometimes suffers from an information overload and his personality changes when reality and technology start to blur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqzmld"&gt;Seasoned writer-director Kim Jee-woon has helmed critically acclaimed Korean classics like &lt;em&gt;The Good, The Bad, The Weird&lt;/em&gt; (2008) and Korea’s first Warner Brothers-funded film &lt;em&gt;The Age of Shadows&lt;/em&gt; (2016). There are flashes of brilliance throughout the series, particularly in its seamless, well-timed use of flashbacks — a storytelling tool that too often feels abused nowadays. On one level, his sleek transitions between past and present fittingly capture the unsettled mind of Dr. Koh. On another, these shifts in time provide an absorbingly suspenseful experience for the viewer, especially in the last few episodes. This works in the show’s favor, as Apple TV Plus will drop episodes of &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; one at a time, weekly through December 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3jFg09"&gt;Based on the popular Korean webtoon of the same name, &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; premiered on November 4th, coinciding with Apple TV Plus’ launch in the Korean market. Though Dr. Brain might feel like a slow start for Apple, it is perhaps helpful to remember that not too long ago, Netflix debuted its first Korean original series &lt;em&gt;Love Alarm&lt;/em&gt; to rather disappointing, less-than-illustrious reviews. However, the platform has since developed a prolific portfolio of Korean shows winning both critical and commercial acclaim, most notably with the breakout success of &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;. Despite its shortcomings, &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; offers a promising, hopeful glimpse of Apple TV Plus’ vision for its future projects in Korea and a veritable challenge to other streamers in the market. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook sued by defunct photo app Phhhoto on antitrust grounds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JIzpnsYya8tj1F4AQB55JBCdIso=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70100270/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook sued by founders of defunct photo app Phhhoto for putting it out of business&lt;/strong&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B4wt1E"&gt;Defunct photo app Phhhoto is suing Meta, formerly Facebook, on antitrust grounds, claiming the social media platform feigned interest in working with it, but then copied its features and hid its name from search results, effectively driving it out of business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TapuwX"&gt;Phhhoto’s technology allowed users to capture five frames “in a single point-and-shoot burst,” which could be looped into a short video (a phhhoto) to be shared either on its platform or Instagram. Sound familiar? That’s because, according to Phhhoto, Facebook copied Phhhoto’s main feature and &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-boomerang-video-app"&gt;released it on its Instagram platform as Boomerang in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, after blocking Phhhoto from Instagram’s API and from being pre-populated in Instagram posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ni4nr7"&gt;“The actions of Facebook and Instagram destroyed Phhhoto as a viable business and ruined the company’s prospects for investment,” Phhhoto says in a complaint filed in US District Court on Thursday. “Phhhoto failed as a direct result of Facebook’s anticompetitive conduct. But for Facebook’s conduct, Phhhoto was positioned to grow into a social networking giant, similar in size, scope, and shareholder value to other social networking and media companies with which Facebook did not interfere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxNiD6"&gt;Phhhoto, which launched in 2014 and shut down in 2017, claims it had 3.7 million monthly active users at its peak, and celebrities including Beyoncé, Joe Jonas, Chrissy Teigen, and Bella Hadid were uncompensated users of the app, posting its content to their Instagram accounts. Phhhoto claims in its complaint that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom, and several other Facebook employees downloaded the app in August 2014 and examined its features. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mIO0qRIZq4XBFWsVWBjZ2i00Om0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988080/zuck_phhhoto2.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Phhhoto / court filing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phhhoto claims in a new lawsuit that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg examined its app in 2014.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NvyYRi"&gt;Bryan Hurren, then strategic partnerships manager at Facebook, reached out to Phhhoto in February 2015, telling the company it was “really awesome,” and offering to incorporate its tech into Facebook Messenger, according to the lawsuit. Phhhoto declined, but Hurren then offered to incorporate Phhhoto content into the News Feeds of Facebook users. After investing heavily in the project, Phhhoto says Hurren cited internal legal conversations that prevented the two companies from moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkiMk2"&gt;In March 2015, Instagram’s settings changed, so that users of Phhhoto were unable to find their friends on Instagram, the lawsuit claims. Phhhoto claims Hurren told its team at the time that the company was “upset that Phhhoto was growing in users through its relationship with Instagram.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ow0KsL"&gt;Then, just as Phhhoto was about to launch the Android version of its app in October 2015, Instagram introduced Boomerang, which the lawsuit calls a “slavish clone” of Phhhoto. In March 2016, Phhhoto discovered that its content was being suppressed on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgVKXz"&gt;The company says its suspicions were confirmed in 2018, when UK’s Parliament released a &lt;a href="https://www.parliament.uk/globalassets/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-and-sport/Note-by-Chair-and-selected-documents-ordered-from-Six4Three.pdf"&gt;cache of previously sealed documents&lt;/a&gt; as part of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127230/facebook-data-documents-parliament-deals-zuckerberg"&gt;investigation into Facebook&lt;/a&gt;’s alleged anti-competitive and data-collection practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaG2EF"&gt;“This revelation provided the first link between Facebook’s earlier actions toward Phhhoto (here, cutting off API access) as part of an exclusionary scheme with the algorithmic suppression discovered in late 2017,” according to Phhhoto’s lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lgOo7"&gt;Phhhoto is seeking a jury trial and unspecified monetary damages. Joe Osborne, a spokesperson for Meta (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;Facebook changed its name to Meta&lt;/a&gt; on October 28th), said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “This suit is without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QrTRA4"&gt;

    <title>Lime raises over $500 million, confirms plans to take its electric scooter company public</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hw9PIGmh7cCQJpb3HfpDCVF4S2c=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099980/LIME_SAN_FRANCISCO_STREET_DREAMS_120.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vnRqfq"&gt;Lime announced today that it raised $523 million in debt financing, a sign that investors are feeling more optimistic about the long-term survival of shared electric scooters in a post-pandemic world. Lime must be feeling more optimistic, too, because a spokesperson confirmed that the company plans on going public sometime in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KM6IaK"&gt;Last September, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scooter-startup-lime-raise-new-funding-after-spac-setback-uber-2021-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Lime was hoping to raise up to $200 million in convertible debt from Uber and other previous investors. The scooter company was also reportedly in talks with investment bank Evercore about going public via a reverse merger with a special acquisition company, or SPAC, but &lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;says those talks fizzled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kV3isn"&gt;Now, Lime says that its most recent funding round was oversubscribed, with $418 million in debt financing led by Abu Dhabi Growth Fund, Fidelity Management &amp;amp; Research, Uber, and certain funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management. The company also received a $105 million senior secured term loan facility from a private equity group at UBS O’Connor. (These bank loans are typically made to companies that have below investment-grade credit ratings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nsZbXx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lime says that its most recent funding round was oversubscribed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VV805V"&gt;Lime is not releasing details about interest rates or anything else related to the terms of the deal, the spokesperson said. The company also declined to reveal whether it plans on going public by merging with a special acquisition company (SPAC) or a traditional initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8cavD"&gt;The past two years have been a rollercoaster for Lime and the shared scooter industry as a whole. The company’s ridership dropped 95 percent as a result of the pandemic. While the world was locked down, Lime made a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250420/lime-funding-uber-deal-alphabet-scooter-jump-bike"&gt;crucial investment deal with Uber&lt;/a&gt; and others for $170 million to take over the ride-hailing company’s bike and scooter business Jump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHMmiX"&gt;In the fall of 2020, the company was feeling more optimistic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538190/lime-scooter-ceo-interview-covid-future-200-million-rides"&gt;having hit the milestone of 200 million rides worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. Lime CEO Wayne Ting told a crowd of investors in November that for the first time the company was operating cash flow positive and free cash flow positive in the third quarter and was on pace to be full-year profitable, excluding certain costs, in 2021. (Being cash flow positive means Lime has more money going into the business at a given time than going out. But it’s not the same as having net income or being profitable after adjusting your earnings for interest and taxes, also known as EBIT.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFCm9G"&gt;Then the Delta variant hit, which led to more lockdowns and delayed reopenings. Now, a spokesperson wouldn’t confirm whether Lime was still on pace for a full year of profitability, even though its last quarter was EBIDTA (earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes, and amortization) profitable. (Its Q3 2020 was also EBITDA profitable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W0mIT9"&gt;Even though it has proven popular with riders, scooter sharing’s early years were marked by steep losses. Most companies relied on a hefty dose of venture capital to keep their operations afloat. The industry struggled to fix its unit economics, in which the purchase price for each scooter exceeded the amount of revenue it brought in before eventually breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nid79M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lime wouldn’t confirm whether it was still on pace for a full year of profitability&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5C4Pm4"&gt;The original scooters deployed by companies like Bird and Lime — mostly sourced from Chinese companies like Xiaomi and Segway-Ninebot — weren’t built for shared use, so they were prone to breakdowns, often within weeks of being rolled out. But over the last several years, the scooter companies have taken pains to roll out better, more durable scooters in order to increase the average life span and improve their unit economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuWHYs"&gt;Going public would certainly help raise cash in the near term, but it also carries big risks. Lime’s main rival, Bird, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428864/bird-electric-scooter-spac-public-valuation"&gt;recently went public via a SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt; that valued the Santa Monica-based company at $2.3 billion. That deal just closed, and as soon as they were publicly listed, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/shareholders-approve-bird-spac-merger-stock-promptly-falls/"&gt;shares in the newly merged company fell sharply&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o004cy"&gt;But while Bird relies on its business model of sending fleets of scooters to small operators to handle deployment and charging, Lime will likely rely on its scale and global status to attract investor interest. The company claims to be the top scooter operator in the US and Europe. It hit 250 million rides over the summer (recall it was at 200 million a year ago) and recently rolled out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575127/lime-next-gen-scooter-profit-quarter"&gt;fourth-generation version&lt;/a&gt; of its electric scooter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGplhu"&gt;“This oversubscribed round is a testament to the strong business we’ve built and the overwhelming confidence we’ve received from the financial community,” said Ting in a statement. “This investment will allow us to double down on our newest generation of e-bikes and e-scooters, as well as additional modes, to ensure people have reliable access to affordable, shared, carbon-free transportation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofn23J"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 5th, 11:38AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lime has had two EBITDA profitable quarters: Q3 2020 and Q3 2021. A previous version of this story misstated that. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTjLTR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
