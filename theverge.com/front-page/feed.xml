    <title>Gaming companies should avoid predatory designs, lawmakers say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uXcE5CvGicISOUPBcyOAfzcraP0=/203x0:2405x1468/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69704078/lootbox.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8yqk4y"&gt;Democrats are calling on some of the largest gaming companies to better protect children by extending new UK design rules to children in the US. The regulations could ban companies from selling in-game loot boxes to minors, among other restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zrig6L"&gt;&lt;a href="https://trahan.house.gov/uploadedfiles/final_game_letters_-_combined.pdf"&gt;In letters to a dozen major gaming companies&lt;/a&gt;, including Blizzard, Epic Games, Microsoft, Nintendo, and Riot, Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), Rep. Kathy Castor (D-FL), and Rep. Lori Trahan (D-MA) pressed executives to extend new UK design regulations to children in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GtOFw"&gt;“It is imperative that Congress acts with urgency to enact a strong privacy law for children and teens in the 21st century,” the lawmakers wrote. “As we work towards that goal, we urge you to extend to American children and teens any privacy enhancements that you implement to comply with the AADC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zvVsVK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is imperative that Congress acts with urgency to enact a strong privacy law for children”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BmSPE5"&gt;The new UK rules, called the “Age Appropriate Design Code,” are set to roll out next month, applying to social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram as well as games like &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;. Specifically, the new rules force companies to design their products in the “best interests” of children, offer stricter privacy settings and policies for different age groups, and restrict “nudging techniques” often used to encourage users to continue using the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdAClo"&gt;The UK law does not extend to children in the US, but in Tuesday’s letters, lawmakers called on the 12 companies to voluntarily apply these same protections to Americans. Notably, the lawmakers argued that the Entertainment Software Rating Board’s (ESRB) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18226852/loot-boxes-gaming-regulation-gambling-free-to-play"&gt;loot box guidance&lt;/a&gt; does not go far enough in protecting children from “manipulation” associated with these in-game purchases and that the companies should create stricter regulations in compliance with the new UK rules in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3IWwk"&gt;“The prevalence of micro-transactions—often encouraged through nudging— have led to high credit card bills for parents,” the lawmakers wrote. “Loot boxes go one step further, encouraging purchase before a child knows what the ‘bundle’ contains— akin to gambling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkZZNV"&gt;The US already has some laws protecting children’s privacy — most notably the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, authored by Markey. But the law only applies to children under the age of 12. The UK rules extend to minors under the age of 18. Earlier this year, Castor reintroduced her &lt;a href="https://castor.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403677"&gt;“Kids PRIVCY Act”&lt;/a&gt; which includes elements of the UK’s Age Appropriate Design Code. Specifically, the bill would prohibit behavioral ad targeting to children and force companies to design their products in the best interests of young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q73Z38"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmj8i7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p id="CTi4Nv"&gt;We’re also inviting the next generation of creators to join us.

    <title>TCL announces new 6-series and 5-series TVs that come with Google TV instead of Roku</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TsVhJe5TqlZKcilBMKh4pTS3QcM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69704022/IMG_1105.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tMUdnH"&gt;TCL has long been the flag bearer of Roku TVs. The company’s 6-series is one of the best-performing sets you can buy for under $1,000. It features a fantastic picture with the help of Mini LED backlighting — TCL beat Samsung and LG to implementing that technology — and quantum dot HDR color. The 5-series and 4-series Roku TVs are no slouches either in their respective pricing tiers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urAnGl"&gt;But now TCL is taking a step that could dramatically shake up the US TV market: it’s expanding beyond Roku and will release updated versions of its most popular TVs that come with Google TV on board. The software that debuted on Google’s 2020 Chromecast (and also runs on recent TVs from Sony) will now be offered on the latest 5-series and 6-series TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14EAlh"&gt;I recently spoke with some of TCL’s executives who made it abundantly clear that the company is not transitioning to Google TV &lt;em&gt;instead&lt;/em&gt; of Roku or walking away from its longtime partner. Rather, TCL expects that the TV operating system landscape will take after smartphones and eventually consolidate down to two choices: Roku OS and Google TV. TCL wants to offer consumers the choice of either one, and the existing 6-series and 5-series Roku TVs will remain for sale. That stance seems just a bit dismissive of Samsung’s Tizen and LG’s webOS TV platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IlY0T4"&gt;The Google TV versions retain the same price points as the Roku models — but there are some tweaks and upgrades since they’re newer hardware. For one, the TCL 6-series with Google TV will be capable of 4K at 120Hz, an improvement over the Roku model, which can only reach 120Hz at 1440p. That’s a big deal for PS5 and Xbox Series gamers. The Google TV version comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports (one of which is eARC), with two additional HDMI 2.0 ports. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E2rWF6C3E3SnkkLSGpiwnfYm2cU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773200/IMG_1100.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 6-series with Google TV has two full-spec HDMI 2.1 ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3hdixt"&gt;Both the 6-series and 5-series with Google TV will also support HDR10+. And in what some people might perceive as a controversial decision, TCL is outfitting its Google TVs with always-listening microphones that can be used for voice commands. There’s a physical switch on the back of the TVs to disable the microphones if you prefer to stick to the remote’s press-and-hold method to Google Assistant controls. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qFNuGb6X0G8c93JBvuryWBohoAs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773206/IMG_1098.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL’s Google TVs have always-listening mics located at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LFXHVo5GmQoIBlMxTOv5iQYUEng=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773199/IMG_1097.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a physical switch to turn off the TV’s built-in microphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HbmU9e"&gt;The lower-priced 5-series doesn’t include 4K at 120Hz, but it still gives you full-array local dimming and both variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode when gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeDxwB"&gt;TCL is highlighting Google TV’s content-focused interface, which differs significantly from the grid-of-apps Roku homescreen UX. Here’s what the company says the new software offers customers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CNQx3I"&gt;With the addition of Google TV, TCL’s latest offerings will also come with notable features like the For You tab where users will find new content based on their interests, across their streaming services; the Watchlist to fine tune recommendations by clicking on content and saving to watch later, even from a browser or phone; and the Live TV integrated channel guide where recommendations for streaming content are visible alongside live program listings. In addition, quickly finding TV shows and movies by title, genre, and even actors, is made possible by pressing the dedicated Google Assistant button on the remote and saying the command; or simply make Google TV the hub of any smart home by easily controlling your connected devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="p3AaZZ"&gt;Preorders for TCL’s first Google TVs in the US begin today: I’ve included their Best Buy links below. The company tells me that the new 5-series will ship within the next couple weeks, and the 6-series should follow shortly after that. A 75-inch model of the 6-series is expected to come later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QRJge"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TCL 6-series with Google TV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748695675415496976" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch: $1,299&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748695712892295817" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch: $999&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgFuzC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TCL 5-series with Google TV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748695744417216631" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;75-inch: $1,299&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748695761875439072" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch: $899&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748695795187643160" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch: $649&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748695826735635451" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch: $599&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u11BwsVPeCrrNhukCEvyA6KxDzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773307/IMG_1101.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The remote for the TCL Google TVs is quite different from the Roku remote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2Ljud"&gt;It’s worth noting that TCL’s very best TVs, which include the 8-series and 8K-capable 6-series, will still exclusively run Roku OS in North America. But regardless, I’m curious to see how this will shake out over the coming months. As I said earlier, TCL has always been the premier Roku TV brand. The company’s vertical integration and in-house panel production has put it in a place where, for example, Amazon’s Fire TVs from Toshiba and other brands have been unable to compete in terms of picture quality. Now, Google TV is about to get a huge boost by serving as the backbone of that impressive hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRWSms"&gt;There are upgrades here (particularly on the 6-series) that might push people toward the newer Google TV TCLs instead of the previous Roku sets. But you’ll also have those people who have sworn off ever bringing a TV with microphones into their home — mute switch or not. I’m looking forward to taking a closer look at TCL’s Google TVs in the weeks ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Beats Studio Buds are already $20 off at Amazon and Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vcoTzDBjvW18DhQigmIWvGClqe4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703765/DSCF4152_Edited.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Typically $150, Amazon and Walmart are both taking $20 off the recently-released earbuds. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qh5ECz"&gt;The Beats name carries quite a bit of clout, which is perhaps the reason Apple is able to sell headphones and earbuds that fall under the Beats umbrella for a premium, regardless of their performance. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22533158/beats-studio-buds-features-price"&gt;Beat Studio Buds&lt;/a&gt; are a great case in point. The fitness-focused earbuds lack wireless charging and suffer from lackluster noise cancellation, however, they typically command a higher price than some of the like-minded competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJri1v"&gt;Thankfully, they’re currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/1141873/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBeats-Studio-Buds-True-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Black%2F643659699&amp;amp;partnerpropertyid=1065598" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $20 off, the first discount the colorful earbuds have received since making their debut in June. Noted flaws aside, the Beats Studio Buds still tout a comfortable, stem-less design and satisfying sound for the price, along with USB-C charging and support for a handful of Android-specific features — a hallmark we hope Apple brings to more devices in the future. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RN8hwK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10693512"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LmGDy1"&gt;The latest iPad Air is, arguably, the best tablet for most people right now. The well-built, midrange device adopts some design elements from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features"&gt;2018 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; and is compatible with many of the same devices, yet it’s not nearly as big or expensive as its larger sibling. Nonetheless, it comes with a terrific display, USB-C connectivity, and Apple’s A14 Bionic processor, a chip that promises to provide ample speed for years to come. Normally $600, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748634717956796230#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are selling the 10.9-inch iPad Air with Wi-Fi and 64GB of storage for $500, matching the best price we’ve seen on the 2020 iPad Air this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

While still occasionally pricier than similarly specced Chromebooks, Google’s sensible 13.3-inch laptop remains one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; you can buy, with good battery life, an excellent keyboard, and an attractive, understated design that makes the most of its sturdy magnesium chassis. This particular model — which is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YMM4YC1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748639044897168537#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $749&lt;/a&gt; — also packs in a Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM, while remaining plenty light at 2.3 pounds. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi announces Mix 4 with under-display camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jo5Uu8jPjslxptbyKiozr17qA9E=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703667/mix4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pf5xvq"&gt;Xiaomi has announced the Mix 4, the first phone in the Mi Mix series to be announced in nearly three years. The Mix phones have always been about bezel-less designs with seamless screens, and the Mix 4 carries on that idea by commercializing a technology that Xiaomi has been working on for a long time: a selfie camera that’s located directly under the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PziUla"&gt;Xiaomi calls this CUP (Camera Under Panel) technology, though it’s similar to the under-display selfie cameras we’ve seen from other companies. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608812/oppo-next-generation-under-screen-camera-tech-announced"&gt;Oppo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597594/zte-axon-30-refresh-specs-availability-under-display-phone-camera"&gt;ZTE&lt;/a&gt;’s latest efforts, the Mix 4’s screen has a 400ppi area that lets light pass through to the selfie camera, which Xiaomi describes as “virtually invisible.” The camera is 20 megapixels and the display is a 6.67-inch 120Hz 1080p curved OLED panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky1XD1"&gt;Xiaomi says CUP is “a technology iterated through three major generations, five years, sixty patents, a $77 million investment, and hundreds of engineers.” Last year the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405241/xiaomi-under-display-selfie-camera-no-notch-hole-punch-2021-mass-production"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; to start mass-producing smartphones with its third-generation under-display camera technology in 2021, so it’s making good on that promise with the Mix 4. Xiaomi first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650166/xiaomi-under-display-selfie-camera-weibo-teaser-mi-9-notch-hole-punch"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; its take on the idea back in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JS4R8h5931q5lgahRKBbyHVS2HU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773053/Xiaomi_MIX_4_13.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MBQ0Ih"&gt;The Mix 4 is the first phone to be announced with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550723/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-cpu-ai-performance-mwc-2021"&gt;Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 Plus processor&lt;/a&gt;, a speed-bumped version of the flagship 888 chip with a top clock speed of 3GHz. (Honor did already say that it would use the 888 Plus in the Magic 3, but that phone is yet to be revealed in full.) The processor is paired with 8GB or 12GB of RAM and 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQ1Axr"&gt;The camera system centers around a 108-megapixel Samsung HMX sensor, suggesting similar or identical performance to the slightly outdated but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;still pretty good Mi 11&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also a 13-megapixel ultrawide and an 8-megapixel 5x periscope telephoto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tajwxO"&gt;The Mix 4 has a 4,500mAh battery that can charge at up to 120W wired and 50W wireless. This isn’t Xiaomi’s first phone with 120W fast-charging, but it might be the fastest — Xiaomi claims the battery will get a full charge in under 15 minutes, compared to 23 minutes for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363317/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-announcement-twitter-fast-charging"&gt;last year’s Mi 10 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. 50W wireless charging, meanwhile, will take 28 minutes to get you to 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgxMRA"&gt;Xiaomi will only confirm a mainland China launch for the Mix 4 so far. Preorders will start there tomorrow with general availability coming on August 16th, and the pricing starts at 4,999 yuan (~$770) for an 8GB/128GB model, going up to 6,299 yuan (~$970) for 12GB/512GB.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue’s $50 Icepop mic brings subtle improvements to some Logitech headsets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logitech Blue Icepop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7aLnFia2LUTCk6Z_5BKyiMTHqWk=/0x0:2056x1371/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703641/gproxicepop1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Icepop is compatible with the G Pro X Wireless, the G Pro X, G Pro, and Astro A40.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kGagu1"&gt;Not content with cornering the market with its USB microphones, the latest product from Logitech-owned Blue is a detachable mic called the Icepop. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluemic.com%2Ficepop&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F10%2F22612829%2Flogitech-blue-icepop-microphone-g-pro-x-wireless-gaming-headset" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s a $49.99 upgrade&lt;/a&gt; that can replace the default mics included with Logitech’s G Pro X Wireless gaming headset, the G Pro X, the G Pro, as well as Astro’s A40 headsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5Gjo1"&gt;Logitech is promising that the Icepop will deliver enhanced “broadcast-quality” performance with its 10mm electret condenser mic. It has a built-in pop filter that aims to eliminate those hard “b” or “p” sounds that can be a giveaway that you’re using a lesser mic, and its unidirectional cardioid pickup is said to eliminate background noise and focus more on your voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXxObM"&gt;Installing the Icepop is as simple as plugging it into one of the compatible headsets’ 3.5mm mic jack. Logitech sent over a G Pro X Wireless for testing, and there were no firmware or software updates required to get it working. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech Icepop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9bdgKTqn0l3vB7nvlSUPfQ9mgQg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766156/gproxicepop2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Icepop plugs into one of the compatible mics via 3.5mm jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NfHzF7"&gt;Now, yours truly isn’t a podcast host, so I don’t have preferred voice settings locked in for the times when I need to jump into a voice chat. But to illustrate how the recording quality differs between the Icepop and the default mic that ships with the G Pro X Wireless, I recorded several samples to show what they sound like with and without the special Blue Voice features built into Logitech’s G Hub software. If you’re using the Astro A40, you won’t be able to access the Blue Voice features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6kwBK"&gt;The first is a clean feed from the G Pro X Wireless default mic with no special voice presets via Blue Voice. (My voice sounds a little dull with this mic, and it’s relatively easy to hear my air conditioner running in the background once my voice stops near the end.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yrE8Ks"&gt;&lt;audio controls=""&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766084/gproxwirelessdefaultmic.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sslJH6"&gt;Here’s the default mic again but with Blue Voice turned on with the “Broadcaster 1” preset activated. (Background noise has been hushed, and my voice has much more depth, though it’s still not particularly warm-sounding.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hkig1g"&gt;&lt;audio controls=""&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766095/gproxwirelessdefaultmicbluevoice.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YDHFj0"&gt;Now, here’s how the Icepop sounds without any tweaks made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k8Dq2y"&gt;&lt;audio controls=""&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766097/icepopdefault.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bVQrg2"&gt;Lastly, here’s how the Icepop sounds with the same “Broadcaster 1” preset turned on in Blue Voice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sFSIms"&gt;&lt;audio controls=""&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766100/icepopbluevoice.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ehVM6u"&gt;After listening to the samples over and over, the difference in quality between Logitech’s default mic and the Icepop, while noticeable, isn’t as apparent as I was expecting considering its $49.99 cost. Of course, it’s not reasonable to expect this add-on to rival standalone microphones that cost more, and there are some things that I like about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5iQ6Y"&gt;The Icepop does a better job of accurately capturing what my voice sounds like in real life, replacing some of that shrill effect from the default mic with warmth. And those “b” and “p” sounds do sound great, as advertised, though I was surprised to hear it fumble a little when I made “x” and “s” sounds. That could be my slight lisp or it could be a flaw with the tuning or a limitation of the mic. Turning on the Blue Voice feature fixed most of my complaints, but I was expecting a little more out of the raw feed captured through the Icepop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9tPpiV"&gt;Given that voices have so much range and that hearing is, of course, subjective, I recommend giving this a try if you’re curious and already own one of the compatible headsets. Depending on how you like to gussy up your voice for chats, streams, or podcast appearances, you might be able to get some solid performance out of the Icepop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0mvab"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxoabH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rsutNN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP announces new detachable and all-in-one Chrome OS computers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jItH8BcKBYolBcYJSTILEKQg-sg=/0x150:3600x2550/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703584/HP_Chrome_Family_August_2021_new_Shot2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Chromebase AiO (left) and Chromebook x2 11 (right) Chrome OS computers.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eEQVW6"&gt;HP is announcing two new Chrome OS computers for its consumer-focused lineup. The first is the Chromebase AiO, an all-in-one desktop computer with a screen that can rotate from landscape to portrait. The second is the Chromebook x2 11, a lightweight detachable that can easily shift from laptop to tablet modes. The company is also announcing a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183975/google-works-with-chromebook-badge-accessories-chargers-keyboards-mice"&gt;Works With Chromebook-certified&lt;/a&gt; 24-inch USB-C monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WF2kW"&gt;All three new products are designed for students, families, and general consumers. The Chromebase AiO will be available at HP, Amazon, and Best Buy this month, while the Chromebook x2 11 will be available from Best Buy this month and from HP’s website in October. Both computers start at $599.99 for base configurations. The M24fd USB-C monitor will be available in October from HP directly for $249.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="K1Q2tY"&gt;HP Chromebase AiO&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/55n2Ny3lr-nlyjude26Lm2EMzvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769857/HP_Chromebase_AiO_FrontFace_Articulation_Hero.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chromebase AiO’s 21.5-inch touchscreen display can rotate from landscape to portrait orientation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lTvLkm"&gt;The $600-and-up Chromebase AiO is an all-in-one computer with a rotating display — a first for all-in-one Chrome OS desktops. Its 21.5-inch touchscreen has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and it comes with either an Intel Pentium Gold processor or a 10th Gen Core i3 chip. The base Pentium Gold configuration has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage; you’ll be able to get up to 16GB RAM and a 256GB SSD with an upgraded model, but oddly, there isn’t a configuration with 8GB of RAM available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UT6pLi"&gt;The conical base of the Chromebase AiO is made of aluminum and houses dual 5-watt speakers and four ports — two USB-C and two USB-A — as well as a 3.5mm headphone jack. A 5-megapixel camera is available for video calling. You can selectively disable the camera or microphones with the Chromebase’s built-in shutter. Included in the box is a wireless mouse and keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hqf83O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A first look at HP’s new all-in-one Chrome OS desktop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22379888"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qA2-s3L2totXG7x7kVdypZnO_ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769858/HP_Chromebase_AiO_RearFace_Landscape.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the Chromebase AiO’s ports are located on the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QyhvY0"&gt;Along with its ability to rotate from landscape to portrait, the screen can be tilted back 20 degrees, though there is no height adjustment. HP says portrait mode makes it easier to read long webpages or work with documents. I had a chance to test out a pre-production version of the Chromebase AiO to see how useful the rotating screen is in person — you can read my impressions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22379888"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Qualcomm-powered Chromebook x2 11 comes with a detachable keyboard, kickstand, and rechargeable pen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zlTP06"&gt;The Chromebook x2 11 is an 11-inch Chrome OS tablet that comes with a magnetic keyboard and kickstand to use it in laptop mode. It has Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7c processor (the first-generation chip, not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451392/qualcomm-snapdragon-7c-gen-2-arm-processor"&gt;more recently announced second-gen version&lt;/a&gt;) and optional 4G LTE connectivity (but not 5G). HP claims it will last up to 11 hours between charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QFfGd"&gt;The 11-inch touchscreen display features a 3:2 aspect ratio and 2160 x 1440 resolution. The tablet itself is made of aluminum and has two USB-C ports for charging and data transfer and a microSD card reader. A fingerprint reader is integrated into the power button for biometric logins, while dual speakers provide audio. Unfortunately, HP wasn’t able to find room for a 3.5mm headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFg0Um"&gt;A 5-megapixel camera is available for video calls, while an 8-megapixel camera is on the back for photo taking or document scanning.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The x2 11’s display features a productivity-friendly 3:2 aspect ratio.&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KBH4Gm"&gt;The Chromebook x2 11 will be available with either 64GB or 128GB of storage paired with 8GB of RAM. The LTE-equipped models come with either 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage or 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tHq8L"&gt;Included in the box is a wireless pen that magnetically attaches to the side of the x2 11 to recharge. It can be used with Google’s new Cursive progressive web app for note-taking and sketching. The x2 11 will be the first device on the market with the Cursive app; Google says it will be made available to other Chrome OS devices in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M24fd USB-C is certified to be plug-and-play with Chromebooks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4k4k2w"&gt;The M24fd is a USB-C monitor that has Google’s Works With Chromebook certification for simple setup with a Chrome OS laptop. It can provide up to 65 watts of power to the connected laptop over the USB-C cable, or you can connect it to other devices over HDMI (1.4) or VGA. There are also two USB-A ports on the monitor for other peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQMR87"&gt;The 23.8-inch display is IPS and has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. HP says it has horizontal and vertical viewing angles of 178 degrees and supports AMD’s FreeSync tech for more fluid gameplay, with refresh rates up to 75Hz. Brightness is rated up to 300 nits and there is an anti-glare coating on the display itself. HP claims up to 99 percent coverage of the sRGB color space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/04X3gLPAJQeX6ZJJ5n8sAjP7vhg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769866/HP_M24fd_USB_C_Monitor_Rear.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition to a USB-C port, the M24fd has HDMI, VGA, and two USB-A ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UVSSah"&gt;The M24fd’s detachable stand doesn’t rotate like the Chromebase AiO, but it does allow for tilt adjustment from negative 5 to positive 25 degrees. There is no height adjustment, however.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP’s new Chromebase AiO has a screen that rotates from portrait to landscape</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WMU1qTxhw13HQCUqvxEc3o9oQzw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703548/dseifert_4699_hp_chromebase_21_5_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Chromebase AiO all-in-one computer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TWaqDM"&gt;HP has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22379829"&gt;just announced three new Chrome OS-focused products&lt;/a&gt;: a detachable tablet, a new all-in-one, and a Works With Chromebook-certified monitor. All of them are designed to capitalize on the explosive growth Chrome OS devices have seen over the past year and a half, as many students and families have had to adopt remote schooling. I’ve had a chance to try out a pre-production version of the new Chromebase AiO ahead of the announcement, read on for some first impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypwWDH"&gt;The Chromebase AiO is the first all-in-one Chrome OS desktop with the ability to rotate its screen from landscape to portrait. You can switch modes with just a light push on the corner — the content on the screen will automatically rotate to match the new orientation for you. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9hwq2BGzN_LnsqF8q2GpKcR5SdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769958/dseifert_4699_hp_chromebase_21_5_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chromebase AiO’s claim to fame is the ability to rotate its display to portrait orientation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d89p4v"&gt;HP claims this makes the Chromebase more versatile and easier to use for scrolling through long webpages or working with long documents. But in practice, I didn’t find the portrait mode very helpful in my day-to-day work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="b8VyHR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"HP announces new detachable and all-in-one Chrome OS computers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22379829"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ESMkTb"&gt;For starters, whenever I rotated the screen from landscape to portrait or vice versa, my window arrangement would get lost, forcing me to reset everything. It might be fine if all you use is a single window, but the 21.5-inch screen is large enough to invite you to open multiple windows for side-by-side comparisons or just better multitasking. This obviously works best when the screen is in landscape mode, but whenever you switch to portrait and back again, you’ll have to rearrange all of your open windows. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fine when the screen is in landscape, but becomes awkwardly tall and long in portrait mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R47RJ3"&gt;Additionally, the built-in webcam is on the long edge of the screen, making it most useful in landscape mode. When the screen is rotated to portrait, the camera is awkwardly off to the side. (It’s effectively the opposite of the problem with the webcam placement on the iPad Pro.) A portrait orientation screen can be very useful as a secondary display, but it doesn’t make as much sense to me for a primary one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6GrpPEGMg4YrmI2w0cnf3gpd_C4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769966/dseifert_4699_hp_chromebase_21_5_18.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The base of the Chromebase AiO is aluminum with light gray fabric and is attractive without being ostentatious.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qe9SlZ"&gt;Though the marquee feature didn’t win me over, the rest of the Chromebase’s design is quite nice. The base is wrapped in attractive fabric, the dual speakers kick out a surprising amount of sound and are clear when used for video calls. The general design is modern, yet understated enough to fit in most home decors. This isn’t a bright yellow iMac, which is probably a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ClJCJy"&gt;The screen itself is bright enough for indoor use and is fine for typical productivity or school work, even if its 1080p resolution isn’t the most pixel dense. The touch response is suitable and a nice thing to have if a younger student is using the computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ExXJVS"&gt;The model I’ve been able to try out is the mid-tier version with a 10th Gen Core i3 processor and 4GB of RAM. As this is a pre-production model, I haven’t done any formal benchmarking, but in general usage the processor is more than up to the task of running Chrome OS at this resolution, even when I have multiple desktops, windows, and tabs going at the same time. (The only real sluggishness I noticed was when I tried to play 4K YouTube videos.) The RAM, on the other hand, was an unsurprising bottleneck: I frequently had tabs or windows reload in the background, causing me to miss things like email notifications or lose my place in a paused YouTube video. Just 4GB of RAM might be passable on a small tablet where you are likely only working with one window at a time, but on a device with a large screen that invites you to multitask, it’s not enough. The top-spec configuration comes with 16GB of RAM, but I’m not sure why HP isn’t offering one with 8GB, which is enough for most people and doesn’t have the limitations of 4GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ouXbJFS2L0s6En8xygHM3M9BT2s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769948/dseifert_4699_hp_chromebase_21_5_17.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the Chromebase’s ports are arranged on the back of the base.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5sxJ1eAwFBdWJCJG7pFrEZGKBJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769956/dseifert_4699_hp_chromebase_21_5_11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included wireless mouse and keyboard use AAA batteries and connect over Bluetooth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sRxzm2"&gt;All of the ports on the Chromebase AiO are neatly arranged in a vertical column on the back of the computer and should be plenty for most people. There are two USB-C ports rated at 10Gbps and two USB-A ports rated at 5Gbps and all of them can be used to charge mobile devices. The only inconvenient part of this design is the 3.5mm headphone jack, which requires reaching around the back of the display to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0ghh3"&gt;The included wireless keyboard and mouse are simple, but mostly fine. They run on AAA batteries and connect via Bluetooth. The keyboard is plasticky, but pleasant enough to type on, while the scroll wheel and buttons on the mouse are stiffer than I’d like. Sadly, there’s no biometric authentication on the Chromebase AiO, requiring me to type in a PIN or password to log in each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzqXzo"&gt;HP says the pricing for the Chromebase AiO starts at $599.99, which would be for the model with the lower-tier Pentium Gold chip and slower eMMC storage. The company didn’t have pricing information for the spec tier I was able to test, but the top-tier model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage will sell for $770. If you’re willing to spend that much, the Chromebase AiO might be an interesting desktop to consider, provided Chrome OS meets all of your computing needs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameMaker Studio 2 will now let you publish on desktop, mobile, and the web for $9.99 per month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zZY9GBSmW8TTPztHn4jdm0iFdEM=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703528/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YoYo Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xLMac8"&gt;GameMaker Studio 2, the game development software used to create indie darlings like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/9/4819852/hyper-light-drifter-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyper Light Drifter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/7/7/4497618/undertale-combines-classic-rpg-gameplay-with-a-pacifist-twist"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is introducing new pricing options today that should make it even more affordable to develop independent games. GameMaker Studio’s developer YoYo Games is now offering an updated “unlimited” free version of the software for hobbyists, a new “Indie” price tier that bundles all non-console platform licenses together for $9.99 per month, and cheaper licenses for studios publishing games on consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9Bm2S"&gt;Prior to today, GameMaker Studio 2 had a free price tier mostly intended for learning how to use the software. It had a monthlong time limit and required you to pony up for a subscription (starting at $39 per year to develop for Mac or Windows) to keep experimenting, among other restrictions. The new unlimited version ditches the time limit but will still require amateur developers to pay to export and publish their game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="laCH4b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Publish games everywhere for a lot less&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xmJt9G"&gt;The price to export and publish is luckily also going down. The new Indie price tier bundles licenses for Mac, Windows, Android (including Amazon’s Fire OS), iOS, UWP (Universal Windows Platform), Ubuntu, and HTML5 for $9.99 per month / $99.99 per year. Previously, non-console pricing broke down into two categories: Creator offered $39-per-year subscriptions to licenses for either PC or Mac; and Developer&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;gave $99-a-piece permanent licenses to export games for mobile, desktop (Mac, Windows, and Ubuntu), HTML5, and UWP. Packaging them into a single option simplifies things and makes it easier to get games released across a greater variety of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhtKd9"&gt;The final pricing change is to console licenses. YoYo Games used to charge $199 per year to publish on either Xbox, PlayStation, or Switch. Those prices will now be replaced by a single Enterprise tier for a $79.99 per month / $799.99 per year subscription. That’s the same offering as YoYo Games’ old $1,500-per-year Ultimate license for a dramatically lower price. Some of the flexibility of picking and choosing a specific console to publish on is lost, but the benefit of a lot more platform options might be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxJxIs"&gt;Developing games has obvious hurdles (learning how to code is just scratching the surface), but the price is one of the larger ones. Lowering the cost to develop and publish on popular platforms like iOS and Android could make a big difference for developers just getting their start. Even if it doesn’t, now anyone can experiment for free at their own pace.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is bringing Samsung to the Apple Watch fight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rumored Galaxy Watches" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lHR93ChNVZ3qCQpGsLLfZGg5-nM=/1x0:1600x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703617/Samsung_Galaxy_Watch_4_Classic_AH_02_1420x799.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Rumored Galaxy Watches | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic" target="_blank"&gt;Android Headlines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zJEfSe"&gt;On Wednesday, August 11th Samsung is expected to announce a couple new smartwatches: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22608535/samsung-unpacked-event-date-time-galaxy-z-fold-flip-earbuds-watches"&gt;widely rumored Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic&lt;/a&gt;. The company that has the most to gain — or lose — from the success of these watches isn’t Samsung, however, it’s Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GwQ0w"&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17924798/google-smartwatch-wear-os-tick-tock-apple-watch-competitor"&gt;many years now&lt;/a&gt;, I have decried the lack of good smartwatch options for Android phones. There’s nothing in the Android ecosystem that matches the quality and utility of the Apple Watch. As the pace of development in phones seems to slow, the pace of development on wearables still has a chance of growing. And without a viable alternative for Android users, it’s ever more likely that Apple will peel off users (or keep iPhone owners from ever trying Android).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYEp1H"&gt;At long last, Google seems to be ready to finally make a strong attempt to get back in the wearables game. But despite buying Fitbit and despite rumors that Google is working on some kind of Pixel watch, Samsung will be the first out of the gate with Wear OS 3 smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NeABQc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung is first out of the gate with Wear OS 3&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="drgemK"&gt;They will be based on the collaboration between Google and Samsung that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;announced earlier this year at Google IO&lt;/a&gt;. In essence, Samsung is abandoning its custom Tizen OS for watches and instead contributing parts of it to a newly-invigorated version of Google’s moribund Wear OS. Both Google and Samsung are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;promising better battery life, nicer software experiences, and more robust third party app support&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYyk3n"&gt;But making a smartwatch that’s better than current Wear OS watch options is embarrassingly easy. Samsung has been doing it for years with its Tizen watches — watches which only really work well with Samsung devices and have been hampered by awful third party app support. We’ve often recommended Galaxy watches as the best option for Android users — but “best” is not the same thing as “great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plmQPU"&gt;It’s not just about improving on the low bar of either Wear OS or Tizen. There are low bars everywhere for Android users. As Wear OS stagnated, OnePlus, RealMe, Oppo, Fitbit, and others have turned to proprietary, simplified platforms that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380322/oneplus-watch-review-price-specs-features"&gt;lack the features you’d expect&lt;/a&gt; in a smartwatch today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="secmdD"&gt;So the pressure is quite high for both Samsung and Google to deliver to make a pair of smartwatches that are good enough to keep Android owners who want a smartwatch from feeling like they’re missing out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvjHTt"&gt;We will obviously have to wait to review the watches to see if Google and Samsung can meet the moment, but it’s not likely that this first go-round of Wear OS 3 watches from Samsung will be able to match the ecosystem or integration of the Apple Watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCnqHo"&gt;As of right now, the only Wear OS 3 watches we know for sure are coming are these two from Samsung. Fossil will be making watches for this holiday season, but they will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; launch with this new Wear OS 3 platform — instead they’ll use the current, disappointing software until an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;update is made available&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond that, we have no idea what the roadmap for Wear OS looks like. Many companies you’d expect to churn out Wear OS watches have bailed in favor of their own platforms — or bailed on smartwatches altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CRtYcW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung will be the sole provider of Wear OS 3 smartwatches for awhile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QkJERr"&gt;Which means that when it comes to competing with the Apple Watch, Samsung’s Galaxy Watches are going to be the only game in town. And that’s a problem for Google, because Samsung’s Galaxy Watches will be designed with Samsung’s Galaxy ecosystem in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwHPEq"&gt;Like Apple, Samsung is trying to build out an entire suite of associated products and services for its Android phones. It has its own line of headphones, its own system for smart home controls, its own watches, and its own fitness offerings. It even has its own voice-controlled virtual assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgra41"&gt;Samsung’s smartwatches have always worked well with Samsung Galaxy phones, but have been a pain on non-Samsung phones. They’ve required installing multiple apps and plug-ins and came with confusing options for tracking fitness and health. We don’t know yet how closely these watches will be tied to Samsung’s ecosystem, but it could mean that non-Samsung Android users will be put off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhqbgT"&gt;Smartwatches are increasingly defined by their ability to do different kinds of fitness and health tracking. And though I am sure that Samsung will not be shy about putting lots of heath-related sensors into the upcoming Galaxy Watches, Samsung Health is not up to the challenge of competing head-to-head with Apple Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dsmN3"&gt;It gets more complicated with Google’s acquisition of Fitbit. Google has said that it wouldn’t stop using its own health tracking system, Google Fit. That means that these watches could theoretically have three different fitness tracking software options: Samsung, Google, and Fitbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m48vhA"&gt;More consumer choice at the cost of a little confusing software isn’t necessarily a bad tradeoff. Competition is good. But as the new standard bearer for smartwatches for Android, I hope Samsung doesn’t push non-Samsung users too hard into the Galaxy ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9IwmA"&gt;Samsung is so dominant in the world of Android phones that in some regions it can often feel like it’s the only option. For at least the next few months, it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be the only option for Android users looking for a full-featured smartwatch running the latest software. That is a lot of ecosystem power — will Samsung handle it responsibly?&lt;/p&gt;
