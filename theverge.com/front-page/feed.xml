    <title>The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra’s camera bump is no moon; it’s a space station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qof00Ruf3W4wwrDibD6jXJ64w-Q=/0x63:1500x1063/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69044009/mi_11_bump3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a lot.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Xiaomi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7WgYQp"&gt;We were warned. But as is so often the case, our feeble minds couldn’t fully grasp it until it was staring us in the face. We saw the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra’s camera bump in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280166/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-leak-front-screen-display-specs"&gt;pre-announcement unboxing video&lt;/a&gt;, so we knew what was likely in store: an absolutely massive bump with three rear-facing cameras next to a 1-inch screen. But now that the phone has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;officially launched&lt;/a&gt; and we’ve seen it from more angles, we can confirm that it is actually the Death Star of camera bumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vft2dQ"&gt;What’s most striking is the bump’s unapologetic thickness. This isn’t a design that tries to minimize its appearance or meld it into other elements of the phone, a la the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it’s a major contributor to the device’s overall 8.38mm thickness. It’s practically halfway to a &lt;a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/6801580015/sonyt77t700"&gt;2008 Sony Cybershot point-and-shoot&lt;/a&gt; glued to the back of your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C6aIG7Uz4jvVvu2nxcqsWzkqdh4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22405941/mi_11_bump11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Imag&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;e: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Top and bottom views of the Mi 11 Ultra’s camera bump and the phone attached to it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XMnCUP"&gt;The bump’s standout feature — that little 1-inch OLED — no doubt requires a thicker design than your average display-less array. And let’s not forget the cameras themselves, starting with a 50-megapixel wide angle with a very large 1/1.2-inch sensor that’s just a shade smaller than the 1-inch sensor you’ll find in dedicated cameras like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995864/sony-rx100-mark-vii-camera-review-price-specs-features-microphone-jack"&gt;Sony RX100 VII&lt;/a&gt;. That big sensor potentially offers better light-gathering capabilities than a more conventionally sized one, especially considering it’s combined with a relatively fast f/1.95 lens. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RBsULfgwB63DBbs6uwx6B6qq7Vg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406043/xiaomi_bump.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bump is big, but so is the main camera sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Eb8x7l"&gt;There’s also a 48-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide and a 48-megapixel f/4.1 periscope-style 5x optical zoom. That’s not on quite the same level as the S21 Ultra’s four rear-facing cameras (plus an autofocus sensor), but it’s still plenty of hardware to house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEZpE5"&gt;The camera bump is, without question, enormous. But it’s not just big for the sake of being big, though. Its screen and uncommonly large main camera are potentially really useful. Will we ever see a more mainstream device with a camera bump this, for lack of a better term, chonky? Probably not. This 6.8-inch device is probably the best venue to debut these features since users already know they’re getting a big device. The rest of us can just marvel at what an astonishing technological feat it is. Truly more machine than man.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ratchet &amp; Clank is currently free, and it’s getting a PS5 update, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ratchet &amp;amp;amp; Clank" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sBpwe84E2ldP8-J-ehlRitlsz2g=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69043598/RCPS4_3_ari_run.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R4VlBc"&gt;Insomniac Games’ 2016 remake of &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most popular first-party exclusives released during the PS4’s life span. And today, the developer announced that the game will receive &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/1376580160875495427?s=20"&gt;a next-gen optimization patch sometime next month&lt;/a&gt; to take advantage of the PS5’s hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPpuL9"&gt;The new update will allow PS5 owners to run the game at 60 frames per second. If you own a PS4 copy digitally or physically, you will receive the update free of charge. Additionally, the update will be available for users who play &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt; via the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z4TF9y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank (2016) will be playable in 60 FPS on PS5 after a new update in April! As part of the Play at Home campaign, download the game for free now through 3/31. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RatchetPS4?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#RatchetPS4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/Iw6CMNByFU"&gt;https://t.co/Iw6CMNByFU&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/VEFiW3IMWK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VEFiW3IMWK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Insomniac Games (@insomniacgames) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/1376580160875495427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pR7zTq"&gt;The patch comes at an interesting time for the &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt; franchise as the game’s highly anticipated sequel, Rift&lt;em&gt; Apart&lt;/em&gt;, is slated to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278233/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-ps5-release-date"&gt;release as a PS5 exclusive on June 11th&lt;/a&gt;. More importantly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308943/ratchet-and-clank-free-ps4-ps5-playstation-sony-ps-plus"&gt;the 2016 remake is currently free to own&lt;/a&gt; as part of Sony’s “Play at Home” initiative with the offer available until March 31st at 8PM PT / 11PM ET. No PS Plus subscription is required to redeem. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077’s latest patch fixes hundreds of bugs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-WATTvq5GOOYmUC7rB3VVuDdP6M=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69043566/ss_ae4465fa8a44dd330dbeb7992ba196c2f32cabb1.1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0satWL"&gt;CD Projekt Red released an update for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;with hundreds of bug fixes. Patch 1.2, a 34GB or more download depending on platform, is live on PC and consoles, with a Stadia update coming later this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eT92Bf"&gt;Fixes range from quality-of-life improvements to game-crashing bugs, including improvements to vehicles, police forces, NPC behavior, quests, and much more. The &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/37801/patch-1-2-list-of-changes"&gt;full list&lt;/a&gt; is available on the game’s website. CD Projekt Red released its first major patch in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22239765/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-bug-fixes"&gt;January&lt;/a&gt;, an update it said “lays the groundwork” for future fixes. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340232/cyberpunk-2077-1-2-patch-fixes-police-driving-dodging-issues"&gt;latest patch&lt;/a&gt; was delayed after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274035/cd-projekt-hack-source-code-cyberpunk-2077-witcher-3-encrypt-data-ransom"&gt;hackers&lt;/a&gt; accessed the developer’s internal network, forcing the developer to push the release back to late March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v7vmG9"&gt;CD Projekt Red’s work is far from done. The game’s launch late last year has been nothing short of disastrous. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt;’s release included widespread bugs across several platforms. Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;pulled&lt;/a&gt; the game from its online stores in December of last year and began issuing full refunds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toSLHZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suXhvG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is closing its PlayStation Store for PS3 in July and Vita in August</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PS3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QeJXfnsSIHk_S0uo1GG9b7I_h-k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69043509/vpavic_191205_untitled_0018_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qOKmOj"&gt;Sony is officially closing its PlayStation Store for the PlayStation 3 on July 2nd, with the store shuttering for Vita devices on August 27th. &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/important-notice/"&gt;The shutdowns&lt;/a&gt; mean you’ll no longer be able to purchase digital copies of games or DLC for the PS3 and Vita. Sony is also removing the remaining purchase functionality for its PlayStation Portable (PSP) on July 2nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkYrbj"&gt;Thankfully, you’ll still be able to download and play previously purchased games, videos, and media content. The only thing that’s changing, at least for now, is that you won’t be able to purchase PS3, PS Vita, or PSP digital games and videos. In-game purchases will also stop after the stores are closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fPPM4"&gt;You’ll also still be able to purchase cross-buy content following the closures, allowing you to access the PS3 and PS Vita / PSP versions of games that come with cross-buy support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="PS Vita (stock)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gk2Vfz-YHTOJxPm9tbckoz_MOOU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/3080777/PS_Vita_stock.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s PS Vita.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g1Kwoh"&gt;News of the closures originally surfaced last week from &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/ps3-vita-psp-stores-permanently-closed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TheGamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and many had feared the closures would prevent people from downloading games to their devices. That’s clearly not the case, which is good news if you still own a PS3, PSP, or Vita and you want to continue accessing your games. The only thing that’s really changing here is you won’t be able to buy new digital games and content unless the games have cross-buy support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Fb6YO"&gt;Sony’s PS3 originally launched in November 2006, and more than 80 million units of the console were sold in total. The Vita didn’t fare as well, with over 10 million units sold in total, but the PSP was a hit with more than 80 millions sold during its 10-year lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK0LbEtEShHQh97Hs1ENU1d_fQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/bking_200322_3945_0023.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Brennan King / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hDQ0n6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Currently, you can purchase the base iPad with &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-8th-Gen-Wi-Fi-32GB-Space-Gray%2F989344107%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB of storage for $299 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, but only in space gray. Or you can buy it for as low as $320 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J65DST5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (space gray only). If you need more space to store things like apps, you can grab a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5J7BF1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model for $395&lt;/a&gt; in select colors, which is $29 off its usual retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford stops sales of its home charging station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MZthE9ovJdXwmkm7LP1sQ9KTpVk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69042946/sokane_210125_4386_1835.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gjVKwx"&gt;Ford has stopped selling its Level 2 home chargers for the Mustang Mach-E after discovering some weren’t working, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvS250"&gt;The issue, which was &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/sales/ford-halts-sales-its-home-ev-chargers"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has to do with the wall-box chargers registering a fault and stopping charging altogether. Ford says there are no safety concerns, but it decided to stop selling the $800 home charging stations at the end of February until it figures out the problem. Mach-E owners can still charge their electric Mustangs using 120V or 240V outlets at home, or at public charging stations. (Owners who run into any issues can call Ford at &lt;a href="tel:(800)%20392-3673"&gt;(800) 392-3673&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBIfax"&gt;Ford’s 48-amp Level 2 charger (officially called the Ford Connected Charge Station)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is able to put around 28 miles of range back into the Mustang Mach-E battery pack per hour, about eight miles more per hour than you’d get plugging into a 240V outlet. While some automakers that sell electric vehicles sell these chargers (which also require an installation process), there’s a growing list of third-party options. According to the &lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt; report, some dealers are turning to Amazon in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYTeV5"&gt;More than 4,000 Mustang Mach-E SUVs have shipped to customers in North America so far, though the home charger issue is not the first hiccup in Ford’s rollout. Ford delayed shipping some of the earliest deliveries in order to do extra quality checks, and also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316055/ford-mustang-mach-e-recall-loose-bolt-delivery-delays"&gt;recalled a few dozen&lt;/a&gt; that were already out in the world due to loose subframe bolts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrj4A1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Power sports company BRP will make electric watercraft, go-karts, and motorcycles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CdpXG88y7CXd3d9i2BUj_1rn_QY=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69042771/Picture2_rev_3x2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NrEAZz"&gt;Canadian power sports firm BRP announced that it would spend $300 million to electrify its entire lineup of vehicles by 2026. The company, which manufacturers watercraft, snowmobiles, ATVs, and go-karts, will start rolling out its first products in the next two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7m7Wl"&gt;The $13 billion global power sports market is slowly coming around to electric drivetrains, and BRP, which owns popular brands like Ski-Doo snowmobiles, Sea-Doo watercraft, Ryker ATVs, and Rotax go-karts, is trying to position itself at the forefront of the movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TyPrD3"&gt;“We have always said electrification was not a question of ‘if’ but a question of ‘when,’” said José Boisjoli, BRP president and CEO, in a statement. “Today, we’re very excited to unveil more details of our plan to deliver market-shaping products that will enhance the consumer experience by offering new electric options.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xYggzx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have always said electrification was not a question of ‘if’ but a question of ‘when’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="32VIrE"&gt;BRP will use a “modular electric power pack” developed by its sub-brand, Rotax, across its new lineup of electric power sports vehicles. To accommodate the new production commitment, the company will spend some of its $300 million retrofitting Rotax’s assembly facility in Austria, as well as building a brand-new electric vehicle development center in Quebec, where BRP is headquartered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFUMnT"&gt;This won’t be BRP’s first time developing electric vehicles. In 2019, the company acquired Alta Motors, an electric motorcycle manufacturer, and introduced its first EV, the Rotax Sonic e-kart, which is currently in use at the &lt;a href="https://www.rotax.com/en/news/latest/detail/welcome-to-the-rotax-max-dome.html"&gt;Rotax Max Dome in Linz, Austria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ct1dnk"&gt;BRP isn’t the only power sports company racing to develop more electric vehicles. Polaris and Zero Motorcycles are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21473587/polaris-zero-motorcycles-electric-ev-off-road-vehicle-snowmobiles"&gt;partnering to co-develop electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22302725/polaris-electric-ranger-utv-zero-teaser"&gt;ATVs and snowmobiles&lt;/a&gt;. Electric trucking company Nikola Motor has released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18411541/nikola-wave-electric-jet-ski-4k-display-cruise-control"&gt;concept versions of an electric watercraft and an electric off-roader called the NZT&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla has also teased an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20977300/tesla-atv-electric-features-range-price-release-date-announcement-elon-musk-all-terrain"&gt;electric ATV called the Cyberquad&lt;/a&gt;. And Volkswagen has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18250047/vw-electric-dune-buggy-geneva-auto-show-2019"&gt;revealed plans to make an electric dune buggy&lt;/a&gt;, the ID Buggy, which is based on the old Meyers Manx kits from the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I shed a single happy tear for the big boat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Suez Ship Is Refloated in First Step to Clearing Canal" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7w9gmKDZy5OUP5hJYb-nZ-zVm_g=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69042767/1232002859.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="muEcZZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/29/world/suez-canal-stuck-ship"&gt;The boat is unstuck&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ve been following the news, you know exactly the boat and exactly how stuck it was: the Evergreen Marine Corporation’s Ever Given cargo ship has been stuck across the Suez Canal for the last six days, disrupting billions of dollars in global trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxeMS1"&gt;Nevertheless, it’s given people something to laugh about because it seems like a mostly harmless thing; according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, the big boat was blocking $9.6 billion in global shipping traffic a day, but those numbers are abstract enough that many haven’t felt an impact in their daily lives. You might not have been able to get your things on time, but at least you knew why. A big boat was stuck. The other boats had to traverse the historical route around the horn of Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJOEEC"&gt;I am not a nautical man, though, like many other people, I am still in love with the sea. My job is pretty simple: I wake up, and I spend my day writing. (Emails and tweets both count.) I live in New York, a city on the water, but I hardly feel the impacts of living on the fringes of maritime culture unless I’m at one of the parks that overlook the harbors or there’s a disaster, like Hurricane Sandy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjXgFy"&gt;There is an undeniable mystique to water. Even if you don’t believe me, your body does: every vertebrate mammal has what’s known as the mammalian diving reflex, which is a suite of physiological changes that happen to your body when your face is submerged and your nostrils fill with water. Your heart rate slows down, for one, and your body conserves its oxygen. You can’t help it; it just happens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSduIR"&gt;The ocean is vast, powerful, and unknowable. It’s nearly too big to comprehend and perhaps more mysterious than space itself. And yet, we float boats on it anyway. They get where they’re going, mostly, which seems to me a wonderfully human feat. It feels like hubris to deploy a ship like the Ever Given, which is 1,312 feet and 2 inches long, and maybe it is. (The Ever Given was launched in 2018 and wrecked a ferry in Germany a year later, which makes the time between then and the Suez incident the longest it’s gone without something bad happening in its history.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fXMwoK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It feels like hubris to deploy a ship like the Ever Given, which is 1,312 feet and 2 inches long, and maybe it is&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NMP0uu"&gt;The boat is unstuck. I am happy for the people who made it happen because they must be feeling pretty good right now. I’m also happy for the boat because it was built for sailing and being stuck longways in a canal is not traversing the high seas. I’m happy that I got to see a big boat get stuck like a child’s toy across one of the most important trade routes on the planet. The Suez Canal opened for business in 1869, a year before the mammalian diving reflex was described in scientific literature by Paul Bert. (This was the second time; Edmund Goodwyn, the first guy, didn’t get credit for his 1786 discovery.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVa4kH"&gt;The ocean was the first frontier, which is why we call space the final frontier. They’re more similar than they are different: unfathomably big and inimical to human life without some sort of supra-human contraption (a boat). There’s a reason why all of the American space shuttles were named after ships. They’re both ways to get to other worlds. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ns6w5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 3 (non-LTE) review: third time’s the charm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $165 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is $34 off its usual price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F185638711%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; has knocked $30 off this model’s retail price as well, bringing it down to $199. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="0eLZZK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch SE review: pay a lot less to give up only a little","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6p1Qub"&gt;The best deal right now on the Apple Watch SE 40mm with GPS is at Amazon, which has knocked &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5ZRFRG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$20 off its normal price in gold&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $259. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYyAAC"&gt;The 44mm with GPS is also on sale at several retailers. The lowest you can currently get this model for at Amazon is $289 in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XTRZD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. Walmart also has this model on sale for $289 in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt; only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EMA4Er2sFrxHrUuDpHfpSH0b1VM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68898291/bfarsace_201130_4322_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WeXuhD"&gt;When it comes to truly wireless earbuds, there are a ton of brands and products to choose from. Whether you enjoy the unconventional design of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live or prefer Jabra’s compact Elite 75t, there’s a pair of wireless earbuds for just about everyone. Fortunately, many of the best wireless earbuds go on sale on a regular occurrence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsWVXq"&gt;Regardless of which brand you prefer, we have compiled some of the best deals on wireless earbuds right now. Of course, if you want to do more research before making a buying decision, I encourage you to read out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;Best Wireless Earbuds buyer’s guide&lt;/a&gt; to help you determine which pair of earbuds is best for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EnOnUF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The AirPods Pro, the best wireless earbuds for people who use Apple products, pictured next to an iPhone 11 Pro Max and MacBook Pro." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJCYyJb47PApJ-PTdVbfaAx2TaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19336097/cwelch_191031_3763_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c27rNd"&gt;APPLE AIRPODS DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2vr3VH"&gt;If you own an iPhone or multiple Apple products in general, the AirPods Pro are likely the best true wireless earbuds on the market for you. Unlike the base AirPods, the Pro variant has better sound quality and features noise cancellation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMREv"&gt;Apple’s flagship Pro wireless earbuds tend to go on sale frequently, and we often see them drop as low as $200. You can also get a pair for $180 at Best Buy, but they will be &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730154636955201273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Geek Squad Certified Refurbished&lt;/a&gt; instead of brand-new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mydRHm"&gt;Additionally, the AirPods Pro are currently $219 new at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html%2FDFF%2Fd10-v21-t1-x995659%2FSID%2F66960X1514734X399deab46224a444932767312ff6c84b#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPY6Vk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9766m"&gt;Alternatively, you can buy a pair of second-generation AirPods. The entry-level model includes a wired charging case. Usually retailing for $160, you can get them for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/994132/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1003525/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DcXNMK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eJgls2"&gt;For a few dollars more, you can get a new pair of AirPods with a wireless charging case. At their regular price of $200, they aren’t as good of a value, but you’ll rarely find yourself paying the usual price. At the moment, they are $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HGCqrw"&gt;SAMSUNG GALAXY BUDS DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5RLzc"&gt;Samsung has a few different wireless earbuds to choose from, including its latest flagship wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds include active noise cancellation and the best sound quality yet for Samsung earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyxi2K"&gt;There are no current deals available for the Galaxy Buds Pro, but you can buy a pair for the usual retail price of $200 at several retailers, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733771584476830246" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B08MWZHHKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733771635387220077" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1614521-REG%2Fsamsung_sm_r190nzkaxar_galaxy_buds_pro_noise_canceling.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZthMF"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Plus were our top pick last year as the best wireless earbuds overall. A successor to the Galaxy Buds, the Plus model extends the battery life by up to 11 hours and, unlike AirPods, comes in different color options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9qe27"&gt;Right now, you can get a pair for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733693938480222182" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$110 at Samsung’s direct website&lt;/a&gt; in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733693993307410932" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mPBmzD"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Live are some of the more unconventional wireless earbuds on the market right now — but don’t let their bean-shaped design fool you. These are a good option if you want earbuds that produce a powerful sound and include lengthy battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ScDytt"&gt;The lowest price you can buy the Samsung GalaxyBuds Live is $80 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735168432735464332#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt; But, if you want new pair of these bean-shaped earbuds you can get them for $130 ($40 off) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733697059048914646#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, or for $140 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B658NP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735168211035728190#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="u5smDl"&gt;OTHER TRUE WIRELESS EARBUD DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="58GOfq"&gt;Compared to the competition, Jabra’s wireless earbuds have a rare feature that has yet to become standard in the true wireless earbud market: the ability to connect to two devices concurrently. Ideally, this is great for users who switch between two devices often (like, say, a phone and a laptop). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJ5wIC"&gt;Last year, Jabra released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Elite 85t wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are the highest-tier model in Jabra’s lineup. They have more advanced noise cancellation than the 75t. Although no deals are available now, you can buy the Jabra Elite 85t for their normal price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733772512480142500" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LacpUE"&gt;If a $230 price tag is intimidating but you want a pair of Jabra earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative"&gt;Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt; are also a good option, and they see regular price cuts. The Jabra 75t are our pick for the best true wireless earbuds that are ideal for the multitasker in your life. They’re a solid alternative if you don’t want to buy AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9znxnQ"&gt;You can buy a pair in titanium black for only $130 at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733698116592948428" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvElfP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10369683"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqq7gj"&gt;If you are in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for your workouts, you can’t go wrong with the Beats Powerbeats Pro. These earbuds have an over-ear hook that keeps them in place during intense exercises. They’re also IPX4 sweat and water-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about sweat ruining them should your workout get intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aryAiB"&gt;There are a few different discounts available for the Powerbeats Pro. The lowest we currently see is at Best Buy for $160 in either &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733773029374008951" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733773015236913845" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;yellow&lt;/a&gt;. The next best deal is at Newegg, which has pair in &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fbeats-by-dr-dre-my582ll-a-in-ear-black%2Fp%2F0TH-00ZD-00441%3Fitem%3D9SIA9HABR26907%26source%3Dregion%26nm_mc%3Dknc-googlemkp-pc%26cm_mmc%3Dknc-googlemkp-pc-_-pla-pocket-gear-_-headphones%2Band%2Baccessories-_-9SIA9HABR26907%26gclid%3DCj0KCQiAvvKBBhCXARIsACTePW8OhHZqwPA03GNEbu42AL6CLYiIH6kz-qHC7O50PqK6mpD8SVAfawYaAoCREALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;black for $180&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Odu94n"&gt;Amazon has select colors (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B07R5QD598?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B088KTDP6H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pink&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B07WBTX9FH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;navy blue&lt;/a&gt;) on sale for $170.&lt;/p&gt;
