    <title>So you got a 5G phone, but is your plan ready? </title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;5G in the US isn’t mind-bogglingly fast, but it is going to get better | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Your guide to the current state of 5G carrier plans in the US, what they cost, and whether it’s worth upgrading your plan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0STAxL"&gt;You’re the proud owner of a new 5G phone — congratulations! We’ve got some bad news, though: if you live in the US, 5G &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/study-finds-that-us-5g-speeds-are-slower-than-14-other-countries"&gt;probably isn’t going to be the mind-bogglingly fast experience&lt;/a&gt; that you’ve been promised. For most regions, it’s just a little faster than the 4G speeds we’re used to using. But here’s the good news: 5G is going to get better, so if you have a 5G phone you may want to make sure your plan delivers it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUbp57"&gt;If you got a phone recently, there’s a good chance it supports 5G. Pretty much every new phone in 2021 — with the exception of some budget models — will offer some form of 5G support. Whatever your preferred brand or operating system, 5G is coming your way soon if you don’t have it already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1ylmN"&gt;Your phone is ready for the next big thing, but what about your data plan? Across the board, the major US carriers’ unlimited plans already include access to 5G. However, carriers offer a mix of 5G bands that vary in speed and coverage. It’s complicated, as all things 5G have been since it first appeared in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ov9vPM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s complicated, as all things 5G have been since it first appeared in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AeQgSC"&gt;Consider this your guide to the current state of 5G and data plans in the US — which ones include 5G, which don’t, what variety of 5G they include, and whether you should consider upgrading depending on your carrier’s implementation of 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7M860"&gt;One important note for those with a 5G phone: even if you discover that your current plan does include 5G and it’s available in your area, you may still need to upgrade to a new SIM card if you moved it over from an older device. A SIM card that was activated in a 4G device will still work with a 5G device, but you may have trouble connecting to the 5G network. Check with your carrier if you’re not seeing the little 5G logo pop up on your screen and you think you should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6877V"&gt;For comparison purposes, the prices listed in this article are for one line of service per month before taxes and fees. Additional lines bring down the monthly cost per line, but your total bill increases, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5eQLb4"&gt;Verizon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E2ySFp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: Unless you live in one of the few areas with Verizon’s truly fast UW 5G, we don’t think there’s a reason to change your plan just yet. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="yeRjtT"&gt;Verizon offers two varieties of 5G, the faster of which it calls “Ultra Wideband” (also referred to as millimeter wave or mmWave) and is available only in certain parts of certain cities. It’s scarce, but it is mind-bogglingly fast, and you’ll see a 5G UW logo on your phone screen if your phone is using that network. Oh, and 5G UW signals don’t reach indoors for the most part, so if you’re spending most of your time inside your house or apartment right now, you probably wouldn’t pick it up even if you live in a place where it’s available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="vsmFJ8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ultra Wideband is scarce but mind-bogglingly fast&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="AxSy3H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10248231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wnDLVU"&gt;“Nationwide” is the company’s other 5G, a low-band variety that’s slower than mmWave but offers much broader coverage. In fact, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/heres-why-verizon-iphone-users-must-turn-off-5g-right-now"&gt;sometimes a bit slower than 4G&lt;/a&gt;, so if you’re not happy with the 5G speeds you’re getting, you may want to try limiting your phone to LTE and see if things improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wc9Ye8"&gt;Check &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fcoverage-map%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s coverage map&lt;/a&gt; to see what’s available in your area. If you do live in a city with UW 5G, be sure to zoom &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way in to see the exact areas and streets with coverage — they’re marked in a darker shade of red that will appear once you zoom in close enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zt3rAT"&gt;Verizon’s Shared Data (data capped) plans and its $80-per-month basic unlimited plan include the lower-tier Nationwide 5G only. For access to UW in addition to Nationwide 5G, you’ll need at least the $90 “Play More” unlimited plan. Verizon offers $10 off those monthly prices if you enroll in auto pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkrFa3"&gt;Verizon also includes Nationwide 5G on its prepaid data plans, which start at $75 per month for unlimited data or $40 per month for a 5GB data-capped plan. The most expensive unlimited plan also includes UW 5G as of early 2021. There’s a $5 monthly discount for auto pay as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="H6XaJU"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dGY28e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: Don’t worry about switching up your AT&amp;amp;T plan for 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Rje9sa"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s history with 5G is… fraught. Early on, the company marketed what was essentially LTE technology as “5G E” and (rightfully) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277484/att-fake-5g-e-network-lte-study"&gt;caught a lot of flak for it&lt;/a&gt;. You won’t see that term in any of the company’s marketing these days, but AT&amp;amp;T customers still might see a 5G E logo on their phone screen when connected to this service. If you do see it, know that what you’re getting is not really 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;
&lt;aside id="P0HVlL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G really isn’t worth upgrading for yet, but if you’re on any of the company’s unlimited plans, you wouldn’t need to anyway&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="gXk39F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10248430"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C6XNQm"&gt;Outside of that debacle, AT&amp;amp;T has invested in its true 5G offerings, which are structured similarly to Verizon’s: a fast mmWave version called 5G Plus in limited places and slower but more widespread standard 5G coverage. However, 5G Plus may be even more scarce than Verizon’s UW 5G. The company doesn’t provide any coverage maps for it, and it says only that it is deployed in “select innovation zones” in parts of certain cities. Testers for &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/fastest-mobile-networks/2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;’s annual mobile network test&lt;/a&gt; didn’t encounter 5G Plus in cities where AT&amp;amp;T offers it. The carrier’s standard 5G is of the low-band variety similar to Verizon’s Nationwide, and &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; testers also found that it sometimes lagged behind 4G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCcuum"&gt;All of this is to say that AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G really isn’t worth upgrading your plan for yet, but if you’re on any of the company’s unlimited plans, you wouldn’t need to anyway. Both 5G and 5G Plus are included in all postpaid unlimited plans, which start at $75 per month ($65 with auto pay). The Unlimited Plus prepaid plan also includes it at $75 per month ($60 with auto pay). AT&amp;amp;T’s only postpaid 4GB data-capped plan doesn’t include 5G and neither do its other prepaid plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNimDg"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T may have had a somewhat rocky start with 5G, but the technology will improve. And for now at least, the company isn’t charging a premium for its fastest 5G variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5N4Cb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fmaps%2Fwireless-coverage.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T 5G coverage map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZW3lLd"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="z7bVnx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: All of T-Mobile’s postpaid and prepaid plans include 5G. If you’re on the base postpaid unlimited plan and live in a congested area you might find you have more reliable access to 5G by upgrading. But no need if you don’t notice slowdowns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PxCgUp"&gt;Of the three big carriers, T-Mobile might be in the best position to bring truly faster-than-LTE 5G to the most people — but it doesn’t seem to be there quite yet. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s efforts have been concentrated around high and low-band offerings. T-Mobile offers both, too, but it’s also working on converting Sprint’s former midband frequencies to 5G. This might be a sweet spot: not as fast as the mmWave stuff, but genuinely faster than 4G. &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/race-to-5g-5g-limps-to-nationwide-status"&gt;Recent analysis&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; shows the network isn’t delivering on that promise just yet, but T-Mobile promised to extend midband 5G to 100 million people by the end of this year and doesn’t look to be slowing down any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpSW0x"&gt;All of the company’s postpaid plans include 5G, starting with the $65 per month ($60 with autopay) Essentials plan. One caveat: customers on that base-level plan are the first ones subject to slowdowns when the network is congested. T-Mobile also offers 5G on its prepaid plans for both unlimited and data-capped options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="wjFqsx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10248478"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TFa17r"&gt;For now, we think T-Mobile customers can stay put on their current plan. Essentials plan customers who are happy with their network speeds and don’t notice slowdowns probably wouldn’t gain much from upgrading just yet. But it will be interesting to see if T-Mobile can make good on its ambitious promises to bring meaningfully fast 5G to more of its customers in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uA0ipT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcoverage%2Fcoverage-map&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile 5G coverage map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m4L2q7"&gt;US Cellular&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tQnXJX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: All plans (pre- and postpaid) include access to 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJEhwO"&gt;US Cellular 5G is of the low-band variety, so it’s still only a little faster than 4G. But the good news is if you’re on US Cellular, you have access to the company’s 5G: all plans (pre- and postpaid) include it. And if you’re in a rural area, US Cellular is more likely to offer 5G to you now, while major carriers’ coverage is still mostly concentrated around bigger cities. So there’s not much to deliberate here, if you have a 5G phone and your area is covered, you should be able to connect. We just wouldn’t advise anyone to switch to US Cellular only because it offers 5G where they live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xH1tu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uscellular.com%2Fcoverage-map&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US Cellular coverage map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x37LzS"&gt;MVNOs: Cricket, Metro by T-Mobile, etc.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jpsQGR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: If you’re happy with your MVNO plan, don’t switch things up just for 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAFgq4"&gt;Most mobile virtual network operators, or MVNOs, do include 5G on their plans. Cricket’s unlimited plan offers 5G access using AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network ($60 per month for one line). All Mint Mobile plans include access to 5G on T-Mobile’s network, and Metro by T-Mobile prepaid plans come with 5G access, starting with a 10GB plan for $40 / month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rpGfnM"&gt;A significant caveat though: since MVNOs don’t own the networks they use, carrier subscribers are likely to get preferential treatment when there’s congestion. If you’re looking for the best of the best speeds, one of the big three might be the way to go. But again, that reality is still a ways off. Chances are, you wouldn’t be upgrading to a night-and-day experience if you did switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gExXvj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article stated that only T-Mobile’s postpaid plans offer 5G. T-Mobile in fact offers 5G on all of its prepaid and postpaid plans. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgbGhl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 27, 2021: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon has added a new prepaid unlimited plan that includes UW 5G access.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9hcLa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is bringing iCloud Keychain support to Chrome for Windows, but it’s not ready yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image of the iCloud for Windows screen, with the new Passwords option" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s-nIWteYCLVk6VBGmLagEqcjXcU=/0x16:732x504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729981/IMAGE_2021_01_27_11_57_45.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gUsvQp"&gt;Users caught between Apple and Microsoft may now have an easier time managing passwords: it looks like iCloud Keychain is coming to Windows 10 as a Chrome extension (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/27/icloud-windows-chrome-extension-icloud-passwords"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). It’s already in the iCloud for Windows 10 app, but there’s just one small problem: the Chrome Extension isn’t available yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSTGnx"&gt;The latest version of iCloud for Windows 10 includes “Support for iCloud Passwords Chrome Extension” in the list of new features, and when you open the app, there’s a new Passwords-syncing option. Checking the box will cause a login prompt to come up, along with a request for two-factor authentication. According to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201391"&gt;Apple’s support page&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll need to have two-factor turned on for your account to have access to the feature, which is probably a good choice since, in theory, you’re going to be syncing all of your passwords. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gTH8R"&gt;I say “in theory” because after you log in again, you’re prompted to download the iCloud Passwords extension for Chrome. However, the download button just takes you to a 404 page, and searching the Chrome Web Store for the extension doesn’t turn up anything. It seems like Apple may have launched the iCloud for Windows update a little prematurely. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Windows dialog box informing the user that they have to download the iCloud Passwords extension" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BMA4uLh9mA_9pJ19FkITpZYUm2Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22263750/2021_01_27_11_24_39_iCloud.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Google 404 page" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cub8Mt4bQ5UiDkS2QUy4DPaJXyg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22263749/2021_01_27_11_29_56_Error_404__Not_Found___1.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not the extension I was promised.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IVMwWE"&gt;Hopefully the Chrome extension will be available soon, as having access to iCloud Keychain on Windows would make life a lot easier for people who use it on their iPhones, iPads, or Macs. However, if you simply can’t wait, you could always &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/24/15921282/best-password-manager-1password-lastpass-dashlane-how-to"&gt;switch to a dedicated password manager&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, moving all of your passwords would be a pain if you’re already using iCloud Keychain, so you may be better off just waiting a little bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Memes have broken the brokerages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O8-wE0wT01cHBQ0UBkFXvfpBh10=/0x0:4015x2677/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729939/gamestop_stock_sean_hollister.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ezPUBA"&gt;In retrospect, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;stock memes were inevitable&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, it looks like a lot of brokerages weren’t ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qy25dD"&gt;Vanguard, Charles Schwab, and Fidelity Investments, among others, have been experiencing outages, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/outages-continue-to-plague-online-brokerages-11611768827"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. None of the brokerages would tell the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;specifically why the outages were happening. Also, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade are restricting trading around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt;, as individual investors pile into these companies, &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch &lt;/em&gt;reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WjeIQs"&gt;See, GameStop stock rose an astounding 1,600 percent &lt;em&gt;in January alone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/em&gt; points out. What happened is a little complex, but basically boils down to traders gathering on Reddit, Discord, and elsewhere to encourage others to buy call options on the stock. The internet’s exuberance over GameStop has also affected AMC, Bed Bath and Beyond, BlackBerry, Tootsie Roll, and other companies. The trading action has &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/reddit-day-trader-army-fattens-fortunes-of-world-s-super-rich"&gt;further enriched some of the world’s richest people&lt;/a&gt;. It has also &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/yellen-monitoring-gamestop-market-activity-psaki-says"&gt;caught the attention&lt;/a&gt; of Janet Yellen, the US Treasury secretary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHQR2N"&gt;Over the last decade, most of us have seen the power that social networks can bring to bear on politics, for instance, and media. Now, social networks are disrupting finance. The pandemic has more people day trading — 2020 was a record high in the volume of individual trading, Devin Ryan, an analyst with JMP Securities, told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal. &lt;/em&gt;And collectives of retail traders can use platforms such as Discord, Twitch, and Reddit to coordinate their actions in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CpISNX"&gt;Until recently, it was hard to imagine that doing a trade would be as easy as posting to Instagram, but here we are. And what’s more, trading is cheaper than ever — free at many brokerages — reducing further the amount of confidence an investor might need in a stock to buy options on it. Right now, Robinhood, a broker that allows free trades on stocks and options, is the most popular free app in Apple’s App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPrZoD"&gt;The result of this frenzy is what appears to be a massive casino, but investors beware: at a casino, the house always wins.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thursday is the last day to get Samsung’s Galaxy S21 preorder perks</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7rHwLC"&gt;This isn’t new information but more of a PSA that you only have one more day to preorder the Galaxy S21, which will get you a few perks you wouldn’t get otherwise. Every major US carrier and most retailers are accepting preorders for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;S21&lt;/a&gt;, S21 Plus, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;high-end S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; through Thursday, January 28th. No matter where you buy it, you’ll get up to $200 in Samsung credit to pick up a few accessories on its site, along with a complimentary Samsung SmartTag to help keep track of your stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6lCSB"&gt;If you want to dig into the preorder offers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22225628/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-preorder-how-to-price-verizon-tmobile-sprint"&gt;check out my Taylor Lyles’ post&lt;/a&gt; that has everything you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OKAAEo"&gt;Nintendo Switch owners who haven’t had the chance to play through the glorious &lt;em&gt;BioShock &lt;/em&gt;trilogy can do so for a really reasonable price from several retailers. Usually $50 for &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt;, its sequel &lt;em&gt;BioShock 2&lt;/em&gt;, and the series finale &lt;em&gt;BioShock Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, it’s just $20 for the physical version. This is well worth playing, especially since you can take it on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MmYCAf"&gt;This isn’t tech, but&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Sean Hollister (a Nerf connoisseur) thinks the Nerf Rival Artemis XVII-3000 is an excellent blaster, so this deal at Walmart popped out to him. Originally priced at $70, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNerf-Rival-Artemis-XVII-3000-Red%2F271354070&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s just $30 right now on Walmart’s site&lt;/a&gt;. It includes 30 rounds, so you’ll probably need to buy more if you want to do some prolonged target practice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden made climate change a national security priority — what’s next?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An aerial view of a Russian nuclear icebreaker clearing a path in ice to North Pole" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mOMdO_444KsOI4jjRrfj6zVJosk=/0x2:2050x1369/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729722/GettyImages_200138853_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YcPRQF"&gt;President Joe Biden signed a sweeping executive order today that makes climate change a top US national security priority. He commissioned a “National Intelligence Estimate on the security implications of climate change.” He also directed the Department of Defense and other federal agencies to develop plans to adapt to a warming world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AvbBFY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Climate change could be deliberately “weaponized”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7zRppq"&gt;The environmental and geopolitical risks from climate change are quickly evolving. We’ve already seen droughts exacerbate water and food scarcity, which can spark conflict. In the future, climate change could be deliberately “weaponized” in clashes over resources, according to Sherri Goodman, who served as deputy undersecretary of defense for environmental security from 1993 to 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYi1bm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Goodman, who is now a senior fellow at the Wilson Center’s Environmental Change and Security Program and Polar Institute, just before Biden signed the executive order. She paints a picture of what risks might lie ahead and what the executive order might be able to accomplish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khEgYh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="or43W2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You were the first person to call climate change a “threat multiplier,” a term that’s thrown around a lot now when we’re talking about the consequences of climate change. What’s changed since you first coined the term?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9df8vm"&gt;We coined that phrase &lt;a href="https://www.cna.org/cna_files/pdf/National%20Security%20and%20the%20Threat%20of%20Climate%20Change.pdf"&gt;in 2007&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, we were predicting what is now a reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUxxon"&gt;The Arctic has warmed at two to three times the global average, with temperatures as high as &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/charts-warm-siberian-town-hits-100-degrees-n1231787"&gt;100 degrees&lt;/a&gt; in Siberia. We now potentially face a global power competition in the Arctic as sea ice retreats and the Arctic region becomes more navigable. A whole new ocean has opened in our lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmM2JK"&gt;We need to understand how those climate threat multipliers have reshaped the way we see the world and the way you need to act responsibly within it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sherri Goodman, former deputy undersecretary of defense for environmental security, speaks at the 2016 Concordia Summit on September 19th, 2016, in New York City.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hWgysG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What risks do you foresee growing? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4wWns"&gt;The growing risks are that vulnerable populations become more so and that other nations begin to weaponize climate as part of their security strategies. Russia is already, for example, expanding its presence in its part of the Arctic — both for economic opportunities to convert the northern sea route into a toll road for transit from Asia to ports in Europe, as well as building up its military infrastructure. China, for example, envisions a polar “Silk Road,” where it will take advantage of retreating sea ice and being able to transit the Arctic. China has already put in place an ambitious program to increase its Arctic capabilities, particularly in science and research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4Fff5G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Water is becoming more precious and scarce.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AtSJSd"&gt;Agricultural growing areas shift with climate change. In the near to medium term, there are some winners and some losers. You need to understand how that’s going to affect global commodities — particularly food, grain, wheat, and water — as there becomes more competition for resources. We’re constantly thinking about competition for oil, which is not as valuable a resource now as it used to be. Water is becoming more precious and scarce. Wheat production is shifting to the northern region. Russia, for example, is already a major global wheat producer and will likely &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/16/magazine/russia-climate-migration-crisis.html"&gt;become more so in the future&lt;/a&gt;. Will it weaponize its sale of wheat in the global market in the way it did with gas sales to Ukraine some years ago, to use those resource assets as leverage? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHdZ2w"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m glad you mentioned the Arctic. For a lot of Americans, melting sea ice feels so far away. Can you bring home why the Arctic is so important for the US?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfMCU5"&gt;We have to remind ourselves, we are an Arctic Nation. Alaska is part of the United States. We have long been pioneers in the science and research for the Arctic region. Very rapid changes in the Arctic are evidence of changes occurring elsewhere in the planet, but occurring even more rapidly in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbPKOq"&gt;From a geopolitical perspective, nations around the world, particularly Russia and China, could see opportunities to potentially extract the vast energy and mineral resources, which lie below the seabed and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/3/16398518/deep-sea-mining-hydrothermal-vents-japan-precious-metals-rare-species"&gt;could be exploited&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onaexx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you hope Biden’s executive order can accomplish?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rD5Hy9"&gt;The national security implications of climate change need to be clearly recognized throughout our national security and foreign policy, strategy, and plans. That means with respect to China, the Arctic, Russia, Iran, the Middle East, Africa, we need to understand changing environmental conditions. We need to understand how that change should shape our foreign policy and national security strategies, our interactions with allies and partners, and our competition with adversaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lHdIJd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The climate reality has already changed so much just in the last four years.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VGOhHA"&gt;And then, second, the Department of Defense, in particular, can lead by example in moving toward net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. The Department of Defense is one of the nation’s largest energy users. And it’s also subject to all the climate impacts that communities, cities around the country are. It has the same climate resilience challenge in terms of building back better and becoming climate-resilient. Whether it’s by electrifying its vehicle fleet, advancing micro grids and renewables on its bases, shoring up the resilience of its major coastal bases, or better protecting infrastructure from wildfire or permafrost collapse, the Department of Defense can lead by example in how the nation as a whole needs to become resilient to climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYwOd0"&gt;The climate reality has already changed so much just in the last four years. The polar regions are melting. Permafrost is collapsing. Droughts are spreading. Extreme weather is more frequent and more intense. Wildfire season lasts all year. And so, the climate reality demands further action by the security community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykeQ7b"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SqVHOM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter troll faces 10 years in prison for spreading vote-by-text hoax</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h6EILmCVedql9RWp6R2V2WXyQhI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729716/acastro_201106_1777_vote_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9KYWpA"&gt;The United States Department of Justice announced today that it has charged a Twitter user who allegedly spread misinformation during the 2016 presidential election using Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpCMLk"&gt;Douglass Mackey of West Palm Beach, Florida, is accused of conspiring with others to spread election misinformation in 2016, which was designed to deprive individuals of their constitutional right to vote. He has been charged with violating the civil rights conspiracy statute and, if convicted, will face up to 10 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSn0ur"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1360816/download"&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; alleges that between September 2016 and November 2016, Mackey (who used the alias “Ricky Vaughn” on Twitter) spread fake information to his followers, trying to convince voters that it was possible to cast their vote by sending a text message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LZ8v7B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter suspended Mackey’s account several times for violating its terms of service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QwtrJD"&gt;According to the complaint, Mackey was associated with numerous pro-Trump group chats, including one under the name “War Room,” where several individuals shared ideas on how they could influence the 2016 election, according to prosecutors. One such example included an internet “Draft our Daughters meme,” which shared false information implying that if Hillary Clinton was president, she would support making women eligible for the draft. The complaint also details that in September 2016, 4,900 unique telephone numbers texted their votes to a number Mackey promoted on social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lt0OSz"&gt;Twitter suspended Mackey’s account several times for violating its terms of service. But on three separate occasions, Mackey returned with a separate account linked to the Ricky Vaughn alias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQQarK"&gt;Mackey remained anonymous until &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-white-nationalist-troll-ricky-vaughn_n_5ac53167e4b09ef3b2432627"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt; identified&lt;/a&gt; him in a 2018 exposé. Mackey’s alias was ranked among the top 150 influencers of the 2016 election, ranking 107, according to an &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@socialmachines/who-s-influencing-election-2016-8bed68ddecc3"&gt;analysis conducted by MIT’s Media Lab&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s motorized Echo Show 10 will finally be available on February 25th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w9Vcfx9L1DnI8TkfJC4_I2BD_mg=/0x240:5760x4080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729700/Echo_Show_10__Glacier_White__Kitchen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gzQbvt"&gt;Amazon’s new motorized Echo Show 10 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21454117/amazon-new-echo-show-10-alexa-smart-display-moving-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;announced last fall at its annual hardware event&lt;/a&gt; — finally has a release date of February 25th, with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/echo-show-10/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorders starting today for $249.99&lt;/a&gt;. The smart display was originally announced for a late-2020 release date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHM9uk"&gt;Unlike Amazon’s other Echo Show smart displays, the Echo Show 10 has a motorized base that allows the display to swivel around to face you whenever you’re interacting with it. It also uses its rotational abilities (together with digital zooming and panning) to keep users centered in the frame on video calls, even when they’re moving around. Notably, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;supports Zoom&lt;/a&gt; in addition to its own Alexa group calling features, making it a potentially useful tool for videoconferencing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uT2mDE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s new Echo Show 10 moves to look at you","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21454117/amazon-new-echo-show-10-alexa-smart-display-moving-screen-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="HmCbuF"&gt;Similarly, the screen can rotate when playing video from services like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, allowing you to always be able to see your show. The display on the new device can also be manually tilted up and down, although the 10-inch “HD” panel is still largely the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0SL9X"&gt;The Echo Show 10 doesn’t use its camera setup for facial recognition, though. It can tell when someone is talking and face them, but it can’t determine specific people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAlzE0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk’s shot at Amazon flares monthslong fight over billionaires’ orbital real estate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Vt8HzeWiNLkiHnDbmPUXu_uK6A=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729618/VRG_ILLO_4389_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photos by Britta Pedersen-Pool, Elif Ozturk / Anadolu Agency via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9B4Oxc"&gt;The satellite feud between Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Amazon spilled out into the open on social media this week, after brewing for months in meetings with regulators. It’s only the latest spat in a new race among billionaires for a slice of a $1 trillion telecommunications market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PUvuY"&gt;Musk and Bezos, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22163361/elon-musk-billionaire-richest-world-jeff-bezos-tesla-stock-spacex"&gt;the two richest people in the world&lt;/a&gt;, are racing to build vast networks of satellites in low-Earth orbit capable of bringing high-speed broadband internet to rural parts of the world that have little or no access to the internet. SpaceX has 955 satellites in orbit for its Starlink network and plans to launch thousands more, while Amazon’s Kuiper System is in earlier stages of development without any satellites in orbit — yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aqTZj"&gt;The quarrel centers on a filing from last summer, when SpaceX asked Federal Communications Commission officials for approval to change some Starlink satellites to altitudes between 540 and 570 km — close to Amazon’s proposed constellation, which will orbit Earth around a 590 km altitude. SpaceX says the tweak would make it easier to de-orbit old satellites without causing spectrum interference with other satellite operators, but Amazon and other companies beg to differ. They say it would create interference, heighten the risk of satellite collisions, and get in the way of Amazon’s future constellation as approved by the FCC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4N9Frp"&gt;“It does not serve the public to hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation,” Musk tweeted Tuesday, echoing the points made in feisty SpaceX filings posted on Twitter by CNBC reporter Michael Sheetz. In those filings, SpaceX’s director of satellite policy, David Goldman, said “competitors cherry pick data and ignore the true changes in the modification” in order to “reach misleading claims of interference.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It does not serve the public to hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354018055014260738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PXB7DJ"&gt;Responding to Musk’s tweet, Amazon released a statement saying: “The facts are simple. We designed the Kuiper System to avoid interference with Starlink, and now SpaceX wants to change the design of its system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOq3XA"&gt;“Despite what SpaceX posts on Twitter, it is SpaceX’s proposed changes that would hamstring competition among satellite systems,” Amazon said. “It is clearly in SpaceX’s interest to smother competition in the cradle if they can, but it is certainly not in the public’s interest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHD4H8"&gt;The public finger-pointing was an unusual escalation for a kind of industry conflict usually confined to the obscure corners of FCC filing databases. Bezos and Musk’s foray into the world of satellites has generated new excitement — and chaos — for a massive industry filled with incumbents such as SES, Viasat, Intelsat, and others. SpaceX, aiming to invest a total of $10 billion in Starlink, has floated a possibility to investors of splitting the program off into a separate entity sometime in the future and filing an IPO, a prospect that would put Musk’s star power at the helm of another potentially disruptive public company. And despite falling far behind SpaceX, Bezos has pledged to invest $10 billion in Kuiper, cementing its move to compete with both SpaceX and existing satellite internet companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lTwZ3A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you are going to put up and basically claim an entire sphere around the earth, then you’re gonna generate a lot more attention and discussion.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pn8rHi"&gt;“If you are going to put up and basically claim an entire sphere around the earth, then you’re gonna generate a lot more attention and discussion,” said Caleb Henry, a senior analyst at satellite research firm Quilty Analytics. “Because everyone has to know how to operate with respect to that layer of satellites that you put.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwsWKe"&gt;Since its first Starlink launch in 2019, SpaceX has lofted over 1,000 satellites to orbit of the roughly 12,000 needed for continuous global coverage.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That deployment pace has been supercharged by Musk’s breakneck push to offer commercial service and start generating revenue to fund SpaceX’s Mars rocket, Starship. In 2018, when development was moving too slow for Musk’s style, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spacex-starlink-insight/musk-shakes-up-spacex-in-race-to-make-satellite-launch-window-sources-idUSKCN1N50FC"&gt;he grew angry and fired seven Starlink managers&lt;/a&gt;, including the program’s top designer and SpaceX’s VP of satellites. Those two managers now lead Amazon’s Kuiper project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqijz5"&gt;Last year, SpaceX began an invite-only beta program that now has thousands of users across the US, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Its initial price is pegged at $99 a month, plus $499 for a setup kit that includes a pizza-sized dish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oCUw4k"&gt;Amazon’s constellation promises a network of 3,236 low-Earth-orbiting satellites. The online retail giant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178235/amazon-project-kuiper-user-terminal-antenna-internet-satellite-constellation"&gt;last month revealed the design&lt;/a&gt; for a phased array antenna that can provide “maximum throughput of up to 400 Mbps,” but it has been largely quiet on its deployment timeline or which rocket it’ll use to put the satellites in orbit. Nonetheless, Amazon is one of a handful of organizations to push back on SpaceX’s rapid Starlink deployment campaign for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHUtTQ"&gt;Satellite broadband firm Viasat joined Amazon last year in asking the FCC to deny SpaceX’s application to move nearly 3,000 Starlink satellites to a lower orbit, saying the Starlink system poses “an unreasonable threat to the continued use of the shared orbital environment.” The company escalated its request in December, calling on the FCC to conduct an environmental assessment of Starlink. And some are concerned that SpaceX’s rush to build and invest in its constellation could make it harder for the FCC to regulate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HyecJT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I built it, now you can’t change it - good policy is never formed that way.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fKS8Yq"&gt;“I built it, now you can’t change it - good policy is never formed that way,” John Janka, Viasat’s chief officer for global government affairs, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0jGk3"&gt;Since SpaceX began launching its Starlink satellites in batches of 60 atop its Falcon 9 rocket, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21043229/spacex-starlink-satellite-mega-constellation-concerns-astronomy-space-traffic"&gt;astronomy organizations have sounded alarms&lt;/a&gt; over the satellites’ brightness in the night sky: capturing long-exposure telescopic images of the cosmos from Earth are now often tainted by ugly light streaks produced by the bright satellites passing by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gH5iGh"&gt;Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer who tracks Starlink satellites on the side, said the proximity between SpaceX’s proposed altitude and Amazon’s future satellites is slightly concerning, “but the majority of what they’re asking doesn’t seem, to me, to be really interfering with the Amazon ones.” A bigger commercial concern is SpaceX planting its flag in prime orbital real estate, where “it’s high enough that you don’t have to be constantly re-boosting the orbit and using a lot of fuel, and low enough that if things go wrong it’ll reenter naturally” in the Earth’s atmosphere — a key FCC requirement for mitigating debris in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15t5Bg"&gt;“The more SpaceX’s satellites are in that altitude range, the less room there is for other companies to later put stuff there,” McDowell said. “The grabbing-up of all the good territory is a reasonable complaint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJglai"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VR success I Expect You to Die is getting a sequel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="I Expect You To Die 2 logo over a gameplay image" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/knTLm7BqE0l4FJHhb8yV7ecz8h4=/200x0:1280x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729280/I_Expect_You_To_Die_2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YZeJSd"&gt;Schell Games is making a sequel to its massively successful virtual reality game &lt;em&gt;I Expect You to Die&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s expected to come out later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jtKWod"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.schellgames.com/blog/ieytd2-announcement/"&gt;Along with the announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the studio mentioned the original game earned $6 million in revenue across all VR platforms, which could explain how it can afford to make a sequel. It isn’t yet clear which VR platforms the next game will come to, but it &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1499120/I_Expect_You_To_Die_2/"&gt;will at least arrive on Steam&lt;/a&gt;, which indicates support for Vive, Index, and Windows Mixed Reality headsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Urb4EP"&gt;The original was more or less a spy-themed escape room in VR, and the second one looks like it’ll be more of the same, which isn’t necessarily unwelcome in a world where real-life escape rooms aren’t really accessible during a pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TlD7TB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Welcome back, Agents.&lt;br&gt;Ready to get back to work?&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IExpectYouToDie2?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#IExpectYouToDie2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/IYifJ4RzTK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/IYifJ4RzTK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— I Expect You To Die (@ieytd) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ieytd/status/1354462149712736260?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wb5ZfT"&gt;So far, most of the early era VR games people would recognize haven’t gotten follow-ups, and that’s doubly true for ones made by indie studios. While &lt;em&gt;Lone Echo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/lone-echo-2-release-date-further-delayed/"&gt;has a sequel in the works&lt;/a&gt;, the studio behind it &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/facebook-acquires-vr-studio-behind-lone-echo/"&gt;was bought by Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and is now a part of Oculus Studios. Similarly, &lt;em&gt;Job Simulator&lt;/em&gt;’s sequel (&lt;em&gt;Vacation Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, of course), was made after &lt;a href="https://owlchemylabs.com/owlchemy-labs-and-google-join-forces/"&gt;the studio behind it was purchased by Google&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q94OII"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Superhot&lt;/em&gt; was super fun when it came to VR, but its sequel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318812/superhot-mind-control-delete-expansion-free-all-owners-first-game"&gt;doesn’t yet support VR play&lt;/a&gt;. I could go on, making a list of VR games that haven’t gotten sequels like &lt;em&gt;Arizona Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Boneworks&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt; (not that it needs one), but you get the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvokBe"&gt;Hopefully, this sequel announcement speaks to the fact that VR is coming out of a slump. It had a pretty successful 2020, with the release of &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx &lt;/em&gt;and the Oculus Quest 2, but one year of success doesn’t necessarily indicate a trend. As with all things, content is king, and VR will need to keep having killer releases to gain market share. Obviously, it’s not all on&lt;em&gt; I Expect You to Die 2&lt;/em&gt;’s shoulders, but if it can replicate the success of the original, it could indicate that the VR market is getting back on its feet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This a cappella group is scarily good at imitating Windows sound effects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZKrrxnax9c_5nVJOD8wNc2sxxE=/278x0:1634x904/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729240/windows.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZKeTWR"&gt;If you’ve ever used Windows 10 before, I need you to stop what you’re doing and go listen to this a cappella group’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AZB64VBJfA&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;terrifyingly accurate&lt;/a&gt; covers of Windows sound effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqCCBn"&gt;No Windows noises were spared here. The compilation includes the Windows Vista startup theme (remember that?), the recycle bin crunch, the Windows XP shutdown tones, and more. But the two segments that are unbelievably spot-on are the “USB In” and “USB Out” noises, which come about 10 seconds in. If I closed my eyes, you could convince me they were the real deal. Also, the error message straight-up stresses me out. It’s haunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2Dyhn"&gt;But don’t take my word for it — give the video a watch yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Pf9QPI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4AZB64VBJfA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kGuLD3"&gt;The group behind this video is a Korean band called Maytree. They’ve got a number of other cover videos up on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/maytree_music/?hl=en"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, including an excellent rendition of Ariana Grande’s “Positions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHxtjH"&gt;I use Windows 10 every day and experience some of these sound effects constantly — they’ve grown so commonplace that they don’t register when I hear them. When I saw the title of this video, the cynic in me thought “Windows 10 sound effects? Really? Of all the things to cover?” But videos like this are a funny reminder that these operating systems are auditory experiences, too. And there’s a level of intricacy to even the most basic sound effects that’s hugely impressive for a group of human voices to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;
