    <title>How to choose a photo storage service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Photos on the Google Pixel" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gYXwhBgMRaP0gsWNtPB0Z6ePB8k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67778301/google_photos_vlad_savov.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q9HfSI"&gt;Last November, Google — which until now has offered unlimited storage for “high quality” (read: compressed) photos — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;announced that “unlimited” is being changed&lt;/a&gt; to “up to 15GB on your Google account.” In other words, while photo and video storage currently does not count against your total of 15 free gigs on a Google account, it will as of this coming June 1st — along with your Gmail, Google Drive files, and other stored data. Once you hit that 15GB wall, you will have to buy into the Google One service to increase your storage capacity. (Unless you own a Pixel, in which case you still have no limits on “high quality” photos.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTbl7b"&gt;If you’re a Google Photos user who finds all of this a bit irritating, you may be thinking of leaving. But first, it’s a good idea to check out your alternatives. Below are some of the main photo storage services available to you, along with their basic fees, so you can figure out whether you want to switch. (Note: We’ve only included services that are specifically geared toward photos, not more general storage services such as OneDrive or Dropbox.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chKhYl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/"&gt;Google Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vXH35MCZPB-qOWTZMXZFKj3STjc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504078/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.57.42_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Photos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qoZVjQ"&gt;Google provides each of its accounts with 15GB of free storage. However, for the last few years, photos have been treated differently: under its “high quality” plan, Google stored an unlimited number of photos for free as long as you allow them to be compressed to 16 megapixels. (According to Google, photos that size can be printed without issue up to 24 x 16 inches.) Videos were kept to a maximum of 1080p. (Data such as closed captions could be eliminated to save space.) “Original quality” photos — those that were not compressed — were not part of this unlimited plan but were counted as regular files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5YwJy"&gt;However, all of that is changing. As mentioned above, starting on June 1st, 2021, Google will be including photos in its storage calculations. Once you hit that 15GB ceiling, you will have to buy into the &lt;a href="https://one.google.com/about"&gt;Google One service&lt;/a&gt; for additional storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVXGQL"&gt;Google One currently starts at 100GB of storage for $1.99 a month ($19.99 a year) and proceeds to 200GB for $2.99 a month ($29.99 a year) or 2TB for $9.99 a month ($99.99 a year). The 2TB plan also comes with a VPN for Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxaryX"&gt;Before you run to invest in Google One, be aware that there are several mitigating factors Google is offering its users. When the new plan goes into effect, that is when the clock starts; photos you uploaded before then won’t count toward your 15GB limit. Also, if you’re a Pixel owner, then you can continue to upload high-quality photos without affecting your 15GB limit. (Of course, Pixel owners used to get unlimited original quality for free, rather than having to upload their photos in “high quality.” But hey, it’s something.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qTIED4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.icloud.com/photos"&gt;iCloud Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iCloud Photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OhHlPR3hHSzYXLHM4BHWLPypgyw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22045506/Screen_Shot_2020_11_16_at_9.50.00_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iCloud Photos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gIMWLM"&gt;If you’re part of Apple’s ecosystem, then you have easy access to iCloud Photos, Apple’s equivalent to Google Photos. iCloud Photos is connected to the Phone app on your Mac or iOS device as a backup for your photos. You automatically get 5GB of storage space associated with your iCloud account; after that, it costs 99 cents per month for 50GB, $2.99 per month for 200GB, and $9.99 per month for 2TB. (This is for the US; &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238"&gt;other countries have different fees&lt;/a&gt;.) Windows users can also access iCloud Photos via an &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204283"&gt;associated app&lt;/a&gt;; Android users will have to access it using a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yZr3Oh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Flickr page" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rs5L-CTH_oyitP0u2yut9q5965c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13692625/flickr_interface.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flickr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0WoADA"&gt;Flickr has a free plan as well, but it’s limited to 1,000 photos — within certain guidelines: photo files are limited to 200MB and video files to 1GB. For &lt;a href="https://help.flickr.com/pricing-faq-r1qHsTEbU"&gt;unlimited storage without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you pay either $6.99 a month or $59.99 annually (plus tax). Other advantages to a paid annual membership include stats about which of your photos are trending and a variety of discounts from several companies, including Adobe and SmugMug (which is now part of Flickr). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BrJgci"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smugmug.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21561171%2Fphoto-storage-service-google-amazon-flickr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SmugMug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Smugmug" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8w07DX4OmmluqYJWke4hyZfYgMg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22032766/smugmug.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: SmugMug&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SmugMug&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mH6JCv"&gt;Speaking of SmugMug, this long-lasting service is also available, offering storage, portfolios, and sales opportunities for professionals. For $55 a year or $7 a month, you get unlimited uploads and a customizable website. The Power plan ($85 a year or $11 monthly) adds site customization and your own domain name. If you’re looking to be a professional photographer, the Portfolio plan adds e-commerce features for $200 a year or $27 a month (you keep 85 percent of the markup). And finally, the Pro plan lets you create events, price lists, and branded orders, among other features, for $360 a year or $42 a month. If you’re interested in trying it out, you can get a two-week trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m3pftc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://500px.com/"&gt;500px&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="500px" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OvSPHukZyZ_L03o3HavAkQfYvd8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22045546/500px_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: 500px&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;500px&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YKFo5I"&gt;Canadian company 500px is actually more for professional photographers than your average snap-and-save picture taker. It offers pros a place to store, exhibit, and license their work. So if you have ambitions to start peddling your photos, 500px may be worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oJbxb"&gt;The site offers two paid plans. The first, modestly named Awesome, offers unlimited uploads, priority support, no ads, a history of “liked” photos, gallery slideshows, and a profile badge for $59.88 a year or $4.99 monthly. The Pro plan adds a way to display your services and organization tools for $119.88 a year or $9.99 monthly. (You get a discount on your first year: Awesome costs $47.88 a year or $3.99 monthly, while Pro goes for $71.88 a year or $5.99 monthly.) And if you want to make a bit of money, you can submit your photos to be licensed for stock usage through 500px. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67i7IV"&gt;There is a free ad-supported plan that gives you seven uploads a week. When you sign up, you can try out the Pro plan for two weeks before committing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZgbkNT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://app.photobucket.com/explore"&gt;Photobucket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Photobucket" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wRnWvdW4CSwYhI3v_juEr5ai-1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504081/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_10.54.08_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photobucket&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fui9Kk"&gt;Photobucket offers a limited free plan, allowing you to upload up to 250 photos for free — more a trial plan than anything else. If you like what you see, you can start with the Beginner plan at $5.99 per month or $64.68 annually, which gives you 25GB of storage, along with no ads, password-protected album sharing, and an image editor. For $7.99 per month or $86.28 annually, the Intermediate plan provides 250GB of storage and unlimited image hosting. Finally, for $12.99 per month or $140.28 annually, the Expert plan offers unlimited storage and no image compression, among other extras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1bm9gL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.deviantart.com/"&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="DeviantArt" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CgcJg8R-ExLnrm10unHvuB1l4Pc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504090/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_10.57.24_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z7uIFC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.deviantart.com/"&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/a&gt; calls itself “the world’s largest art community” with a social network for visual artists of all kinds. It offers visitors a wide range of artist galleries to view, divided into categories such as traditional, animation, and illustrations. DeviantArt (or DA for short) even has its own publishing platform called Sta.sh — emphasizing the fact that this site, like 500px, is less for simple storage and more for showing (and selling) your art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YBRVT"&gt;With a free membership in DeviantArt, there are no restrictions on how much you upload for public access, and you get admission to DA’s community of artists and art lovers. &lt;a href="https://www.deviantart.com/core-membership/"&gt;Core Members enjoy additional perks&lt;/a&gt;. For $3.95 a month or $39.95 a year, you get to sell your art with no service fee (but a 20 percent fee on Premium Gallery &amp;amp; Premium download sales) and a $100 max price per digital item, along with 20GB of private storage space in Sta.sh. For $7.95 a month or $79.95 a year, you can charge up to $1,000 per item and pay a 12 percent fee on Premium Gallery &amp;amp; Premium download sales, along with 30GB of private storage. Finally, $14.95 a month or $149.95 a year lets you charge up to $10,000 per item, lowers your fee to 10 percent fee per sale, and gets you 50GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iBQOi3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/photos/storage"&gt;Amazon Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon Photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uyGvuT12uD0xtAZPBYAG3hjy6Tw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504092/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_10.58.40_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Photos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FRZOow"&gt;Amazon provides its Prime members with a grab bag of extras along with the free shipping. In addition to the video offerings, music streaming, and other goodies, you get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/photos"&gt;unlimited photo storage&lt;/a&gt; for $119 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FzQzPt"&gt;A nice perk is that you can share that unlimited storage with five friends or family members in what is called the Family Vault. Everything there is accessible to everyone who shares the Vault. “Unlimited,” by the way, does not include videos or other files; for those, Prime members get 5GB of storage, and after that, there is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/photos/storage/plans"&gt;a long list of storage plans&lt;/a&gt; available starting from $1.99 a month for 100GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZJVY1"&gt;That’s something to keep in mind if you drop your Prime membership. In that case, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=201480950"&gt;according to the Amazon instructions&lt;/a&gt;, “the unlimited photo storage benefits associated with the membership end. All uploaded photos count toward your Amazon Drive storage limit.” The total storage for non-Prime members (stills and video) is 5GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nIl4Rl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdegoo.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21561171%2Fphoto-storage-service-google-amazon-flickr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Degoo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X5aXsoUnREQc9faqJoaAteULFM0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530485/Screen_Shot_2021_05_19_at_5.14.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Degoo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bZluEe"&gt;Unlike 500px and DeviantArt, which are tailored more toward professional creators, Degoo is geared toward the everyday photographer who uses images to make memories. In fact, the site touts its AI engine, which it says will “show you the best moments of your life.” To that end, its free ad-based version provides 100GB of storage; you can view or download photos on an unlimited number of devices but only upload from three. You also have to access your account at least every 90 days to keep it active. Paid accounts include Pro ($2.99 / month), which removes the ads and time limit and gives you 500GB of storage, and Ultimate ($9.99 / month), which gives you a whopping 10TB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqq6cZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 12th, 4:55PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to include SmugMug and to explain that it only covers photo-specific services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube pulled its community captions feature, so now more creators are making their own</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration depicting hands holding up captions on a YouTube video." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tYzRXztJ17pcN7j6UVEzL4H7dNQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69322838/acastro_210518_4590_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nEKmjf"&gt;Jack Edwards doesn’t want to be praised for doing what he considers the bare minimum: making his videos accessible to his deaf and hard of hearing viewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7E7gbv"&gt;Edwards began making book and lifestyle videos on YouTube five years ago, but he only started captioning all of his videos in January. “It was one of my goals this year to invest more time into making my channel more accessible for viewers,” he says. “I always think about the quote, ‘It’s a privilege to learn, rather than to experience,’ and that’s true for so many accessibility issues. I don’t rely on subtitles to enjoy YouTube content, so it’s easy to forget that others do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5nOSHr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Captions are up 30 percent year to year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="95Vhnw"&gt;More creators like Edwards have been writing captions for their videos over the past year, providing subtitles so that more viewers can engage with their content without having to hear or understand the audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5vAcn"&gt;It’s a result deaf campaigners considered almost impossible about a year ago, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349401/youtube-community-captions-deaf-creators-accessibility-google"&gt;YouTube nixed community caption contributions&lt;/a&gt;. Most YouTube channels don’t upload captions for their videos, so it fell on subscribers to volunteer high-quality subtitles for fellow viewers to read. Yet, in September, YouTube &lt;a href="https://liamodell.com/2020/09/28/youtube-community-captions-translations-ccs-dontremoveyoutubeccs-creator-insider-deaf-rikki-poynter-amara/"&gt;scrapped the feature&lt;/a&gt; allowing for viewer-submitted captions, citing “low usage” and “abuse.” Creators had to start making captions themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k35M9O"&gt;When the plans were &lt;a href="https://teneightymagazine.com/2020/04/24/youtube-to-review-community-captions-feature/"&gt;first announced&lt;/a&gt; in April 2020, deaf YouTuber Rikki Poynter, a prolific captions campaigner, gave me a very bleak forecast. “Community contributions gave us more captioned channels and now we will risk having less of that.” Half a million people signed &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/google-inc-don-t-remove-community-captions-from-youtube"&gt;an online petition&lt;/a&gt; calling on YouTube to reverse the decision, and thousands of Twitter users got the hashtag &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DontRemoveYoutubeCCs?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#DontRemoveYouTubeCCs&lt;/a&gt; trending in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="hJjZEa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Viewers have encouraged creators to fill the gaps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CK6vJg"&gt;But over the past year, more creators have started adding captions of their own. Compared to August — the month before community captions were deprecated — total user-submitted captions in January were up by more than 20 percent, a YouTube spokesperson told me. Year on year, from January 2020 to January 2021, the increase was by more than 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69y61G"&gt;“We’re delighted that creators are finding our captioning tools helpful for their videos,” the spokesperson said over email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8irPC"&gt;Even though new tools such as a brand-new captions editor and the ability to add captions during the upload process were made available&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in July 2020 and May 2021, respectively, for some, the incentive to start captioning came from somewhere else: their viewers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpz5O9"&gt;“I got a message on Twitter about how YouTube was planning on dropping an important [closed captions] feature a few months ago and that it could mean that there wouldn’t be any for my hard of hearing viewers,” said Kennie J.D., who creates videos on makeup and films for an audience of almost 570,000 people. “I found that horrible, so I’ve been paying for a service called Rev.com that makes captions for my videos after they go up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XHlRPQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If hearing people and the like can enjoy content, why can’t we too?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5PO2Ib"&gt;Poynter suggests that more awareness about the importance of captions is behind the 20 percent increase — that, and the idea that creators have “got no other choice now,” since they can’t rely on viewers to fill the gap. Whatever the reason, she isn’t the only one who benefits from the rise in subtitles. “[It’s] also people with ADHD, auditory processing disorder, or [those] learning whatever the spoken language the video is in. So many groups of people are missing out,” she says. “If hearing people and the like can enjoy content, why can’t we too?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PV72t"&gt;Poor-quality captions don’t help things, either. YouTube does provide automatic captions through speech recognition, but many deaf users consider them inaccurate and unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yp1Get"&gt;So it falls to deaf activists and YouTubers like Poynter to call on others to write their own captions. “I used to send out personal emails to many YouTubers a year asking them to caption their content,” she says. “During VidCon and Playlist Live seasons for a few years, I even personally hand wrote letters and mailed it out to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6L4vmO"&gt;YouTube added the ability to add captions in the “upload flow” earlier this month. In the past, the social media site failed to promote its captioning features well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqpfHJ"&gt;Poynter notes that the reported increase in manual captions is great, but they still need further promotion. For now, it seems, the community is doing YouTube’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWx0wX"&gt;“[Captioning is] something I hope all creators who make content full-time will start to do,” Edwards says. “While it’s really lovely to receive a little ‘thank you’ message as a token of someone’s appreciation, it’s also important to recognize the even more important work being done by deaf or hard of hearing creators on the platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yd7QV1"&gt;Commenting on YouTube’s recent promotion of captions in a tweet on Twitter, Poynter says: “They’re going to need to be more consistent about it. I do like that the uploading process now has a more accessible [way of adding captions]. When people actually see it, they’re a little more likely to want to use it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify finally adds offline music downloads on Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2297IVf1kkpldXGU3yLjdO48spc=/410x0:1511x734/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69322747/Apple_Watch_banner_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wdo8Sp"&gt;Spotify is adding the ability to download playlists, albums, and podcasts on Apple Watch to play offline, the &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-05-21/enjoy-more-ways-than-ever-to-use-spotify-on-your-apple-watch-now-with-downloads/"&gt;company announced Friday&lt;/a&gt;. Users will be able to stream audio in 96kbps, add and delete Spotify content on their phones, and sync with the Watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o43TIr"&gt;“Being able to download music and podcasts complements the existing feature of being able to stream your favorites from the watch, and now you don’t even have to take your phone with you,” the company said in its news release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OHlogg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"&gt;Your browser does not support HTML5 video.&lt;source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pr-newsroom-wp/1/2021/05/Apple-Watch-2021-Landscape.mp4?_=1" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OpEGi5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549483/spotify-apple-watch-streaming-music-rolling-out"&gt;Spotify added the ability to stream&lt;/a&gt; music using an Apple Watch in November; until that point, the Apple Watch only worked as a remote for Spotify music playing on an iPhone or other Spotify Connect-compatible device. Spotify first launched its Apple Watch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18063838/spotify-apple-watch-download-features"&gt;app in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JaQy18"&gt;The offline feature will be available starting Friday on Apple Watch Series 3 or later running WatchOS 6.0 or later, with WatchOS 7.1 and up recommended. A Spotify Premium subscription is also required. &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/"&gt;Spotify Premium memberships&lt;/a&gt; range from $9.99 per month for a single account, up to $15.99 per month for a family plan. There’s also a $4.99-per-month student account option available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6etuX"&gt;Another streaming music service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443522/deezer-apple-watch-offline-listening"&gt;Deezer, beat Spotify to the punch&lt;/a&gt;, adding the ability to download music from its Apple Watch app earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQfU4g"&gt;Also this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442880/spotify-youtube-music-download-offline-playlists-podcasts-updates"&gt;Spotify said it was launching a new feature&lt;/a&gt; to allow Google’s Wear devices to download music and listen offline, without needing an accompanying phone. It hasn’t been released yet, but it’s in the works, the company’s product lead for wearables said &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/D_mVOAXcrtc?t=2515"&gt;during Google’s developer keynote&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple TV Siri Remote review: pushing all the right buttons</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;If you’ve got an Apple TV, it’s a must-have upgrade&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="L7aLVB"&gt;It’s so, so, so much better. But the moment Apple showed off the second-generation Siri Remote, it was obvious that this would be a huge improvement over its detested predecessor. It’s easy to tell which way is right side up when you reach for it. The clickable touchpad area that dominated the upper third of the prior remote has been replaced by a more intuitive D-pad. The Siri button has been pushed to the remote’s right side, almost guaranteeing that you’ll never unintentionally trigger Apple’s voice assistant. And now there’s a proper power button for your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFcXYL"&gt;Listing all of these “upgrades” on the new $59 Siri Remote really illustrates just how disappointing the old one that somehow lasted six years on the market was. Before this big redesign, the most Apple did in that time was to try to cure the “which side is up?” confusion by adding a white rim around one of the buttons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442395/at-the-epic-trial-phil-schiller-got-away-clean"&gt;“Can’t innovate anymore, my ass.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XFTwoI"&gt;But this? This new Siri Remote is a very good remote. There’s nothing exceptional about it, but it’s functional, accessible, and painless to use. If you used those words to describe the original Siri Remote, you’d be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22394083/siri-remote-apple-tv-goodbye"&gt;in the minority&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="domTV5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10511307"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OCQTI2"&gt;It feels really nice, too. Apple makes the remote from a unibody aluminum shell that’s taller, heavier, and considerably thicker than the old Siri clicker. It’s slightly narrower than the black remote but still feels larger on the whole — and that’s a positive. The previous Siri remote was so thin that it was easily lost to the deepest reaches of the couch. I don’t see that being as much of a problem with the new, chunkier hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J20Dix"&gt;The Siri Remote is in keeping with Apple’s renewed fondness for hard edges. With the remote gripped in hand, you never really feel the edges on the front, but you do at the back. The back metal is curved, but there’s still a hard edge at both sides. As long as you don’t squeeze the remote too tight, it should prove reasonably comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GEEcVIBgXK-1bw4weScVml5NO6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529635/DSCF3939.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has added power and mute buttons to the new Siri Remote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1xda5D"&gt;Instead of putting what basically amounted to a trackpad on the top section of the remote, Apple has switched to a much more traditional directional pad. Within that circular D-pad is a touch-sensitive center button that still lets you swipe around content or move in any direction just like you could before. (And yes, you can still play with the subtle movement of app icons on the home screen by gently nudging your thumb around.) But some streaming apps didn’t work perfectly with that input method, so Apple is now including the far more precise D-pad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttHtGW"&gt;This choose-your-preferred-navigation method — Apple calls it the “clickpad with touch surface” — has a very short learning curve. Initially, I would inadvertently activate the touchpad when I just meant to move my finger from down to up or vice versa on the D-pad. That didn’t last long, but if it winds up a bigger hassle for you, there’s an option in the remote’s settings menu to assign the center button to “click only,” which gives the D-pad all navigation duties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sa8uyQ"&gt;Apple has also come up with a clever jogwheel function that lets you circle a finger around the outer ring to scrub through videos at faster or slower speeds depending on how quickly you’re thumbing around the circle. It’s a direct callback to the days of the iPod clickwheel and does a great job helping you land on an &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; moment in a video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HGfqfNUpkQIqqzKnv6M2f13zTSo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529636/DSCF3948_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new clickpad is infinitely better than the prior touchpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aa0he1F9Qr__5W97w2f4nWIT680=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529710/DSCF3949.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Siri button is now on the side, where you’re less likely to press it accidentally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="12zYjz"&gt;But I must confess something: I had an embarrassing few hours where I couldn’t figure out how to make this work. Eventually, I learned the trick: after pausing a video, you’ve got to rest your finger on the D-pad momentarily before you start circling around it. An animation will pop up in the progress bar (with a little dot that indicates where your finger is) to let you know you’re in jogwheel mode. If you just pause the video and immediately start the circular movement, it doesn’t do the right thing. Don’t be like me and unnecessarily factory reset your Apple TV 4K because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xct7Jj"&gt;The buttons themselves all have a satisfying click and don’t feel the least bit mushy. The clickpad is quieter when pressed than the buttons below it, which are each significantly noisier than any other remotes I had to compare against, be it for a Roku, Chromecast, or otherwise. Again, it’s not a problem unless you’re sensitive to that sort of thing, but you’ll absolutely hear the volume rocker when you’re turning up a certain scene in a movie or show. The Siri button on the side is whisper quiet; you still have to press and hold it down whenever you’re doing a voice command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hM0hLg"&gt;You might also have to overcome some muscle memory challenges since the mute button is now where play / pause was situated on the old remote. The “menu” button has been rebadged as “back” but does the same functions as before, which means, in most cases, the new icon makes a ton more sense. The buttons aren’t backlit, but it’s easy enough to memorize them by feel once you’ve used the remote for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CBdcQqhgCwpu8-dCcM6PyV6lQFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529631/DSCF3906_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a circular D-pad with a touchpad in the center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EVCHZA"&gt;But as good as the new Siri Remote is, it feels like Apple missed some opportunities that frankly seem like low-hanging fruit. The most glaring is that there’s no way to locate the remote if you’re unable to find it. As I said earlier, the bigger dimensions should make for fewer instances where the remote gets misplaced, but &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; way of having it alert you to its location would’ve been nice. “Hey Siri, where’s my remote?” seems like such an easy thing to make happen, but that voice query won’t do you any good or make the remote beep. And unlike Apple’s recently introduced AirTags, there’s no ultra-wideband chip in the remote to help pinpoint its position in a room. If you’re finding that the remote goes MIA constantly, you might just have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/5/10/22429238/apple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design"&gt;settle for a case&lt;/a&gt; that combines an AirTag with the Siri Remote. But having a simple, straightforward remote locator feature is one area where Roku objectively beats out Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWIcIl"&gt;A less impactful gripe is the lack of an input button for switching between HDMI sources; the Apple TV automatically becomes the active input when you power it on or wake it from sleep. But an input button would’ve at least made life easier for people switching between an Apple TV and an Xbox or PlayStation. As a result, I just can’t quit my LG TV’s remote, much as I wish I could. Most of my devices automatically grab the TV’s attention when they’re switched on, but a button is foolproof. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bflUJ0BqVtj70FwQYOsJ7UUuB2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529634/DSCF3938.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Siri Remote is substantially thicker than the previous one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/91i2a-8hNAVdxgdT5m38ROEYGso=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529633/DSCF3923.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hopefully it won’t go swimming in couch cushions as often.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="13pTzo"&gt;I can complain about buttons being absent, but I can also praise Apple for the same reason: there are no branded shortcut buttons whatsoever on the Siri Remote. Not even Netflix can lock down its own button, whereas you’d be hard-pressed to find another streaming box remote without that logo somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="EcTqGE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10511751"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="88lBKt"&gt;The Siri Remote still charges with Apple’s Lightning connector — despite now being thick enough to house a USB-C jack. USB seems more natural for this type of scenario, but what do I know? I’m just one man who’s elated to have a reliable, sensibly designed remote control again. Apple is going to keep doing Apple things. I was not able to test the new remote with third-party charging stands designed for the old one, but I wouldn’t be surprised if that industry catches up with the new design in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AvEaeLXu1kCNhxDZlwfv3vN_huE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529638/DSCF3951.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The right choice is clear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="y4avp2"&gt;The gyroscope and accelerometer from the previous Siri Remote are history, so you won’t be able to use this one for Apple Arcade games that rely on those sensors. But it’s unlikely many people were gaming with it to begin with; tvOS now supports many third-party gamepads, including the latest Xbox and PlayStation controllers, if you hadn’t heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="4IiJSM"&gt;Any way you slice it, the new Siri Remote is a win on every level. It’s inconceivable that we put up with the last one for so many years, but its time has come. And the remote control taking its place is extremely good at doing remote control things. Much as how Apple’s M1 MacBooks would have earned perfect scores if they’d had competent webcams, the Siri Remote would be flirting with perfection if it just had some way of letting you easily find the thing. Or if the buttons were backlit. My review of the new Apple TV 4K is coming soon, but if you’ve already got the last model, this is the only real must-have upgrade to go for. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mass Effect’s legendary Normandy starship is coming to No Man’s Sky, if you snag it soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-uBsQ1qSeyp17RKH4yaM_hAI59c=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69322382/image__118_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Normandy in &lt;/em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SIUs8G"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt; players who are fans of the beloved sci-fi series &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; will soon be in for a treat: &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect’s &lt;/em&gt;legendary SSV Normandy SR-1 starship will be appearing in &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPV2Ge"&gt;The Normandy’s arrival is the culmination of an alternate reality game that’s taken place inside &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt; over the past few days. If you want to add the Normandy to your frigate fleet (&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/no-mans-sky-next-guide/2018/8/1/17640984/freighters-freighters"&gt;a group of ships you dispatch on missions&lt;/a&gt;), you have until May 31st to participate in the expedition (an event where players share an adventure on the same planet) that lets you acquire it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6D6Tj9mlURTqMJgB5gii0KOPX3g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529440/image__117_.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Another screenshot of the Normandy in &lt;/em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IbuehR"&gt;The crossover arrives just a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22256806/mass-effect-legendary-edition-pc-ps4-xbox-one-mac-walters-release-date"&gt;the release of &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; a new remaster of the popular series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwa0bo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt; is coming up on its five-year anniversary this August, and developer Hello Games is continuing to support the title with big new updates. Those shared expeditions, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22358926/no-mans-sky-expeditions-update-hello-games"&gt;were added in March&lt;/a&gt;, while an update in February added the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22285801/no-mans-sky-companions-pets-update-hello-games"&gt;let you adopt wild animals as pets&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This is Microsoft’s vision for the future of meetings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wuMoRt7sCJWEtoiBlXCe-8jNOBE=/199x0:2296x1398/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69322362/MRiCWV1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="If5IWC"&gt;Microsoft is outlining its vision for the future of meetings today. After a year that’s seen more people dialing into the office remotely, the company is once again banging the drum for hybrid work: a model that combines remote access with in-person work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5A6iG9"&gt;While the company has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344273/microsoft-redmond-headquarters-open-hybrid-workplace"&gt;teasing new concepts for Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt; in recent months, it’s now starting to bring to life an updated interface for the communications software that will help blend remote colleagues into physical meeting rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msrtw7"&gt;A new video details Microsoft’s plans, which include larger screens that help facilitate face-to-face meetings with life-sized remote colleagues. Microsoft imagines meeting rooms where cameras are placed at eye level to improve eye contact, and spatial audio that will help you hear colleagues’ voices when they’re dialed in. This spatial audio will also supposedly make it feel like a remote colleague is more present in a room.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qEnmFrQLvkPntyIV2lB2llajMB4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530228/MRiCWV1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new Microsoft Teams interface for remote meetings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C3BEFk"&gt;This meeting room of the future looks like it’ll require a lot of hardware, though. Customers will need new intelligent video cameras that can detect who’s talking and bring them into view, speakers capable of spatial audio, and even microphones embedded into the ceilings. Microsoft itself might deliver some of this hardware: the company started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308962/microsoft-intelligent-speaker-teams-translation-transcription-features"&gt;selling Intelligent Speakers for Teams&lt;/a&gt; recently, which will help bring this future meeting room scenario to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zThvb3"&gt;This meeting room of the future is all part of a broader push by Microsoft to get ready for what it sees as a hybrid approach to work, where more employees will be working remotely or dipping in and out of the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fGh8n6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Hybrid work represents the biggest shift to how we work in our generation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oSZooz"&gt;“Hybrid work represents the biggest shift to how we work in our generation,” says Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in a &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hybrid-work-paradox-satya-nadella/?trackingId=qSsWl2a1RnCj0dHpJqE19A%3D%3D"&gt;LinkedIn post&lt;/a&gt; outlining the company’s approach. “And it will require a new operating model, spanning people, places, and processes.” Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fresilience%2Fhybrid-work-solutions%3Frtc%3D1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;releasing a playbook&lt;/a&gt; for businesses looking to adopt a hybrid model, with data and research it has conducted during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIjkZz"&gt;Microsoft has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344273/microsoft-redmond-headquarters-open-hybrid-workplace"&gt;gradually opening up its campus&lt;/a&gt; in Redmond, Washington in recent months, and remote meetings have become a big focus point. “In fact, at Microsoft, meeting recordings are the fastest-growing content type,” reveals Nadella. “Employees now expect all meeting information — whether that’s recordings, transcripts, or highlights — to be available on demand, and on double speed, at a time that works for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OlAC-QR4lEinxusoq7NOhQmhBBE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530231/teamscameras.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s meeting rooms of the future will require more hardware.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YR8Igc"&gt;The push toward hybrid work also opens up security challenges for organizations. Microsoft is embracing this new era by removing its own employees from corporate networks and taking an internet-first approach instead. That means ditching the old era of corporate domains and intranets you need VPNs for and having all data in the cloud. Of course, Microsoft also happens to own Azure, so that makes it both easier for the company to switch and an incentive to promote its cloud business. For other businesses, it’s not always an easy task to embrace the cloud fully. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FU53uL"&gt;Microsoft is also asking its own employees who work from home to “run a test of their home networks to ensure they are secure,” and requiring that every mobile device that accesses corporate information is managed. We’ve seen a variety of ransomware attacks and increases in phishing attempts during the pandemic, and Microsoft says the threats keep on increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBCwd5"&gt;“The threat landscape has never been more complex or challenging, and security has never been more critical,” explains Nadella. “We intercepted and thwarted a record 30 billion email threats last year and are currently tracking 40-plus active nation-state actors and over 140 threat groups.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap is buying its AR display supplier for more than $500 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A man wearing Snap’s fourth-gen Spectacles, which are black with angular frames." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VzkLCCcAuWWfTki68amH_4NQpTY=/169x0:1789x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69322370/Spectacles_DonAllenIII_Portrait.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snap’s fourth-generation Spectacles. | Photo: Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gmQQPe"&gt;Snap has agreed to acquire WaveOptics, the supplier of the augmented reality displays that power its new Spectacles glasses, for more than $500 million, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has learned. The deal is Snap’s largest ever, underscoring the company’s long-term bet that AR eyewear will eventually go mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxMIUg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://enhancedworld.com/"&gt;WaveOptics&lt;/a&gt; primarily makes waveguides, a display technology that allows for the overlaying of virtual objects onto the real world through a transparent surface like glass, and accompanying light projectors. Snap is using WaveOptics displays in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445481/snap-spectacles-ar-augmented-reality-announced"&gt;new Spectacles announced this week&lt;/a&gt;, which it isn’t selling widely but is giving to a small number of AR effect creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fwD31z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Snap’s new Spectacles let you see the world in augmented reality","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445481/snap-spectacles-ar-augmented-reality-announced"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ofeabf"&gt;Based in the UK and founded in 2014, WaveOptics raised a total of $65 million in funding to date, according to the financial data firm PitchBook. The roughly 125-person team will now report to the director of Snap’s hardware division, Steen Strand. Snap is paying for half of the deal in stock now, and in two years it can decide to pay for the other half in either cash or stock. A Snap spokesperson confirmed the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYQkuN"&gt;For Snap, the purchase scoops up the maker of a key component for AR glasses in a nascent but quickly growing industry. Snap’s spokesperson said that WaveOptics will continue to supply other companies with its waveguides and work with Snap on custom optical systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="DHcV35"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Buying WaveOptics is partly a defensive move&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kyBjxG"&gt;Even still, buying WaveOptics is partly a defensive move by Snap. Many of its larger tech rivals are working on their own waveguide technology as they plan to debut AR glasses. Google, which first broke into the space with Google Glass in 2013, recently posted a slew of listings for a new team dedicated to building waveguides. Apple bought the holographic waveguide-maker Akonia in 2018 and is planning to announce an AR headset as soon as next year. And Facebook has said that it’s building custom waveguides for future AR glasses, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes will one day “redefine our relationship with technology.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A first-person look through Spectacles showing an area in the center augmented with glowing plants and a butterfly landed on the wearer’s palm." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pgb9p7VLX1EGdD0eTN36lp_UY2g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530319/spectacles_fov.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Snap&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;AR effects seen through the new Snap Spectacles.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MUAjSK"&gt;WaveOptics, meanwhile, has signaled that it wants to make AR displays tailored for mass adoption. In February 2020, the company announced what it claimed was the thinnest color waveguide available. And a few months ago, it debuted a waveguide that supports prescriptions in partnership with Luxexcel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4d48K"&gt;The newest Snap Spectacles with WaveOptics tech feature a 26.3-degree field of view, which is smaller than more bulky AR headsets like Microsoft’s Hololens. Snap’s glasses are designed to display its AR effects, called Lenses, brightly both indoors and outdoors. The tradeoff is that the battery only lasts 30 minutes. The glasses also weigh 134 grams, far more than a normal pair of glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HevvN"&gt;So even though Snap is spending a lot of money on WaveOptics now, it’s likely going to be a long time before the tech is ready and affordable enough for most people. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel thinks that it will take roughly a decade before AR glasses become compelling enough for mass adoption like mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pzGtGl"&gt;The colorful, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;2021 iMac&lt;/a&gt; might become the desktop of choice for most people, however, when it comes to flexibility, few products rival the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;2020 Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;. It’s fast and functional, and right now, you can pick up the base configuration at &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/mac-mini-%E2%80%93-apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%2C-8-core-gpu-%E2%80%93-8gb-memory-%E2%80%93-256gb-ssd-%E2%80%93--silver.product.100694159.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; (membership required) or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $600, its lowest price yet. The discounted, 8GB model is built upon Apple’s eight-core M1 chip and includes 256GB of storage and Wi-Fi 6. It’s also remarkably quiet, though, it lacks a wide selection of ports and doesn’t support external GPUs, a notable downgrade from previous Mac models. Still, the drawbacks don’t render the M1 iMac any less of a deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3sEVbw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9712859"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ELPt60"&gt;Netflix remains the undisputed king of streaming with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394425/netflix-subscriber-growth-stalls-2021"&gt;more than 208 million subscr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320332/disney-plus-100-million-subscribers-marvel-star-wars-wandavision"&gt;ibers&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s one of many streaming platforms in existence. While lesser known, AMC Plus offers a bevy of terrific programming, including hits like &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Rectify&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt;, among others. And if you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber, you can now land &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/storefront/ref=dvm_us_eg_cs_othr_pr_pmdmoda?contentType=merch&amp;amp;contentId=deals&amp;amp;merchId=deals&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two months of AMC Plus for $1&lt;/a&gt; through May 23rd, a $17 discount. In addition to highlights from AMC’s catalog, you’ll have access to a selection of binge-worthy content from Sundance Now, IFC Films Unlimited, and Shudder, a horror-centric streaming service built specifically for scares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nlf4Je"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10510778" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z06wpv"&gt;Quality gaming monitors aren’t exactly a dime a dozen. The Asus’ TUF Gaming VG27WQ1B monitor offers an excellent set of specs for the price, however, especially when you consider &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=VergeDeals052121&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fblack-asus-tuf-gaming-vg27wq1b-27%2Fp%2FN82E16824281084" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg is currently offering an additional $50 off&lt;/a&gt; the initial list price. The curved, 27-inch panel features a 165Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and support for FreeSync Premium, not to mention two HDMI ports and a DisplayPort. The 1440p monitor also supports HDR10, a technology that makes for better contrast, more accurate colors, and higher brightness across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xJcGDq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10511043"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5knqXj"&gt;If you missed the chance to get Sony’s flagship WH-1000XM4 noise-canceling headphones for just $260 yesterday, fret not, as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F284230046954%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeWH1000XM4Ebay052021%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F21%2F22446118%2Fmac-mini-m1-amc-plus-streaming-service-asus-gaming-monitor-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay retailer Pro-Distributing&lt;/a&gt; still has the black color option in stock. Regularly $350, the 1000XM4 offer excellent noise cancellation, long battery life, and the ability to pair to more than one device at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FJr5mt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="vVS3Wm"&gt;The Google Pixel 3XL is getting up there in age and will no longer receive updates past October 2021, but if you’re looking for a large Android phone with an excellent camera, Woot has the &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=VergeDeals&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fgoogle-pixel-3xl-64gb-unlocked-clearly-white%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_cdet_elec_dly_wobtn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white model with 64GB of storage for just $215&lt;/a&gt;. This version is unlocked and should work with all major US carriers. Woot also notes that the bootloader on these models is unlocked, so if you’re looking for a cheap way to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442051/android-12-beta-download-google-io-2021"&gt;try out the new Android 12 beta&lt;/a&gt;, this is an easy way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this feature on the 2011 RSA hack that redefined cybersecurity  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PU_GFd2Vi5cvHPxQTieB7rfvLXI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69322037/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TXB54V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; has published an &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-full-story-of-the-stunning-rsa-hack-can-finally-be-told/"&gt;in-depth feature&lt;/a&gt; on the 2011 hack of security company RSA, in which hackers stole the so-called “crown jewels of cybersecurity,” the secret keys forming a “crucial ingredient” of its SecurID two-factor authentication devices. It would go on to “redefine the cybersecurity landscape” with huge implications for not just RSA, but also the organizations that relied on its devices for their own security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOuQp1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired’s &lt;/em&gt;Andy Greenberg describes the moment RSA analyst Todd Leetham discovered that hackers had accessed one of RSA’s most important pieces of data: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Ub4M2X"&gt;With a growing sense of dread, Leetham had finally traced the intruders’ footprints to their final targets: the secret keys known as “seeds,” a collection of numbers that represented a foundational layer of the security promises RSA made to its customers, including tens of millions of users in government and military agencies, defense contractors, banks, and countless corporations around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="waPpYJ"&gt;One of the most interesting sections of the report describes how the hack affected the psychology of RSA’s employees, making them intensely paranoid. The company switched phone networks, started holding meetings in person, and shared documents on paper. The building was swept for bugs, and some office windows were covered in paper to prevent surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="L5eH5G"&gt;Paranoia was beginning to take hold in the company. The first night after the announcement, [RSA’s head of North American sales] remembers walking by a wiring closet and seeing an absurd number of people walking out of it, far more than he imagined could have ever fit. “Who are those people?” he asked another nearby executive. “That’s the government,” the executive responded vaguely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JsmTcw"&gt;The RSA hack was not only blamed for a subsequent hack of “at least one” US defense contractor, but it opened much of the world’s eyes to the danger of supply chain attacks. Rather than attacking a target directly, a supply chain attack sees hackers infiltrating one of their target’s suppliers to get behind their defenses, like what we saw with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188060/microsoft-president-solarwinds-orion-hack-breach-brad-smith"&gt;last year’s SolarWinds hack&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="2L393A"&gt;After 10 years of rampant state-sponsored hacking and supply chain hijacks, the RSA breach can now be seen as the herald of our current era of digital insecurity—and a lesson about how a determined adversary can undermine the things we trust most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Philips Hue Wall Switch Module review: smart-ish, at last</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make any wall switch Hue-smart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="hSUqCE"&gt;You’ve undoubtedly run across taped light switches like the one pictured above if you’ve ever spent time in Airbnbs. Hell, maybe you have some of these in your own smart home. No judgement, we’ve all been there, which is why I just installed a Philips Hue Wall Switch Module in my own house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QO1dfW"&gt;Many smart home fans can trace their obsession back to the very first Hue lightbulbs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/29/3570322/philips-hue-led-customizable-bulb-apple-store-home-automation"&gt;launched back in 2012&lt;/a&gt; as an Apple Store exclusive. But Hue bulbs, like all smart bulbs, come with a few catches. First, they require a constant source of power to function. That means you’ll lose control over that fancy Hue bulb hanging above your kitchen table just as soon as someone flicks off the light switch. To solve this, many people disable the switch mechanism with tape or a dummy wall plate, only to realize that physical controls are useful when you or your housemates and guests can’t be bothered to yell a command or pull out a phone. So they buy a Hue remote control and tape it to the wall. This comedy of errors is then repeated over and over until they have a house full of mismatched wall switches and legitimate concerns about life priorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaGxVn"&gt;There’s a small cottage industry of aftermarket solutions for this, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18629735/lutron-aurora-dimmer-hue-lights-smart-price-specs-features"&gt;Lutron’s Aurora dimmer&lt;/a&gt; that sits on top of a light switch. But Philips has never addressed it directly, until now. The new $39.95 Hue Wall Switch Module solves these issues by making most existing wall switches Hue-smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tv5c2x"&gt;Note that I said &lt;em&gt;Hue-smart&lt;/em&gt;, not smart. That’s because the switch you rewire to the Hue Module can only control Hue lightbulbs, not regular inexpensive lights like other smart switches. Nevertheless, it caters to fans of both smart lights and smart switches by offering the benefits of both, so long as they can stomach the cost and ecosystem lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9KXlhr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10511587"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SixME4"&gt;The Wall Switch Module from Signify-owned Philips Hue is a much simpler device than it first appears. Basically, it’s a buttonless Zigbee remote control for Hue lights. You add buttons by wiring the Hue Module to a standard household light switch. The switch + Hue Module works as a Hue remote control whether tucked inside the wall or not since the Hue Module is powered by a single CR2450 coin battery (included). That allows you to make sure the Hue Module and switch are working properly with your Hue setup before connecting everything back to the wall. It also means that you’ll have to have to disassemble everything at some point in the future to replace the battery, but not for at least five years, according to Philips Hue. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ia7kqkI8HsJvLwtWuxr8s7TIkBo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530165/Hue_switch_test.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The battery-powered Hue module can be tested before installing it inside the wall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ssEW2e"&gt;I was able to install a Philips Wall Hue Switch Module behind the existing switch in my laundry room in about fifteen minutes. The steps were quite simple, but you’ll need enough empty space in the wiring box behind the switch to accommodate the 4.3 x 1.0 x 3.8 cm (0.51 x 0.39 x 1.5 inch) Hue Switch Module. You should also be comfortable working with household electricity — if not then find someone who is or call an electrician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kDAehj8XlCiz5ZpZdrVi-oInppQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530170/verge_IMG_7358_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything included with the Hue Wall Switch Module. It might look complicated but it’s not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eqbt5x3w1q7_ziGEQhTg6FB4ktE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530198/verge_IMG_7214__1__2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hue Switch Module wired to my wall switch and the old household wires rerouted into the orange wire connector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lvyeSK"&gt;Installation is straightforward with the help of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GC41Ws8c5Y"&gt;videos tutorials supplied by Philips Hue&lt;/a&gt;. After shutting off the power at my circuit breaker, I removed the switch assembly from the wall. I then disconnected the two electrical wires connected to my rocker switch and rerouted them into a tiny Hue-supplied wire connector to close the circuit and ensure my lightbulb socket is never without power. I then plugged a Hue-provided wire-pair into the Hue Module and back to the light switch at the same locations where the two household wires were removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9TSDz"&gt;The Hue Switch Module is added to the Hue app and Hue Bridge (required) like any Hue light or accessory. After assigning the Module to control the Hue bulb in my laundry room, all that was left was to tuck the Hue Switch Module into the wall box and remount the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRJQdb"&gt;The Hue Module can be assigned to control multiple Hue lights in a Hue-defined room or zone, or just one Hue bulb in my case. The switch can be set to function as a simple on/off, or to cycle through predefined Hue scenes assigned to one, two, or three presses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x7Vm4uZlmHgeMmkg00qlCj8ocPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530188/Hue_app_scenese.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hue app allows button presses to be assigned scenes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6JU0SY"&gt;Scenes didn’t work too well on my rocker switch since a “press” is only registered after both an on / off motion, meaning I’d have to toggle the switch up, down, up, down, up to toggle the scene assigned to the third press. And since my laundry room doesn’t require mood lighting anyway I went with the simple on / off toggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rL0nFe"&gt;The Philips Hue Wall Switch Module solves the issue of someone flipping the light switch and rendering the smart bulb useless. Although it does occasionally miss a beat causing the switch to reverse orientation. Over the weeks I’ve had it installed, I noticed that flipping the switch up turns the light on some days and off on others. That means the module failed to trigger the light somewhere along the way despite it being installed smack in the middle of my relatively small house which is blanketed in a strong Zigbee signal created by ten other Hue lights and plug-in accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l3r9NN"&gt;To test the failure rate I flipped the switch on and off 100 times with a one-second gap in between. The light failed to respond appropriately five times, translating to a failure rate of 5 percent. It’s not a big deal unless you’re a stickler in such matters. I for one, believe that when a switch is in the up position the light should always be on, just as toilet paper should be unrolled toward the user and bathmats are for drying wet feet. These things are not negotiable in my house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5MLPk"&gt;The Hue app also can’t be configured so that the Wall Switch Module automatically turns off a light after a set time period. That would be ideal for my laundry room, which is really a closet that’s only used a few minutes at a time to load and unload laundry. As such, after a few weeks I ended up adding a motion sensor from Aqara to the room to automatically turn off the light when motion is no longer detected. (You can also stick to the Hue ecosystem and use a more capable $39.99 Hue motion sensor instead.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkoiJQ"&gt;Other notables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jg82Gv"&gt;The module has two inputs allowing it to control two single switches or one unit with a double rocker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="b44jTP"&gt;The module also works with push-button switches which have the advantage of making lights dimmable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8UhgcC"&gt;The module turns the lights on and off smoothly, not suddenly with a flash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="G5bGoj"&gt;So, now I have a $14.99 Hue bulb, $39.95 Hue Wall Switch Module, and $15 motion sensor to replace the 99 cent LED bulb I was using previously. That’s a total cost of $70 to automate a simple task and save a bit of energy all because I failed to teach my kids how to turn off a $1 light bulb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8cKU6x"&gt;Was it worth it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vB69uA"&gt;That depends. If you’re like me, and you can afford to be irrationally excited about smart lighting and actually enjoy the hours spent configuring open-source tools like HomeBridge to run on a Raspberry Pi, then yes, it’s worth it. For everyone else it’s a bit complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4ecm6"&gt;The Philips Hue Wall Switch Module has the power to unite two opposing camps of home automators who, unsurprisingly, have serious religion when it comes to the primacy of smart bulbs vs. smart switches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSUwK7"&gt;Smart bulb zealots tout the control they have over the color and dimming options of their lights. Hue bulbs, for example, are compatible with Apple’s adaptive lighting feature allowing Hue lights to be automatically adjusted for cooler colors during the day and warmer colors at night. That’s nice, but there’s still that issue with switches killing the power. Smart switch zealots, meanwhile, enjoy an endless selection of inexpensive decorative faceplates and switch types to choose from, along with cheap standard bulbs. But they’re limited to toggling the power or dimming the light, not changing its color or discretely controlling different bulbs on the same circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DFUSuY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Hue Module is a bridge between smart lighting and smart switches, with benefits of both&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D0WmYr"&gt;The Hue Module neatly bridges these two worlds, offering the benefits of both. The downsides are some increased complexity for smart bulb zealots (who often end up buying physical remotes anyway) and increased cost for smart switch zealots. It’s a particularly attractive option for anyone that can afford to be heavily invested in the Philips Hue ecosystem of high-quality feature-rich devices that work across every major smart home platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ErsAP"&gt;The Hue Module is not for you if you’re looking to make regular cheap light bulbs smart. For that, there are a plethora of alternatives. I have a bunch of Z-Wave switches and dimmers from Duewi installed, for example, but several Zigbee solutions are also available that sit behind your existing switches just like the Hue Module. Aqara, for example, makes inexpensive (and sometimes hard to find) in-wall switch modules (&lt;a href="https://www.aqara.com/en/single_switch_T1_with-neutral.html"&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.aqara.com/en/single_switch_T1_no-neutral.html"&gt;without&lt;/a&gt; neutral) that make existing switches smart, but are powered from the mains and work with any standard light, unlike the Hue Module. You could even step things up with &lt;a href="https://www.lutron.com/en-US/Products/Pages/StandAloneControls/Dimmers-Switches/DimmersSwitches.aspx"&gt;Lutron&lt;/a&gt;’s excellent switch and dimmer replacements if you can afford them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="x9qv0Y"&gt;If you’re already invested in Hue, or want to be, then the Philips Hue Wall Switch Module does two things well. It neatly solves the issue of unresponsive bulbs connected to wall switches that has long plagued Hue smart lights, while letting you reap the benefits of both smart lights and smart switches. The Philips Hue Wall Switch Module is available now in Europe for €39.95 / £34.99 and arrives in the US in late June for $39.95.&lt;/p&gt;
