  &lt;p id="mlkkez"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 25th, 2021 12:36PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Walmart plans to restock both the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; today. You can find additional information &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22065347"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZoKH5"&gt;The Xbox Series S and Series X consoles are officially out. Due to the pandemic, combined with the high demand for these consoles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551484/best-buy-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-store-sales-holiday-2020"&gt;retailers like Best Buy and Target are only selling online&lt;/a&gt;. That means you won’t be able to walk into a store to pick one up — unless you’ve purchased it already online. Only then will you be able to arrange an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5s3rFB"&gt;Until we hear updates on stock replenishing from retailers, I recommend keeping it locked to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H75RTZ8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;amp;tag=verge-evergreen-20&amp;amp;linkId=e8ef14f64e0e9e1dacba6db0add8b578&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fxbox-series-x-video-games%2F-%2FN-fd2hh&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpromotions%2Fgaming%2F20-1310%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, and (if you have memberships) &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-brand-showcase.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fprod24980179&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723309405282483811" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy encourages shoppers to visit its site&lt;/a&gt; to order instead of showing up at its stores. It doesn’t have set time slots for when it expects stock to be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVxesu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="hLH7PZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ejjLHa"&gt;If you’re trying to decide between the Xbox Series S or Series X, my colleague Tom Warren recently reviewed both consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cqFv0O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="hCC7LP"&gt;Buy with the Xbox All Access plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="tnxiJL"&gt;As an alternative to paying full price upfront for each console, you can pay a monthly installment for either of them through the Xbox All Access plan. It’s a financing option that lets you get the console upfront at no cost. You’ll be billed one monthly payment for the console and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate together ($24.99 per month for the Series S, $34.99 per month for the Series X) for 24 months.

    <title>Go read this piece about why you may be seeing a lot of city pop in your feeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sEBc92t4S2C8ZiRp2o3EiOe9Vvg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68874655/acastro_181016_1777_music_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FnDtch"&gt;City pop is a genre defined by nostalgia. Though, as Cat Zhang writes, that nostalgia is algorithmically generated — and its recent popularity is wrapped in the acceleration of global exchange and a whole Western mythology of Japan as the capitalist future. Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/article/the-endless-life-cycle-of-japanese-city-pop/"&gt;Zhang published an elegant capsule history of the genre in &lt;em&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which also explains why the music is surging in popularity in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyZ6Dk"&gt;Naturally, it started in Japan. “The upswing of city pop likely originates with the &lt;a href="https://www.electronicbeats.net/city-pop-guide-japans-overlooked-80s-disco-10-tracks/"&gt;Japanese themselves&lt;/a&gt;: a few decades ago, domestic crate diggers started critically reevaluating vintage Japanese music, or &lt;a href="https://wamono.bandcamp.com/"&gt;wamono&lt;/a&gt;,” Zhang writes. Then, some decades later, it hit Western ears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nyaVSZ"&gt;“Japanese music isn’t particularly accessible overseas: The country has been exceptionally &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-music/change-of-tune-japan-music-fans-moving-from-cds-to-streaming-services-idUSKBN27Q0GB"&gt;slow to embrace&lt;/a&gt; streaming, prioritizing the consumption of CDs, and its expansion into foreign music markets has also been sluggish,” Zhang writes. “One recent breakthrough was the compilation &lt;a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-pacific-breeze-japanese-city-pop-aor-and-boogie-1976-1986/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pacific Breeze: Japanese City Pop, AOR &amp;amp; Boogie 1976–1986&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; released in 2019 by the reissue label Light in the Attic as part of their &lt;a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/1357715-Japan-Archival-Series"&gt;Japan archival series&lt;/a&gt;. The project, which now &lt;a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-pacific-breeze-2-japanese-city-pop-aor-and-boogie-1972-1986/"&gt;has a sequel&lt;/a&gt;, took four years to bring to fruition.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blysxH"&gt;The other part of city pop’s sudden American popularity has to do with the recommendation algorithms that drive our social platforms. City pop thrives on YouTube because its algorithm can’t recognize nuance. “[T]he algorithm will simply route listeners from “lo-fi beats” videos to “Plastic Love,’” Zhang writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgYErw"&gt;The whole piece is fascinating. As the writer Kyle Chayka wrote &lt;a href="https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-80s-japan-footage-city-pop-nostalgia"&gt;today in his newsletter DIRT&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="4fxsqO"&gt;[N]one of these artifacts are completely authentic, and none the result of a single gaze, self or other. The stitched-together footage and the remixed, re-uploaded music are the kind of fictions that culture is always producing, the present digesting the past in order to produce something hybrid and new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WRDMnb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart will have the Xbox Series X available at 3PM ET today</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="njkeDE"&gt;If you missed Target’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22295791/xbox-series-x-s-restock-gamestop"&gt;early morning&lt;/a&gt; Xbox Series X restocks today, you have another chance today to secure Microsoft’s next-gen console. A Walmart spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the retailer will have the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; available for purchase today, February 25th, at 3PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfM933"&gt;Walmart told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; you will have two options to pay for the console — with a one-time payment of $499.99 or pay with Xbox All Access, which requires a monthly payment for 24 months. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935894/microsoft-xbox-all-access-bundle-offer-project-scarlett-upgrade-deal"&gt;Xbox All Access is a bundle&lt;/a&gt; that splits the cost of an Xbox console; Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes both versions of the video game streaming service; access to xCloud; and Xbox Live Gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AfBWYF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ASjwVc"&gt;If you are buying either an Xbox Series X or S, there are a few additional items outside of video games you may want to consider purchasing, such as an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF248LD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;additional controller&lt;/a&gt;. And unlike the PS5, you can purchase a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB SSD expansion&lt;/a&gt; to add to the Xbox’s base storage (512GB on the Series S, 1TB on the X), though it is not cheap. Alternatively, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Game-Drive-Xbox-Special/dp/B072LX7WLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an external hard drive to store your games&lt;/a&gt;, but any games stored through it will not take advantage of the next-gen hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zhFeF"&gt;If you are having trouble deciding on what games to buy, you can always buy a subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you access to a slew of digital games and access to Xbox Live Gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D0rS31"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Oculus reapproved Virtual Desktop’s native PC streaming feature for Quest headsets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XCwbXu74Po34TDt5ZwdNK8NLWUE=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68874465/hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fYVrti"&gt;The Virtual Desktop app for the Oculus Quest has been updated to enable the wireless streaming of PC VR games natively over Wi-Fi, eliminating the need to go through the complex multistep sideloading process &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218827/oculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to"&gt;I outlined here&lt;/a&gt;. Oddly enough, this isn’t the first time the app has sported this feature. Its developer introduced it in the app in 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"&gt;but claims it was forced to remove it&lt;/a&gt; because Oculus was developing its own wireless streaming solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYU8iG"&gt;According to an interview with &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/pc-streaming-quest-virtual-desktop"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Guy Godin, the app’s developer, submitted the feature recently to Oculus’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262794/oculus-update-app-lab-vr-early-access-sideloading"&gt;App Lab&lt;/a&gt;, which is a newly launched fork of the Oculus Store for early access games and experiences. But interestingly, Oculus approved the feature for the app in the main store instead, and you can grab the update right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRltuT"&gt;Godin shared to &lt;em&gt;UploadVR &lt;/em&gt;that more than 90 percent of Virtual Desktop users have gone  through the complicated setup process to enable wireless streaming. But with this new update, it’ll be far easier for new users to stream titles they own on PC like &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Boneworks&lt;/em&gt;, and more without a significant amount of hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxEER5"&gt;You can pick up the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2017050365004772%2F%3Flocale%3Den_US&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F25%2F22301151%2Foculus-store-virtual-desktop-native-pc-vr-game-streaming-quest-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Virtual Desktop app made for Quest &lt;/a&gt;for $19.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WrJdDI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook it turning VR into a platform — but some indie developers fear its power","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Spotify will let you filter your liked songs by mood and genre</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DoGcvbJk3ByvYAtwpB7e1bMO8KQ=/0x0:1734x1156/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68874385/spotifyfilters.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jmwhRb"&gt;Spotify’s making it easier to parse your liked songs. The company is &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-02-25/how-to-sort-your-favorite-songs-with-spotifys-new-genre-and-mood-filters/"&gt;rolling out a new feature today&lt;/a&gt; that’ll let users filter their liked songs by genre and mood. This way, you can enjoy more of what you like without compromising on the vibe. I, for example, have songs that would be fun in the club but also folky songs for relaxation time, both of which are under my liked songs umbrella. This new feature would let me decide what mood I’m in and then listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RElnO"&gt;To access the filters, you have to have at least 30 liked songs. You can then go to your library, tap into liked songs, and select a filter that’s listed across the top. You can remove that filter whenever you like and swap in a new one. These filters will change as you like new songs, Spotify says. For now, they will only be rolling out to English-speaking markets, including the US, Canada, and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1TB0I"&gt;Spotify has made it no secret that it wants to be the app for every kind of audio need, including music and podcasts. Although this feature is small, it’s the kind of update that makes a product more useful for everyday use and could keep people coming back to the app to like songs, which is what Spotify wants. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mailchimp employees have complained about inequality for years — is anyone listening? </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Behind the claims of sexism and racism at Atlanta’s premier tech startup&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="TB4pqv"&gt;Alejandra Luaces had only worked at Mailchimp for four months when she got a surprising anonymous email. “Oliver* is in an open marriage and is fair game,” the message read, referring to a senior engineering manager. “Serena* also knows so you can ask her to confirm.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPwMB4"&gt;Luaces was not interested in Oliver. She certainly wasn’t interested in asking a female employee about his marriage. As a product operations manager — and one of the few Latinx women in the engineering org — Luaces was determined to succeed at one of the most prestigious tech companies in Atlanta, according to sources close to the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTB4R7"&gt;The events were confirmed by three former employees as well as internal documents reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oYBSA"&gt;In June 2016, one month after the anonymous email, Luaces and Oliver went to a diversity conference together in New York City. Luaces’ department was going through a reorg, and she was interested in a position on his team. Oliver seemed open to it, even suggesting that he’d speak to the engineering director on her behalf. But he also became increasingly flirtatious, allegedly sending Luaces late-night texts hinting that he wanted to have sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nxwKav"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The level of toxic masculinity and sexism was unlike anything I experienced in 10+ years in the tech industry”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Iq1pHn"&gt;After they returned to Atlanta, Oliver sent her a message saying he’d thought they were going to hook up on the trip. Luaces responded that she didn’t think it was a good idea. Shortly after, the offer to move to his team seemingly evaporated. Luaces’ role was being eliminated in the reorg, and she was told she could either take a lower-level position or leave the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePdFvC"&gt;In the offer letter for the new role, Mailchimp managers told Luaces that she would not be eligible for a pay raise for “at least the next year, and maybe a few years.” The letter also said that while Luaces was a hard worker, “the perception is that you will fill your time with non-work related activities if your task list is not full.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s been noted that you’re a hard worker when you have ample tasks assigned to you, but the perception is that you will fill your time with non-work related activities if your task list is not full. You will need to manage your own workload (with the help of your team lead and manager) and also put a real effort into being seen as a contributor who works hard at their job." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PHfvc4_kNbrrjuxyxitoVLW0D54=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328067/offer_letter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Offer letter Mailchimp sent to Alejandra Luaces for an internal transfer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hLWkjj"&gt;Luaces’ experience at Mailchimp is now roughly three years old. If her complaint was an isolated incident, there probably wouldn’t be a story. But according to 11 current and former employees, Mailchimp has continued to struggle with instances of sexism, bias, and perceived pay disparities since Luaces left in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPFtAe"&gt;Employees say the company’s position as one of the premier startups in Atlanta allows it to view workers as disposable, as there are fewer tech jobs to choose from than if the company were located in San Francisco or New York City. They also say that because the organization is private and has never taken on outside investment, executives can operate without the specter of more public accountability. Many feel they’ve exhausted every option internally and are only speaking to the press as a last resort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ut6MFk"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Mailchimp spokesperson said: “We’ve always wanted Mailchimp to be a place where everyone feels included, respected, and empowered to do their best work. But that hasn’t been the experience for all of our employees. Over the past four years we’ve doubled in size, and while we worked hard to foster an inclusive culture as we grew, we fell short in some important areas.” The company declined to comment on&lt;em&gt; The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;questions about individual personnel matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKKPtR"&gt;Stories about Mailchimp’s company culture began circulating on February 17th, 2021, after a principal engineer, Kelly Ellis, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/justkelly_ok/status/1362158917862625280"&gt;posted a viral tweet thread&lt;/a&gt; about her decision to leave. She said she’d dealt with “sexism and bullying” and was underpaid compared to male colleagues. (Ellis did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zMDnUH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Welp, I guess it's official: I'm leaving my job. I dealt with sexism and bullying, and found out that I, as the only female principal eng, was paid less than the other (male) principals outside of Atlanta. I would not recommend friends work at Mailchimp, especially women.&lt;/p&gt;— Kelly Ellis (@justkelly_ok) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/justkelly_ok/status/1362158917862625280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dtDIB6"&gt;Mailchimp told employees that it had investigated Ellis’ claims and found them to be unsubstantiated. But CEO Ben Chestnut also said that he knew the company needed to do better. “I’m hearing loud and clear that we have work to do, including needing greater transparency around pay equity and an intentional focus on inclusion,” he wrote in a letter to staffers, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mailchimp-ceo-ben-chestnut-email-pay-equity-discrimination-kelly-ellis-2021-2"&gt;which was first reported in &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “I want to address these issues head-on, and I know we’ll be stronger for it. I’m asking our leadership team to prioritize these issues and work with me to fix them. What we do needs to match what we say.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOWakR"&gt;Group chats and Slack groups filled with former Mailchimp employees were set ablaze by the news. Workers began discussing their own experiences with alleged discrimination and unequal pay, wondering whether what they viewed as the open secret of Mailchimp’s company culture would finally be brought into the open. “They’re going to have to acknowledge the problems that are being raised, and respond with something other than, ‘we have investigated ourselves and found we did nothing wrong,’” one said in an alumni Slack. “I wish more people would speak out but I wont for the same reasons (NDA, fear of retaliation),” another responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJlERx"&gt;Mariesa Dale, a design manager who joined the company in 2018, left after a year due to what she says was a misogynistic culture. “The level of toxic masculinity and sexism was unlike anything I experienced in 10+ years in the tech industry,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lbsP5q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Working at Mailchimp is a status symbol — particularly in Atlanta&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H8ued2"&gt;Dale remembers that once, a manager shushed her when she responded to a question she’d been asked directly during a meeting with him and another male colleague. He then asked her male counterpart to answer the question. She says that when she went to HR to tell them about the behavior, nothing seemed to change. “Leadership at Mailchimp clearly knows about this and doesn’t do anything about it,” she says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eutYgx"&gt;In response to this allegation, Mailchimp said no formal HR complaints have been filed against the manager in question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4nnde"&gt;A female leader who left the company in 2019 said she was repeatedly given what she viewed as gendered feedback and promised promotions that never materialized. Once, when she pushed back on a comment her manager made in a review, he said, “Don’t contradict me in front of the kids,” referring to her direct reports. He also would tell her to “be more professional” when she disagreed with him in meetings. The woman says she reported these experiences to HR, but nothing changed. Eventually, she found out she was making roughly $100,000 less than a male colleague just one level above her who did comparable work, and she decided to quit. She asked to remain anonymous due to fear of retaliation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yfFr8"&gt;A different form of alleged pay disparity is also felt on the support team. According to an employee who recently left, the department is one of the most diverse factions of the company — but it’s also one of the lowest paid. One senior staffer said they made just $48,000 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="txNWCC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He needs to be subtler when it comes to voicing his opinion about his compensation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ck8agv"&gt;Employees also say it’s difficult to move out of these positions. While most corporate employees work out of the glitzy Ponce City Market — a mixed-use space filled with shops and restaurants — the support team works in an old building two and a half miles away, making it difficult to forge connections with other teams. “The support team was treated like the custodians,” a former staffer says. “Everyone loves and respects the custodian. They’re a friendly face when you walk in the door. But no one has any interest in promoting the custodian.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXBdbX"&gt;“It feels like you’re the lowest rung on the ladder,” a current employee adds. “When you see people of color, women, LGBTQ people in this department it feels really shitty. We’re hidden away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sU4Xam"&gt;In response to this assertion, a Mailchimp spokesperson said: “In our view, career progression isn’t about moving out of the Customer department, but growing within it.” Mailchimp also said other departments of the company have more gender diversity than customer service, but it did not comment specifically on racial or LGBTQ diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qr6YjO"&gt;Still, working at Mailchimp is a status symbol — particularly in Atlanta. For many employees in the support department, it’s their first corporate job, and some say they are drawn in by the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine and the Herman Miller chairs. When the pandemic hit and people started working from home, those superficial perks evaporated. “When all those things were taken away I realized I didn’t like this job that much,” the former worker says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F86s9s"&gt;Given their disparate environment, not all members of the support team were sympathetic to Kelly Ellis’ complaints. After she posted a photo of an expensive Lego set on Twitter, one wrote “can you imagine the cognitive dissonance it takes to spend ~48 hours being upset over pay and then tweeting about an $800 Lego set...while people who make 1/3rd of your pay clean up some mess you made?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DeyvDm"&gt;The story about a white woman getting outsized attention for discrimination in the tech industry isn’t new. In August 2020, Françoise Brougher, former COO of Pinterest, sued the company for gender discrimination, eventually getting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175043/pinterest-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement-coo-francoise-brougher"&gt;a $22.5 million settlement&lt;/a&gt;. She brought her complaints after &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/03/pinterest-race-bias-black-employees/"&gt;two Black women on the policy team&lt;/a&gt; — Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks — spoke out about discrimination at the company. Ozoma and Banks received less than a year’s severance when they left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bSjdyx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some would greet him by saying “what’s up gangster” and joke that he was stealing computers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dz2LPq"&gt;For Angelo Ragin, however, Ellis’ experience was validating. He’d voiced some of the same concerns in 2014 when he’d advocated for a pay raise and was told he was being entitled. His concerns about pay, while old, are echoed by current Mailchimp staffers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VdCp3S"&gt;Ragin was the first Black employee at Mailchimp. He started on the tech support team in 2009 before moving to the IT department. The role fit Ragin’s background: he’d previously worked on the Geek Squad at Best Buy and was an expert in Apple software and products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCGCjB"&gt;One of the key metrics on the IT team was how many tickets agents solved. Mailchimp employees would write in with technical issues, and it was up to the team to resolve them as quickly as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPtHGP"&gt;Ragin says he was often in the top two agents in regard to tickets solved — a claim backed up by ticket count statistics from 2015. He says he was the guy Mailchimp’s founders, Ben Chestnut and Dan Kurzius, would go to when they had technical concerns. So when he found out he was making 14 percent less than his white colleagues, Ragin was shocked. He asked to be bumped up to their level, which the company did, bringing his total compensation to $68,400 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6m0A23"&gt;Still, Ragin felt like the work he was doing warranted more. “I was the go-to guy,” he says. “I would walk in the office and be going 100 percent all day. My goal was to change the perception of IT, because people needed to trust in the IT department so they feel fully equipped and educated about what kind of stuff they have in front of them.” He wanted to make $80,000 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3Ua37"&gt;In his review in 2014, his manager said that the company had already bumped him up 14 percent, and “with bonuses, company-paid health insurance and other perks the total compensation package easily puts Angelo well on the way, if not already in excess of, his $80K/year long term goal.” He refused to further increase Ragin’s pay. Ragin was then chided for advocating for himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Management definitely recognizes his efforts and successes but these can be overshadowed when he displays what some might perceive as a sense of entitlement. He needs to be subtler when it comes to voicing his opinion about his compensation. It’s great that he’s confident but some people might misread his self-confidence as arrogance or a sense of entitlement.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aKlg9cd6Dz0UaYBSEOVhKRHi5V0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328070/management.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feedback Angelo Ragin got from a manager in 2014.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJl8i7"&gt;Another manager wrote in the review: “Management definitely recognizes his efforts and successes but these can be overshadowed when he displays what some might perceive as a sense of entitlement. He needs to be subtler when it comes to voicing his opinion about his compensation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkxFUv"&gt;The following year, Mailchimp recorded $280 million in revenue, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/technology/mailchimp-and-the-un-silicon-valley-way-to-make-it-as-a-start-up.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzbjZ5"&gt;Earlier on in his tenure, Ragin had taken a week off due to a difficult situation in his family. When he returned to the office, he says he was called out for not responding to tickets while he was away. “That crushed me,” he says. “I was just like ‘are you serious?’ Especially because I’m your token Black kid, I’m the one you put on a poster when you go to job fairs to say you’re diverse. You’re not diverse, you just have me here.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CgYA2gjcptYNabm6Cj3ColdzAyw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328062/MailChimp_Job_Poster.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Angelo Ragin on a Mailchimp recruiting poster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6W8ymv"&gt;Ragin was also beginning to tire of small slights that piled up from white colleagues. Some would greet him by saying “what’s up gangster” and joke that he was stealing computers. A few years earlier, he’d started a side business repairing iPhone screens and selling accessories to support his family. One day, another Mailchimp employee began joking about him having the accessories piled in his car and asked if he was hawking toilet paper or paper towels, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ids36r"&gt;Ragin decided to send a letter to Mailchimp’s co-founders to voice his concerns. “It’s hard to walk into a company you love and have loved for so long, feeling like you’re going to do your best to have a good day but you’re expecting some sort of uncomfortable comment from someone and you just have to swallow your feelings for the sake of not being labeled as ‘aggressive’ or ‘defensive’ by your peers so you just keep quiet,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppLKCF"&gt;Mailchimp eventually decided to roll out unconscious bias training and enlisted Ragin’s support. He was glad to advise on the curriculum but was not compensated for the extra work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JC9k0M"&gt;While the bias training is now available for all employees, some staffers say the company still has more work to do. On the anonymous forum Blind, some have been discussing a perceived exodus of Black employees in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s evident that our beige C suite is too busy counting Calendly’s bag (re: Ben’s gross Slack message about Tope last week) to be bothered that they have been hemorrhaging black talent (#blaxodus) pre-covid or even consider validating the terrible experiences of marginalized employees by implementing anti-racist systems." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W9eXvM4GS9j-nMqeUIECQro1HfI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328069/screenshot_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comments in Blind, an anonymous employee forum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U28ex0"&gt;This perception could be related to the growth of Atlanta’s tech scene, which is giving employees more options of where to work. In January, CEO Ben Chestnut sent a Slack message to staff about a company called Calendly that had recently raised $350 million in funding. “It can be easy to look at companies like Calendly and feel like the grass is always greener and the wins come easier,” he wrote. “That’s not the case — we’ve got our phasers set to win and if anyone’s got green, it’s us!” He ended with a rocket emoji. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOf0HO"&gt;His comments were not meant for Luaces or Ragin. Both had left the company by this point: Luaces to run her own &lt;a href="https://www.hellyeahglutenfree.com/"&gt;bakery called Hell Yeah Gluten Free&lt;/a&gt; and Ragin to start his own consulting business. Ragin never got the promotion he was asking for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64z7q1"&gt;It’s a reality that even employees speaking out publicly cannot change. However much Mailchimp improves, two people of color who genuinely loved the company when they first arrived are now working outside the tech industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="9dyPQC"&gt;Ragin says that his experience at Mailchimp even prompted him to go to therapy for depression. “I questioned myself, I questioned my work, I questioned my ability, because every time you get to the next level, they move the bar,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Zk0wtX"&gt;
&lt;p id="daiysG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Two names were changed to protect the identities of those involved &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where to buy Nvidia’s RTX 3060 graphics card </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N_xC0e_-R_mHspcZBFq1U1sCY88=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873032/shollister_200224_4441_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kfxa6U"&gt;Nvidia’s new RTX 3060 will be available to purchase starting on Thursday, February 25th at 9AM PT / 12PM ET. Unlike other GPUs in the RTX 30 series, Nvidia is not making a Founder’s Edition of the RTX 3060, but other manufacturers like EVGA and Gigabyte are making their own iterations of the RTX 3060. The price is said to be $329, but as has been the case for the past year, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to find it available for that. Retailers that have posted listings are already marking up 3060 cards to $390 or more, which is much closer in price to the step-up 3060 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbzG6g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Sean Hollister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22064700"&gt;reviewed EVGA’s iteration of the RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt; and noted in his review that although the GPU’s price makes it more competitive to buy, you’re sacrificing more than a little bit of performance compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21768294/nvidia-rtx-3060-ti-when-where-how-to-buy-gpu"&gt;RTX 3060 Ti&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Just 10 percent of the new Postal Service fleet will be electric</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wWUPNMfsNBxEt-VvhsyO26Akkg0=/0x427:2560x2134/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68874134/NGDVfrontLeft_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: USPS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yy738L"&gt;Only 10 percent of the United States Postal Service’s new fleet of mail trucks will be battery-powered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;despite President Biden’s desire to convert the entire government fleet&lt;/a&gt;, USPS head Louis DeJoy &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-postal-service-vehicles/u-s-postal-chief-commits-to-10-of-new-delivery-vehicles-as-electric-vehicles-idUSL1N2KU2O2"&gt;revealed in Congressional testimony on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. The other 90 percent will be gas-powered, though the trucks — which are being built by defense contractor Oshkosh — are supposedly designed to be converted into electric vehicles down the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kg27zW"&gt;When DeJoy was asked why it wasn’t the other way around, he said he was willing to talk to the Biden administration but that the USPS doesn’t “have the 3 or 4 extra billion [dollars] in our plan right now that it would take to do it.” The USPS mail vehicles make up about a third of the entire government fleet. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NeIKaO"&gt;The USPS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297823/usps-postal-service-mail-truck-electric-oshkosh-workhorse"&gt;announced the new-generation mail truck on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; following a yearslong bidding process. It’s paying Oshkosh nearly $500 million to get the vehicles into production by 2023, and the defense contractor is promising to build anywhere between 50,000 and 165,000 of them over the next ten years. They will replace the current mail trucks that have been in service for more than two decades, which were built by defense contractor Grumman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6I9lMV"&gt;Many of those mail trucks — known as “long life vehicles” or LLVs — are well past their expiration dates and some have even caught fire, which is not only dangerous but has also cost the USPS a lot in repairs and upkeep. Additionally, they’re not equipped with modern amenities like airbags or air conditioning. The new trucks offer those, plus better ergonomics and new safety features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vyHNot"&gt;Both the USPS and Oshkosh said the deal was for a mix of gas and electric versions of the new vehicle, and that they would be “fuel-efficient” and “low-emission.” But they initially declined to specify what that mix would be or how they defined those terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gK8lLl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Electric vehicles make a lot of sense in short-range delivery settings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dl7nOa"&gt;“The [new vehicles] are expected to be more environmentally friendly than the current LLVs due to fewer trips required and better emission controls. These controls will decrease emissions and help improve air quality when compared to the vehicles they are intended to replace,” the USPS told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The flexible platform will allow the Postal Service to purchase the [new vehicles] with powertrains that maximize fuel efficiency, reduce operational costs and allow the incorporation of emerging technologies in the future when they become mature and offer operational savings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WH58Yn"&gt;Multiple bidding companies proposed all-electric or hybrid options during the six-year search for a new truck, &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.com/2020/08/31/inspector-generals-report-details-new-mail-truck-program-problems/"&gt;which was fraught with problems and delays&lt;/a&gt;. Only one of those companies was still in the running during the final phase, though: commercial EV startup Workhorse. After years of struggling to generate revenue, many industry analysts and experts thought the USPS contract was Workhorse’s best shot at survival. But some thought Workhorse had a decent chance considering it was the only one pitching an EV in the final stage and because electric vehicles make a lot of sense in short-range delivery settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idOGgi"&gt;Workhorse said Wednesday that it has requested “additional information from the USPS” about the decision and that it “intends to explore all avenues that are available to non-awarded finalists in a government bidding process.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmFOJP"&gt;Some environmental groups took aim at DeJoy after the announcement of the new truck. The USPS chief has been under pressure to resign for months following accusations that he was deliberately hampering the Postal Service’s ability to properly function during last year’s election, which saw a record number of people vote by mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="8D7Bi8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some have accused DeJoy of playing politics, but that may not be what happened here&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xYAH0k"&gt;“From undermining our democracy to delaying climate action, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy continues to fail the United States Postal Service and the American public,” Gina Coplon-Newfield, the director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All campaign, said in a statement. “The lack of commitment from the USPS to electrify its fleet directly contradicts the Biden administration’s goals and executive order to clean up pollution from the US government’s vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JI5Mgv"&gt;But while DeJoy may make a good scapegoat, it’s not clear that politics were at the heart of the decision to go with Oshkosh. The Trump administration certainly spent four years exhibiting a disdain for clean air policies. But it was also quite chummy with the people behind Workhorse. Trump himself cheered on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537225/gm-factory-workhorse-ev-electric-vehicle-startup-sale-trump-tweet"&gt;sale of the former General Motors factory in Lordstown, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; to Lordstown Motors, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20954956/gm-lordstown-motors-factory-workhorse-electric-vehicles-trump-ev"&gt;is essentially a spinoff of Workhorse&lt;/a&gt;. Former Vice President Pence &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302966/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-truck-ev-endurance-unveiling-pence"&gt;attended the unveiling of Lordstown Motors’ electric pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; (which is based on an original Workhorse design). And the Department of Energy started doing due diligence on Lordstown Motors for a possible &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/13/2157813/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Corp-Advances-to-Next-Stage-in-Department-of-Energy-s-Advanced-Technology-Vehicles-Manufacturing-Loan-Program-Application.html"&gt;Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; loan while Trump was still in office, despite the fact that the ATVM program has been otherwise dormant for nearly a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get an Oculus Quest 2 at Newegg and score a gift card for up to $20</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4fwctud5ibW7cxuFB_jphI7Wl14=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873771/akrales_200904_4160_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F6f4sw"&gt;The Oculus Quest 2 standalone VR headset has been tough to find throughout the pandemic. Several retailers now have it back in stock, but only at Newegg can you snag one and get a complimentary gift card with your purchase. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Foculus-quest-2%2Fp%2FN82E16826910017" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The headset with 64GB of storage &lt;/a&gt;costs $299 and includes a $10 Newegg gift card, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Foculus-quest-2%2Fp%2FN82E16826910018" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;while the 256GB model is $399&lt;/a&gt; and comes with a $20 gift card. If you’ve considered getting a headset, you might as well buy it from a place that’ll give you a freebie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KeYdx1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10318379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DvLPQT"&gt;In addition to the headset, Newegg is including gift cards with other accessories made for the Oculus Quest 2. The zip-up carrying case for the headset &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Foculus-301-00369-01-case%2Fp%2FN82E16826910021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $50 and includes a $5 gift card&lt;/a&gt;. The Elite strap that dramatically improves the Quest 2’s fit and comfort &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Foculus-301-00375-01-strap%2Fp%2FN82E16826910020" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is also $50&lt;/a&gt; and comes with a $5 gift card. As a Quest 2 owner myself, I highly recommend both accessories. Once you get your kit, you can follow &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218827/oculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to"&gt;my how-to on streaming VR games like &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; to your headset wirelessly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JP0w32"&gt;Razer’s first compact 60 percent gaming keyboard, the Huntsman Mini, is $100 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BFF4C7J/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733306396839425140" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which is $20 off its usual price. Both are offering the black-colored model with clicky optical switches. Unfortunately, this deal doesn’t apply to the Razer’s mercury white colorway. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21318516/razer-huntsman-mini-60-percent-keyboard-mechanical-clicky-linear-price-release-date"&gt;You can read more about the keyboard’s features right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A5FKf0"&gt;In case you’re hunting for a feature-packed 1440p gaming monitor that doesn’t cost a fortune, Acer’s XV272U is $300 at Amazon and B&amp;amp;H Photo. I wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/2/16/22286158/acers-nitro-xv272u-gaming-monitor-g-sync-1440p-qhd-amazon-deal-sale"&gt;this deal last week&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s not new, but it’s worth telling you about again in case your search for PC components is still ongoing. This model has a 27-inch QHD IPS panel with G-Sync compatibility and a 144Hz refresh rate, so it ticks a lot of boxes for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
