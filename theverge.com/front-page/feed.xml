    <title>Acast acquires RadioPublic to become the biggest podcasting company in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YiUFHkXK5yiY5oR-JC1Vz-T9-iA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68841309/acast_radiopublic.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Acast&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eemai7"&gt;Acast, a podcast host and ad network, is looking to improve its tech and broaden its reach. The company announced today that it’s acquiring RadioPublic for an undisclosed amount with the goal of using RadioPublic’s tech to bring more creators to the Acast platform and make inroads in the US market. RadioPublic’s podcast app will remain live, and its team will stay based in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4mXGP"&gt;Among the tools that RadioPublic created — and that intrigued Acast — is something called Podsite, which helps podcasters set up a complimentary website for their show as well as a feature called &lt;a href="https://about.radiopublic.com/2017/09/12/introducing-affinity-promotions-for-podcasts-on-radiopublic/"&gt;Affinity Promotions&lt;/a&gt;, which helps podcasters target their most loyal listeners with text-based messages. They can use these messages to promote a newsletter, for example, or highlight new merch. RadioPublic, more than anything else, homed in on podcast creators and designed tools especially for them, similarly to Acast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJ8gej"&gt;The Acast team operates a hosting platform, ad network, and listening app and is mostly interested in the creator side of the business. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557233/patreon-acast-podcasters-rss-feed-private-subscribers"&gt;partnered with Patreon&lt;/a&gt; to host its users’ shows and more easily distribute their private RSS feeds, as one example, and it makes hosting free at its most basic level. And while RadioPublic understands the US podcasting market well, which Acast plans to target moving forward, Acast is better known in other places around the world, which RadioPublic would like to reach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcM1we"&gt;“I think it was a match made in heaven,” says Leandro Saucedo, Acast’s chief business and strategy officer, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. He also points out that beyond RadioPublic’s consumer-facing tools, their technology was superb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSy7d6"&gt;“It’s hard for me to explain because you get so down to the technical side, but let’s say  within the car that’s Acast there’s a gearbox, which you never see but you definitely feel it if you drive, and there’s some nice gearbox stuff in RadioPublic that you wouldn’t think of, but once we put that gearbox into our car, our car runs smoother,” he says. “I think there’s a lot of that behind the scenes, which really makes sense for us, which is deep tech within the realm of podcasts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naxEH5"&gt;Broadly, Acast’s goals mirror Spotify’s. The team wants to bring as many creators to its platform as possible so that it can learn from their data and monetize their programming by selling ads through its advertiser marketplace. The more shows it has, the larger inventory it can sell. Spotify, comparatively, has tried to create a similar situation through Anchor and Megaphone, which offer sponsorships and access to an ad marketplace, respectively. The only difference in Spotify’s case is Anchor itself, which makes creating a show easier through software. Acast hasn’t focused on the actual creation toolset yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbGARX"&gt;Still, Saucedo claims to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Acast is “the largest podcasting business in the world,” based on its revenue and investments. He says he can’t share specifics but points to the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/acast"&gt;$120 million in funding&lt;/a&gt; and says that, if backtracked, someone could figure out the brand’s valuation, which he wouldn’t divulge. Whether Saucedo is accurate in his claim is somewhat irrelevant, as it speaks to Acast’s ambitions and the wider race to the top in podcasting. Everyone wants to capture the podcast advertising market and ride that revenue to being the biggest name in podcasting. Acast is taking its shot now, and RadioPublic is one way it thinks it’ll win.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber loses final appeal against drivers’ employment status in UK</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gg5tguUBRywFIgBrxq-aGhnqLIo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68841287/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y6AOnK"&gt;Uber has lost the final appeal in a long running UK legal battle over whether its drivers are self-employed or legally-recognized workers with all the attendant rights, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-19/uber-loses-u-k-top-court-ruling-on-drivers-employment-status?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The ruling is the conclusion of the company’s five-year legal fight in the country and a major setback for Uber that could affect all gig workers in the UK, regardless of employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyBrsS"&gt;Today, the UK’s Supreme Court ruled that Uber drivers are, indeed, workers, confirming the decision made by three lower courts. The unanimous decision means that drivers are entitled to a minimum wage, paid holiday, and other legal protections. Judge George Leggatt said Uber drivers working time isn’t limited to time spent driving passengers, but also “includes any period when a driver is logged into the app and ready and willing to accept trips.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VXS5JL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ruling dates back to a case from 2016&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UXd6GV"&gt;The ruling could have a significant impact on the UK’s estimated 4.7 million gig economy workers, affecting not just tech giants like Uber and food delivery firm Deliveroo, but also less well known companies like couriers CitySprint and plumbing outfit Pimlico Plumbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayPTkm"&gt;In response to the ruling, Uber’s regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe Jamie Heywood said that the company respect’s the court’s decision, but added that it “focused on a small number of drivers who used the Uber app in 2016,” and that the ruling doesn’t reclassify all of its UK drivers as workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eAWDLF"&gt;“Since then we have made some significant changes to our business, guided by drivers every step of the way,” Heywood said. “These include giving even more control over how they earn and providing new protections like free insurance in case of sickness or injury. We are committed to doing more and will now consult with every active driver across the UK to understand the changes they want to see.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNVu1F"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fen-GB%2Fblog%2Fsupreme-court-verdict&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F19%2F21330906%2Fuber-uk-supreme-court-employee-rights" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Uber said that the ruling classifies the drivers as “workers” rather than “employees,” which is a legally distinct category. It also says that certain elements of its service which were described in the judgement no longer apply, including penalties for drivers who reject multiple trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSmLyY"&gt;The original case against Uber was brought in 2016 by two drivers for the company, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam. They argued that Uber controlled nearly all the aspects of their working conditions, including who they could accept for rides and how much they would be paid, meaning the company was acting as their employer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0ezZZ"&gt;Uber lost three cases against Farrar and Aslam in 2016, 2017, and 2018. But today’s judgement from the Supreme Court, the UK’s final court of appeal, ends their legal options. The dispute will now return to a specialty tribunal, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, which will decide how much to award the 25 drivers. Uber also faces another 1,000 similar claims that had been stayed pending today’s ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emREnN"&gt;In a statement, the GMB Union, which helped bring the case against Uber, welcomed the “historic” win. “The Supreme Court has upheld the decision of three previous courts, backing up what GMB has said all along; Uber drivers are workers and entitled to breaks, holiday pay and minimum wage,” Mick Rix, GMB national officer, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BO75f2"&gt;“Uber must now stop wasting time and money pursuing lost legal causes and do what’s right by the drivers who prop up its empire,” Rix said, adding that the union now plans to work towards helping its members claim compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube won’t reopen remaining creator Spaces as company shifts to new model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u-4dj5uugSAfiiYN35MaIzVUUyY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68841243/wjoel_1777_180403_youtube_004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UdtHq4"&gt;YouTube’s permanent Spaces locations, which were designed to offer resources and networking opportunities to its creators, won’t reopen after the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtubespaces-update/"&gt;the company has confirmed&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, YouTube says it’s shifting to a hybrid model that will combine pop-up locations with virtual events. The Spaces that won’t be re-opening are in Berlin, London, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rio, and Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OIzQ1a"&gt;Although it was the pandemic that pushed YouTube towards a virtual model, the shift away from permanent Spaces has been underway for at least a couple of years. Back in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2019/05/30/youtube-pivots-physical-spaces-strategy/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TubeFilter&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the company was moving towards a reliance on temporary pop-up locations to give it the flexibility to serve creators across a wider area. At the time it said it would shutter its permanent Spaces in Mumbai and Toronto, and serve the locations with pop-ups instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KQ0IQ0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We truly believe this flexible new strategy will allow us to reach more regions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VqBZDv"&gt;YouTube’s mix of virtual events and pop-up locations have already reached tens of thousands of creators, according to the company. It says that last year it ran over a thousand virtual events that were attended by over 70,000 people across 145 countries. Meanwhile, since 2016, its 45 pop-up events have reached over 15,000 creators across more than 20 cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfPIw5"&gt;“We truly believe this flexible new strategy will allow us to reach more regions,” YouTube says in a blog post. In 2021, the company says it’s running a multi-week virtual program as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505891/youtube-black-voices-fund-first-originals-slate-announced"&gt;#YouTubeBlack Voices Fund&lt;/a&gt;, and continuing to invest in its NextUp program for emerging creators. There will also be live and recorded online workshops. Pop-up events and experiences will return once it’s safe to run in-person events again, YouTube says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly negotiating to build iPads in India</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fyWgILRvLhswLWuBqeY1XO8bJ1k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68840821/vpavic_190829_3709_1164.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1HWnMS"&gt;Apple is said to be lobbying the Indian government in a move that could see the company manufacture iPads in the country for the first time. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-india-idCAKBN2AI0TL"&gt;Reuters reports&lt;/a&gt; that the government is planning to launch an incentive scheme designed to boost India’s computer exports, and Apple wants in — but is angling for a better deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u6dJlO"&gt;The initiative will have a budget of up to Rs. 70 billion ($964 million) over five years, according to Reuters, but Apple is reportedly asking for that to be almost tripled to Rs. 200 billion. The reason is said to be partly that India’s supply chain doesn’t yet have the scale to meet Apple’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5jzy8"&gt;Apple already makes iPhones in India, having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/26/17506068/apple-iphone-6s-india-tariffs"&gt;started in 2018&lt;/a&gt; to avoid new import tariffs imposed by the Indian government as part of a “Make in India” initiative. The company has also been seeking to diversify its manufacturing out of China; last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252434/apple-manufacturing-china-vietnam-ipad-india-iphone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that some iPad production would shift to Vietnam this year, which would be the first time major iPad manufacturing happened anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFrJOT"&gt;Two people that spoke to Reuters said it was likely that iPads would be assembled in India by one of its current contractors “as early as this year.” Apple’s partners in India currently include Foxconn, Pegatron, and Wistron.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube removes PewDiePie diss track for violating cyberbullying, child safety rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o21x9hSOp_3rafYImCkJdAiZEPQ=/181x0:1309x752/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68840577/Screen_Shot_2021_02_18_at_10.09.58_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p35bjg"&gt;YouTube has removed one of Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg’s recent videos, a diss track aimed at popular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21519095/cocomelon-netflix-moonbug-blippi-hulu-streaming-youtube-children-entertainment"&gt;children’s channel Cocomelon&lt;/a&gt;, for violating guidelines around cyberbullying and child safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0v5GbZ"&gt;In the video, Kjellberg attacks Cocomelon’s content and pokes fun at kids who watch the videos. Kjellberg also uses phrases like “your audience is just a bunch of motherfucking virgins,” which could violate YouTube’s guidelines for using offensive or vulgar language in videos that include children. Toward the end of the video, Kjellberg also hands what appears to be plastic weapons to a few kids, who use them to attack a melon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDCydO"&gt;YouTube’s team decided to remove the video because it contained imagery that was inappropriate for children despite “looking like it was made for kids” and for creating content that “harms the YouTube community by persistently inciting hostility between creators for financial gain,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1362572883793309698/photo/1"&gt;according to official tweets&lt;/a&gt;. The second rule is in line with YouTube’s policy focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21005185/youtube-harassment-policy-update-malicious-expression-public-figures-maza-crowder"&gt;preventing creator-on-creator harassmen&lt;/a&gt;t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwUnVE"&gt;The company’s statement also acknowledges that while criticism is allowed, and diss tracks are allowed in certain cases, “this video crossed the line.” The removal did not result in a channel strike for Kjellberg’s channel, but further violations of YouTube’s policies may result in a channel strike, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vquyJU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I am not going to continue with it because 1) it wouldn’t be funny and 2) I don’t actually care about Cocomelon”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oQOZi8"&gt;“Our policies prohibit content that leads to repeated patterns of harassment on- and off-platform,” a YouTube spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “Following a review, we’ve removed the video in question for violating those policies because they had the effect of encouraging abusive fan behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pw8Ph"&gt;Re-uploads are circulating on YouTube, but the company stated on Twitter that it will be removing them as moderators come across videos. YouTube’s policies around kids content have tightened over the last few years, and content that may target kids or families by including children in the video are prohibited from using sexual themes, violence, obscene, or other mature themes, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rRlf7"&gt;Part of the reason that Cocomelon caught Kjellberg’s attention was because of the channel’s remarkable growth. In June 2020, it was brought to Kjellberg’s attention that Cocomelon was rapidly gaining subscribers. By mid-December, Cocomelon had surpassed 100 million subscribers. In a February 8th video, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8h4XU67bNU"&gt;Kjellberg announced&lt;/a&gt; he was creating a diss track aimed at Cocomelon. He released it a week later, where it remained active for a few days before YouTube took it down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMq8CJ"&gt;“I saw this as the finale,” Kjellberg said in a video posted on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWPWrz7pIz4"&gt;February 17th called “I Love Kids.”&lt;/a&gt; “I am not going to continue with it because 1) it wouldn’t be funny and 2) I don’t actually care about Cocomelon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCnU6p"&gt;This isn’t the first time that Kjellberg has created a diss track, either. In 2018, Kjellberg released “Bitch Lasagna” during an ongoing feud with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/30/17800234/pewdiepie-top-youtube-channel-t-series-india"&gt;Indian Bollywood studio T-Series&lt;/a&gt;. Their feud began when Kjellberg’s fans noticed that T-Series was on track to overtake Kjellberg as the most subscribed to channel on YouTube. Kjellberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/28/18521547/pewdiepie-subscribe-new-zealand-shooting-hateful-tseries-meme"&gt;disavowed the “subscribe to PewDiePie” meme &lt;/a&gt;after the phrase was used by the gunman who murdered more than 50 people in the Christchurch mosque shooting in New Zealand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hX14a7"&gt;By the end of March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/31/18289617/pewdiepie-tseries-congratulations-subscribe-youtube-diss-track-100-million"&gt;T-Series overtook Kjellberg&lt;/a&gt; as the most subscribed-to channel on YouTube, which he acknowledged with a new music video. Currently, there are livestreams on YouTube tracking Cocomelon and Kjellberg’s subscribers. Even if Kjellberg is done with the meme, it’s clear the internet is not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="on3gnX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmRNlX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFKXxY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kqb97J"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKr6rT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia says it won’t nerf the Ethereum mining performance of existing GPUs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4xZW6oNB_DKe3dhMGM7QfITLvgA=/12x0:2636x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68840348/twarren_rtx3080_3_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pqgySS"&gt;This morning, Nvidia announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289154/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;it would artificially reduce the performance&lt;/a&gt; of its upcoming $329 GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card when it comes to one specific task: Ethereum cryptocurrency mining. As weird as that news might sound, it was music to the ears of some gamers — who have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;trying and failing to get their hands on graphics cards for months&lt;/a&gt; due to the great GPU shortage, and blaming miners for part of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Z1vOq"&gt;You might be wondering: what does this mean for &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; GPUs? Nvidia isn’t talking about its plans for future graphics card just yet, but the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; (in no uncertain terms) that it won’t nerf existing GPUs. “We are not limiting the performance of GPUs already sold,” says a spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qirJu6"&gt;I was also a bit skeptical that the company’s new batch of Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) cards, marketed as an alternative for those miners, would mean that gamers might actually be able to buy an RTX 3060 as a result. If Nvidia’s diverting its already limited production capacity of GPUs towards CMPs, doesn’t that mean fewer gaming GPUs to begin with? There’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order"&gt;a global semiconductor shortage going on&lt;/a&gt;, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AbZfwBYTG6BGCgUQDVO5SM_MAqI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22312133/xV6u2t6.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s new Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP).&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PCC3lj"&gt;But Nvidia strongly suggests the new CMPs won’t impact the ability to produce GeForce gaming cards at all. “The chips used for CMP could not meet the specifications of GeForce and don’t impact overall GeForce capacity or availability,” replied a spokesperson by email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9TJoGD"&gt;While Nvidia wouldn’t confirm that it’s talking about binning — the process by which chipmakers like Intel, AMD, Nvidia and others take chips that aren’t 100 percent operational due to occasional manufacturing defects, and sell them as slower or less feature-filled parts instead — the statement certainly sounds something like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZnqeM"&gt;But it could also be that they’re different altogether. The shot you see above of Nvidia’s CMP looks nothing like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FritzchensFritz/status/1338201495007793152/photo/3"&gt;the layout of Nvidia’s GA102&lt;/a&gt; used in the Ampere-based RTX 3080 and 3090, or the &lt;a href="https://hothardware.com/photo-gallery/Article/3035?image=big_geforce-rtx-3070-die-shot.jpg&amp;amp;tag=popup"&gt;GA104&lt;/a&gt; used in the RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti. It doesn’t look much &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/130561288@N04/50914796651/"&gt;like Nvidia’s previous-gen Turing desktop chips&lt;/a&gt;, either. Perhaps the CMP is simply a GPU design that hasn’t publicly been revealed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KDZY2B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Real GA102 Ampere Die-Shot, very close to the official rendering. &lt;a href="https://t.co/qLUhzylT7B"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qLUhzylT7B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fritzchens Fritz (@FritzchensFritz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FritzchensFritz/status/1338201495007793152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XkVR8p"&gt;If so, it’s vaguely possible that Nvidia has a stockpile of older chips it’s putting to use. The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278562/nvidia-rtx-2060-gtx-1050-ti-gpu-shortage-global-chip"&gt;bringing back the GTX 1050 Ti from 2016&lt;/a&gt;, after all, and it’s doubtful that Nvidia switched over one of the RTX 30-series factories just to make that happen. But without knowing what the CMP actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, your guess is as good as ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zTCZnm"&gt;Lastly, you might be wondering: why only nerf Ethereum mining, when other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have also seen incredible gains? Here’s Nvidia’s full answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="egtKnZ"&gt;Ethereum has the highest global mining yield for any GPU-mineable coin at the moment and thus is likely the main demand driver for GPUs in mining. Other algorithms do not contribute significantly to GPU demand and this cannot change quickly due to network effects within a given cryptocurrency. The rate limiter applies to anything that uses Dagger Hashimoto or Ethash-like algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="knJzfP"&gt;We’re looking forward to seeing whether Nvidia can make the $329 GeForce RTX 3060 any easier to buy than previous GPUs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280277/nvidia-rtx-3060-graphics-card-release-date-time"&gt;when it launches February 25th at 12PM ET&lt;/a&gt;. After months of around-the-clock hunting, I finally managed to nab a 3060 Ti a couple weeks back — here’s hoping you won’t need to go that far. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 2021 Game Developers Conference won’t have in-person gatherings after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7f0llgtfi0rI-2UY045O35NfCZo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68840089/acastro_200302_1777_GDC_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Isntqq"&gt;The Game Developers Conference is changing course from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365498/gdc-2021-game-developers-conference-event-physical-hybrid-coronavirus-july-san-francisco"&gt;original (potentially risky) plan&lt;/a&gt; of hosting a hybrid in-person / digital event in 2021. According to &lt;a href="https://gdconf.com/news/new-approach-2021-family-gdc-events-and-more"&gt;an announcement on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, GDC 2021 will be all-digital and split into three separate events to better and more safely accommodate the networking, games showcases, and instructional workshops and panels the event is known for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hRA2ZZ"&gt;The series of events will start with GDC Masterclass, a collection of virtual workshops and trainings for developers that will take place on March 4th and 5th. GDC Showcase, which will be open to the public and free to attend, will run from March 15th through 19th, featuring networking and lectures in “a new array of content and formats.” Finally, GDC 2021 proper will take place during the week of July 19th as a business and education-focused event. &lt;a href="https://igf.com/article/igf-2021-accepts-over-500-excellent-entries"&gt;The Independent Games Festival (IGF)&lt;/a&gt; will also take place that week on July 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQhseh"&gt;Last year’s GDC was pushed back to the summer and held digitally, retitled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21243284/gdc-summer-event-digital"&gt;as GDC Summer&lt;/a&gt;. Keeping the events digital in 2021 ensures the conference won’t become a potential COVID-19 superspreader event, a concern that hasn’t stopped this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;Mobile World Congress&lt;/a&gt; from moving forward as an in-person convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZ3v0a"&gt;Another added benefit of going digital is that it could make GDC 2021 a lot more accessible. Attending GDC in past years has been &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gdc-at-a-crossroads/"&gt;prohibitively expensive for some independent developers&lt;/a&gt; even before including the cost of staying in San Francisco for a week. A digital event should allow more people to attend without the expense of travel. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blackmagic’s new ‘Pro’ Pocket Cinema Camera 6K adds the tilt-screen the original needed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dE8UfjU_kHe62jxzrsNDZTdzZqQ=/561x0:2049x992/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68839828/hero_lg_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Blackmagic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZdfaqQ"&gt;Blackmagic is releasing a new, “Pro” version of its Pocket Cinema Camera 6K, which looks to fix a lot of the pain points &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20903307/blackmagic-pocket-cinema-camera-6k-review-test-features-specs-price"&gt;we found in the original&lt;/a&gt;. It adds a tiltable, brighter screen (and an optional electronic viewfinder attachment), a bigger battery, and built-in ND. The camera is slotting into Blackmagic’s line-up above the regular 6K, coming in at $2,495, about $500 more than the non-Pro version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDjsdn"&gt;While the new features still won’t make the camera ideal for consumers, they will bring some quality-of-life improvements to filmmakers and video production houses on a budget — especially that tiltable screen. I’ve used a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera before, and it’s a dream mounted on a tripod at eye-level, but an ergonomic nightmare when you’re trying to get a shot handheld or at a high or low angle. Being able to tilt the screen up or down will help make the camera easier to use, and could even remove the need for an external monitor, depending on your shooting style.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/89tp0SrgZ4I2P5p44GKtqOSgonQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313574/uses_xl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Blackmagic&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This would be an annoying shot to get with the regular version.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5qRcHZ"&gt;In our review, we also found that the original Pocket Cinema 6K’s display was hard to view outdoors, but the Pro has two different solutions for that. One is that the screen now runs at 1,500 nits, which is as bright or brighter than most of &lt;a href="https://smallhd.com/collections/focus-pro?product_id=5117267476613&amp;amp;variant_id=34439571275909&amp;amp;product_handle=focus-pro"&gt;SmallHD’s dedicated on-camera monitors&lt;/a&gt;, and should help the monitor’s visibility in bright sunlight. The second is an optional, $500 OLED electronic viewfinder, which uses a dedicated (but seemingly proprietary) connector instead of taking up the camera’s single HDMI port like a &lt;a href="https://www.zacuto.com/gratical-evf"&gt;Zacuto EVF&lt;/a&gt; would. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0ftrZ"&gt;To power all that, it uses a larger battery than the original, but Blackmagic only quotes an hour of shooting time with the screen at 50 percent brightness (though that is an improvement over the original’s estimated 45 minutes). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="l34hyT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pro is more competitive with Canon’s C100 MK II&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mEdeDx"&gt;More exciting, especially for those who shoot outside a lot, are the built-in ND filters. The camera has four built-in filters that cut down light by two, four, and six stops for when the sun is shining a bit too brightly. Of course, I would’ve loved to see &lt;a href="https://www.newsshooter.com/2016/11/09/sony-introduce-fs7-ii-with-electronic-variable-nd-locking-e-mount-and-higher-price/"&gt;an electronically variable ND filter&lt;/a&gt; like on Sony’s cameras, which provide a continuous range instead of discreet stops, but at this price point I can understand why Blackmagic didn’t go that route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvnGTT"&gt;Throw in an extra mini-XLR jack for a total of two, and the Pro is a nice upgrade to the original Pocket 6K. It also makes the camera more competitive with Canon’s C100 Mark II, which has a similar Super-35 sensor, EF mount, and built-in ND. The cameras may appeal to different types of shooters, but I know I’ve found myself cross-shopping Canon and Blackmagic’s offerings before, especially when I’m uncertain about what type of projects I want to work on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9X74e"&gt;If, like me, you were put off by some of the asterisks and caveats of the original version, the Pro version may be worth another look — especially since all the extra features come at a relatively low price premium.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The carbon-fiber Vaio Z is the world’s lightest laptop with an Intel H-series chip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aVfjZT95KeBbMEPYW4RRYq7i8uw=/384x274:2240x1511/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68839804/FUJI_8_14.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vaio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZTdwvM"&gt;Vaio is known for making laptops that pack a surprising amount of power into unbelievably thin form factors. The Vaio Z may be the company’s most ambitious product yet. It contains up to Intel’s four-core Core i7-11357H — and at a starting weight of 2.11 pounds, it’ll be the lightest laptop ever to house an Intel H-series processor. (Though &lt;a href="https://us.vaio.com/collections/vaio-z"&gt;models you can buy in the US&lt;/a&gt; are 2.32 pounds.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im9d4x"&gt;Part of the reason the Vaio Z is so light is that it’s the first laptop ever to be made of “contoured carbon fiber.” You’ll find carbon fiber in some of the nicest lightweight laptops on the market, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327454/dell-xps-17-2020-laptop-review-display-test-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS line&lt;/a&gt; — it’s a sturdy and lightweight material. But those laptops utilize sheets of carbon fiber that are held together with metal or plastic parts. Vaio has actually contoured the material around the edges of the Z’s chassis, so it’s carbon fiber all around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GCM1o"&gt;Vaio says the device has passed 26 “surface drop” tests, and will deliver up to 13 and a half hours of battery life. In terms of other specs, you can get up to 2TB of storage, 32GB of memory, Iris Xe integrated graphics, and either an FHD or a 4K  14-inch display. There’s a backlit keyboard, a webcam with a physical shutter, a full-size HDMI port, and two USB-C ports as well. The chassis is a clamshell, though you can fold the screen down to 180 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ct42wl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HROBewgmVTk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HttiQg"&gt;Of course, this all doesn’t come cheap. The Vaio Z starts at — I’m not joking — $3,579. So it won’t be a practical purchase for most people, but it’s still an impressive achievement and an interesting proof-of-concept. Keep an eye out for our full review in a few days, where we’ll dive into the performance you can expect for that price. You can &lt;a href="https://us.vaio.com/products/vaio-z?variant=33061213405259"&gt;preorder&lt;/a&gt; units now on Vaio’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hill Report: who wants to talk to Reddit?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CFPB Director Kathleen Kraninger Testifies On Protecting Consumers During Pandemic" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-m8xE-O7SpQJcRM3BVZ69nL1AaA=/0x0:3975x2650/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68839637/1227843495.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vRsjub"&gt;Weeks after Reddit community r/WallStreetBets &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;shitposted GameStop stock up to more than $400 a share&lt;/a&gt;, the House Financial Services Committee pulled all of the major players in for questioning on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xW60I6"&gt;The hearing featured:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wxutSI"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev&lt;/strong&gt;, whose commission-free brokerage platform made WallStreetBets’ GameStop short squeeze possible — well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287381/robinhood-citadel-financial-services-house-day-traders"&gt;until it didn’t&lt;/a&gt;, and the app froze all meme trading for hours, angering both the meme traders, lawmakers, and regulators, creating the conditions for our hearing today!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZMNQkG"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Reddit CEO Steve Huffman&lt;/strong&gt;, who, in his opening remarks, basically just explained what Reddit is, providing a dictionary-style definition of “subreddits” for lawmakers. After that, he didn’t say much else. No one was asking him questions!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RIbyyt"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Keith Gill&lt;/strong&gt;, better known by his Reddit pseudonyms, RoaringKitty and u/DeepFuckingValue, who rather than donning his infamous red headband, hung it behind him next to an inspirational poster of a cat encouraging us all to “Hang in there.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mhe8XY"&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;Kenneth C. Griffin&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Gabriel Plotkin&lt;/strong&gt;, CEOs of Citadel and Melvin Capital, respectively. We’re not going to talk about them too much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="CZ937f"&gt;Robinhood was clearly the focus. The company’s app facilitated the r/WallStreetBets January GameStop squeeze until, as Tenev puts it, the company couldn’t any longer. At the height of the meme-trading frenzy, Robinhood pulled the plug on popular stocks like GameStop and AMC, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254584/gamestop-robinhood-short-reddit-wallstreetbets-aoc-ted-cruz"&gt;prompting lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to call for this hearing to investigate the company’s relationships with hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3U1oI"&gt;At Thursday’s hearing, Tenev tried to dispel those rumors. “We don’t answer to hedge funds,” he said. “We serve millions of small investors who use our platform every day to invest.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SnY4TI"&gt;Throughout the hearing, Tenev assured lawmakers that Robinhood had to halt meme stock trading because its business partners — the clearinghouses that &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;perform the trades — bumped up how much money it would cost the company to finish them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Whhu5"&gt;Tenev apologized for pausing those trades and promised to do better in the future — typical remarks from a congressional witness in the hot seat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Rk02So"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IT MEANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MWV9IQ"&gt;For a hearing investigating what happens when a bunch of Redditors disrupt the US financial markets, social media’s role in the GameStop squeeze wasn’t really a major part of Thursday’s hearing. But for the lawmakers focused on the internet’s influence in January’s events, they appeared deeply concerned about how social media discourse can cause real-world problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHiFlr"&gt;Now, what happened to the bemoaned video game retailer’s stock price in January does not even remotely come close to the fallout of the pro-Trump riot at the Capitol that also took place that month, but it plays into how lawmakers are looking to regulate social media post-Trump. For example, earlier this month, Senate Democrats took their first stab at reforming Section 230 by introducing a bill, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22268368/democrats-section-230-moderation-warner-klobuchar-facebook-google"&gt;called the SAFE TECH Act&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, that bill would open tech companies, like Reddit and Facebook, up to lawsuits if the platforms host abusive content targeting specific users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVqQXG"&gt;It was the first big moderation bill to drop after the deadly attack at the Capitol, and importantly, it could set the tone for future discussions around regulating tech platforms. That message clearly found its way across the Capitol from the Senate into the House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLliBn"&gt;Rep. David Scott (D-GA), asking Tenev if Robinhood engages in content moderation on social media — it doesn’t, and why would it? — brought up this line of thinking: “This episode [the GameStop-Reddit saga] exposes a serious threat to our financial system when tweets and social media posts do more to move the market than material, legitimate information,” Scott said. “The risk is enormous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqOwBy"&gt;Now, Scott’s take may not be mine, but it serves as an example of how lawmakers are tying together forum discussions and real-world action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXZF8X"&gt;Responding to one lawmaker, I think Huffman raised an important counterpoint: “WallStreetBets may look sophomoric or chaotic from the outside, but the fact that we are here today means they’ve managed to raise important issues about fairness and opportunity in our financial system,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0MkmD"&gt;This balance will be difficult to strike if Congress proceeds on legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kcXrpx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE HIGHLIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty, wins 18 trillion bonus points for this gem in House Financial Committee testimony:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"A few things I am not: &lt;br&gt;I am not a cat;&lt;br&gt;I am not an institutional investor;&lt;br&gt;Nor am I a hedge fund"&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gamestop?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#gamestop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/5W9UkQcG95"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5W9UkQcG95&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Yaël (@YaelOss) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YaelOss/status/1362477126365151232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F6BlU9"&gt;The meme stock hearing’s most viral meme has to come from RoaringKitty’s opening statement. Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/2/9/22274865/zoom-hearing-cat-filter-lawyer-texas-live-court-hearing"&gt;a Zoom filter of a cat&lt;/a&gt; got stuck on a lawyer’s face before a live court hearing, and the following video clip became a viral meme. Despite going by a cat-related username, Gill appeared to refer to the infamous lawyer cat in his opening remarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ipln4O"&gt;“A few things I am not: I am not a cat. I am not an institutional investor, nor am I a hedge fund,” Gill said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dK12gL"&gt;It’s not the first time that white cat filter has been invoked in Congress. Watch a member of the House Financial Services Committee have trouble with Zoom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276998/tom-emmer-coronavirus-relief-lawyer-cat-house-financial-services"&gt;in this &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;story from earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2j4fo4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT DIDN’T THEY ASK? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bVhO1U"&gt;Sitting through this hearing, I was waiting and waiting for Huffman to be on the receiving end of any meaningful line of questioning, seeing as he was the only witness who leads a social media company. Reddit may not be as big as Facebook, but it’s been at the center of some of the internet’s ugliest scenes, from /r/creepshots to Gamergate. Still, Huffman made his opening statement at the top of the hearing, and it took around an hour and a half before he said anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IocrVm"&gt;Here’s what I would’ve liked to hear from Huffman:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RAgNxG"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kellymakena/status/1362456841247207429?s=20"&gt;In Huffman’s opening remarks&lt;/a&gt;, he said that Reddit employees acted as “diplomats’’ to help soothe disagreements within r/WallStreetBets’ leadership during the height of the squeeze. Why did Reddit step in in such a way? Has Reddit ever had similar conversations with other subreddit moderators? If so, which subreddits, and why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AisaSz"&gt;To what extent was r/WallStreetBets’ GameStop short squeeze a content moderation issue? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3ct4qC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT’S NEXT? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OZcPPs"&gt;Thursday’s hearing was just the first in a series following the Reddit-GameStop short squeeze. Chair Waters said in an interview with MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle Thursday that she plans to hold two more hearings before ending the committee’s investigation. It’s not clear when those additional hearings, one being an expert listening session and another focusing on legislation, are scheduled to take place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naUesy"&gt;The Senate Banking Committee, chaired by Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), also said last month that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254909/senate-banking-stocks-sherrod-brown-aoc-gamestop-reddit-hearing"&gt;it would hold a hearing&lt;/a&gt; on “the current state of the stock market” in the wake of the unprecedented market volatility around GameStop and other meme stocks. Still, Brown has yet to make any official announcements regarding that hearing or any additional actions the committee may take. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KsltBI"&gt;But in a flurry of letters Thursday morning, Banking Committee member Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) started taking measures into her own hands. Warren wrote to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, &lt;a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/senator-warren-to-finra-in-wake-of-robinhood-controversy-how-will-you-level-the-playing-field-for-individual-investors"&gt;prompting the body&lt;/a&gt; to investigate Robinhood’s relationship with Citadel and asking it to ensure that retail investors aren’t disadvantaged by these relationships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1h7quA"&gt;And of course, the Securities and Exchange Commission is currently investigating the GameStop saga on its own. In an interview with CNBC Thursday before the hearing, SEC Chair Hester Peirce didn’t provide much information on how the SEC plans to respond, but he did suggest short-selling limitations may be in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cVlKap"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="U068kf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMMmFw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
