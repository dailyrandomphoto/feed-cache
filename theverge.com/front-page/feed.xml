    <title>Why look at reality when you can edit what you see in real time?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZgeMSFH9a3bV4p3iPvoLfd3CBSs=/371x0:2255x1256/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69987831/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_11.05.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WebIK2"&gt;The adoption of augmented reality is happening slowly but surely, and it’s easy to see one possible future for the technology: hardware that lets you edit what you see in real time, replacing objects around you with virtual overlays. Call it mixed reality, to be more precise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xeM1dr"&gt;Recent research from the AI team at Porsche (yes, the carmakers — we’ll get to that in a bit) shows how this might work. The team has built an &lt;a href="http://www.grosse-puppendahl.com/publications/ismar2021.pdf"&gt;AI system dubbed TransforMR&lt;/a&gt; that detects objects like cars and people, removes them, then replaces them with CGI alternatives in real-time. The end-results are hardly flawless (edits are haphazard and the CGI models look like they were borrowed from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Movie_Maker"&gt;&lt;em&gt;3D Movie Maker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) but the concept is striking. It’s not hard to imagine applications like this becoming commonplace in decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Lj69sd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a rough demo, but the concept is striking&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zKVoxG"&gt;The team behind the work told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that although individual elements of their work had been done before, the composite system us novel. TansforMR can run on regular smartphones and tablets, but requires a 4G connection to send data to the cloud. Images are processed so that objects are not just covered up, as with Snapchat AR lenses or Apple’s Memoji, but edited out entirely. Objects are detected, segmented, then “inpainted” (replaced with AI-generated background), and a CGI model substituted for the original. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g8sbnbHW1QFN5jNPmcYpsrOVbjE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923295/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_10.08.18_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The TransforMR model involves many distinct steps&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="48TSLm"&gt;There are obviously lots of areas for improvement. The frame-rate is just 15fps at low quality inpainting; the lag is 50 to 100 milliseconds; and the CGI replacements are low quality. But, the team behind the system say these aspects are relatively easy to improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0tMm3"&gt;“The main limitation is that large images are very compute-intensive,” Mohamed Kari, a machine learning researcher at Porsche, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “So for the inpainting we do this with very small images currently, operating on 512 x 512 images. But the bandwidth [usage] is negligible. If you can do FaceTime you can do TransforMR.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTFG5I"&gt;One of the key elements of the system, says Kari, is its use of pose detection. This means that when the system detects a person, for example, it identifies 18 separate joints in the body. That means the CGI replacement can be anchored to the target’s movement in real time. Kari compares this to other AR systems which simply identify geometric surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AniRF4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Integrating this technology into AR glasses is impossible right now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a9tHA2"&gt;Looking at clips of TransforMR in action, it’s not hard to imagine such software being integrated into AR glasses. Users could pick a “theme” for their day, replacing cars, buildings, and people with sci-fi alternatives, or items taken from nature. But, as Kari points out, this would involves a huge hardware challenge. Current augmented reality glasses can only project low-resolution, semi-opaque overlays onto their lenses. Right now, we just don’t have the technology to “edit” what users are seeing with this sort of hardware. (Though it could presumably be done using a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609564/facebook-reality-lab-reverse-passthrough-vr-prototype-research-siggraph"&gt;“passthrough” VR system&lt;/a&gt;, where first-person cameras play a live video feed onto screens that completely occlude the wearer’s vision.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IS8vAR"&gt;“We are reproducing the full image on screen, so we can remove whatever we want to, but with augmented reality glasses removing objects is difficult because it adds light intensity,” says Kari. “In HoloLens for example, you are looking &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; the glass,  so removing stuff is more difficult. That question is open to research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvTVRK"&gt;But why is Porsche investigating this sort of tech in the first place? According to one of the company’s AI architects, Tobias Grosse-Puppendahl, it’s all about improving the experience of passengers and drivers. Future versions of the TransforMR software could be used to entertain people when they’re stuck in traffic, Grosse-Puppendahl tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Our main question was, how can we modify reality in a way that is fun and entertaining to react with? And that’s where our idea originated from.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8lCqJ"&gt;Other research projects at Porsche follow a similar theme. For example, the company has also built a &lt;a href="https://mkari.de/pubs/uist2021-soundsride.pdf"&gt;prototype system called SoundRide&lt;/a&gt; which uses a car’s machine vision to detect changes in scenery and cue up appropriate music. “Maybe, for example, you’re driving through the Alps, driving through a beautiful route, and suddenly you have a wonderful view and maybe the music changes,” says Kari. “We’re thinking how technology can make the experience in the car even more interesting and beautiful.” And that means tinkering with what people would otherwise see and hear. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford to deploy ‘angels’ to troubleshoot busted EV chargers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RtIsp-ldED84LYhGQorTvJXNinI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69987817/sokane_210125_4386_1835.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charging Ford’s electric Mach-E.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uvEzOY"&gt;Ford has an interesting idea for how it can improve the reliability of electric car chargers in the US: charge angels. In an &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/service/how-ford-helping-ev-owners-charging-stations"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Ford’s general manager of electric vehicles Darren Palmer, announced plans to deploy employees in specially equipped electric Ford Mach-Es to visit and test chargers when connected vehicle data or social media complaints suggest there might be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jqy8kP"&gt;“All they’ll do all day long is go and check them to see where they fail and why,” Palmer said. Although details of the initiative are yet to be finalized, the company expects it to launch before the end of the year, ready for the release of the all-electric &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;F-150 Lightning in 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2vnfwJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Some of them are old and they don’t have the quality or reliability we want”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f23fYL"&gt;“There are a lot of plugs out there, but some of them are old and they don’t have the quality or reliability we want,” Palmer said. “Over 99.5 percent of customers go into a charger and get a charge. We’re pleased about that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCLg53"&gt;We experienced this problem first hand when we reviewed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265570/mustang-mach-e-review-electric-ford-ev-photos-video"&gt;Ford’s Mach-E&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than operating its own charging stations like Tesla, Ford has the “FordPass Charging Network” which gathers together &lt;a href="https://www.ford.com/buy-site-wide-content/overlays/mach-e-overlays/public-charging/"&gt;over 13,500 charging stations&lt;/a&gt; operated by other companies like Electrify America and ChargePoint. But the problem, as my colleague Sean O’Kane &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265570/mustang-mach-e-review-electric-ford-ev-photos-video"&gt;found in his review&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, is that the quality of upkeep between these different providers can vary, meaning you might not get a perfectly working charger first time. Here’s how Sean described his experience: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pYePK7"&gt;“For instance, I took one drive to an Electrify America station, which is basically Volkswagen’s fledgling version of Tesla’s Supercharger network, and still ran into problems. The first plug I tried gave me repeated error messages. When I tried another plug, a moth flew out, and then the car charged far slower than it is supposed to. It was only after trying multiple stalls that I finally got a charging rate worth staying connected to — around 77kW, about half of what the Mustang Mach-E is ultimately supposed to get out of these fast-charging stations. (It was also somehow the only Electrify America station in all of Austin, Texas, which really needs to up its charging infrastructure game.)”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="P8cNAS"&gt;YouTuber Marques Brownlee had a similar experience when he pitted a Tesla and a Mustang Mach-E against a gas-powered car in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXzuFprlyrw"&gt;1,000 mile road trip&lt;/a&gt;, and found it much easier to find a fully-functional fast-charger for the Tesla. It can be a frustrating situation that means range anxiety continues to be an issue, even as the range of electric cars themselves improves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhNmoF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uFUv1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenSea fixes vulnerabilities that could let hackers steal crypto with malicious NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UAsVBbflZL50UC8aCakifNjKSvI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69987745/acastro_210329_1777_nft_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NLlAHM"&gt;OpenSea has fixed vulnerabilities in its platform that could’ve let hackers steal someone’s crypto after sending them a maliciously crafted NFT. The issue was found by security firm Check Point Research, which noticed tweets from people claiming they were hacked after being gifted NFTs, according to a blog post. The researchers talked to one of the people saying they were attacked, and found vulnerabilities proving an attack could happen this way and reported the problems to OpenSea. The security firm says the NFT trading platform fixed the issue within an hour and worked with researchers to make sure the fix worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBHRaA"&gt;While the attackers potentially being able to drain entire wallets is certainly not a good look for OpenSea, it wasn’t a simple matter of just gifting someone an NFT — the exploit needed its target to click on a few prompts first, including one that might include transaction details. While being sent an NFT gift doesn’t require any interaction on your part, the malicious NFTs were harmless if they just sat unviewed in an OpenSea account. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lAV7BRWvoR4DM85gdhjUUYD39Xc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22922471/Screen_Shot_2021_10_12_at_3.17.56_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Check Point Research&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The transfer confirmation message users may see while viewing an infected NFT.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oFs0Ji"&gt;The potentially dangerous situation occurs when viewing the image by itself (by, say, right-clicking on it and hitting “open in new tab”). For users with a crypto-wallet browser extension like MetaMask installed, it initiates a popup asking to connect storage.opensea.io to their wallet. If the target clicks yes, the attackers could snag the wallet’s information and trigger another popup asking to approve a transfer from the victim’s wallet to their own. If you’re not paying attention or didn’t realize what was going on and confirmed the transfer, you could wind up losing everything in your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTG5uI"&gt;OpenSea says in a statement that it hasn’t found any instances of someone actually carrying out that kind of attack — though it’s still unclear what happened to the people who say they were attacked. As far as I could find, there were only a few people talking about being hacked after receiving a gift NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8m4oKf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Don’t sign things you haven’t read or don’t recognize&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Te9lil"&gt;OpenSea says it’s working with third-party wallet providers to help people recognize malicious signature requests. Still, for the most part, standard internet safety rules apply — don’t click on things that seem out of the ordinary, and &lt;em&gt;definitely &lt;/em&gt;don’t confirm any transaction requests unless you’re entirely sure it’s something you want to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8WA9i"&gt;While this particular attack required a lot of interaction (as well as at least some amount of inattention) from the target, it’s good to see Check Point’s confirmation that OpenSea has fixed it. It’s easy to imagine people new to NFTs potentially getting their wallets drained, and we’ve seen examples of bad actors and scammers in the crypto space. There are those who are willing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619272/poly-network-attack-600-million-cryptocurrency-theft-doge-ethereum-binance-return-defi"&gt;steal people’s Ethereum&lt;/a&gt;, pretend to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683766/nft-scams-theft-social-engineering-opensea-community-recovery"&gt;OpenSea support employees&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650594/banksy-nft-scam-pranksy-ethereum-returned-duplicates-art"&gt;sell an almost certainly fake Banksy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXaoCw"&gt;OpenSea also &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/new-features-and-updates-mobile-app-offer-management-tools-and-more/"&gt;announced on Monday&lt;/a&gt; that it would hide gifted NFTs from an account’s page by default if they’re from unverified collections and add an option to suspend your account from buying or selling NFTs if you think your wallet has been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bird’s scooters will now emit annoying beeps when you drive on the sidewalk</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An rental electric scooter “BIRD” abandoned on a sidewalk..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W90mx8_L69xa9uTDY3FUsMcxsKE=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69987781/1234464872.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Gerard Bottino/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="npKSSk"&gt;Riding an electric scooter on the sidewalk is dangerous, but scooter-sharing companies have struggled to prevent their customers from engaging in risky behavior. Bird thinks it has found a solution: annoying beeps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKA24c"&gt;Using technology provided by a company called u-blox, Bird is rolling out an end-to-end GPS system “designed to deliver centimeter-level accuracy specifically for the micromobility industry.” Riders who stray onto the sidewalk will be bombarded with audio alerts from the scooter, as well as notifications on their smartphones, warning them to get back on the street. Failure to follow directions results in a de-powered scooter: the vehicle will slow down and eventually come to a stop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CHbnGK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The problem Bird is trying to solve is a seemingly intractable one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Vy13D"&gt;The problem Bird is trying to solve is a seemingly intractable one. Riders have a difficult time tracking down available scooters when they want one. And scooters sometimes block sidewalks, obstructing the path for people in wheelchairs and other pedestrians with mobility concerns. They all end up cluttered in a handful of places rather than spread evenly around a city. And cities have complained about the companies failing to place enough scooters in low-income and minority communities to ensure equal distribution across economic lines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bzKmn9EqHWE1tW_oZGcmywK2k_E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22922312/Bird_SafeSidewalkDetection.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DVGOrU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.li.me/second-street/lime-debuts-sidewalk-detection-latest-innovation-to-improve-scooters-for-all"&gt;Lime says it uses “a sophisticated statistical model”&lt;/a&gt; with 95 percent accuracy to determine when a scooter has gone up onto a sidewalk. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252156/spin-scooter-remote-control-tortoise-segway"&gt;Other scooter companies&lt;/a&gt; have invested in remote-operation technology, including cameras and other sensors, to improve fleet management. These front- and rear-facing built-in cameras enable remote operators to move the scooters when they happen to be blocking sidewalks or street traffic. They can also make it possible for an e-scooter to travel several blocks to riders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7AW83n"&gt;But Bird claims that its GPS-based solution is easier and cheaper to roll out than expensive camera-based systems. It also says that u-blox’s ZED-F9R module (great name) will make it easier for customers to find nearby scooters, even in cities with tall buildings that typically obstruct satellite signals. This is how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cjTc52"&gt;The ZED-F9R is a dual-band multi-constellation GNSS receiver that supports up to 8 times more satellite signal types and 4 times more constellations (GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, and BeiDou) than standard solutions. The module processes real-time vehicle data including wheel speed, IMU sensor data including acceleration and spatial orientation, and real-time kinematic data that corrects for ionospheric interference. The technology is also optimized for e-scooters by applying dynamic models matching the movements of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="86vJmE"&gt;Bird is also using what it calls “centimeter-level sidewalk mapping” to determine when a scooter has left the road and onto a sidewalk. This allows the company to create a geofence that deactivates the scooter’s throttle when it enters a prohibited zone. Centimeter level, you say? How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="c3h3rs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; It starts with a geofence outline constructed from satellite imagery or city GIS data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLEX7T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; From here, we use surveying equipment to measure the location of three city landmarks. Only a few measurements are needed for each city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8JVcf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Once the landmarks have been identified, we compare their location to the satellite imagery to determine offsets and rotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkEn4S"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4:&lt;/strong&gt; We then use these offsets and rotation values to shift and transform each of our original geofence outlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNMPgY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, after our geofence outlines have been updated, they are pre-loaded onto our vehicles to eliminate latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dV2SAE"&gt;Bird says it will be testing the new system in scooters deployed in Milwaukee and San Diego, with Madrid to soon follow. If all goes well, the company plans to roll it out to the rest of the global fleet “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="mOhNCl"&gt;AMD warned last week that its chips are experiencing performance issues in Windows 11, and now Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/october-12-2021-kb5006674-os-build-22000-258-32255bb8-6b25-4265-934c-74fdb25f4d35"&gt;first update&lt;/a&gt; to its new OS has reportedly made the problems worse. &lt;a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/287786/first-windows-11-patch-tuesday-makes-ryzen-l3-cache-latency-worse-amd-puts-out-fix-dates"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechPowerUp &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that it’s seeing much higher latency, which means worse performance, after the Windows 11 update went live yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o76pxc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713310/windows-11-amd-ryzen-processors-performance-issues-software-update-october"&gt;AMD and Microsoft found two issues&lt;/a&gt; with Windows 11 on Ryzen processors. Windows 11 can cause L3 cache latency to triple, slowing performance by up to 15 percent in certain games. The second issue affects AMD’s preferred core technology, that shifts threads over to the fastest core on a processor. AMD says this second bug could impact performance on CPU-reliant tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UISg1A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first Windows 11 update arrived yesterday&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="91bIAR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechPowerUp&lt;/em&gt; measured the L3 cache latency on its Ryzen 7 2700X at around 10ns, and Windows 11 increased this to 17ns. “This was made much worse with the October 12 ‘Patch Tuesday’ update, driving up the latency to 31.9ns,” says &lt;em&gt;TechPowerUp&lt;/em&gt;. That’s a huge jump, and the exact type of issue AMD warned about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pesAox"&gt;Patches for both of the Ryzen issues are coming before the end of the month, though. The L3 cache issue will likely be addressed next week by Microsoft, with &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/q6ufs1/windows_11_l3_cppc_patches_dates/"&gt;rumors suggesting&lt;/a&gt; October 19th for a patch. The preferred core patch will be addressed by an AMD driver, which is expected to be delivered later this month and will hopefully be available on Windows Update as soon as it’s released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCM5vl"&gt;It’s still surprising to see Windows 11 ship with these issues, especially when Microsoft has limited the amount of supported processors for this new OS. Bugs always happen with new OS releases, but such an obvious performance impact on key CPUs should have been picked up during the months of public beta testing. Either way, it’s encouraging to see this will be fixed very soon so those suffering from worse performance won’t have to wait too much longer for a patch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Realme’s extremely green GT Neo 2 flagship has a Snapdragon 870 for $425</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8aMZvd8TZfj44M3gEcbFmurSixk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69987706/IMG_0172.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9TPtp3"&gt;Realme has launched its latest flagship phone for India, the GT Neo 2. It’s similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534618/realme-gt-hands-on-europe-launch-price-specs"&gt;the impressive Realme GT&lt;/a&gt; that came to Europe a few months ago — this one is better in some ways but worse in others. Depending on your taste, you’ll probably feel quite strongly about which bucket the neon green version pictured above falls into. (It also comes in black and blue.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeSjvR"&gt;While the GT has a Snapdragon 888 processor, the GT Neo 2 is built around an 870. This is basically Qualcomm’s speed-bumped version of the 865 Plus, which was itself a faster version of last year’s flagship chip — the main core now runs at 3.2GHz. Realme says the GT Neo 2’s new vapor cooling system is 30 percent larger and 20 percent more efficient, making use of stainless steel as well as copper. The phone does include 5G connectivity, though 5G networks haven’t yet been switched on in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpIDHT"&gt;The display is a little bigger than the GT’s, measuring in at 6.62 inches. It’s a 1080p OLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate. The battery is also bigger than the GT’s at 5,000mAh, up from 4,500mAh, and the GT Neo 2 still has Realme’s 65W SuperDart fast charging. Realme says it should take 36 minutes to fill from 0 to 100 percent. There’s still no wireless charging, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633722/realme-flash-magdart-magnetic-wireless-charging-time-test"&gt;the new magnetic MagDart system&lt;/a&gt; that is so far yet to be included on any commercial device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S-3WNa8ZoP38yeyR9-QOKV_Bvo0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923288/IMG_0171.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n7DWcE"&gt;Like the GT, the triple camera system includes a 64-megapixel main sensor, an 8-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 2-megapixel macro lens. Realme is pushing the GT Neo 2’s Street Photography mode, which is supposed to boost shutter response and focus performance, as well as including some film simulation filters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QB7Ezh"&gt;The Realme GT Neo 2 will be available later this week in India. It costs Rs. 31,999 (~$425) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, or you can get a 12GB/256GB version for Rs. 35,999 (~$475).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Quake remaster is now 4K 120fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mlH_uJ9jls3jS0etabTX27qkpW0=/308x0:1613x870/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69987692/Quake__Minor_Update_HERO_v3_1920x870.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bethesda&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ilOfvm"&gt;The “next-gen upgrade” for this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632110/quake-xbox-playstation-switch-4k-visuals-version-download"&gt;Quake remaster&lt;/a&gt;, which adds support for up to 4K / 120fps gameplay, is now available for the PS5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The upgrade is available for free, &lt;a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/6dXzcvcwZCrzKLsv7yJZSC/quake-next-gen-update"&gt;according to Bethesda&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s no time limit to redeem it. The PC version of the game isn’t getting the upgrade, since it already supports 4K / 120fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WyM6z4"&gt;As well as the framerate improvements, the upgrade also adds support for the PS5 Dualsense controller’s adaptive triggers and integrated speaker. Meanwhile, Xbox players get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/4/12092820/xbox-play-anywhere-launches-on-september-13th"&gt;Play Anywhere support&lt;/a&gt;, a Microsoft technology that means ownership of the game and progress automatically carries over to its PC version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAHuof"&gt;The upgrade process is a little different for the PlayStation and Xbox. Xbox owners should see the upgrade installed automatically thanks to Microsoft’s Smart Delivery system, and any existing saves should carry over. Meanwhile, on PS5, players will need to download the upgraded game via the game’s hub or PlayStation Store, and Bethesda provides instructions for how to do so &lt;a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/6dXzcvcwZCrzKLsv7yJZSC/quake-next-gen-update"&gt;over on its blog&lt;/a&gt;. PS4 saves cannot transfer to the PS5 version of the game, Bethesda says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAkxcM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bowers &amp; Wilkins updates iconic Zeppelin speaker with Alexa and AirPlay 2  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GjLnGM7aHEIUDQOGPpRmkFy1Lik=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69987638/1x1_Zeppelin_Midnight_Grey_Lifestyle_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New streaming tech, old Zeppelin shape.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6rTqck"&gt;Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins has announced a new Zeppelin speaker that updates the eye-catching design with modern connectivity and smarts. The new speaker supports wireless standards like Qualcomm’s AptX Adaptive and Apple’s AirPlay 2 and also has Alexa built-in for voice control of your music. The new Zeppelin is available to order in light or dark grey starting today and is priced at $799 / £699 / €799. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvcX5f"&gt;The original Zeppelin was one of the most iconic iPod docks available when it launched in 2007, and it’s been updated several times over the years as the way we listen to music has changed. 2011’s Zeppelin Air added support for Apple’s AirPlay standard alongside its existing 30-pin dock, while the 2015 Zeppelin Wireless dropped the dock entirely to focus on wireless connectivity using standards like AptX Bluetooth or Spotify Connect (although it kept a 3.5mm input around as a wired option).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Pb9gxIgNVyY9sltr50gASk6wKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22920583/High__Zeppelin_Midnight_Grey_Connector_Panel_Detail_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are no wired inputs for music sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qqo6Gv"&gt;With the new 2021 Zeppelin, however, B&amp;amp;W has gone fully wireless. Around its back, there’s a socket for power and a USB-C port, but the latter is only there for servicing rather than connecting a music source. Instead, the Zeppelin supports a full suite of wireless standards, including AAC, SBC, and AptX Adaptive Bluetooth codecs (but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652655/qualcomm-aptx-lossless-announced-snapdragon-sound"&gt;no AptX Lossless&lt;/a&gt;), AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect, and B&amp;amp;W’s own Music app, which offers support for streaming services like Deezer, Qobuz, and Tidal. There’s no Chromecast support built-in, nor is Google Assistant available alongside Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="86DpVQ"&gt;If you’d like to use the Zeppelin as part of a multi-room setup, then B&amp;amp;W says it plans to add support early next year. When it’s released, the feature will let users pair multiple Zeppelins together with B&amp;amp;W’s existing line of connected Formation speakers together. Alternatively, if you’re on iOS, you should be able to achieve a similar setup thanks to Zeppelin’s support for AirPlay 2. Just don’t expect to be able to pair two Zeppelins together as a stereo pair; B&amp;amp;W says the multi-room functionality is designed for each Zeppelin to offer stereo sound by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mfn10sKpX_uAiUF6nGTqP6W5yXc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22920591/High__Zeppelin_Midnight_Grey_Drive_Units_White_Background.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two tweeters, two mid-range drivers, and a subwoofer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6KtUUE"&gt;Internally, the new Zeppelin has a pair of one-inch tweeters, two 3.5-inch mid-range drivers, and a single six-inch subwoofer powered by a total of 240W of amplification. Although there’s no remote like with previous Zeppelins, there’s a set of physical playback controls on the rear of the speaker (but there’s no physical off switch for Alexa).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNcX1B"&gt;In the era of iPod docks, the Zeppelin was one of the most desirable all-in-one speakers on the market. But in the years since, it feels like Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins has lost ground to the likes of Sonos and Amazon as multi-room audio and smart speakers have taken over, respectively. With the new Zeppelin, I’m sure the company is hoping to reverse that trend.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fujifilm launches wide-format version of its Instax Link mobile printer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LXIiqJx510J9TuIq3nNcLNa3s2A=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69987616/large_210520_instax_LINK_WIDE_AshWhite_Sketch_Edit_Print_291_Stack_retouch.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="buD3Fs"&gt;Fujifilm has announced a new mobile printer that uses its larger Instax Wide format film. The  Instax Link Wide Smartphone Printer is a similar idea to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397156/fujifilm-nintendo-instax-mini-link-app-collaboration"&gt;the existing Instax Mini Link&lt;/a&gt;: hook up your phone over Bluetooth and use an app to edit and print your own Polaroid-style snapshots from your camera roll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjwxcZ"&gt;Instax Wide film is much bigger than Instax Mini — it’s about the size of two credit cards side by side. That means your Link Wide printouts might not be as easy to carry in a wallet as Instax Mini photos, but they should be a lot more viewable and usable for other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLGrj5"&gt;The Link Wide printer is also compatible with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21517015/fujifilm-x-s10-camera-vlogging-price-specs-features"&gt;Fujifilm’s X-S10 mirrorless camera&lt;/a&gt; from last year, allowing you to print directly without a phone. Of course, you can print photos taken with other cameras by uploading them to your phone and then to the Instax Link app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MDCYzR6ovu3ZcTyLllVelfqs2Bs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923253/linkwide.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Instax Link Wide’s Rich and Natural color modes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JT07t2"&gt;Fujifilm says the Link Wide printer should be good for about 100 Instax prints on a battery charge. There are two printing modes, Rich and Natural, that let you choose between “bright and immersive or saturated and classic” color output, as well as the ability to edit images in the app by cropping or adding text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dW8mZC"&gt;Fujifilm will release the Instax Link Wide Smartphone Printer late this month for $149.95. The company is also introducing a new black-bordered variant of Instax Wide film, which will sell for $21.99 for a pack of 10.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some of Verizon’s Visible cell network customers say they’ve been hacked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JYy2soK3rXiuStajsstFeIuJ5qg=/331x0:1081x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69987158/1500x500.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Visible&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8JPEpQ"&gt;Some customers of Verizon’s Visible service are using social media to say that hackers have accessed their accounts, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Visible/comments/q6y73u/im_seriously_disappointed_with_visible_today/"&gt;changed their information&lt;/a&gt; to lock them out, and in some cases &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Visible/comments/q6o4q4/yes_i_was_hacked_as_well_im_making_this_as_public/"&gt;even ordered phones&lt;/a&gt; using their payment info (&lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/verizon-owned-visible-network-suffers-suspected-data-breach/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you’re not familiar, Visible is a cell service &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/what-visible" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;owned and operated by Verizon&lt;/a&gt; that pitches itself as a less expensive, “all-digital” network, meaning there aren’t any physical stores like you’d get with a traditional carrier. Starting on Monday, customers on both Twitter and Reddit reported en masse that they’d been getting emails from the company about changed passwords and addresses, and that they’ve &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dao0815/status/1448026781332623360?s=20"&gt;had difficulties contacting the company’s chat support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYw5nt"&gt;Visible’s customer service account on Twitter seemingly hasn’t addressed the issue, besides &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/visiblecare/status/1448040220318961665?s=20"&gt;directing upset customers to its DMs&lt;/a&gt;. A user marked as a Visible employee on the subreddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Visible/comments/q65cdl/security_update/"&gt;posted a statement on Monday&lt;/a&gt; afternoon, saying that a “small number” of accounts were affected, but that the company didn’t believe its systems had been breached. The statement did recommend that users change their passwords, but as many commenters pointed out (and as I can confirm), the password reset system currently isn’t working. Verizon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yX8ZQb"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="D0Ho6e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I haven’t received any emails or texts from the company about the situation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9aXBLc"&gt;I’m a Visible customer myself (I switched from T-Mobile for reasons unrelated to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633853/tmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc"&gt;its recent massive data breach&lt;/a&gt;, but am &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; thrilled to possibly have been double-owned) and so far my account doesn’t seem to be compromised. I’m able to log in online and make sure my order history doesn’t have anything untoward, and opening the app is working like normal (though I received a few errors earlier in the day). I haven’t received any emails, texts, or other communications from the company regarding this situation. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sj6f0YP8i1FoTvugJ7E9tmVjifQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22922737/IMG_2881.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The error message I received earlier trying to log into the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p id="ofVyAc"&gt;Without much official word from the company, it’s hard to say exactly how the reported breaches happened, and what any potential hackers have access to — though we’ll keep you updated if we hear back. With many security breaches, the advice is to change your password and make sure you have two-factor authentication turned on, but Visible &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Visible/comments/q53nk9/lack_of_2fa_on_visisble/"&gt;currently doesn’t support 2FA&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully, incidents like this where some customers are seeing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Buttered_Pecans/status/1447413221057462275?s=20"&gt;$1,000-plus charges&lt;/a&gt; on their credit cards from Visible may make that feature a higher priority.&lt;/p&gt;
