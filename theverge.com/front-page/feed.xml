    <title>Project CHIP will finally ship later this year</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x162Ri"&gt;Project Connected Home over IP (CHIP), the awkwardly-named-but-interesting smart home partnership between Apple, Amazon, Google, and over 170 other companies that’s supposed to make everything more compatible should finally start showing some results later this year. According to &lt;a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/news_and_articles/future-of-iot-is-now/"&gt;a webinar hosted by the Zigbee Alliance earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, companies participating in the program will be able to get smart home devices certified for the standard by late 2021, which means we might see some things on shelves for the holiday shopping season. That first wave of devices will include things like lighting, blinds, HVAC controls, TVs, door locks, garage door openers, security systems, and Wi-Fi routers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCuST9"&gt;The CHIP standard is built around three technologies: Bluetooth LE for setup, WiFi for high-bandwidth use cases, like streaming video from a security camera, and the still-nascent Thread mesh network protocol for low-bandwidth devices such as motion sensors. (Thread has been a work in progress for a while, but it’s now on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;Apple HomePod Mini&lt;/a&gt;, the newest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22193059/eero-pro-6-review-mesh-router-wifi-6-test-speeds-network"&gt;Eero routers&lt;/a&gt;, so maybe it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22310378/eve-smart-home-thread-plug-home-kit-weather-station-price-specs-features"&gt;finally going to happen&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FN5qtk"&gt;Manufacturers will be able to bring CHIP support to older products through bridges, as well, so there’s a chance that devices you already own might work with CHIP products in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ObgNCA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first CHIP certified devices could be available by the holidays&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jU3Q7m"&gt;The program, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21027890/apple-google-amazon-smart-home-standard-zigbee-connected-ip-project"&gt;first announced back at the end of 2019&lt;/a&gt;, has had some delays due to the pandemic. It was originally supposed to have products within the CHIP standard by the end of 2020, but then the group &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427139/amazon-apple-google-zigbee-alliance-open-source-smart-home-standard-2021-launch"&gt;announced last September&lt;/a&gt; that we wouldn’t see anything until sometime in 2021. That time apparently is the &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; of 2021, so it’s very possible this launch could slip even further into 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeWmSm"&gt;The goal of CHIP is to offer a unified standard for smart home products so that customers don’t have to worry if a device they buy will work with the other devices they already own. Its technologies replace older smart home protocols such as Zigbee and Z-Wave and are designed to work with whatever voice assistant you prefer. Of course, a new standard &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/927/"&gt;isn’t a guarantee to solve any confusion&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s very possible that the CHIP program will just add yet another option to the list of standards already out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJQ37K"&gt;Stacey Higgenbotham at &lt;em&gt;Stacey On IOT&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://staceyoniot.com/project-chip-embraces-a-timeline-and-the-blockchain/"&gt;has a deep dive on all the announcements&lt;/a&gt; made by the Zigbee Alliance this week, including how it plans to improve smart home security through... the blockchain, so I suggest reading her analysis for more on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Apple’s ‘Spring Loaded’ event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gI7IK3nwguOVMw1RNdWJEfYaVTk=/0x0:1770x1180/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69136145/appleinvite.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qIR5T4"&gt;Apple has officially announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22310826/apple-april-20th-event-date-rumors-ipad-pro-macbook-tv-airtags"&gt;“Spring Loaded” event&lt;/a&gt; for April 20th, its first major product announcement of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fs5b1a"&gt;Unlike a lot of Apple’s events, its spring events tend to be a bit more scattershot: one year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;might see high-end iPads&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/27/17155688/apple-event-2018-news-highlights-recap-ipad-education"&gt;another a more education-focused event&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18277461/apple-event-2019-tv-plus-arcade-credit-card-streaming-news-oprah-recap-biggest-announcements"&gt;launch of a comprehensive service strategy&lt;/a&gt;. This year, rumors are pointing to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336917/apple-new-ipad-pros-mini-base-april"&gt;refreshed iPad Pro lineup&lt;/a&gt;, potentially with Apple’s first Mini LED panels — which would bring a big jump forward for the company’s tablet displays. But we could also see new AirPods, the company’s long-rumored AirTag trackers, a new iPad Mini, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6r3aba"&gt;The proceeding should kick off at 1PM ET on Tuesday, but if you’re looking for an early preview, here’s what you can probably expect to show up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HOEop9"&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JxMxJQ"&gt;It’s been over a year since Apple’s last refresh of the iPad Pro, and the 2020 model — a fairly iterative update to the 2019 version — is starting to get a little long in the tooth, especially compared to the beefed-up specs on Apple’s latest iPhones and M1 Macs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGQQFx"&gt;Like last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336917/apple-new-ipad-pros-mini-base-april"&gt;Apple is expected&lt;/a&gt; to launch both 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models; but the larger iPad Pro is expected to make a big switch in screen technology to debut Apple’s first Mini LED display. Additional rumors indicate that supply of the Mini LED panels might be hard to come by, that stock of the larger model may be limited at launch, or that Apple might delay the release of the 12.9-inch version until availability is better.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zBZGKi"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sheds more light on what to expect, too: while the overall design of the two tablets is expected to stay largely the same as last year’s model, Apple is expected to swap out the A12Z chip for a newer processor that’s said to be on par with its more recent M1 chipset. The new iPads are also said to upgrade to a Thunderbolt port (with faster data speeds and a wider peripheral selection than the standard USB-C port) and feature upgraded cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lT9yk6"&gt;Apple could also potentially have a new Apple Pencil accessory in the works to go with the new iPad Pros. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/03/new-apple-pencil-design-rumor-image/"&gt;Images of a new, glossy version&lt;/a&gt; of the stylus have been circulating on Twitter, and the “spring forward” teaser could imply that Apple might offer a spring-loaded tip, similar to what &lt;a href="https://estore.wacom.com/en-US/stroke-pen-nibs-5-pack-for-intuos-4-5-us-ack20002.html"&gt;Wacom offers on its pens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="b9AGzS"&gt;AirTags&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OuBNThklNinnRQHDa5mQsEMF1OQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16318924/apple_tag.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/06/04/ios-13-tag-device/" target="_blank"&gt;Guilherme Rambo / 9to5Mac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w4SDSr"&gt;One of Apple’s worst-kept secrets in years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21205994/apple-airtags-name-confirmed-tile-tracker-rumor-leak"&gt;Apple’s Tile-like AirTags&lt;/a&gt; have been rumored to make an appearance at nearly every Apple event and announcement since early 2019. Said to be small, circular tags with Bluetooth and ultra-wideband radio chips, AirTags would rely on Apple’s existing Find My app and network of iPhones, iPads, and Macs to allow users to track and find missing objects (similar to how users can currently track lost phones). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPwHRX"&gt;AirTags would also potentially work with recent iPhone models’ U1 chip to allow for AR-based ultra-wideband tracking in local areas — something that Samsung has recently also began to offer with its Galaxy SmartTag Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPigxw"&gt;There have been references to AirTags (or Apple Tags) in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/30/20841204/ios13-code-apple-tile-location-tracking-tag-find-my-app"&gt;iOS code leaks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/18/21142249/apple-tags-iphone-kuo-location-tracking"&gt;endless rumors&lt;/a&gt;, and even in an official support video that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21205994/apple-airtags-name-confirmed-tile-tracker-rumor-leak"&gt;explicitly revealed the “AirTags” name&lt;/a&gt; as part of its offline finding feature last year. The only thing left is for Apple to officially announce them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Lz4zxj"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hi8fI0"&gt;Also long overdue for an update is Apple’s oft-neglected iPad Mini, which was last refreshed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;over two years ago in March 2019&lt;/a&gt;. (Given that &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; update came after a four-year drought for the iPad Mini, a refresh this year would actually be beating par.) The current model features the exact outdated design that Apple’s been using for nearly a decade, with an older A12 processor to boot, so there’s plenty of room for Apple to improve things, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQqFtD"&gt;Adding fuel to the fire is that both &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; and noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo have pointed at a larger iPad Mini (potentially with an 8.5-inch display, which could come from eliminating some of the chunky 2012-era bezels) for 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hXZT6d"&gt;AirPods 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wAOlyD"&gt;A third-generation version of Apple’s AirPods has been rumored for months, set to feature shorter stems and replaceable ear tips, similar to the current AirPods Pro design. The updated AirPods are also said to feature better battery life than their predecessors. Apple has also been rumored to be working on a refreshed AirPods Pro design that would eliminate the earbud stem entirely, but as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534123/apple-airpods-3-pro-2-2021-chip-design-battery-life-true-wireless-earbuds-headphones-homepod"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’&lt;/em&gt;s report&lt;/a&gt; notes, that redesign is further out — so they’re unlikely to make an appearance here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ADfaBj"&gt;Apple TV&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Avj54i8-cca5EZipGaQwJuZUvxQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9289303/akrales_170919_1976_0104.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cnc8SQ"&gt;The Apple TV 4K sits at a strange place in Apple’s lineup. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16341876/new-apple-tv-4k-review-2017"&gt;Released in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, it’s one of the oldest Apple products still being sold. At $180, its price has since been lapped by Roku, Amazon, and Google, all of which offer comparable 4K streaming boxes at a fraction of the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Qgrpg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost"&gt;Apple is rumored to be working&lt;/a&gt; on a refreshed model for 2021, which would add a faster processor and a new remote to replace the infamous Siri Remote. Support for HDMI 2.1 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22369056/apple-tv-2021-120hz-refresh-rate-support-4k-gaming-arcade"&gt;120Hz refresh rates&lt;/a&gt; could also be in the cards. But more than new features, the Apple TV 4K is in dire need of a price cut — something that Apple is historically more reticent to provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="xc2tHL"&gt;iOS 14.5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qWXCM9"&gt;Given the pace of both developer and public betas, it’s all but certain that Apple will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22267230/apple-ios-14-5-watchos-7-4-public-beta-unlock-iphone-apple-watch-mask"&gt;officially release iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt; either at or immediately following the event (especially if it has new iPad hardware). The new software promises to add the ability to more easily unlock an iPhone while wearing a mask through an Apple Watch, new emoji, and Apple’s highly debated App Tracking Transparency feature that has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;drawn particular ire from Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HjrMZ1"&gt;MacBooks and iMacs and Mac Pros (oh my!)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="n5xs2A"&gt;After the shockingly great debut of Apple’s first wave of Apple Silicon-powered computers last fall with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1 MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, Pro, and Mac Mini, all eyes are on Apple’s next steps in its ARM transition. The company is rumored to be working on plenty of new Macs as it looks to achieve its ambitious goal of switching fully from Intel’s chips within two years. That includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;more powerful MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt; that would ditch the Touch Bar, bring back MagSafe and additional ports, and feature an improved M-series chip. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233191/apple-silicon-redesigned-imac-mac-pro-rumor-features"&gt;A new iMac and a smaller Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; (also featuring M-series chips) are said to be in the works as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JT7aTR"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22320961/apple-wwdc-2021-event-date-software-updates-ios-ipados-macos"&gt;WWDC around the corner&lt;/a&gt;, though, it’s likely that we won’t hear more about new Mac hardware until then, especially if Apple is planning on debuting more developer and professional-friendly Apple Silicon-powered laptops and desktops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XyOxwb"&gt;Something surprising&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2WK14k"&gt;Of course, with Apple, you never quite know what to expect — which means that there’s always room for a surprise announcement or two at the Spring Loaded event that not even we saw coming. Could Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959066/apple-augmented-reality-ar-headset-glasses-rumors-reported-release-date"&gt;tease its long-rumored VR headset&lt;/a&gt;? A refreshed iPhone SE? A first look at the Apple Car? Whatever happens, stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;for all the details. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is finally realizing it has a labor problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XqTxX508CfcTJsJfLvIu5fUZDhE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69136127/acastro_210208_4402_amazonVote.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9l6LKx"&gt;Today, let’s talk about the new tone Jeff Bezos is taking when talking about Amazon — and whether we can expect it to have any practical effect on the company after he turns over the CEO job to his successor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"&gt;Andy Jassy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B90Zc6"&gt;A recurring theme in this column is Amazon’s general indifference to public perception. Last month, it picked &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/why-amazon-picked-a-fight-with-congress"&gt;a losing fight with Congress&lt;/a&gt; over the unionization efforts at its Bessemer, Alabama fulfillment center. A year ago, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; revealed that the company had &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015"&gt;lied to lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; about whether it used data from third-party sellers to inform product development. A couple years before that, it conducted&lt;a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton/issues/amazon-misreads-the-room-144903"&gt; a sham search for a second “headquarters”&lt;/a&gt; that angered politicians around the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2FUNW"&gt;The company has seen record growth every year since anyways, and it was&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21144680/verge-tech-survey-2020-trust-privacy-security-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt; the most-liked of all big tech companies&lt;/a&gt; even before the pandemic made people more depend on it. (Amazon picked up &lt;em&gt;50 million&lt;/em&gt; new Prime subscribers in 2020, an increase of about one-third in just 12 months.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmczhY"&gt;Given Amazon’s tendency to dismiss most criticism, you might have expected Bezos’ last letter to shareholders to resemble an extended victory lap. Certainly it would be warranted: Amazon is one of the most extraordinary businesses ever built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYtSTI"&gt;But that’s not really Bezos’ style. His religious devotion to “&lt;a href="http://businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-says-always-day-1-amazon-philosophy-2019-12"&gt;Day 1&lt;/a&gt;” — the idea that businesses ought to remain as paranoid and action-oriented as they were when they first born, lest they be defeated by entropy — precludes that sort of long walk into the sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLM9Wn"&gt;And so perhaps we should not be too surprised that he took labor issues at the company head on. Sure, Bezos has mentioned them before — his &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2019-letter-to-shareholders"&gt;letter last year&lt;/a&gt; also devoted many paragraphs to Amazon’s support for the $15 minimum wage, re-training workers, and so on — but I’m not sure he has ever confronted critics quite so directly. Bezos writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0s8sed"&gt;Does your Chair take comfort in the outcome of the recent union vote in Bessemer? No, he doesn’t. I think we need to do a better job for our employees. While the voting results were lopsided and our direct relationship with employees is strong, it’s clear to me that we need a better &lt;em&gt;vision&lt;/em&gt; for how we create value for employees – a vision for their success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrFQld"&gt;If you read some of the news reports, you might think we have no care for employees. In those reports, our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That’s not accurate. They’re sophisticated and thoughtful people who have options for where to work. When we survey fulfillment center employees, 94% say they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="v20WKm"&gt;Bezos knows that there will be more efforts to unionize in Amazon fulfillment centers, and future ones might not be quite so easy to defeat. And so he sets two enormous goals for the Amazon of the future. The company should be “Earth’s Best Employer,” he writes, and “Earth’s Safest Place to Work.” And he plans to work on these projects personally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="d0e6Kt"&gt;In my upcoming role as Executive Chair, I’m going to focus on new initiatives. I’m an inventor. It’s what I enjoy the most and what I do best. It’s where I create the most value. I’m excited to work alongside the large team of passionate people we have in Ops and help invent in this arena of Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work. On the details, we at Amazon are always flexible, but on matters of vision we are stubborn and relentless. We have never failed when we set our minds to something, and we’re not going to fail at this either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yrAeGg"&gt;Is it just me, or does this sound like a man who has at long last gotten the message?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuzHtE"&gt;It has taken long enough. Pushback on the company’s claims of being a friend to the working man has come from all corners, from Republican Sen. Marco Rubio to Democrats like President Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. And despite Bezos’ note that 94 percent of employees say they would recommend Amazon as a good place to work, it’s the company’s own workers who keep bringing disturbing information about their job sites to light. (I’m &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; trying to unsee &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles"&gt;the photos of pee bottles&lt;/a&gt; that workers used in the absence of bathroom breaks that they submitted to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPFz8M"&gt;Over the past year, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/fired-interrogated-disciplined-amazon-warehouse-organizers-allege-year-retaliation-n1262367"&gt;workers have filed at least 37 complaints&lt;/a&gt; to the National Labor Relations Board alleging interference with workers’ right to organize, more than triple the total in the previous year. Amazon&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/02/amazon-union-warehouse-workers/"&gt; mounted an anti-union campaign&lt;/a&gt; that included, among other things, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/technology/amazon-control-bathroom-breaks.html"&gt;firing organizers on flimsy pretexts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5sptx"&gt;If workers were as happy at Amazon as Bezos says they are, you wonder why all of that was necessary. And maybe — finally — he does, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54BjuF"&gt;There are technological ways of improving Amazon as a workplace, he says. The company can rotate workers who perform repetitive tasks to lessen the strain on their bodies, for example, using “sophisticated algorithms.” It will spend $66 million “to create technology that will help prevent collisions of forklifts.” It will invent more things like this under Bezos in his new role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0MlSR9"&gt;No tech giant deserves much credit for announcing a simple intention to do better. Amazon’s business requires punishing physical labor, along with ruthlessly seeking new efficiencies that chip away at workers’ dignity. The company is also leading the way in the use of automation technologies that will make those same workers’ jobs ever more precarious. It’s hard to even imagine how such a system could come to be seen as “Earth’s Best Employer,” no matter how good Amazon’s forklift management software someday becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQVsAe"&gt;But part of the unusual power that founder-led tech giants have is the way their creators can marshal internal goodwill, along with their limitless finances, to make investments that others won’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmGKsn"&gt;Bezos’ promise to become “Earth’s Best Employer” is on some level insane, because it immediately becomes a cudgel with which lawmakers, the press, and the public can beat Amazon every time another labor issue is discovered. (I predict “Earth’s Best Employer” will become to Amazon what “don’t be evil” became for Google, or “move fast and break things” became for Facebook: a mission statement that ultimately became more useful to critics than it did to the company itself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xB8IF7"&gt;The thing is, though, that Bezos is smart. Like, world-historically smart. He knows that he is setting the bar far above where it sits today, and he knows that he is going to be held accountable to it. Bezos’ version of the world’s best employer likely looks a lot different than mine, but I also imagine that it could lead to higher wages, safer working conditions, and better job training programs, at least for the workers who aren’t replaced by robots. Hopefully it will lead to less union-busting and bottle-peeing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXxCib"&gt;In the days after the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal, Facebook executives looked as tone deaf as Amazon has lately in response to its labor issues. Eventually, though, they realized their tone had to change — and their business practices had to as well. We can argue about how effective the 30,000 people hired to shore up the platform’s security have been, but it’s undeniable that Facebook transformed its approach to integrity between late 2016 and today. And it all started with a belated acknowledgement that the company had a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qPJeu"&gt;Maybe the cursed @AmazonNews account will snipe at another member of Congress tomorrow in the coming days, and all of the above will seem moot. Or maybe Amazon has truly internalized that the time has come to shut up and listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bPtYl"&gt;For now, it sure seems like Jeff Bezos is. And I can’t say I saw that one coming.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The lowest you can grab a pair right now is for $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.staples.com/apple-airpods-pro-mwp22am-a-in-the-ear-bluetooth-headset-white/product_24422954?storeId=10001&amp;amp;AID=10921729&amp;amp;PID=4485850&amp;amp;SID=fa73db569d2011eb83a05281c35caba30INT&amp;amp;cvosrc=affiliate.cj.4485850&amp;amp;cvo_campaign=Coupon&amp;amp;cm_mmc=CJ-_-4485850-_-4485850-_-10921729&amp;amp;CID=AFF%3A4485850%3A4485850%3A10921729&amp;amp;CJPIXEL=CJPIXEL&amp;amp;cjevent=faa926699d2011eb824c01890a82b82a&amp;amp;dclid=CO2H2dLk_e8CFcmnnwod0Y4CCQ&amp;amp;userEnv=&amp;amp;tenantId=StaplesDotCom&amp;amp;locale=en-US&amp;amp;zipCode=21638&amp;amp;channel=WEB&amp;amp;encode=" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$199 at Staples&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This week’s best tech deals this week include AirPods Pro, Echo Show 10, and a gaming monitor</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0NI61y"&gt;Some weeks aren’t so great on the tech deals front. Thankfully, this hasn’t been one of those weeks. Each day, our deals roundups have been full of fresh discounts, like the best-ever price on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M1N8522?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s new Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt; smart display that can rotate to follow your movements around the room or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1621994-REG%2Flg_27gn800_b_27_qhd_ips_hdr10.html%23donotlink&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F4%2F16%2F22385758%2Famazon-echo-show-10-lg-27-inch-qhd-gaming-monitor-airpods-pro-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 off a 27-inch 1440p gaming monitor&lt;/a&gt; from LG. There are a few other deals to look through below, and they’re all good, so I won’t waste much more of your time. But in case you’re looking for a Mother’s Day gift, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22358371/mothers-day-gifts-ideas-best-mom-tech-gadgets"&gt;our gift guide&lt;/a&gt; (which is gorgeous, might I say) is full of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Dn5i0D"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3RCyyd"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro are $197&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QAn0mg"&gt;Apple’s top-shelf wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are down to $197 at Amazon and Walmart, over $50 less than the MSRP and about $20 less than typical pricing. Apple is expected to refresh its non-Pro AirPods very soon, but if you’re looking for noise canceling, you’ll want to go with the Pro model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gvr4jS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="MaHW9K"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AC3jNK"&gt;LG’s 27-inch 1440p gaming monitor is a great value for $297&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LNyXqe"&gt;Normally around $400, LG’s UltraGear 27-inch gaming monitor that has 1440p resolution, G-Sync compatibility, and a 144Hz refresh rate is just over $100 off its usual price at Amazon and B&amp;amp;H Photo. If you have a gaming PC or console and want to step up to QHD, this monitor should be a good fit for you — and it costs far less than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kkT74u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10429642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="7tU1nD"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jes7o0"&gt;Amazon’s latest Echo Show 10 smart display is $50 off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DJVgFW"&gt;You can get the best-ever price on Amazon’s new Echo Show 10. What’s special about this one compared to previous generations is its motorized base, which allows its screen to rotate and follow your movements to stay in view. If you buy it through Amazon, you can get a free Ring smart bulb with the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9QLwoh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10362085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Why I left</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vkd7p5"&gt;I’m really serious about quitting Twitter this time, I promise. I deactivated my account on March 15th and declared the event to my friends in Slack. They earnestly congratulated me. They’re all still on Twitter, but they all know how exhausting and distressing it can be. Now that I’m gone, their new joke on Twitter is that I “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1382835258714955779"&gt;don’t exist&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tSr52o"&gt;It’s not the first time I haven’t existed, and sure as death and taxes, it won’t be the last. But my nonexistence on Twitter didn’t stick right away. When I first quit on the 15th, I came back three days later because I decided that I wanted to tweet about a new project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izeasF"&gt;Then I got owned by my friends, and I deserved it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JQekaM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;welcome back to twitter btw&lt;/p&gt;— Casey Newton (@CaseyNewton) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1372609151277232128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="edM1TI"&gt;It doesn’t feel good to quit something over and over again — especially when everyone knows you’re coming back. When I deactivated my account again &lt;em&gt;for real &lt;/em&gt;on March 25th, my friend Casey Newton wasn’t buying it: “writing about people deleting Twitter should be like reporting a missing person to police. You have to wait at least a day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SXJpa"&gt;And so I returned to Slack to declare, once again, that I had quit Twitter. But now I’m subject to a real financial penalty. I’ve agreed to pay Casey $1,000 if I reactivate my Twitter account, and I &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;don’t want to cut that check. It’s an absurd amount of money. Fortunately, I can’t think of a single tweet that would be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUW9MX"&gt;I know this sounds like a stunt or a joke, but it’s not. Hours after I deactivated my account and put a bounty on it, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350049/twitter-chrissy-teigen-quits-abuse-harassment"&gt;Chrissy Teigen announced&lt;/a&gt; she, too, would be leaving Twitter. When I saw her goodbye letter it felt like it was in my own handwriting. “This no longer serves me as positively as it serves me negatively, and I think that’s the right time to call something,” she wrote. “...one thing I haven’t learned is how to block out the negativity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cp6E7y"&gt;That’s not to say my experience on Twitter was anything like Chrissy’s. Twitter works differently when you have millions of followers and an endless eruption of mentions and replies. (Even rarer: her tweets often generated coverage from reporters and created entire news cycles.) And like other women on the internet, she received years of public abuse simply for being herself — except at a scale few people will ever experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8la4r"&gt;But everyone is &lt;em&gt;exposed &lt;/em&gt;to the online abuse of others at scale, even if they are not targeted by it. And that means Twitter is a horror show for people who feel real anxiety just from witnessing anger and cruelty. I’ve directly received plenty of abuse and threats through Twitter over the years because of my work, but the stuff that actually sticks with me is what I see happening to others. Whether it’s learning too much about the sacrificial character of the day, or falling down a thread of abusive replies to a random tweet, it’s difficult to avoid “negativity” on a platform that seems designed to reward it. Even the intermittent rewards that Twitter does provide — Llamas on the loose! Small boulder the size of a big boulder! — are at risk of&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22350677/cinnamon-toast-crunch-shrimp-tail-milkshake-duck-jensen-karp-topanga"&gt; becoming their own nightmares&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxcz3q"&gt;Making a change when you’ve been worn down for so long can feel more like something that’s already happened instead of a clear moment in time that separates past and future. I’m worn down, and that makes quitting Twitter feel a lot easier. (Well, that, and theoretically owing Casey a thousand bucks.) But the stress from Twitter’s toxicity is not the only reason I’m leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="55kDqQ"&gt;There’s a deeper problem that comes with using a tool for more than a decade — the way it shapes how you experience the world. How it makes you form words and sentences to fit certain kinds of boxes. How it makes you feel compelled to fill those boxes, and why. How these things alter the rhythm of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKYHEc"&gt;I’ve never liked the moral panic around “internet addiction,” but there is something resonant about the metaphor. (Let’s just leave aside stuff like the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/30/12715848/new-york-post-internet-texting-addiction-irresponsible-hysteria"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;calling screens “digital heroin”&lt;/a&gt;.) The little voice I once had in my head telling me to smoke cigarettes actually never sounded much different from the little voice telling me to tweet. I will let other people figure out the mechanisms behind that — all I need to know is that, for a time, I heard and I listened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMubtv"&gt;When those little voices go away, you find how much room there is for other kinds of thinking — in different shapes of time and color and texture. In 2014 I permanently quit Facebook after a few failed attempts. It didn’t take long to stop seeing things in my head that were Facebook-shaped. I found other places on the internet to enjoy and other ways to communicate with people. Just because Facebook and Twitter are free doesn’t mean you have to let them live rent-free in your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7zenT"&gt;This past weekend, a thought passed through my mind in the shape of a tweet, and I felt the urge to tweet it. But I couldn’t, so I didn’t. And as the thought drifted away from me, I felt lighter. It wasn’t put on a permanent record. I didn’t stop to watch my phone and see if anyone else would acknowledge it. I let it go, closed my eyes, and felt the sun on my face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SocIfQ"&gt;The birds in my backyard tweeted approvingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="k8zF7y"&gt;
&lt;p id="NgmMrE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 16th, 8:53 AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; 40 minutes after this story was published, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/1383037968072384517"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrissy Teigen rejoined Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. I wish her the best.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to celebrate Earth Day 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Earth" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OozVLmUOe7lHQnZ6AK-ktjzpbJ4=/51x0:1049x665/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69135860/earth.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xiTnsQ"&gt;Let’s face it, it’s been a long and hard year for the denizens of our planet since Earth Day’s 50th anniversary in 2020. However, it’s possible that things are looking up somewhat. Although the COVID-19 pandemic is still raging in many parts of the world, we do have vaccines that may eventually get us past this. And in the meantime, the Biden administration in DC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375827/white-house-biden-budget-request-100-million-air-quality-monitor"&gt;is putting environmental programs in place&lt;/a&gt; that may get the US back on track. So perhaps it’s worth doing a little partying (and educating) on behalf of this year’s annual celebration of the environmental movement, which is set for April 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kYWwy"&gt;Once again, most Earth Day celebrations will be virtual. What follows is a sampling of some that you can attend. For a more complete list, or to find Earth Day celebrations in your area, you can &lt;a href="https://earthday.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/8d15cc3da12d4338a109c7d64c97c02a"&gt;use Earthday.org’s online tool&lt;/a&gt; for both online and on-site events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OrXJWS"&gt;Earth Day Live: Restore Our Earth&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Earth Day Live: Restore Our Earth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G8QW6v9NDXzAPuCqgHRYw78zARY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444064/earth_day_2021.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Earthday.org&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earth Day Live: Restore Our Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d5NL8Q"&gt;Earthday.org’s second annual “&lt;a href="https://www.earthday.org/earth-day-2021/"&gt;Earth Day Live: Restore Our Earth&lt;/a&gt;” online live stream event will be broadcast on April 22nd beginning at noon, parallel to the Biden administration’s global climate summit (see below). It will feature a variety of celebrities, politicians, and activists from many fields. It will be preceded by two events: on April 20th, there will be a global youth summit, and on April 21st, a global education summit. To take part, &lt;a href="https://www.earthday.org/earth-day-2021/"&gt;visit Earthday.org&lt;/a&gt; on the day of the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="d0a4eY"&gt;Leaders Summit on Climate&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Leaders Summit on Climate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CK9POWpOWKMDlBfZR167D915AWA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444074/leaders_summit_on_climate.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaders Summit on Climate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cnjXXK"&gt;President Biden has invited 40 world leaders to a &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/leaders-summit-on-climate/"&gt;Leaders Summit on Climate&lt;/a&gt; which will take place April 22nd and 23rd. On the agenda are weighty questions, including how to reduce emissions, achieve net-zero (offsetting or reducing carbon dioxide emissions), and protect populations from climate change. You’ll be able to watch via a live stream link which will be available closer to the date of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cXPtVd"&gt;American Climate Leadership Summit (ACLS 2021)&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="American Climate Leadership Summit " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aB6u8wc6Pps7TkoQsIHgbUYYFKs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444080/ACLS.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Climate Leadership Summit &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8IMN0w"&gt;Another alternative to the Leaders Summit on Climate is the &lt;a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/ed5af75f-48ab-434f-8666-2d1854f7789c/summary"&gt;American Climate Leadership Summit&lt;/a&gt;, an online gathering of environmental activists happening April 27th - 29th. Sessions will offer information on the current status of climate change, strategies for activism, and other topics. It costs $25 to attend a single forum, $50 to attend the main session and a single forum, and $75 for access to the entire program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="P9PVFn"&gt;Join a virtual march and rally&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SC1.5NCE NOT SILENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cbXshH"&gt;Two organizations, &lt;a href="http://www.earthdayinitiative.org/"&gt;Earth Day Initiative (EDI)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://marchforsciencenyc.com/"&gt;March for Science NYC&lt;/a&gt;, are collaborating to offer a series of online events culminating in a virtual march and rally using an online gaming platform. On Sunday, April 18th, from noon to 8PM ET, there will be an online event with speakers and presentations from politicians, artists, and activists such as Elizabeth Warren, Kyra Sedgwick, Rosdely Ciprian, and Marc Yaggi, exploring a variety of environmental issues.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GaFom"&gt;On Monday, April 19th, the virtual march and rally, called “SC1.5NCE NOT SILENCE,” will take place in a 1990s-like virtual reality space created by &lt;a href="https://www.futuremeetspresent.com/"&gt;Future Meets Present&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gather.town/"&gt;Gather&lt;/a&gt;. Through an avatar, you will be able to visit booths, speak to exhibitors and other attendees, and, at 3PM ET, take part in a march and rally organized by March for Science NYC and &lt;a href="https://fridaysforfuture.org/"&gt;Fridays for Future&lt;/a&gt; (the movement co-founded by Greta Thunberg).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga5lzp"&gt; You can attend by sending &lt;a href="http://www.earthdayinitiative.org/2021-events"&gt;an RSVP via the EDI site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PX5TwU"&gt;If you’re a runner or a walker, &lt;a href="https://secure.qgiv.com/event/2021weact5k/"&gt;WE ACT for Environmental Justice&lt;/a&gt; is holding a virtual 5K race, where participants will be encouraged to walk or run 5K during the week of Earth Day, April 17th through April 25th. So even if your normal exercise regime is a half-mile stroll, you can still take part. You can use the race to raise money for WE ACT — or not — but all registered participants are asked to donate either a set amount or an amount of their own choosing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSI Stealth 15M review: thin doesn’t always win</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A supremely lightweight 15.6-inch gaming laptop that puts form slightly too far ahead of function&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="80PAtr"&gt;MSI’s Stealth 15M is a gaming laptop for people who’d prefer to keep their gaming habit a secret. The metal design looks striking, and, aside from the single-zone RGB backlit keyboard, there isn’t much else about the 15M that’ll give away what you’re probably using it for — aside from its loud fans. Unless you’re running the simplest tasks on battery saver mode, its fans are almost always audibly whirring, and the whining only gets louder with demanding applications and games. You might not notice it if you wear headphones or a headset most of the time, but others around you probably will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LklO9o"&gt;It can be noisy because it’s always warm and trying to keep cool. A thin laptop crammed with powerful components can lead to higher temperatures, especially during gaming. It has an aluminum chassis that helps to diffuse some of that heat, but it still can become uncomfortably warm to touch at times, despite its fans’ best (and loudest) efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bbu8cI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10447863"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iiP6vQ"&gt;If &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;MSI’s GS66 Stealth&lt;/a&gt; is going for the jugular of Razer’s high-end Blade 15 Advanced, the Stealth 15M aims to take on the more affordable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315386/razer-blade-15-base-2021-review-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-3070-qhd-screen-performance"&gt;Razer Blade 15 Base&lt;/a&gt; model that I recently reviewed. And it’s the closest that MSI has come to meeting Razer where it excels with build quality, design, and port selection. Unlike the GS66, the 15M has a more cohesive-feeling build that doesn’t make me question its durability over time, and it is shockingly thin for a gaming laptop. Yet, for as much as I complained that Razer’s unibody design needs a shake-up, its $1,699 option simply offers more for your money. You’ll get more ports (including an HDMI 2.1 port for 4K output at up to 120 frames per second), a larger trackpad, user-upgradeable RAM and storage, and more power allocated to its RTX 3060 than you’ll get in MSI’s similarly priced Stealth 15M. The Blade 15 Base is almost a full pound heavier and a few millimeters thicker. But I wouldn’t let those traits alone stand in my way if I was getting ready to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI Stealth 15M" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LmMIkzTr-LXQ_Hynv436P5gJ_GY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430771/cfaulkner_20210405_4508_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stealth 15M comes in this “carbon gray” colorway or white.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI Stealth 15M" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EWj5x6X5hnFwgL8XJydSZ3EYsSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430772/cfaulkner_20210405_4508_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The grille is one of the few edgier parts of the design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="arIXqt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10447865"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kldsG1"&gt;But that’s not your only option in this price range. You’ll get great performance in a similar price range with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt; that has an Nvidia RTX 3070 and a QHD screen. But if you have the luxury of time to wait until early May, it’s worth seeing how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368010/dell-g15-amd-ryzen-edition-15-inch-gaming-laptop-release-date-price-specs"&gt;Dell’s $900 G15 Ryzen Edition with the RTX 3060 will fare&lt;/a&gt;. Dell’s option is bigger, thicker, and likely heavier (though Dell hasn’t shared the official weight) than any of these thin gaming laptops, but there’s a big upside: it’ll be just $900 for the starting configuration. Conversely, MSI’s laptop has more constraints on its power, yet those limitations help it look and feel like a high-end laptop that you can lug around more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqfWZY"&gt;For gaming alone, the Stealth 15M isn’t powerful enough to recommend to everyone. It can reach the ideal 60 frames per second threshold with some demanding titles that I threw at it, but it wasn’t particularly smooth until I made a few minor compromises to the visual quality. Likely because of the Stealth 15M’s thin design, MSI set the maximum power draw of the RTX 3060 inside of it to just 65W, which is almost &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;the lowest-possible power requirement the spec allows&lt;/a&gt;. (The slightly thicker Predator Triton 300 SE is at 75W, but the aforementioned G15 Ryzen Edition coming in May runs at 115W.) Performance will be good enough for some people, but unless you play older or less demanding games than the ones I tested below, you won’t take full advantage of the 144Hz refresh rate matte display that MSI put in this model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95nT3C"&gt;Running &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt; on the 15M with the 3060 yields around 57 frames per second with the graphics set to ultra settings. In another open-world game, &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll get around 68 frames per second with settings set to their maximum. For a test of the RTX 3060’s ray-tracing capabilities, &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; with DLSS and ray-tracing shadows set to ultra ran at 57 frames per second. Gaming pushes the 15M to the edge, as its loud fans indicate every step of the way. I didn’t notice any apparent bottlenecks in performance due to the heat, which is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ltvvjL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10447852"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G07l6t"&gt;If you’re comparing these numbers to some of our other reviews, you probably noticed how similarly this laptop performed to the likes of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22276367/asus-tuf-dash-f15-2021-intel-core-i7-nvidia-rtx-3070-review-gaming-laptop-specs-price"&gt;Asus TUF Dash F15&lt;/a&gt; that has an RTX 3070. That’s due to their similar clock speed and wattage requirements. It’s encouraging that the RTX 3060 can keep up, but I’m skeptical that it’ll be able to maintain pace over the next few years, as games become even more graphically demanding to run. Even if some RTX 3070 and 3080 chips run at similar clock speeds and similar wattages as an RTX 3060 right now, they’ll always have more CUDA cores and VRAM to spare, which should give them a sturdier backbone to weather next-gen games in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbZUEQ"&gt;This high-end configuration (which MSI says is available at Costco) comes with the quad-core Intel Core i7-11375H processor and Nvidia’s RTX 3060, just like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22347032/acer-predator-triton-300-se-review-price-features-specs"&gt;Acer’s 14-inch Predator Triton 300 SE&lt;/a&gt;. The big advantages internally, aside from its bigger 15.6-inch FHD screen, are its 32GB of RAM and 1TB of NVMe storage. It’s more than enough for handling basic tasks like browsing the web, and I didn’t catch it chugging with a myriad of Chrome tabs running. Doing other everyday tasks like hopping into a Zoom call, using Slack, and running Spotify worked as well as they should (and the speakers are better than ones I’ve heard in most gaming laptops recently but are still not particularly great). All said, the moment-to-moment use of the Stealth 15M feels similarly speedy to that of other laptops in this price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI Stealth 15M" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AbxeT9itpD2q_cuXSLBO926jcdg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430777/cfaulkner_20210405_4508_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This isn’t the world’s biggest chin bezel, but it’s still somewhat of an eyesore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI Stealth 15M" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M2JLvhu87f1Ev2uTJUgHf6yIVk8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430773/cfaulkner_20210405_4508_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keys are big and nicely spaced out, though the layout might take some time to learn.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U6y6KK"&gt;Everything from games to videos look great on this matte display. It has generous viewing angles, thin bezels, and the colors look accurate. I wish its bottom chin wasn’t as thick. Perhaps MSI could have managed to fit in a 16:10 aspect ratio display, given how large it is. The webcam has an indicator light that flashes on and off endlessly when it’s active instead of just remaining lit, like most other laptops do. MSI says it intentionally designed it this way “to remind the user that the webcam is being used by the software (such as Zoom) that has the access to the webcam.” At least you’ll never accidentally forget that the camera is on, but it is annoying if you’re not the forgetful type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgCJNy"&gt;The keyboard layout might take some getting used to (every laptop seems to have a different idea of where to put the function key and how to arrange the volume and screen brightness keys), but the keys themselves are big and nicely spaced out, with a satisfying amount of key travel. The trackpad works well, but I would have liked to see MSI stick its almost comically large trackpad found in both the GS66 Stealth and Prestige 14 Evo in here. There’s room here, so why not? I would have also welcomed the fingerprint sensor built into the Prestige 14 Evo’s trackpad.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ui5jq4"&gt;The Stealth 15M won’t pass as the thin ultrabook that the Prestige 14 Evo is, but it’s still surprisingly thin for passing as a gaming laptop. The 15M is 16mm thick (its closest competition, the Razer Blade 15 Base, is about 19mm), and it weighs 3.7 pounds. This makes it one of the lightest 15.6-inch gaming laptops I’ve had the opportunity to test yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zOrGh"&gt;The selection of ports around the 15M includes one Thunderbolt 4 port with power delivery (PD) support for recharging other devices (but not the laptop itself) and another USB-C port that supports connecting to an external display. All configurations also include a UHS-III microSD card slot, two USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, one audio combo jack, and an HDMI 2.0 port with support for up 4K resolution at 60Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI Stealth 15M" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/euOufNiGyCL6q6ADMtglJaMN--w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430770/cfaulkner_20210405_4508_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the laptop’s right side, you’ll find a USB-C port with DisplayPort, a Thunderbolt 4 port, USB Type-A, and an HDMI 2.0 port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI Stealth 15M" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQdWL5IibBJXeFHK24BqL2IKm4g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430769/cfaulkner_20210405_4508_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The left side features a charging port, a microSD card slot, USB Type-A, and an audio combo jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nAthPz"&gt;As for longevity, the Stealth 15M’s three-cell 52Wh battery is good for a handful of hours with moderately intensive use. With one hour-long Zoom call tossed into the mix of some otherwise normal Chrome and Slack usage, it lasted about four and a half hours. If all you’re doing is typing, I could imagine it lasting for close to six. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O74xy8"&gt;MSI includes a slim 150W power brick that’s a little smaller in the length and width department than my Pixel 3, but it’s about as thick as three of them stacked. It’s considerably smaller than the bricks included with more powerful gaming laptops, but this one had no trouble keeping the 15M’s battery topped up while gaming. That can be a problem with some models, which sometimes come paired with a power adapter that can’t keep enough wattage going in to match what’s being spent by the hardware during gaming. Additionally, this 150W charger recharges the 15M quickly, taking just about an hour and fifteen minutes during my testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIBr1P"&gt;The Stealth 15M is a well-designed laptop without many glaring issues, but for the price of this configuration (and even the less costly ones, which are still fairly costly), you won’t be getting a ton of bang for your buck if you’re a gamer who wants great performance. MSI went with a thinner, more subtle design than some other gaming laptop designs, and that’s one of the best things about the Stealth 15M. But if you’re eager to spend this much on a gaming laptop, either spend a few hundred more to get one that has a QHD screen with a better GPU or wait until Dell’s more affordable G15 Ryzen Edition releases in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mcqJB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 7:40AM, April 16th, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; MSI confirmed that the flashing webcam light is not a bug, but intentional design. The review has been updated to reflect that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why does Amazon hate its most enthusiastic smart home fans? </title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blink’s cheap wireless cameras have seen better days.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;On the Blink&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="tg6d49"&gt;Blink, the Kickstarter success bought by Amazon in 2017, has long been synonymous with inexpensive battery-powered home video cameras that don’t require a monthly contract for cloud recordings. Open-source projects like &lt;a href="https://homebridge.io/"&gt;Homebridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/"&gt;Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://hoobs.org/"&gt;HOOBS&lt;/a&gt; have made the cameras even more extensible by allowing Blink’s temperature and motion sensors to work with smart home platforms like HomeKit and act as triggers for various automations. This combination of price and functionality led many smart home enthusiasts to buy Blink cameras in bulk for whole-home monitoring, especially those who don’t want to be beholden to a corporate overlord (and its requisite subscription fees). But instead of embracing its most passionate fans, Amazon has turned against them, threatening to terminate Blink accounts while challenging the very concept of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXEB61"&gt;To set the stage, I recently set up a Raspberry Pi running Homebridge with the goal of creating a single iPhone dashboard to tie my smart home together. I started automating my home about 12 years ago, long before you could buy into complete ecosystems from Amazon, Google, and Apple. Now it’s a devil’s brew of Z-Wave and Zigbee devices, some controllable with Siri, some with Alexa, and a few with Google Assistant. It’s held together with a smattering of IFTTT recipes and four disparate hubs from Ikea, Aqara, Philips Hue, and Vera. It works, kind of, but requires several different apps, many interfaces, and lots of patience, especially from my family. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A_yRo74edoTvcAxGgT5OS7R0Jq0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22440361/blink_garden_exposed.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homebridge turns this Blink XT outdoor camera into a temperature and motion trigger for other automations in Apple’s Home app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WVC13j"&gt;Over most of a weekend, I was able to configure Homebridge to link every one of my 50+ smart devices to HomeKit and each other in the Apple Home app. This allowed me to create rules that were previously impossible, like using the Blink XT camera’s motion sensor in my garden to trigger a Z-Wave siren and Hue lightbulbs at night. Nerdvana unlocked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LofxYN"&gt;My sense of delight and intense pride lasted exactly one week before my Blink cameras suddenly went dead. The reason was delivered in an email from Amazon the next morning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ph6qdh"&gt;“My name is Tori and I am with the Blink team. While doing a routine server audit, your account was flagged and subsequently disabled due to unsupported scripts or apps running on your system. The only automation that is permitted for use with the Blink system is through Alexa and/or IFTTT. Please disable these scripts or apps and reach back out to me so that I can re-enable your account.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cbeK1d"&gt;After a brief WTF exchange whereby I explained that Alexa and / or IFTTT are wholly inferior to the capabilities of Homebridge, Tori helpfully directed me to the exact paragraph of the Blink Terms of Service that I had violated. Terms which, admittedly, I was now reading for the first time (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5Vh6Nh"&gt;“We may terminate the Agreement or restrict, suspend, or terminate your use of Blink Services at our discretion without notice at any time, including if we determine that your use violates the Agreement, is improper, &lt;strong&gt;substantially exceeds or differs from normal use by other users&lt;/strong&gt;, or otherwise involves fraud or misuse of Blink Services or harms our interests or those of another user of Blink Services. If your use of Blink Services is restricted, suspended, or terminated, you may be unable to access your video clips and you will not receive any refund or any other compensation. In case of termination, Blink may immediately revoke your access to Blink Services without refund.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bsvLBE"&gt;It turns out that Amazon’s crackdown on Blink automators has been a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homebridge/comments/dpswdf/dont_use_blink_camera_homebridge_plugins/"&gt;known issue&lt;/a&gt; in the community for at least a year. My question is: why does Amazon bother?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcuRVA"&gt;My Homebridge integration may well be in violation of Blink’s terms and conditions, even if the terms seem unduly restrictive. But why is Amazon, owner of those massive AWS server farms that earned nearly $50 billion in 2020, resorting to such draconian measures in response to my meager deployment of five Blink cameras? I could see a crackdown on large-scale corporate installations hammering away at the Blink API, but why me and other small-time enthusiasts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juxEcm"&gt;According to Colin Bendell, developer of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/colinbendell/homebridge-blink-for-home"&gt;Blink camera plugin for Homebridge&lt;/a&gt;, there are at most 4,000 homes using open-source plugins like his. “Even if we round up to 10,000 users, I think this is probably small potatoes for Amazon,” says Bendell, who should know. Not only did he reverse engineer the Blink app to mimic its behavior, but the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oreilly.com%2Flibrary%2Fview%2Fhigh-performance-images%2F9781491925799%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22381356%2Fblink-homebridge-crackdown-amazon-subscriptions" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;O’Reilly author&lt;/a&gt; and self-proclaimed IoT hobbyist is also the director of performance engineering at Shopify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xe6NTe"&gt;Blink could easily look the other way for small home deployments like mine without waving its rights. It says so right in the T&amp;amp;Cs it sent me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="dAX92T"&gt;“Blink’s failure to insist upon or enforce your strict compliance with this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any of its rights.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="y2fkH5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon should be embracing Blink hobbyists, not vilifying them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T9Gn6U"&gt;But that’d be a cop out. Really, Amazon should be embracing Blink hobbyists. Homebridge is, after all, a project that extends Apple HomeKit to work with a wide variety of uncertified devices including cameras and doorbells from Amazon-owned Ring. And study after study have concluded that Apple device owners love to spend money. Surely this is a community Amazon should encourage, not vilify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roAQw4"&gt;At the risk of saying too much (please don’t shut me down, Amazon!), why is it that my two Ring cameras aren’t raising any red flags during “server audits”? I certainly check them more frequently as one is my doorbell. Perhaps it’s because I already pay a monthly subscription to Amazon for Ring and pay nothing to Blink. (Although sadly, even that early benefit has come to an end. As of March 18th, Amazon requires owners of newer Blink cameras to &lt;a href="https://support.blinkforhome.com/before-you-begin/blink-storage-options"&gt;pay a subscription fee&lt;/a&gt; to unlock every feature.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5M3tB"&gt;When I reached out to Amazon with the questions I raise above, and asked if enthusiast initiatives like Homebridge would be officially (or unofficially, &lt;em&gt;wink&lt;/em&gt;) supported, I was given this boilerplate response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16W8vE"&gt;“Blink customers can control their cameras through the Blink Home Monitor app, and customize their experience using the If This Then That (IFTTT) service. We are always looking for ways to improve the customer experience, including supporting select third-party integrations for our devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOhrMk"&gt;Gee, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RuT2G6C3f7CEa9PnLpLG-3AHPoY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22440365/no_monthly_contract_blink.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Blink&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of Blink’s biggest advantages has come to an end.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CVEVR3"&gt;We kid ourselves about ownership all the time. I say I own my house, but, in fact, the bank owns more of it than I do. I listen to &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;music&lt;/em&gt; on Spotify, but those Premium playlists I’ve so carefully curated for years will be plucked from my phone just as soon as payments lapse. But somehow, Blink cameras were supposed to be different. They were for people drawn to Blink on the strength of that “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqitP0llkL0"&gt;no monthly contract&lt;/a&gt;” pitch. These were devices you were supposed to own without limitations or tithes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Jkv5S"&gt;How things have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvbMES"&gt;In 2017, Blink stood alone in the field; today there’s Wyze, Eufy, TP-Link / Kasa, Imou, and Ezviz to name just a few of the companies making inexpensive wired and wireless cameras for every smart home ecosystem, including Amazon’s, often with better features and value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="NiJvzC"&gt;I’ve been a smart home evangelist for more than a decade, doling out advice to friends, often solicited, often not. Blink used to be an easy pitch: cheap and dead simple to install for normies, and highly extensible if you’re willing to put in the effort. But Amazon’s heavy-handed enforcement of T&amp;amp;Cs alongside the introduction of subscription fees have negated any advantage Blink once held over its camera competitors. While Blink sales will undoubtedly benefit from Amazon’s promotion machine, longtime Blink enthusiasts like myself will be taking their allegiances elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stromer ST2 e-bike review: too hot for Europe</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A great speed pedelec hamstrung by EU regulations&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mJSPk1"&gt;The words “Swiss design” conjure images of luxury watch movements and delicately sculpted eyeglasses, not hulking e-bikes with thickly welded frames and face-melting power. Stromer is here to challenge those assumptions and force a rethink of how its Swiss-made electric bikes, with top speeds of 45 km/h (28 mph), can disrupt urban transportation for the benefit of residents. I’ve certainly seen the light after testing a new 2021 edition ST2, Stromer’s first e-bike with a carbon belt drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07crmH"&gt;Broadly speaking, US cities have all of the fast e-bikes and no bicycle infrastructure, whereas European cities have all of the protective infrastructure and few fast e-bikes. It’s exceedingly rare to see fast e-bikes known as speed-pedelecs in my Amsterdam home, for example, where half of all new bikes sold are electric, and bicycles outnumber people by a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8V4PL"&gt;It’s not that EU bike makers are an effete bunch of cheese-eating milquetoasts; they manufacture slow, underpowered e-bikes to avoid the draconian measures triggered by EU Directive 168/2013. It states that any e-bike that goes faster than 25 km/h (15.5 mph) with a continuous rated power above 250 watts is to be treated the same as a gas-guzzling moped. Makers of s-pedelecs like the Stromer ST2 are subjected to a grueling certification process that then requires owners to hold a moped-class driver’s license, liability insurance, and registration. By contrast, a similarly specced Class 3 e-bike in the US usually requires... nothing, other than a helmet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRpZmd"&gt;Regulating speed-pedelecs is a good thing, but they should be specifically targeted and not just shoe-horned into existing rules that curtail adoption, stifle innovation, and increase costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ebBr7"&gt;To make matters worse, speed pedelecs are banned from riding on the vast majority of the ubiquitous bike lanes that famously protect helmet-less Dutch bicyclists in cities like Amsterdam. Why? Because mopeds are banned, and the law doesn’t differentiate. &lt;em&gt;Fuck that.&lt;/em&gt; I wasn’t going to put my life at risk for this review by riding alongside heavy (and dangerous) automobiles just because European regulators can’t get their shit together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbSAdP"&gt;Over the entirety of March, I spent my days fawning over the sophistication of the Stromer ST2 while fuming at lawmakers for holding back s-pedelecs from their full potential as car replacements. While I’ll be reviewing the ST2 on its own merits, it’s nigh impossible to recommend to Europeans without first considering the operational rules by which it’s constrained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JA2W3L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10447591"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wJUKSW"&gt;Before diving too deeply into why European rules suck, let’s start with what makes the new Stromer ST2 so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LFaJ6"&gt;The ST2 is Stromer’s all-rounder model in a &lt;a href="https://www.stromerbike.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/mystromertechsheetmy21produktmatrixneurzv2en.pdf"&gt;range of s-pedelecs&lt;/a&gt; that run from the entry-level ST1 to the ST5 (there is no ST4), with prices ranging from $4,199 / €4,628 to $11,699 / €11,428 and higher depending on configuration and options. Stromer’s motors range from 670W and 35 Nm of torque to 850W and 48 Nm. All Stromers are pedal-assisted e-bikes without throttles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzYzz2"&gt;The ST2 starts at $5,699 / €6,128 and is fitted with a 750-watt Stromer CYRO Drive IG motor mounted on the rear hub. It produces a modest 40 Nm of torque to accelerate the bike up to 45 km/h (28 mph) from a standstill as safely and effortlessly as possible. A torque sensor ensures that power is delivered just as soon it detects a harder press on the pedal. The Gates Carbon belt drive linked to an internal five-gear hub propels the sturdy aluminum-framed bike forward on 27.5-inch wheels sporting high volume Cycl-e ST tires custom-designed by Pirelli. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hG01Gc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power, light, and horn within easy access.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N5sqJx"&gt;My ST2 with the large-sized sport frame options came standard with fenders, a kickstand, and a mini rack; it did not come with the optional front and rear suspension. It weighs just shy of 33 kgs (72 pounds), which is undeniably heavy for an e-bike. But that mass makes the ride feel rock solid at top speed, without any worrisome wobble or flex when riding over bumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IbBJHz"&gt;Safety is also boosted by custom front and rear hydraulic disc brakes, an electric horn, daytime running lights, and a Roxim Z4E Pro headlight that can produce between 600 and 900 lumens at night. (A dazzling 1600-lumen option is available.) There’s also an integrated brake light around back. The required rearview mirror is useful to see overtaking motorists on roads, but it makes the bike quite wide. This resulted in a few slapped car mirrors before I got a feel for the added width. Fortunately, the mirror folds to make it a bit easier to walk the bike through narrow hallways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="WeR8Bs"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Stromer ST2 battery eject|101689" data-volume-uuid="5ed7aaa95" data-volume-id="101689" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-770" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyless battery makes a pleasant “thunk” when ejected after a touchscreen and button combo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qU48tm"&gt;My ST2 review bike came fitted with a 48V, 618Wh removable battery rated for up to 120 km or 75 miles, though I’d estimate real-world range for an aggressive rider like me is about half that. I managed just shy of 50 km (31 miles) with 10 percent charge remaining, according to the Stromer app, before deciding to top up. The ST2 has a customizable regenerative braking feature to make the most of the battery. That flat terrain I tested on didn’t benefit from the extended range allowed by the recuperation that’s possible on long steep declines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFkSYB"&gt;I did about half of my testing while illegally riding on bicycle lanes because responsible individuals can regulate their speed for the slower flow of congested city riding. If a powerful Ferrari can share city roads with slower Hyundais, then certainly a powerful e-bike can share a dedicated lane with traditional bicyclists. Putting the ST2 into low-power mode makes this easy. My riding was an even mix of max power (setting 3) at max speed (up to 47 km/h, according to the integrated display) when commuting outside the city center, and lazy 20 to 30 km/h jaunts at low power (setting 1) around town. A beefier battery with a stated range of up to 180 km (110 miles) is also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvevnP"&gt;The + and - buttons on the left grip make it easy to toggle between the three power modes, while the right grip is home to the shifter. The excellent 5-Speed Sturmey Archer shifter is smooth and reliable and conveniently works from a standstill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="MEe4Lr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10447581"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7czTVY"&gt;The touchscreen display integrated into the top tube is the interface to a bike OS that’s overwrought, in my opinion, though some might like having access to every configuration option (and there are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;) right on the bike. I do not, especially not when all that overhead makes the bike take 20 seconds just to boot, an eternity if you’re in a hurry. My bike was also configured to boot into a lock screen that was frustratingly slow to respond to the five taps required to enter my secret passcode. The display also easily washes out in sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kG2q9f"&gt;In my experience, it’s rare to make any changes once a bike is set up to your liking, meaning it’s best to offload more advanced features to an app. I prefer simple displays that boot fast and serve as a simple dashboard for basics like power setting and battery remaining. Stromer’s app is already very complete, offering lots of ride statistics and bike diagnostics in addition to options to tune the ride to your preferred balance of speed, torque, and agility. (I rode exclusively with the default “standard” setting.) The Stromer OMNI app is one of the best e-bike apps I’ve used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOg4kz"&gt;The ST2 is as high-tech as they come, fitted with Bluetooth to auto-lock / unlock the bike when in range, GPS tracking, and 3G data for over-the-air software updates. An anti-theft mode shuts off the motor and starts blaring the horn to scare off thieves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3QqgQu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A true car replacement that beat a Tesla Model 3&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEOzQp"&gt;S-pedelecs can nearly reach the 50 km/h speed limit of most European cities, which is why they’re often pitched as true car replacements. Traditional e-bikes can already replace car commutes for many, but their top speed of 25 km/h means you’ll have to accept an extended travel time (while getting outside for some exercise). To test this theory, I “raced” a friend to a golf course to the north of Amsterdam; he in his new Tesla Model 3, me on the Stromer ST2 with a six-club pencil bag slung over my shoulder. His 30-minute trip took me just 27 minutes, and I had to wait 5 minutes for a ferry to arrive. Technically, I cheated by occasionally riding at top speed on &lt;em&gt;deserted&lt;/em&gt; bike lanes I wasn’t allowed to use... but should have been. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LFk9lfBZsGdSyD4Owa9bLjwdrBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445520/verge_DSC_4224__1__2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speed pedelecs are forbidden on Dutch bike lanes like the one above and must share roads with cars instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="g5Ndh8"&gt;Now, about EU directive 168/2013. As the name implies, it was conceived years before it was fully enacted on January 1st, 2017, which is part of the problem. It failed to anticipate the explosion of electric personal mobility devices we’ve seen over the last four years, especially in countries like the Netherlands where half of all new bicycles sold last year were electric. The directive splits e-bikes into two categories of “type approvals”: type L1e-A includes electric cargo bikes like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21269590/carqon-cargo-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;Carqon&lt;/a&gt;, while type L1e-B includes s-pedelecs like the Stromer ST2 &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; gasoline-powered mopeds. Any e-bike maxing out at 25 km/h and 250 watts of continuous power is exempt from the directive and treated exactly like a regular bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g53jxW"&gt;Type L1e-B vehicles are limited to a maximum speed of 45 km/h and maximum continuous rated power of 4,000 watts. It requires mopeds and s-pedelecs to be fitted with a rearview mirror, horn, brake light, and prominent license plate; while the owner must be at least 16 years of age, wear a moped-rated helmet, possess a moped (type AM) driver’s license, be covered by liability insurance, and pay to have the vehicle registered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="p6xOMf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Why would any company bother?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7JqdNV"&gt;Critics like the European Light Electric Vehicle Advocacy group &lt;a href="https://www.bikenews.online/index.php?route=bossblog/article&amp;amp;filter_tag=E-Bike+Solutions&amp;amp;blog_article_id=270"&gt;LEVA-EU&lt;/a&gt; argue that because it was designed primarily for mopeds with combustion engines, the current type L1e-B approval process is unnecessarily complex and burdensome for bike makers. S-pedelec manufacturers are required to comply with &lt;a href="https://leva-eu.com/is-eu-type-approval-dangerous-for-speed-pedelec-riders/"&gt;1,036 pages&lt;/a&gt; of text, much of which is about moped safety and emission concerns that simply don’t apply to speed pedelecs. The result is higher costs passed onto consumers and curtailed adoption and innovation because... why would any company bother?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWWINp"&gt;Because Europe is Europe, there’s often variance in how regulations are set into law in each member country. While I complain about s-pedelec access to bike paths in Amsterdam, at least some bike lanes still allow them, unlike other European countries. Conversely, Belgium gives owners the choice to ride their s-pedelecs on any bike path or any road with a maximum speed limit of 50 km/h. It’s policy is informed by an &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2032-6653/10/4/87"&gt;effusive in-country study from 2019&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="POcgyP"&gt;The speed pedelec has the potential to be a sustainable alternative for cars with internal combustion engines for commuting purposes. For the Belgian case, commuting with a speed pedelec can solve problems regarding congestion and air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="PYjAEv"&gt;At the close of 2020, Stromer bikes registered in Belgium (4,061) were more than double that of my Dutch home (1,558), &lt;a href="https://www.bike-eu.com/market/nieuws/2021/02/stromer-solidifies-foothold-in-speed-pedelec-market-as-european-sales-grow-10139703"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bike Europe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And despite being the market leader for s-pedelecs throughout Europe, Stromer produced just 12,417 s-pedelecs in 2020, which is the same number of slow e-bikes Amsterdam-based &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;VanMoof makes in a month&lt;/a&gt;. European S-pedelec demand is clearly being stifled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xdqHK"&gt;So, what’s to be done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="zkClKC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10447634"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vAK9YH"&gt;The good news here is that the European Commission seems keen to address the regulations that currently govern e-bikes. In October, the EC asked TRL, a UK-based mobility researcher, to initiate a review of the EU’s type approval process required by EU directive 168/2013. TRL recently concluded its findings and &lt;a href="https://www.bike-eu.com/laws-regulations/nieuws/2021/03/do-not-introduce-e-bike-type-approval-trl-recommends-to-european-commission-10140091"&gt;recommended that s-pedelecs&lt;/a&gt; be moved out of the L1e-B moped category and into the far less restrictive L1e-A category. L1e-A type approvals currently cover 1,000-watt e-cargo bikes capped at 25 km/h and some vehicles with throttles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyFycZ"&gt;It’s a positive sign but still “unfortunate” for s-pedelecs from the perspective of LEVA-EU. The advocacy group &lt;a href="https://leva-eu.com/leva-eu-position-on-review-for-zero-emission-tailpipe-vehicles/"&gt;has been pushing for an entirely new set of vehicle regulations&lt;/a&gt; for zero-emission vehicles like e-bikes, standing scooters, and electric skateboards based upon weight and speed only, not maximum continuous power. LEVA-EU believes that vehicles with similar levels of kinetic energy should be subjected to similar rules. It would therefore distinguish between vehicles with a maximum speed of 25 or 30 km/h and those capable of 45 or 50 km/h, instead of trying to bend the current regulations dictated by Directive 168/2013 (and the &lt;a href="https://www.bike-eu.com/laws-regulations/nieuws/2019/05/latest-eu-commissions-decision-changed-legal-status-of-e-bikes-10135911"&gt;related Machinery Directive&lt;/a&gt;) to the realities of modern transportation. While the TRL did recommend to “create a dedicated approval process for PMD [personal mobility devices] separate from Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 and the Machinery Directive,” it capped this at a max speed of either 25 or 30 km/h, thus excluding s-pedelecs from the PMD category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9dGJ9"&gt;The EC isn’t bound by TRL’s recommendations so we’ll have to wait until 2022 for it to reveal its legislative proposal. Even then, any proposal would have to be negotiated with the member states; a process that could go on for years before new legislation is enacted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GHRqq3qbcoQEQJUfPRdEB1xReSA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445618/verge_DSC_3452_ps_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stromer ST2 is also available in dark gray.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xwUdbq"&gt;As much as I’d love to call for revolution and demand that urban commuters act on the moral obligation to disobey the unjust laws governing s-pedelecs in Europe, I can’t really apply the logic I used for a short-term review to long-term ownership — especially not with ST2 prices starting at $5,699 / €6,128. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xVpya"&gt;If you’re in the US, then no problem. But anyone in Europe interested in owning the ST2 or any speed pedelec that falls under the current L1e-B type designation had better do their homework. Not only do you need to factor in local laws that might differ from EU rules, but also the costs to register and insure yourself for such a nascent and confusing transportation category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVX7Nv"&gt;The Stromer ST2 is easily the most sophisticated and thrilling e-bike I’ve ridden since I began reviewing the category back in 2016. It also did the rarest of things by letting me glimpse a better future that’s just out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="KSEIhE"&gt;S-pedelecs could help accelerate European initiatives to &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en"&gt;green our cities&lt;/a&gt; and reclaim all of that space allocated to idling cars. But that won’t happen until EU regulators first remove the barriers to adoption and then create incentives to get city-dwellers out of their cars, even the electric ones, and onto bikes like the Stromer ST2. &lt;/p&gt;
