    <title>Union says Amazon threatened layoffs in formal objection to election results</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EPkFFp"&gt;The Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union (RWDSU) has filed a formal objection to the results of a union election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, alleging the e-commerce company threatened to lay off workers. The employees voted against unionizing in an April 9th vote, but the RWDSU is arguing that the results should be set aside because Amazon “created an atmosphere of confusion, coercion and/or fear of reprisals and thus interfered with the employees’ freedom of choice,” the union said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGzL0t"&gt;“Amazon has left no stone unturned in its efforts to gaslight its own employees,” RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement Monday. “We won’t let Amazon’s lies, deception and illegal activities go unchallenged, which is why we are formally filing charges against all of the egregious and blatantly illegal actions taken by Amazon during the union vote today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uE4MSx"&gt;Amazon said in a statement that it was looking forward to the next steps in the legal process. “The fact is that less than 16% of employees at BHM1 voted to join a union,” the statement reads. “Rather than accepting these employees’ choice, the union seems determined to continue misrepresenting the facts in order to drive its own agenda.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="APYwV1"&gt;Workers voted by mail in February and March whether they wanted to join the RWDSU. Of the roughly 5,800 workers at the Bessemer warehouse, 3,041 voted in the election, with 1,798 workers voting against and 738 voting in favor, according to the NLRB. Known as BHM1, Bessmer is only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;the second US Amazon facility&lt;/a&gt; to hold a union vote. If it had been approved, BHM1’s union would have been the biggest group to gain representation in a single NLRB election since 1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IMzyg"&gt;The RWSDU has a list of 23 objections it has filed with the NLRB. Among other things, the union claims Amazon threatened employees that the Bessemer warehouse would close if they joined a union, and that the company sent an email warning it would lay off workers if the union was voted in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWS91a"&gt;It also alleges that Amazon installed a ballot collection box in the warehouse parking lot, creating the appearance that the company — rather than the NLRB — controlled the election, and it monitored the collection box via security cameras. An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the RWDSU allegations about the collection box are not accurate. “We said from the beginning that we wanted all employees to vote and proposed many different options to try and make it easy. The RWDSU fought those at every turn and pushed for a mail-only election, which the NLRB’s own data showed would reduce turnout,” the spokesperson said. “This mailbox—which only the USPS had access to—was a simple, secure, and completely optional way to make it easy for employees to vote, no more and no less.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHv881"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;The mailbox was a major source of contention&lt;/a&gt; during the vote. According to the RWDSU, Amazon pressured workers to bring their ballots to work and put them in the collection box rather than sending ballots by mail and removed workers who supported the union from mandatory captive-audience training sessions. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3anw9k/amazon-sends-vote-no-instructions-to-unionizing-employees-tells-them-to-use-new-mailbox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; also reported&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon sent instructions to employees to vote “no” and told them to use the controversial mailbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXbNX1"&gt;The union is seeking an investigation into what it says is behavior by Amazon that corrupted the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPoGNB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQfTSa"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFuIYq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Faraday Future was investigated by the Department of Labor in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ow7D-RE42SBgEj92HybA2xXNOWs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150231/faraday_future_ff91_5232.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFONuk"&gt;Faraday Future was investigated by the Department of Labor in 2020, though the electric vehicle startup says the matter was “resolved,” according to a previously unreported passage in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805521/000121390021020004/fs42021_propertysolutions.htm"&gt;a recent regulatory filing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emRwYP"&gt;The startup didn’t say what the investigation was about or how much it paid to resolve the legal matter. Faraday Future’s former chief lawyer has &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.793916/gov.uscourts.cacd.793916.1.0.pdf"&gt;claimed in a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; that the company was previously inspected by the Department of Homeland Security’s United States Citizenship and Immigration Services division in 2018, though the startup denied this in court filings. A spokesperson for Faraday Future declined to comment on the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rRRJAk"&gt;The regulatory filing, known as the S-4 “registration statement,” was published as part of Faraday Future’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22247942/faraday-future-spac-merger-public-psac-property-solutions-nasdaq"&gt;merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC)&lt;/a&gt; called Property Solutions Acquisition Corp. When that merger is done, Faraday Future will be a publicly traded company and will have around $1 billion in fresh cash — capping a remarkable turnaround from the brink of bankruptcy and giving it the money it needs to finally try to put its high-performance, ultra-luxury electric SUV into production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PFXBhX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The filing offers the best X-ray of Faraday Future’s business to date&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="99J3KK"&gt;One of the trade-offs of going public is that you have to disclose far more information than you do as a private company. So this dense document not only offers the best X-ray of Faraday Future’s business to date, but it also sheds light on a number of other previously dark corners of the history of the troubled startup and its founder, Chinese tech tycoon Jia Yueting. Here are a few other things that stood out: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YMcWqW"&gt;Jia Yueting is a risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="b2aAT5"&gt;Jia has spent the last few years living in California after self-exiling himself from China, where he was named to a debtor blacklist following the collapse of his tech conglomerate LeEco. His habit of borrowing too much money &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/8/18130543/faraday-future-jia-yueting-leeco-leshi-debt-china"&gt;has left a trail of “debt bombs” that continues to haunt him to this day&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the weight of that debt is what drove him to file for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2020/7/24/21310034/faraday-future-jia-yueting-bankruptcy-details-sovereign-wealth-fund"&gt;personal bankruptcy in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and now those companies he owed money to have small equity stakes in Faraday Future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exOCIt"&gt;The way Jia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/10/30/20879811/faraday-future-ceo-founder-jia-yueting-carsten-breitfeld-bankruptcy"&gt;tightened his grip&lt;/a&gt; on Faraday Future over the years is also what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;led to many of the startup’s problems&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has previously reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtUm1E"&gt;While Jia has been replaced as CEO, all of this baggage presents a risk to the company going forward — literally. Public companies have to list out all of the imaginable problems that investors should know about, and Jia has his own dedicated “risk factor.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4bSWyo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Faraday Future’s founder has a lot of baggage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hahefn"&gt;As that section reads, Jia’s “image will be closely associated with [Faraday Future’s] brand,” according to the filing, and the “media’s focus on negative coverage could materially and adversely affect FF’s valuation and investors’ confidence. Such negative publicity could also solicit inquiries from securities regulatory bodies in the relevant jurisdictions where FF does business.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5UrOF"&gt;Jia is now Faraday Future’s “Chief Product and User Ecosystem Officer,” and he remains on the startup’s executive management committee. And repercussions from his actions continue to pop up, too, as just last week he was &lt;a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2021-04-14/jia-yueting-other-leshi-former-executives-banned-from-securities-market-for-life-101690802.html"&gt;banned for life from the securities market in China&lt;/a&gt; for “fraud” committed at LeEco. Faraday Future also says in the S-4 that its subsidiaries in China — many of them LeEco-related — are involved in around 90 legal disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="owq3zs"&gt;Faraday Future had just $1 million in the bank at the end of 2020 and suffered steep losses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LANhLK"&gt;Faraday Future has spent the last few years treading financial waters, and this new filing shows how close it was to going under. Previously, the best idea of how much cash the startup had on hand came from Jia’s bankruptcy filings, which showed that Faraday Future had around $6 million in the bank by July 2019. Now, we can see that Faraday Future finished 2019 with just $2.2 million in cash and 2020 with just $1.1 million in cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXWTGi"&gt;Those are measly figures when compared to the annual losses Faraday Future has recently posted: $142 million in 2019 and $147 million in 2020. In its near seven-year history, Faraday Future has spent some $2 billion total without generating any revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iCwmvM"&gt;Working with a restructuring firm in 2019 likely saved Faraday Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="025ArV"&gt;How did this startup survive for years with only that much cash in the bank and around $800 million in current liabilities? It took on more debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMNlTu"&gt;Faraday Future is very possibly only still around because of a deal it struck in April 2019 with Birch Lake Associates, a Chicago-based merchant bank that advises restructurings and is run by what one expert &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18524108/faraday-future-bankruptcy-expert-birch-lake-loan"&gt;described to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time&lt;/a&gt; as a “bankruptcy legend.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EdKxoK"&gt;Throughout the S-4, Birch Lake’s fingerprints are all over the last two years of Faraday Future. Birch Lake arranged to have tens of millions of dollars loaned to Faraday Future in 2019, shortly after the startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/31/18162827/faraday-future-evergrande-settlement-restructuring-china-ev-investor"&gt;broke up with its biggest outside investor, Chinese conglomerate Evergrande&lt;/a&gt;. Birch Lake has also helped consolidate and refinance some of Faraday Future’s old debt that was either coming due or in default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B3Pp9E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The startup’s been working with a “bankruptcy legend” for two years to turn things around&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aKlGlH"&gt;One of the key things Birch Lake was involved in, though, was creating a so-called “vendor trust.” At the time that Birch Lake started working with Faraday Future, the startup owed more than $100 million to the suppliers of components for its electric SUV. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18243015/faraday-future-money-lawsuits-employees"&gt;many of those suppliers weren’t getting paid&lt;/a&gt;. Since Faraday Future didn’t have much money, Birch Lake helped solve this by setting up a trust that let suppliers essentially exchange their debt claims for what became small ownership stakes in the startup, which could pay out if and when Faraday Future went public or got bought — a deal that probably looks much better now than when those companies took it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="b5ZXQv"&gt;A 2019 deal with a Chinese gaming company never went anywhere&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5cH00H"&gt;After it announced the deal with Birch Lake, Faraday Future also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/24/18279785/faraday-future-the9-china-car-investment-deal"&gt;announced a potential investment from Chinese gaming company The9&lt;/a&gt;. The two companies were supposed to start up a joint venture in China that would see The9 contribute up to $600 million and Faraday Future develop an electric minivan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUsCjs"&gt;But neither side ever really spoke about that effort again following the announcement, and based on The9’s own financial filings, it’s been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1290746176350887942"&gt;clear since last August&lt;/a&gt; that the deal was dead. Faraday Future basically confirms this in its S-4, saying the deal is “dormant.” The9 &lt;em&gt;did &lt;/em&gt;make an initial deposit of $5 million when the companies agreed to the deal in 2019 as a commitment, but that’s since been converted to stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OPKpU"&gt;(Another partnership with commercial powertrain company US Hybrid, &lt;a href="https://www.ff.com/us/press-room/ff-collaboration-with-US-hybrid/"&gt;announced in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, is mentioned nowhere in the S-4.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UFa9kC"&gt;Faraday Future and LeEco’s separate electric car efforts weren’t so separate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uUL3L7"&gt;This likely won’t surprise anyone who has followed Faraday Future or Jia closely, but at one point, both of his companies were working on electric cars, seemingly at odds. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16334780/faraday-future-leeco-lesee-electric-car-patents"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/leecos-car-was-designed-by-faraday-future-employees-who-1790163868"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jalopnik&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/priya/turmoil-at-faraday-future#.ysKaOl7Ye"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;have reported, the two projects actually had a lot of overlap, despite the companies maintaining at the time that they were distinct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJdSfH"&gt;But there’s a stark admission in the S-4 that finally drops the veil: LeSee, which was the brand for LeEco’s EV project, was treated as a subsidiary of Faraday Future and was considered the startup’s “primary Chinese operating entity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A77ZgN"&gt;Neither were their finances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TZAYiD"&gt;Another thing that has been previously reported, but now there are concrete details in the filing that partially describe some of the many loans Jia Yueting used to move money throughout his empire. Leview Mobile, a LeEco-related company, loaned $67 million to Faraday Future in 2018. LeSee, meanwhile, borrowed nearly $30 million from a Chinese entity controlled by Jia that also was the beneficial owner of Faraday Future’s Hong Kong subsidiary. In 2017, Faraday Future borrowed nearly $9 million from a small bank that Jia owned in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CPdF5"&gt;Faraday Future also borrowed multiple times from unnamed employees starting in 2017 and running through 2020, ranging from as low as $700,000 and as high as multiple millions. In one case, Faraday Future says it borrowed $16 million from a company owned by an employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNqjim"&gt;Jia’s bankruptcy filings also shed light on some of these loans in 2020, including the $16 million one, which was actually &lt;em&gt;originally &lt;/em&gt;funded by the company’s “&lt;a href="https://www.ff.com/us/press-room/a-letter-to-creditors/"&gt;global partners&lt;/a&gt;” committee but was first passed through a Delaware LLC whose president is Faraday Future’s head of investor relations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9Urrj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrlIRc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uWOpU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will allow Parler to return to the App Store</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ulNwuE"&gt;Apple will allow Parler to return to its App Store, according to a letter first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/19/tech/apple-parler-app-store/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN &lt;/em&gt;on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TiBRO"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1384159186209054721?s=20"&gt;the letter&lt;/a&gt; addressed to Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), Apple said “Parler has proposed updates to its app and the app’s content moderation practices” that would bring the app into compliance with the App Store’s rules. Now, Parler is allowed to return once it reintroduces the app to the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="59NFOy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On March 31, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenMikeLee?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SenMikeLee&lt;/a&gt; and I sent a letter demanding answers about why Apple removed Parler from the App Store.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Today, we received a response: Parler will be reinstated on the App Store. Huge win for free speech. &lt;a href="https://t.co/FQBDSSSFGk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/FQBDSSSFGk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Congressman Ken Buck (@RepKenBuck) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1384159186209054721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JKLUfI"&gt;In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; removed Parler, a conservative-favored social media app, following accusations that users of the app promoted violence ahead of and after a pro-Trump mob attacked the US Capitol. Before its ban, Apple demanded that Parler remove hateful and violent content from the app within 24 hours in order to remain on the App Store. Parler did not propose any changes, and so it was removed on January 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLzN3z"&gt;Days later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;Amazon dropped Parler, too&lt;/a&gt;, citing similar threats of violence. In doing so, Amazon effectively took Parler entirely offline until the site could find a replacement web host. Following Parler’s shutdown, the company’s CEO John Matze &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/02/973083119/former-parler-ceo-matze-stripped-of-all-company-shares-upon-firing-sources-say"&gt;was fired&lt;/a&gt; from the company and later stripped of all his shares. Parler found a new web host and went &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22284036/parler-social-network-relaunch-new-hosting"&gt;back online&lt;/a&gt; in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAOjEP"&gt;Apple’s decision to bring back Parler comes just days &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22376127/apple-senate-judiciary-hearing-klobuchar-app-store-google-play-antitrust"&gt;before the company&lt;/a&gt; is set to testify before Congress regarding its App Store practices. Google will also be sending a witness to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22378697/apple-witness-senate-judiciary-hearing-antitrust-app-stores"&gt;testify at the hearing&lt;/a&gt; scheduled for Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rolG65"&gt;Reddit unveiled its take on a Clubhouse-like social audio product on Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/mu3f0x/lets_talk_get_a_sneak_preview_of_reddit_talk_and/"&gt;called Reddit Talk&lt;/a&gt;. The company is billing Monday’s announcement as a “sneak preview,” since the feature isn’t widely available yet. Moderators that want to try the feature out in their subreddit can add themselves to a waitlist for access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsZnvM"&gt;Based on Reddit’s description and images shared by the company, Reddit Talk appears to look a lot like Clubhouse, Twitter Spaces, and other social audio products. Talks will “live” within subreddits, according to Reddit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rcZgVtGaF0lMi6xgEs1s91JJBoY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22454636/bcykx1isg5u61__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Reddit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reddit’s new Talk feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pkMkCT"&gt;During the initial tests, only subreddit moderators will be able to initiate a Talk, and Talk hosts will have the ability to invite, mute, and remove speakers. While only mods can kick off Talks in the beginning, anyone on iOS and Android can listen to one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CbLWJ"&gt;Moderation has been an issue for Clubhouse, so it’s notable that Reddit is starting small and giving access only to moderators first. At some point in the future, mods will be able to bring on trusted community members as co-hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DfUEHti2CyHQE-JcdFvqVLqumdI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22454638/91jj01hxg5u61.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Reddit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reddit Talk mod tools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k5Widi"&gt;The company says it is “testing ways” for hosts to customize how Talks look with emojis and different background colors, and users will be able to change their avatar, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YjyrQU"&gt;Reddit joins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22363221/twitter-spaces-desktop-web-browsers-clubhouse"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; in announcing a social audio feature. &lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt; first broke word that Reddit was working on a social audio feature &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/reddit-clubhouse-voice-chat/"&gt;on April 9th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJDjD9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 19th, 12:33PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Reddit clarified after publishing that the waitlist is intended only for moderators. Also added that mods will be able to bring on community members as co-hosts in the future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon buys nine ULA rocket launches for its space internet satellites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An Atlas V rocket with NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BlA1b6PU6YCF76Z46WQRJpPO9MM=/0x0:4071x2714/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150092/1227844386.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5iTDtw"&gt;Amazon bought nine launches from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance to send its internet-beaming Kuiper satellites into space, the companies announced. It is Amazon’s first launch agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZ3jpC"&gt;The deal is for ULA’s workhorse Atlas 5 rocket. An Amazon spokesman declined to say how many satellites each launch will carry or how often they will launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZCuDqz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon pledged to invest $10 billion into the Kuiper program last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1o1vLZ"&gt;Amazon is planning to build a so-called constellation of 3,236 satellites in space to bring internet to rural parts of the world that have little to no connectivity. It’ll also serve as a major infrastructure boost to its mammoth cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services. But details on the network have been scant since the Federal Communications Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348768/fcc-amazon-kuiper-satellite-constellation-approval"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; the company’s network for launch in July 2020. The competition is stiff, too: both OneWeb and Elon Musk’s SpaceX are also deploying broadband internet networks in low-Earth orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjRRYF"&gt;The FCC requires Amazon to launch at least half of its Kuiper network — roughly 1,618 satellites — by July 2026. The Atlas 5 missions will help Amazon meet that goal, but the company could use other rockets as well. SpaceX, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388378/elon-musk-starlink-satellite-internet-service-moving-vehicles-trucks-2021"&gt;far ahead&lt;/a&gt; of Amazon with its own internet constellation, has been using its Falcon 9 rocket to ferry 1,355 of 12,000 satellites for its Starlink network so far. OneWeb has launched 146 of its roughly 650 satellites planned for its network. And another company, Telesat, plans to launch 300 satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bx8OOX"&gt;Amazon’s Kuiper satellites are designed to fit atop different types of rockets, but the ULA deal provides Amazon with a “capable, reliable rocket” for its first Kuiper launches, Amazon’s VP of technology for Project Kuiper, Rajeev Badyal, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="amONQj"&gt;Kuiper satellites will orbit Earth at an altitude range of 590 to 630 kilometers (or 366 to 391 miles). Amazon says Kuiper prototypes have proved speeds of up to 400Mbps, “and performance will continue to improve in future iterations.” Last year, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178235/amazon-project-kuiper-user-terminal-antenna-internet-satellite-constellation"&gt;unveiled&lt;/a&gt; designs for the antennas customers will use to tap into Kuiper internet. Those antennas can also connect to other satellites in geostationary orbits, or deeper orbits at least 22,000 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeDsaV"&gt;Amazon pledged to invest $10 billion into the program last year — roughly the same investment SpaceX has said it’s making for Starlink. In its statement on Monday, the company said it has over 500 people working on Kuiper and that its “team is heavily focused on inventing new technology to make broadband more affordable and more accessible for customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KsRUBO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A win for ULA&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xISZw8"&gt;Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos’ space company, is in the late stages of developing a heavy-lift rocket dubbed New Glenn. Though Amazon could still pick New Glenn in the future, the rocket isn’t ready yet. Instead, Amazon is working with ULA, a company with ties to Blue Origin: its upcoming Vulcan rocket is powered by the same Blue Origin-made engines in New Glenn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2l0mB"&gt;The deal is a win for ULA, an industry heavyweight that has fallen behind SpaceX for commercial launches. While SpaceX has launched at least two commercial missions this year, ULA hasn’t launched anything. SpaceX’s reusable rockets are cheaper than ULA’s — even though ULA has slashed its Atlas 5 prices to as low as $100 million from as much as $187 million. But SpaceX is, of course, Amazon’s satellite competition, which may have made a SpaceX rocket less palatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwmZ1E"&gt;Low-Earth orbit, a shallow orbital layer where all these companies’ internet satellites will operate, is already getting crowded as SpaceX speeds ahead with Starlink deployment. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374262/oneweb-spacex-satellites-dodged-potential-collision-orbit-space-force"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; this month that OneWeb recently made SpaceX disable its automated collision avoidance system when two of their satellites were projected to collide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPhUxy"&gt;Industry competitors, including Amazon, have criticized SpaceX’s collision avoidance system for not sharing with other operators how it will move a Starlink satellite in the event of a potential collision. Analysts say rules requiring cooperation in orbit are a must, especially as Amazon aims to launch thousands of satellites in the same orbital neighborhood as SpaceX.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Let’s talk to Sen. Ed Markey about fixing the internet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NKsu6OdbfC4WoHuApq9dlivw8mE=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150086/VER_VergeLive_Article.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xu6vIF"&gt;In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216843/georgia-runoff-net-neutrality-fcc-jon-ossoff-raphael-warnock-democrats-senate"&gt;the future looked bright for net neutrality&lt;/a&gt;. After a surprise victory in the Georgia special elections, Democrats gained a majority in the Senate, opening the door for aggressive new Federal Communications Commission leadership that could reinstate net neutrality by regulatory order. There was even talk of passing a bill that would enshrine net neutrality in law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="3Eq4SG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10454209"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VDZaaI"&gt;In the three months since then, not much has happened. Preoccupied with the pandemic, the Biden White House has focused on shepherding through its relief and rebuilding efforts, a pair of massive spending bills that require every bit of political capital Democrats can spare. As a result, even basic measures like appointing a new FCC chair have taken a back seat to more urgent matters. But that may finally be changing, with rumblings from the FCC and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18206984/net-neutrality-bill-congress-new-fcc-markey"&gt;poised to introduce a net neutrality bill in Congress in the months to come&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOPafK"&gt;In a new &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; Live event on May 12th, we’ll dive into the net neutrality fight and the broader progressive effort to upgrade America’s internet. With so much of Washington focused on infrastructure, there’s never been a better time to take stock of the broadband gap and the various ways the government can make sure America stays online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeG3qG"&gt;After a few opening words from &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Nilay Patel, we’ll have a conversation with Markey, talking through the path forward for net neutrality in this Congress. Just like our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287443/section-230-amy-klobuchar-internet-regulation-panel-event-sign-up"&gt;March event&lt;/a&gt;, the whole thing will be virtual, but you’ll be able to drop questions in a chat room if there’s anything you want to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUiusy"&gt;We won’t be posting the full video publicly, so the only way to see it is to &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/thevergeliveinfrastructure/article"&gt;sign up here&lt;/a&gt;. We hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NHTSA is investigating the driverless Tesla crash that killed two people</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IHGtbtl9e6QPQ-7Q0eTBSDaCM08=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69149991/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Uqr3Ek"&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has dispatched a team to investigate the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;fatal Tesla crash in Texas&lt;/a&gt;, in which two people were killed after their vehicle crashed into a tree with no one behind the steering wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pllvTL"&gt;A spokesperson from the NHTSA said the agency is coordinating with local law enforcement to learn more about the incident and will “take appropriate steps” when investigators have gathered more information. The spokesperson did not respond to a follow-up question about whether that would include a recall of Tesla’s Autopilot feature that was likely involved in the crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2YB6NB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“take appropriate steps”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DgO0Zr"&gt;So far, the investigation appears to involve only officials from the NHTSA, and not its sub-agency, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). A spokesperson for the NTSB, which has investigated dozens of Tesla crashes over the years, said he has “no information regarding the crash or any current involvement from the NTSB.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Tlmfy"&gt;Local authorities have yet to identify the two men, aged 59 and 69, who were killed in the crash. The duration of the fire, which lasted four hours and required 30,000 gallons of water to extinguish, is said to have made identification difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CqJyC"&gt;The incident took place at 9PM local time in Spring, Texas. &lt;a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/tesla-spring-crash-fire/285-c28a4993-5b5f-43f4-a924-e39638390647"&gt;According to KHOU&lt;/a&gt; in Houston, investigators are “100 percent certain” that no one was in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash. Minutes before the crash, the wives of the men were said to overhear them talking about the Autopilot feature of the vehicle, which was a 2019 Tesla Model S, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/18/business/tesla-fatal-crash-texas.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MvkER"&gt;This is the latest crash involving a Tesla to be scrutinized by federal investigators. The NHTSA has sent teams to inspect similar crashes involving Teslas that took place in recent weeks in Houston, Lansing, and Detroit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rWp8SE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The latest incident involving a driver using Autopilot crashing into a stationary object&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ESLlO9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338427/tesla-autopilot-crash-michigan-nhtsa-investigation"&gt;This is also the latest incident&lt;/a&gt; to involve a driver using Autopilot crashing into a stationary object. There have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629214/tesla-autopilot-crash-death-josh-brown-jeremy-banner"&gt;at least two fatal crashes&lt;/a&gt; in which a Tesla owner has smashed into a stopped vehicle, and Tesla has yet to address it in any meaningful way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qp8PV"&gt;This crash is unique, though, in so far as it involves a vehicle with no one in the driver’s seat. In the past, Tesla has warned its customers that Autopilot is not an autonomous driving system and still requires constant attention to the road while in use. That said, the company’s marketing has been shown to be needlessly confusing, including the use of brand names like “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving” that implies the vehicle is more capable than it actually is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7IjCS"&gt;Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment, likely because the company has dissolved its press office and typically doesn’t respond to media requests anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYumRJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK to investigate Nvidia’s Arm acquisition on national security grounds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XeTEPaI2nZEJyQunFvtDSNxJaoI=/104x0:1268x776/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69149910/CeLOBOX.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G2dO6O"&gt;The British government has &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/digital-secretary-instructs-cma-to-look-into-nvidias-takeover-of-arm"&gt;ordered an investigation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"&gt;Nvidia’s proposed $40 billion acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of UK-headquartered chip designer Arm. The country’s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), will prepare an initial report on the takeover by the end of July, which will cover potential national security issues, as well as competition and jurisdictional issues created by the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGTIfI"&gt;“I have today issued an intervention notice on national security grounds,” the UK’s digital secretary Oliver Dowden said in a statement. “The UK’s independent competition authority will now prepare a report on the implications of the transaction, which will help inform any further decisions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tw0Iml"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is appropriate that we properly consider the national security implications of a transaction like this.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5qqXuD"&gt;“It is appropriate that we properly consider the national security implications of a transaction like this,” he said. In its press release, the UK government notes that Arm is a key player in the global semiconductor market and that these are integral to the UK’s national infrastructure and security. Arm’s designs are also popular with smartphone processor manufacturers, with &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-starts-national-security-probe-of-nvidia-s-40-billion-deal-to-buy-arm-11618837683?mod=e2tw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; noting&lt;/a&gt; they’re used in over 95 percent of devices sold worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zetTn8"&gt;Once the CMA presents its report, Dowden has the option of clearing the deal, imposing conditions to deal with any issues found, or ordering a “phase two” investigation, which would explore the deal in more depth. The digital secretary has the power to order an investigation like this in any deal involving the takeover of a company with more than £1 million in annual revenue where there may be public interest concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYIVfa"&gt;“We do not believe that this transaction poses any material national security issues,” Nvidia said in a statement. “We will continue to work closely with the British authorities, as we have done since the announcement of this deal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRscaI"&gt;Nvidia will not be the first foreign owner that Arm has had. It’s acquiring the company from Japan’s SoftBank, which has owned the chip designer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/5/12798302/softbank-arm-acquisition-complete"&gt;since 2016&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToFcJV"&gt;Today’s announcement comes after the CMA initially &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-to-investigate-nvidia-s-takeover-of-arm"&gt;said it was preparing to investigate the deal&lt;/a&gt; on competition grounds. “We will work closely with other competition authorities around the world to carefully consider the impact of the deal and ensure that it doesn’t ultimately result in consumers facing more expensive or lower quality products,” the CMA’s chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, said at the time. The US Federal Trade Commission is also reportedly reviewing the deal, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-12/google-microsoft-qualcomm-protest-nvidia-s-arm-acquisition?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOAyUR"&gt;As well as national security and antitrust issues, the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d76f9bd0-31be-47ba-9877-09afa37aecc7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that concerns have been raised that Arm’s headquarters could be moved away from Cambridge by the US-based company. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said his intention is to expand this base, keep Arm’s intellectual property registered in the country, and retain its current name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bThz35"&gt;Arm doesn’t manufacture chips; it provides designs to other chip manufacturers, including Qualcomm, Apple, and Samsung. Some of these companies have reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns"&gt;raised concerns about the acquisition&lt;/a&gt; to regulators that Nvidia could change how Arm licenses out its designs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first trailer for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings debuts Marvel’s latest martial arts hero</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f1t6LFCEiZiF-xqovNlcosUC-xI=/471x0:1986x1010/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69149434/Screen_Shot_2021_04_19_at_9.57.13_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lkS9Nc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; has gotten its first trailer, showing off the high-flying martial arts action and a new hero for the interconnected universe of Marvel films and shows: Shang-Chi (Simu Liu), who’s known in the comics as Marvel’s preeminent master of martial arts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EU08zd"&gt;The trailer serves as a short introduction to Shang-Chi as he faces off against the mysterious Ten Rings organization and its true leader, the Mandarin. The Ten Rings have been a figure lurking in the background for the entirety of the MCU, first introduced in 2008’s&lt;em&gt; Iron Man&lt;/em&gt; (and notably spoofed by a copy-cat group in &lt;em&gt;Iron Man 3&lt;/em&gt;), but &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; promises to reveal the actual group for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="w0WnSL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Marvel couldn’t wait any longer to kick off its next phase of movies and shows","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22348084/marvel-black-widow-streaming-disney-plus-theaters-strategy-wandavision"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5D9LQf"&gt;The upcoming film also takes some inspiration from the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2020/10/1/21495236/marvel-shang-chi-comic-review-gene-luen-yang"&gt;more recent &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; series of comics&lt;/a&gt;, which sees the martial arts master trying to enjoy life in San Francisco away from mystical (and family) drama only for his old life to come crashing back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tt7nz0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the first modern live-action martial arts-focused Marvel project; Netflix previously adapted &lt;em&gt;Iron Fist&lt;/em&gt; into a two-season TV series in 2017, but that project was developed by the now-defunct Marvel Television, instead of Kevin Feige’s Marvel Studios. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/21/14980216/iron-fist-problems-marvel-netflix-writing-villains-optics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iron Fist&lt;/em&gt; also suffered from numerous issues&lt;/a&gt;, including lackluster fight scenes, a bloated runtime, and a frustratingly outdated white savior narrative — all things &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; (with its considerably bigger budget, tighter cinematic runtime, and considerably more diverse cast and creative team) looks to avoid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1G6mnF"&gt;The trailer comes hot on the heels of Liu teasing the first poster for the upcoming film on Twitter, which also showcases a look at Shang-Chi’s full superhero costume (which notably doesn’t appear too much in the trailer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tJj1dS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Whoever said that you could only RECEIVE presents on your birthday? Today, I’m giving you your VERY FIRST LOOK at the teaser poster for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shangchi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ShangChi&lt;/a&gt; and the Legend of the Ten Rings!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming to theatres September 3rd (trailer drops in a few weeks). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WE’RE ALMOST THERE, PEOPLE!!!! &lt;a href="https://t.co/Kzgkg8djeQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Kzgkg8djeQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Simu Liu (@SimuLiu) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SimuLiu/status/1384129985712033800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l707yT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings &lt;/em&gt;is also set to mark Marvel’s return to exclusively theatrical films. Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346947/black-widow-cruella-luca-disney-plus-streaming-premiere-access-marvel-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which will be released concurrently on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1032060/9358?subId1=VergeShangChiTrailer041921&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fen%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; Premier Access and in theaters, &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings &lt;/em&gt;will debut in theaters only on September 3rd. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook ramps up moderation around Derek Chauvin trial, will delete posts mocking George Floyd’s death</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Minneapolis Area Continues To Grapple With Police Brutality As Chauvin Trial Verdict Looms" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uQJmkR3Pm77NvOjEhpbbF8knXs0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69149387/1313185888.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5CCRlj"&gt;Facebook says it’s taking extra moderation measures around the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former police officer accused of murdering Minneapolis man George Floyd last year. As a verdict in the trial approaches, Facebook has designated Minneapolis a “high-risk location” where it will seek and remove calls to bring weapons to events. It will also remove content that “praises, celebrates, or mocks George Floyd’s death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2VVHB"&gt;Facebook content moderation VP Monika Bickert outlined &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/preparing-for-a-verdict-in-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin/"&gt;preparations for a verdict&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post this morning. “We want to strike the right balance between allowing people to speak about the trial and what the verdict means, while still doing our part to protect everyone’s safety,” Bickert writes. Users can “discuss, critique, and criticize the trial and the attorneys involved,” but Facebook will remove content that violates its policies, and it “may also limit the spread of content that our systems predict is likely to violate our Community Standards.” And it will “remove events organized in temporary, high-risk locations that contain calls to bring arms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aOyP0d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Users can still “discuss, critique, and criticize” the trial&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aqrnZw"&gt;The company will delete “severe” attacks on Chauvin, although Facebook considers the former officer a public figure for “voluntarily placing himself in the public eye” — as opposed to Floyd, who is granted a higher standard of protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCDTmi"&gt;Much of Bickert’s post outlines steps Facebook is supposed to take with all content. But it indicates that Facebook could be particularly vigilant in, for instance, removing incendiary event pages around Minneapolis. Last year, the company was criticized for not removing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403004/facebook-kenosha-militia-groups-shooting-blm-protest"&gt;a self-proclaimed militia’s “call to arms”&lt;/a&gt; in Kenosha, Wisconsin, until a fatal shooting took place during the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meAd4z"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337583/atlanta-shooting-attack-facebook-posts-removed-supporting-praising"&gt;made a similar announcement&lt;/a&gt; last month around the mass shooting in Atlanta, Georgia, when it banned any posts that celebrated the attack or the alleged killer. However, Chauvin’s trial is a more potentially volatile situation, especially as footage of police violence — like the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56768217"&gt;shooting of 13-year-old Adam Toledo&lt;/a&gt; — has spread on social media during it. Facebook says that “given the risk of violence following the announcement of the verdict, regardless of what it is, we remain in close contact with local, state and federal law enforcement” after the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;
