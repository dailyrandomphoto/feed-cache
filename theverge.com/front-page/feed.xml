  &lt;p&gt;The senator on the future of antitrust law&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="fcnyvB"&gt;My guest today is Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Democrat from Minnesota who has taken up the role of antitrust enforcer in the Senate under the Biden administration. Her new book, &lt;em&gt;Antitrust: Taking on Monopoly Power from the Gilded Age to the Digital Age, &lt;/em&gt;is out today, April 27th. Klobuchar also serves as chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights. In that role, she &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396544/apple-app-store-google-play-monopoly-antitrust-bill-hearings"&gt;held a hearing last week&lt;/a&gt; focused on the power and control Apple and Google — but especially Apple — wield with their app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nmqnr9"&gt;Last year, there was a similar set of hearings in the House chaired by Representative David Cicilline, the Democrat from Rhode Island; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21078903/podcast-house-antitrust-chairman-cicilline-tech-monopoly-vergecast"&gt;I interviewed him on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about those hearings. But several things have changed since: One, Joe Biden was elected president, and he in turn has put some prominent critics of Big Tech in positions of power, most notably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22321092/lina-khan-ftc-tech-antitrust-law-regulation-amazon"&gt;nominating Lina Khan&lt;/a&gt; to the Federal Trade Commission. Two, it appears there is far more bipartisan support for changing antitrust law than before — in particular, changing a key component of the law called the consumer welfare standard, which has been around since the ‘80s and basically says that anything goes unless regulators can prove consumer prices will go up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZd4IO"&gt;That standard is basically impossible to meet, which is why most mergers get approved and why it’s been so hard to regulate the various platforms. In her book, Senator Klobuchar offers a sweeping review of antitrust history, starting from the American Revolution and the Boston Tea Party, all the way up to now. Her argument is that antitrust enforcement comes and goes in waves, but it is an essential check on a functional capitalist economy — and right now, it’s needed more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HoMaOi"&gt;I asked her about all this and about where she thinks reform is actually headed: does she want the government to set the rates Apple charges developers in the App Store? That doesn’t seem workable. I also asked how she thinks antitrust enforcement will help to make better products, since it’s not like any of the big tech companies are sitting still. And I tried to push on where the limits of antitrust reform might be — and how the senator is thinking about future innovations, not just the products and markets we have today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pABfQa"&gt;Alright. Senator Amy Klobuchar. Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Az6hy6"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP2477309155&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R22ISP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Azo8bY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sen. Amy Klobuchar, welcome to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dqz8ZO"&gt;Thanks, Nilay. It is wonderful to be on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gXUuki"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s actually great timing. You have a new book called &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antitrust: Taking On Monopoly Power From The Gilded Age to the Digital Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, which is coming out the day this interview goes out, so, excellent timing. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MjgICo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You also just had a very pointed hearing in the [Senate Judiciary Committee’s] antitrust subcommittee about the power that, mostly, Apple wields in its App Store. That’s a lot of antitrust action. Where do you think we are in the antitrust reform conversation right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMUvKP"&gt;Okay. We’re in a place of mounting political interest, which is where you want to be when you want to have momentum, but where we’re not is actually getting things done yet. And I thought the app hearing was such a perfect example because it was about Google and We found out that Google had called one of our witnesses — not him, himself, but his company, Match.com — the night before the hearing. And then, this doesn’t look like what you said in your report to your shareholders. That’s pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAedPp"&gt;When that came out, we found out how Apple, they’ve been charging 30 percent to companies like Spotify, but not to Uber. And the reason given to [Sen.] Mike Lee was, “Well, that’s because that’s cars and rides.” So, I think there’s some real problems in this because of monopoly power. And the reason I wrote this book is because we have a serious competition problem in our economy right now, and you’ve got to look at it. I tried to make it really direct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YRAHcb"&gt;I take my own story, [from] my,  grandpa working in the iron ore mines to support the Gilded Age robber barons and seeing  that big house, and seeing the little house my grandma and grandpa lived in their whole life — they didn’t even have a shower or bathtub on the first floor. They had to have it in the basement. — to the work that I did representing MCI when AT&amp;amp;T, after they broke up, and what it’s like to try to get a competitive provider on the side of consumers, actually, to get in the market. It’s not easy. I have over a hundred cartoons, so even if you get bored of reading the book, you can look at the great cartoons that are pretty funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrN1dX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I personally enjoyed the cartoons.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGoo2L"&gt;Exactly. I used some antitrust humor, which is very hard to find. So I make the case that when you go through history, America’s always gotten its act together and taken on monopolies because it’s drowning out small competitors and better prices and innovation; hurts you on wages, non-compete agreements; make it so you can’t go places; especially. I mean, there’s just this unbelievable number of things that have been going on that have stacked the decks against regular people. And so, that means action. And as I said, throughout time we have acted. Farmers with the pitchforks, unions organizing in Chicago against monopolies. And it’s time to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZOpNk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, the book has this incredible historical sweep. I mean, it literally starts at the founding and the Boston Tea Party, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVP2wV"&gt;Yeah, they were mad they were buying from a monopoly tea company. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KOZvza"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And it runs up to now, and there’s a big focus on big tech and pharma in the modern context. That’s kind of where your book focuses on at the end. Those two sectors, to me, they have kind of different harms that are occurring. So in the pharma context, the drug makers buy each other, they find a drug that a lot of people need. There’s a drug that’s used to treat infants in your book, and the price goes up by 400 percent. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovEqN4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the tech context, it’s something else that’s happening, right? Consumers are not seeing higher prices over and over and over again. Consumers actually see free to lower prices, and then it’s monetized in some other way. Can you solve both of those problems with the same kind of legislation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JV4wgg"&gt;I think you can, and you can do it a different way too. You could have special apps for legislation. This isn’t like one way, a monopoly way. We’re going to have to figure out what we can get done. But, when you take on exclusionary conduct, which is basically limiting others, predatory pricing, price gouging, like you see with pharma, or Facebook buying up companies. In the words of Mark Zuckerberg, these businesses are nascent, but the network’s established, the brands are already meaningful and if they go to a large scale, they could be very disruptive to us. He didn’t buy WhatsApp and Instagram just because he thought, “cool.” He bought them because he was afraid they were going to be disruptive to him. So, those are two different scenarios, you are right. But the end result is that they make one company bigger and bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="g8Of7K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="239Auf"&gt;And I think the reason I did sweeping legislation to cover all, is because if you just do tech and you disregard what’s happening with pharma and ag and everything, it’s like whack-a-mole. You’re going to change where the problem is. And so, I’m open to doing special stuff on tech. I really am. But I think that the best way, if I could wave a wand, and I think if a lot of people that’s looked at this, consumer groups, could wave a wand, they would look at: let’s do something to make it easier to take on merger cases, because the courts have really messed that up. The conservative courts and the [Robert] Bork theories. If we just get to the simple way it was done before, we’d be better when they looked at mergers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opbPD7"&gt;Let’s be more sophisticated about how we look back when we get into tech and other things, so that we basically have remedies which we already could use; they’ve used in the breakup of  I think that’d be pretty big, but just basically figure out in each case, what do we have to stop them from doing, whether it’s self-preferencing on search engines, or directly competing with their own products, or making very clear that you can’t charge 30 percent to Spotify and Tile and to Match.com, when in fact, you don’t need that much to pay for the security in the internet. You’re just messing around with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1f94z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you specifically thinking about setting rates? This is, I think, one of the bigger fears in the tech industry, that the government’s going to come in and actually set rates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OkOmES"&gt;There’s two ways. One is passing legislation just to make the defined exclusionary conduct. So it’s easier for the government to do it. Two, government should be doing this now. They should be looking at app stores. They probably are looking at app stores. There are starting to be investigations in states and feds all across the place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrIl6a"&gt;And then the third way is to, as you said, do legislation, but you could do it without actual numbers. You could do other things to say things they can’t do and keep the standards so that the government would then enforce the standard. So it has to be actual stuff that they’re paying for instead of just an arbitrary price, without putting the price on it yourself, which might be very hard to determine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70hIPw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reason I started with the difference between the harms consumers face from big tech and pharma is you mentioned the Bork theories. You went to the University of Chicago Law School. I was an undergrad at the University of Chicago. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OVKVp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dominant theory in the law is law and economics. It still is to this day. That is very much from that university. That’s very much &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bork"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Bork&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. And that is in the ’80s saying antitrust should be measured by the prices consumers pay. And that is called the consumer welfare standard. It is at the heart of this whole debate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZnF4e"&gt;It is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAtAcM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think we should change the consumer welfare standard?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmtMIO"&gt;Well, yeah, I think my legislation helps to do that. So in the old days, during the Gilded Age, they just said basically antitrust, anti-competitive behavior; they used pretty straightforward standards. Eventually, with Teddy Roosevelt, who was the first successful case after making very clear that courts, they were in the hands of the monopolies for a while, so [then] things started moving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XkkLN"&gt;And then, the Bork theory comes up, as many corporations are getting tired of getting questioned about their mergers, and he develops this consumer welfare standard, which includes things like, about efficiency, and we’ve got to protect some corporations. It’s kind of crazy when you really look at it. And then now, it’s almost like we’ve gone full circle, where you’re starting to have some conservatives, some Republicans, even major, major companies that start to say, “This is a mess, man. These gatekeepers are basically making this hard for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEa9yw"&gt;So you start having big companies and small companies question where the law has been.  So, I just think that it is time to change the laws themselves, because if you think we can just wait, when you’ve got Gorsuch and Kavanaugh on the court— Kavanaugh did one decision that was with the liberals on a tech issue, but for the most part, their paths would lead you — and Gorsuch is already there — to the most conservative interpretations of the antitrust laws. We could wait literally 25 years. And meanwhile, we can’t have these gatekeepers making every decision and telling— my favorite one, whole governments, like Australia: “I’m sorry. You want us to pay for content? No way. We’re just going to leave. And then you will have no search engines since we’re 90 percent [of the industry].” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkXux0"&gt;Now, world pressure, they backed off. But, that’s literally what monopolies do. So, I don’t think we can wait for the courts to change, so we must change the laws. We can also change the people enforcing the laws. Lina Khan getting on the FTC, that’s the nominated commissioner from the Biden administration. She’s very aggressive and smart on these issues. Tim Wu getting in the White House. There’s a bunch of things that the Biden administration can do outside of Congress to really up the stakes here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CE4PHd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The last time there was a set of hearings about tech antitrust, it was in the House. It was last year. That was Rep. [David] Cicilline, that was very bipartisan; your hearing was very bipartisan. One shift that I noticed though, the Republicans were very clear that they did not want to change the consumer welfare standard around the time of the House hearings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CdJJnQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And I watched these hearings and I saw Sen. Mike Lee, who’s the ranking Republican member, and he was like, “Yeah, maybe we should change it.” It was strikingly bipartisan in this hearing. He was just as frustrated with Apple as everybody else. At the same time, that’s very dicey. It’s not usually what the Republicans have been saying. Are you seeing movement there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tfyb1h"&gt;Yes. You see it in [Sen. Josh] Hawley’s bill and I have all kinds of issues with him in other ways, but you see it with that bill. You see it with [Sen.] Marsha Blackburn, who really is with me on the Grassley bill, the Klobuchar-Grassley adds tons of money to the two agencies by changing the way the fees are assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tg5FzL"&gt;By the way, it’s the most straightforward first thing we could do before we even change standards. And I think that what you’re seeing is [Sen. Chuck] Grassley really believes in small businesses. That’s what he has in Iowa, right? He is big-business present, but he’s got a lot of small farmers, a lot of small business, and he’s always been a maverick on those issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhLHgN"&gt;And so this is just crushing, what’s going on. And many of them see it beyond tech. And so, that’s why I think in our Senate hearing, which was like a model of how you can do a thing, people were actually asking real questions and were having fun doing it without being just complete jerks, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mao7Of"&gt;They were actually asking intellectual, smart questions. My favorite was when Mike Lee is trying to get to the bottom of why it’s different to order a car through Uber than getting music off of Spotify, and he’s trying to ask Apple, “I don’t understand why one gets charged and one doesn’t,” and they say, “Well, it’s a car.” And then he says, “Well, maybe I’m just a caveman.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qkC6pW"&gt;I thought, “Okay, that’s a very interesting description,” but I think that you’re seeing evolution as we speak. Now, let me not be a Pollyanna about this, because there are problems for me moving forward on this on both sides, right? I can’t even ever figure out where they’re coming from. At the end of last year, I almost got the Grassley-Klobuchar thing through to add $135 million to FTC and DOJ antitrust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RvbZa3"&gt;I got Mike Lee to agree with it with some minor changes. I got [then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell, [Sen. Richard] Shelby, and then of course, our side. Then it floats over to the House who were going to put it in. [Former White House chief of staff Mark] Meadows was behind it, the White House. Why? They wanted to continue the legacy of the two suits they brought on Google and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jtv5ze"&gt;Get over [to the House], [House Minority Leader Kevin] McCarthy and [Rep. Jim] Jordan just stopped it in its tracks. And so, it always feels like every time we move on antitrust, someone stops it. And so, that leads to me one of the reasons I wrote this book, is just getting it all out there so the public — and I hope that at least parts of the book, the beginnings especially — that people see the history. Which is somewhat interesting with the muckrakers taking on Standard Oil, and you get to the present with some policy ideas, including things that people can do as individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46xlVZ"&gt;I tried to write it in that way because I need help I want people to start calling out electeds on this, basically. I want them, Democrats, Republicans, whatever, “What are you doing on antitrust?” Because just me trying to do it every day, it’s really hard because there’s so much under-lobbying money going out there from companies, it makes it really hard. And then, I also think that we’ve just got to capture this moment where there’s growing support for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="scOALD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned Josh Hawley. There’s a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate. Hawley has proposed just a flurry of bills and ideas for regulating big tech companies. He’s also a character in the insurrection. Are you open to working with him?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PcXuXv"&gt;I am. He’s on the committee. I listen to him. I’m looking at his bill right now, but I need to work for my bill, basically, is where it’s going. He has said that some of the things in my bill are good and that’s where it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0b1Ad4"&gt;I’ve got to be able to get support of everyone. [Sen.] Mark Warner is on my bill right now and he’s pretty much of a moderate and came out of business, so I’m just working on building support for my legislation, and I think that’s the best way to go. Democrats control the House and Senate, and one of my key allies is Cicilline, because they did this great work over there in the House, and we’re working together on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XovO6H"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You talked about releasing the book to get the public on your side. Let me channel what I hear from my listeners and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; readers, and I hear this a lot, actually. The tech companies are not sitting still, right? Facebook is terrified of TikTok and Clubhouse and they are racing to copy those features. Apple just released a whole flurry of new products. People like them, right? The average consumer of an Apple iPhone, they get new stuff all the time. They get features.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rc5Wk5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monopolies are usually a lot lazier, right? The senator just waved an iPhone at me. The classic tech monopoly I think about is a cable company, right? Comcast, old AT&amp;amp;T, they provide you service, everybody hates them, but you’ve got nowhere else to go.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxX8JW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People write to me and they say, “Stop trying to ruin my Apple stuff. I want Apple to be in control of this ecosystem because I trust them and I pay a premium for it.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfPRMV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think that this kind of antitrust enforcement will harm that? Do you think it will help it? What is the mechanism by which it will actually make the products better?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzufRX"&gt;I don’t think it’ll harm it one bit. You’re still holding them accountable for all kinds of things on the iPhone, in the product, to make sure it works. They’re making a lot of money off of other stuff and they’re always adding different things. Okay, that’s all good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFOJvF"&gt;But the point is, that we have gotten to this point when they control this whole app market; So basically, you used to go to websites for everything. Everyone has a website, they mostly do now. But as the Match people described, the app stores have basically taken over the internet in a lot of ways. People are spending an average of four hours a day in the app stores. You could still have a successful Apple, but still demand more consumer protections to make it easier for people to compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXkjOw"&gt;You can still have successful companies, and I was in the private sector for 14 years, I think it’s great they’ve introduced these products. I think it’s great that they employ a lot of people, but there’s no reason they had to buy Instagram and WhatsApp because, in Mark Zuckerberg’s words, “They might be disruptive to us,” right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6V5Gbj"&gt;Well, that’s what tech is supposed to do. They’re supposed to disrupt. That’s a good thing, and add new things. So my concern is, when you look back in time, Standard Oil’s in, of course everyone is glad they have gas for their cars and everything else. And then, all of a sudden we realize, wait a minute, there’s no competition. So they broke them up. They were still successful in their own ways, but it helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hp2v47"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T was successful. They broke them up; that actually led to the cell phone industry, it led to lower long distance rates. It didn’t mean that they didn’t do great things and that people liked them some. People liked Ma Bell — that was their name, Ma Bell — but people realized, we can still have them, but we can also have many “thems” or other “thems” that are going to develop new bells and whistles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nADE0t"&gt;And I would say, not everything is great and cozy right now. It’s not great when we have all these privacy violations. And maybe if they wouldn’t have bought Instagram, maybe they could have developed some new privacy things that we would have liked. We’ll never know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGi0cv"&gt;It’s not great that we have all this misinformation out there, that one-fourth of Americans said they’d refuse the vaccine, that 65 percent of Facebook and Twitter disinformation has been attributed to basically 12 individuals on different accounts, and that they’re still out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgRaXW"&gt;And I’ve been leading on that, and I’ve just got to say, there’s a lot of things that are causing trouble. When a guy in a cafe tells me his aging mother-in-law still will not get the vaccine because she read a thing on Facebook that she still believes that it would implant a microchip in her arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OpS2g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right, but you could break up Facebook, sure. It’s not going to stop people from finding information on Facebook, right? Antitrust enforcement is just a means to an end, and the end is better competition, right? You’re going to break up the firms, you’re going to reduce the power in the market that’s concentrated in a handful of firms, but there’s all these other interrelated tech regulation issues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OZ76o"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s privacy, there’s misinformation, there’s whatever chaos is happening around &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 230&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; at any minute of the day, there’s the gig economy and unionization of Amazon. There’s this whole interrelated set of issues. Is antitrust just the hammer and you’ve got a lot of nails? Or does it have a limit to what it can accomplish?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkRR8f"&gt;Well, I think it’s one part of competition policy, but I would argue it’s a combo. We haven’t had any regulation on privacy, right? The states are starting to do it. Now, the companies are going, “Whoa, stop. We need a federal policy.” That’s true, but it better be a strong one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fIGoQ"&gt;So you can regulate things, but you can also at the same time hope that through capitalism consumers are offered new bells and whistles, and I know we get them on our phone all the time. For the record, I’m holding up my iPhone. We know we can, but what if you had more competition in, say, the social media platforms, like I said? Where a company had been able to develop better privacy policies or misinformation policies, and then pretty soon, because they had those, people were gravitating over there. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVeuR5"&gt;We don’t know that because Facebook’s the only thing in town in a big, big way. People gravitate over there, then Facebook’s forced the competitive market to do something else. We just don’t have that right now. So it doesn’t mean that it’s bad they’ve developed this, it just means that we need a check and balance that’s been lacking, and that’s all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2sLZ1"&gt;I think if you believe in capitalism and you believe in tech, and you actually want to keep those small companies going and not just all be purchased and squashed out in some ways of their entrepreneurship, then you better apply the antitrust laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOfGZW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned that you thought this hearing went really well. I thought this hearing went really well. One of the reasons I thought this hearing went well is that you didn’t have Twitter and Facebook there. And just the presence of Zuckerberg and Dorsey tends to just send things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIUu0H"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honestly, if you gave me the opportunity to generate a video clip of me yelling at Jack Dorsey, I would probably take the shot, right? And it seems like no one can refrain from taking the shot when they get it. But that’s a different set of problems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zKX8mZ"&gt;Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aeSWNo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parler competing with Twitter does not rise to the level, in my mind, of an antitrust enforcement problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXcCMb"&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kF6epd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It does feel related to, well, Parler got kicked off all the stores and they didn’t have a recourse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFqLf1"&gt;Okay. So first of all, these hearings, in general, they’re like one-night sound bites, right, if they’re lucky, where people are throwing popcorn at the screen, at these CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFmfCx"&gt;I think they’re important, to hold them accountable, have them there, but I just don’t think that anything could really equal what happened at that app store hearing, where we actually were searching for answers. We had a lot of the testimony, we listened to people that were affected. There was one really good consumer advocate that spoke, but the rest were companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrKdwD"&gt;There was a back and forth, and then they had some expert people from Apple and Google, and Apple almost wasn’t going to send anyone until [Sen. Mike] Lee and I had to explain that they were claiming they couldn’t send anyone because of their lawsuit with Epic Games which was like, interesting, because the day that you told us you wouldn’t send anyone was the same day that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/apples-ceo-is-making-very-different-choices-from-mark-zuckerberg.html"&gt;Tim Cook was on Kara Swisher’s blog&lt;/a&gt;, podcast, and talking about this issue? That doesn’t really work for us. So then they did supply a witness, but we deliberately tried to get some subject matter experts on this because we felt it was important to have actually a back and forth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wmfaL"&gt;Why are we doing this hearing? Clearly, some antitrust subcommittee hearings might not get all this attention. Why did I write this book on antitrust? Because I believe we need to get to solutions. That’s why I ended my book with 25 ideas for solutions. That’s why Mike Lee and I came out of that saying, okay, we can do a sweeping thing. We can maybe do [the] app store thing. States can do it, but we’ve got to start moving. So out of that comes action. We’re not just going to have these hearings just to have hearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMYqJ0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to ask a more expansive question. One of the products that I dream about all the time, and the industry is actively and energetically trying to make, is augmented reality glasses. The reason I think about it is every now and again, I talk to someone like you, and I’m like, I should run for office. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPTG38"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then I realize I am horrible at faces and names and that is just definitely a blocker to running for office. So if I have these glasses from &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; or &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and I could walk into a room, I could just see everybody’s name, maybe I could achieve my dream.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwkPJ7"&gt;Here on your glasses, is what you’re talking about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CY99Bn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. You’d wear the AR glasses and they would just put people’s names on it. People are trying to make this, today. I know they are. We hear about it all the time. Then I think about the technology that you would have to invent and supply to make that work. You’d have to build a lot of facial recognition. You would have to have a database of faces and names. You would have to know where everybody is all the time. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2CysG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then I think about, well, you would literally be augmenting reality. So if you have the Facebook AR glasses, what happens when you look at the Capitol building, right? Then you need this massive investment into content moderation. So Facebook is not literally augmenting the reality of the Capitol building. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpvJi2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They’re definitely building these glasses. Facebook has a division that is actively building it. I’ve interviewed their executives. Apple is rumored to be building it. Some of their schematics have leaked. When you think about writing this legislation, and you think about competition and what tech should do, are you thinking to the next turn? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMHNaK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because I think about those glasses as, there’s so much demand for them. That is the next breakthrough product in the world. If we get the legislation right, those glasses would be an enormous benefit to society in a real way. If we get them wrong, maybe it’s all over.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUOJ3y"&gt;Privacy disaster. Yeah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvjfcX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think to that level, to that term?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEX4ZH"&gt;Yeah. If you actually get the glasses and what you’re talking about is as much a privacy issue as an antitrust issue, actually, and I’ve done some work in the health data issue with Fitbit. Again, here I am [pointing out her Fitbit], so I’m not some Neanderthal about these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNV6bd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re not in the Apple ecosystem. You’ve got an Apple phone, you got a Google Fitbit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4ozfK"&gt;Yeah. The other product, the Amazon product. When I think about those, we don’t have rules of the road in place to govern that. That’s why [Sen.] Lisa Murkowski and I came up with a bill to say, it’s got to be your own private info. You’ve got to have a way that actually [works with] the HHS, because that’s health data, right? Can you imagine if you walked in and it said everyone’s health problems, too, and somehow got into what their records were? That’s a clear, what we call, a HIPAA violation. It could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luD4NY"&gt;So that’s something that has not been done, crying out for help. Then you add what you’re talking about, additional privacy problems. So for me, it’s always a problem with legislation. You have to write things in a broad way that encompasses what might happen in the future. The best way, I think, to do that is to allow agencies to write rules and change rules instead of just dotting every I and crossing every T. Like you asked about the rates with app stores in the legislation and that it is better to put the broad stroke, what the rules should be, and have the agency do it because they can be more facile to change with the times and have experts look at it. That’s how I look at it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yl2No"&gt;And that’s why I say the Biden administration can do so much, some on their own. In a lot of places, our laws have not been updated, as you know, on privacy or on antitrust for so long, they were created long before, whoever it was, Vinton Cerf or Al Gore, whatever, invented the internet, and long before any of this. So we have to update the laws to make it easier for the administrative branch to implement them and anticipating what you’re talking about, which is a whole lot of new stuff coming our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfTtyi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, you talked about capitalism and one of the features of American capitalism is you don’t need permission from the government to introduce new products. This is a product category that it is, I mean, it’s so close. It feels like this is one where it gets introduced, but if it doesn’t have a set of rules, then very bad things can quickly happen. But you also don’t want Apple and Facebook to come to you, hat in hand, saying, can we introduce a new product?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMbWVD"&gt;No. But you do that with safety things, right? The medical device, those kinds of things, pharma, they do have to go, “This is outside of antitrust.” They have to get permission for new products. So you could look at some framework if it starts invading privacy or things like that. There’s all those issues with drones and where they can be used with the FAA. So they’ve had to clarify that based on privacy and those are, a few years back, new things. So that happens all the time. But these guys have said, basically, “It’s the internet. It’s okay.” It’s not being like that. So we have to have some framework in place that they can’t just throw this out there and then afterwards we’re going, “oh my God, what just happened?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5H3UY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You brought up, this is all the internet. There’s still huge monopolies on wires in the ground, on broadband in this country, on telecom. You’ve talked a lot about big tech; when we talk about big tech, we almost always talk about the consumer companies at the edge. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19CArO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It feels like the internet providers, which are monopolies for most people, are not receiving this level of scrutiny. You used to be a telecom lawyer, you worked for MCI. Do you think that scrutiny is coming for the Comcasts and the AT&amp;amp;Ts and Spectrum Cables of the world as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eC2kZW"&gt;I think that you have seen with Comcast, when you look at the cable rates, they’ve gone up every year after year after year. Now we finally, especially during the pandemic, are starting to see more streaming, it’s coming alive as a concept in a big way. There is some competition, but they still dominated. They’re the textbook case of years of dominating what’s happened. So again, that’s why I just keep going to putting the right people in place, demanding more of elected officials, and making changes to the law that aren’t just about tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLoQmM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With broadband in particular, it would be very costly to put more fiber in the ground and run a competitor, a Comcast or whatever, in Chicago. So instead, at least on the Democratic side, the approach has been net neutrality. We’re going to just regulate what Comcast can do with its network. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UiswGy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That feels like what Facebook would like, too. Just let us be in a monopoly and everyone can yell and scream about 230 and we’ll implement your moderation rules to make one side of the aisle happy, and we’ll just be the regulated monopoly for social media in America. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jaM4E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s either the regulated, broadband monopoly direction that we’re going in with net neutrality or it’s the, we’re going to break you up and make you compete.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6XDNA"&gt;I think it’s both. I think that you’ve got to look at each policy. The problem right now is we’re just stymied.We have to be able to do both and figure out, it’s not one size fits all about the new rules for things like privacy, as well as doing something with more competition. So that’s why I’m able to work with Republicans on this and agree that we need to do something when it comes to regulatory enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPQbkN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you could wave the magic wand and make sweeping changes to the structure of the tech industry, what would be the first three things you do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HgIOan"&gt;Okay, well, first I would pass my bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2E8iHT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, you have to tell me what you would actually do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FEiR08"&gt;No, you said wave a magic wand. It does. No, it really does. It gets the money to the agencies, big money, including the change to the fee structure that we need so they can take on the cases. It’s not me taking on the cases. It says that big, fat mega-mergers, they’ve got to really show they don’t hurt competition. And that you’ve got to be able to examine some of the exclusionary conduct with the wind behind your sails in terms of what the standard is. I think that would be really, really key. And then that would help the private sector to start doing some cool new things for the consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4k9m5"&gt;Then I would look at privacy rules. I think that would be very important because we really don’t have those in place on a federal basis. Then the third thing I’d do is more specialized things in different areas that we just talked about, health data. I’m looking at some changes to 230 when it comes to liability of the bill that I have with [Sen.] Mazie Hirono — just passed that really important Asian hate crimes bill — and look at certain types of conduct under Section 230 to lift immunity, like civil rights and stalking and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1xD5d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notably, on your list is not “break up Facebook.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpZ4Ud"&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhRTxY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not, “split up Google and YouTube.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyUmmd"&gt;So unfair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTiop3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQqymh"&gt;Because if you pass my law, I can tell you right now, with the government already looking at that as a remedy in the FTC case that they have brought, that that would be right on the table and to me. I don’t mean break it into little pieces so it doesn’t exist. I mean, just as we did with the AT&amp;amp;T breakup take-off, which happens all the time. Oh, when companies merge, a lot of times they divest something. It isn’t radical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3H8t9"&gt;Oh, so you want me to just be like, wave the magic wand and just cut everyone in half. I want the tools to be in place so that when the government regulators, because I still do have faith in government, when they look at this, when Merrick Garland looks at this, he is super smart. And when the FTC looks at this, they say, “Well, this thing is really a problem. And this thing isn’t.” Right? I don’t want to just wave the magic wand when I don’t really have the data to do that. But I so badly want it to happen. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyPnNv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned the Epic-Apple lawsuit. That’s obviously happening. It’s starting, the trial is starting very soon.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;But that’s obviously happening in the background of this. That is a private cause of action, right? That’s just one company suing another.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GXmsP"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CEUlg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think that is a rich vein of actual reform and change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQepgS"&gt;Well actually, throughout time there have been a huge number of these private lawsuits. But they’ve gotten really slapped around by the Supreme Court in a bad way. It’s become very hard to win there. Tech is probably a new opening, if you look at Kavanaugh siding with the liberals, although that was before Coney Barrett came on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRsla6"&gt;I think that, of course, you want to have a plaintiff’s lawsuit. But they become very hard to bring because of the court rulings. At the same time, you want the government to be able to do it, and you come through there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9n2G4A"&gt;I think it was Bill Baer, who was head of antitrust under Obama, who said there are deals coming to them that never should have gotten out of the boardroom because they’re so clearly anti-competitive. So you do it on both grounds and certainly suits on exclusionary conduct and the like are really important. When I heard those witnesses at our hearing, Spotify, Tile, and Match, just talking about how they’ve been pushed around every time they try to do stuff and threatened to be pulled off the app store, it’s just classic monopoly conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zj40RU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For people who are paying attention to this, a lot of tech executives, policy people listen to the show, what should they be looking for next? What’s the next turn?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWO7hd"&gt;I think they should start...Oh here, what, should I become a psychiatrist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUhDJU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Look inside yourself. You should just break off YouTube on your own, Sundar.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5zfQ0"&gt;Realize what’s coming here. Well, maybe they can adjust their app store terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaIX9g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would that stop it? This is a real thing. People say even the threat of regulation causes better conduct. Would that stop it if Apple said, it’s 15 percent?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XyV2z"&gt;I would just like to point out — they’ve been super arrogant about some of this stuff. Right? You can see it in the emails, you can see it in how they treat companies. They’re calling them the night before a hearing. Like, come on! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G9blKY"&gt;And so, I think that they should start looking at making some changes themself, not just, as you point out, they’ve been doing some things on misinformation and content and the like. But they should really look at some of the fiscal terms and what they’re doing. So that’s what I would suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dh7I4"&gt;And then secondly, take it seriously here. Maybe you think you can hire every lobbyist and you can beat people up and try to go after them for whatever you do by hiring Definers, which they did a while back against those of us working—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQzwOy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is Facebook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VCkw8"&gt;The lobbying firm, to take us on personally. They can keep doing that or maybe think, that’s just making us madder. And do not rule out or refuse to give a witness and then Mike Lee and I spend three days learning all about this, because we’ve got to write a letter to Tim Cook. That didn’t work very well for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJTUNr"&gt;So maybe — and this isn’t vindictiveness, this is just people — they’re banking that we’re not going to learn enough to be able to do this. And I think if you saw that subcommittee, they’re learning a lot. I think that I would get ahead of this by actually doing stuff instead of trying to go after the people and maybe some of their companies and customers that they think are taking them on. That’s what I would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JysMwQ"&gt;And then I would imagine that the administration is going to be really serious. They’re going to put some serious thinkers in, that Joe Biden and Merrick Garland aren’t just going to let this go. And take it seriously. And don’t just do surface things that sound good. Start making some major changes to how you deal with the world and that’ll make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OIItbX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All right. Well, Sen. Klobuchar, you’ve given me more than you promised me, which is great. I really appreciate it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Thanks so much for being on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Tell people where they can get your book.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQmidY"&gt;Well, you can get my book online anywhere from your nearest monopoly. You can get my book in stores. But mostly I hope you get my book. It’s called &lt;em&gt;Antitrust&lt;/em&gt;. And I like to tease Pete Buttigieg, who, even though we were rivals on the debate stage, we’re actually friends, that in the fall, he came out with his book called &lt;em&gt;Trust&lt;/em&gt; and my book is called &lt;em&gt;Antitrust&lt;/em&gt;, so our rivalries continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="cjaduN"&gt;But if you care about this issue at all, I think you’ll have fun looking at the cartoons at the least. But you’ll really enjoy reading the history and seeing where we are and also seeing solutions. That’s what this book is about.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Golden State Warriors are auctioning team memorabilia collections as NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mfks7IJQHercw7qTzk-M9Eq4LTs=/146x0:935x526/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69191888/warriors_nft.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Golden State Warriors&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hH0cVN"&gt;The Golden State Warriors are auctioning off a plethora of team-related memorabilia as non-fungible tokens, the team’s first foray into the world of NFTs. The Golden State Warriors Legacy NFT Collection has two series minted on the blockchain: the Warriors Championship Ring NFTs and Commemorative Ticket Stub NFTs, which were designed by artists’ studio &lt;a href="https://blackmadre.com/"&gt;Black Madre&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cakkLd"&gt;The Championship Ring NFT collection features the Warriors’ six NBA championship rings reproduced as NFTs, with a one-of-one NFT combining all six championships into one NFT. The collection includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bOg4ha"&gt;1947 NBA Championship celebrating the first championship in league history&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="H1eGj2"&gt;1956 NBA Championship &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zg7dgx"&gt;1975 NBA Championship &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yHckyG"&gt;2015 NBA Championship &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AkgUCD"&gt;2017 NBA Championship &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BzCsAY"&gt;2018 NBA Championship &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lWiKbF"&gt;1-of-1 Warriors Six-Time NBA Champion Ring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Xw2ybl"&gt;The winning bidder on the one-of-one NFT will also receive a physical ring to be presented on court at a future game. The NFTs will be “paired with live experiences,” the team said, including a Warrior-for-a-Day experience, and proceeds from the auction will benefit the Warriors Community Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="d5XUmZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dVMCmm"&gt;The ticket stub NFT collection includes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FhaYWH"&gt;The First Ever NBA Championship (Game 5) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="j0nbRh"&gt;1956 NBA Championship (NBA Finals Game 5) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Y3QVzi"&gt;1975 NBA Championship (Game 4) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uI7eo0"&gt;We Believe First Round Upset (NBA Playoffs First Round Game 6), 2007&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZL1geN"&gt;2015 NBA Championship (NBA Finals Game 6)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="w1NKjp"&gt;Single Season NBA Wins Record (73) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="01MOor"&gt;2017 NBA Championship (NBA Finals Game 5) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WoItkh"&gt;2018 NBA Championship (NBA Finals Game 4)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qQ7Lch"&gt;Last regular season game at Oracle Arena Warriors vs. Clippers; April 7th, 2019 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O7XlEm"&gt;First Game at Chase Center – Warriors vs. Clippers; October 24th, 2019 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9bTzDE"&gt;1-of-1 Warriors Golden Ticket NFT &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ynu9IX"&gt;The auction — which only will accept the Ethereum cryptocurrency as payment — for the collection is now live and will run through the weekend on &lt;a href="http://gswnft.com/"&gt;GSWNFT.com&lt;/a&gt;. Given the Warriors’ large fan base among the techies of Silicon Valley, the foray into NFTs should be a slam dunk for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PA9m4x"&gt;This isn’t the first NBA appearance in the NFT realm — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;NBA Top Shot platform lets fans of the game buy “moments”&lt;/a&gt; from NBA history, sort of like digital trading cards. The moment where LeBron James dunked over Nemanja Bjelica in 2019 recently sold for $208,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIxojK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix has a jam-packed summer movie slate this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fvdEwTSM72UGXGXSMWMKeK675LU=/475x0:4075x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69191865/AOTD_SG_0049.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="biL1zK"&gt;Netflix released its summer movie lineup on Tuesday, and it’s looking like the streaming service will be jam-packed with new movies in the coming months. The sheer volume should help Netflix compete with Disney, which is gearing up for the July 9th premiere of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346947/black-widow-cruella-luca-disney-plus-streaming-premiere-access-marvel-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; on Disney Plus and in theaters&lt;/a&gt;, and WarnerMedia, which is releasing each of its 2021 theatrical titles (such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365635/space-jam-sequel-new-legacy-first-trailer-1996-website"&gt;the new &lt;em&gt;Space Jam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;day and date on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iurkND"&gt;Netflix sent me a preview of what’s coming ahead of Tuesday’s announcement, and honestly, there were an overwhelming amount of titles to sift through. It seems like there will be a lot to watch! I’ve picked out just a few that caught my eye and compiled them in this post, but if you want to see the full slate, check out &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-2021-summer-movie-preview"&gt;Netflix’s blog&lt;/a&gt; or watch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1nCZ7IAwA"&gt;this sizzle reel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mf0eTH"&gt;Happy summer streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LvzCBT"&gt;The Mitchells vs. The Machines &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="lniBF3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ak5dFt8Ar0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qtu6lh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mitchells vs. The Machines&lt;/em&gt; is an animated film about a family (The Mitchells) that has to save the world from a robot uprising while on a road trip. It’s produced by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who you might recognize as the producers of &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse&lt;/em&gt; and the writers, directors, and producers of &lt;em&gt;The Lego Movie&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Mitchells vs. The Machines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;hit theaters on Friday, April 23rd, but it’ll be on Netflix this Friday, April 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7dTt2N"&gt;Army of the Dead &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="rpDUMq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tI1JGPhYBS8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FJM271"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; is a new zombie movie directed by Zack Snyder starring Dave Bautista, who you may recognize as Drax in the &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; movies. It’s out on May 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MZMNkp"&gt;The Ice Road&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S17aN5bzVmSgF5ftY8yZzfEj1fQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472102/The_Ice_Road_00_42_15_20_R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Ice Road.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="THMKCw"&gt;Liam Neeson stars as an ice road trucker who has to lead a rescue mission across a frozen ocean to save miners trapped in a diamond mine in Canada. This sounds... awesome? Seems like the wintry movie will make for a fantastic summer flick. It will be released on June 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BspYeH"&gt;America: The Motion Picture&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MM_4tMbmovWCicjbphbMK_HypgQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472078/America__The_Motion_Picture_01_19_07_14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XqlrNU"&gt;I’m just going to share Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80189631"&gt;official description&lt;/a&gt; of this ridiculous-looking animated film here: “A chainsaw-wielding George Washington teams with beer-loving bro Sam Adams to take down the Brits in a tongue-in-cheek riff on the American Revolution.” Oh, and George Washington is voiced by Channing Tatum. It’s out on June 30th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new Fire HD 10 tablet has slimmer bezels and better specs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gk37LNSgCfoSL43oLXnGXhBeZXc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69191876/Fire_HD_10_Lifestyle_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The new Fire HD 10.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VzJhio"&gt;Amazon is &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/firetablets"&gt;overhauling its tablet lineup&lt;/a&gt; today with new Fire HD 10 models alongside refreshed options for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpbNgW"&gt;The $149.99 Fire HD 10 now looks much more in line with what you’d expect from a modern tablet, with a thinner design and slimmed-down bezels on all four sides. The RAM has been boosted by 50 percent to 3GB, and Amazon says the 1080p screen is brighter than before. It runs on what Amazon describes as a “powerful octa-core processor,” though it’s unclear what — if any — improvement this represents over the 2Ghz octa-core chip that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959152/amazon-fire-hd-10-2019-review-tablet-alexa-price-specs-features-photos"&gt;failed to impress us in the last model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lFLtP"&gt;Speaking of performance, Amazon is also introducing its “most powerful 10-inch tablet ever,” the Fire HD 10 Plus. This model has 4GB of RAM, a soft touch finish, and wireless charging, though again Amazon isn’t giving details on the processor. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21294989/fire-hd-8-plus-review-amazon-prime-android-tablet-fireos-price"&gt;the Fire HD 8 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, there’s an optional made-for-Amazon wireless charging dock, this time made by Anker. The HD 10 Plus costs $30 more than the non-Plus model, at $179.99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jAQkMtWs0V2jy8DQyeLdoww_bLk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472651/Fire_HD_10_Plus_Lifestyle_Productivity_Bundle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Fire HD 10 Plus with keyboard case.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xXUhmA"&gt;Amazon’s tablets aren’t normally associated with productivity, but the company is making a go of it with the new Fire HD 10 range. The tablets will be available in “Productivity Bundles” including Fintie-designed keyboard cases and a one-year subscription to Microsoft 365; the bundles start at $219.99 and the keyboards will cost $49.99 as standalone purchases. Amazon has also added a new split-screen multitasking feature to Fire OS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Maxs0p"&gt;As for the kids lineup, Amazon is introducing a whole new range of tablets called Fire Kids Pro. (Clearly, only the most professional kids need apply.) Available in 7-inch ($99.99), 8-inch ($139.99), and 10-inch ($199.99) versions, the Fire Kids Pro tablets have slim protective cases with built-in kickstands. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/09HqHsurFYHCMqvpxBxqV0LBJm4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472654/Fire_HD_10_Kids_Pro_Side.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Fire HD 10 Kids Pro.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oA9Uba"&gt;Amazon says the Kids Pro’s home screen “looks and feels more like a ‘grown-up’ tablet,” and the browser has an option to provide “open but filtered” web access, with parents able to block or allow specific sites. There’s also an app store where kids are able to request app downloads that parents can approve later, and the tablets come with a year of Amazon’s Kids+ service for educational and entertainment content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKrapZ"&gt;Amazon is also releasing a Kids Edition of the new Fire HD 10, which includes a “kid-proof” case, a two-year replacement warranty, and a year of Amazon Kids+. This model will sell for $199.99, and at launch Amazon is offering a 30-percent discount if you buy two of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v0bAqe"&gt;All of Amazon’s new tablets will start shipping on May 26th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hackers threaten to release DC police data in apparent ransomware attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sptSg1wovDpJvHmP3G5pRUju2xc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69191817/acastro_170629_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0BS2b4"&gt;Washington, DC’s police department has confirmed its servers have been breached after hackers began leaking its data online, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/us/dc-police-hack.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. In a statement, the department confirmed it was aware of “unauthorized access on our server” and said it was working with the FBI to investigate the incident. The hacked data appears to include details on arrests and persons of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEKcet"&gt;The attack is believed to be the work of Babuk, a group known for its ransomware attacks. &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dc-police-confirms-cyberattack-after-ransomware-gang-leaks-data/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BleepingComputer&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the gang has already released screenshots of the 250GB of data it’s allegedly stolen. One of the files is claimed to relate to arrests made following the January Capitol riots. The group warns it will start leaking information about police informants to criminal gangs if the police department doesn’t contact it within three days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5vUwYz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;DC police confirmed “unauthorized access on our server”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xoiE7X"&gt;Washington’s police force, which is called the Metropolitan Police Department, is the third police department to be targeted in the last two months, according to the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;, following attacks by separate groups against departments in Presque Isle, Maine and Azusa, California. The old software and systems used by many police forces are believed to make them more vulnerable to such attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibBrWj"&gt;The targeting of police departments is believed to be part of a wider trend of attacks targeting government bodies. Twenty-six agencies are believed to have been hit by ransomware in this year alone, with 16 of them seeing their data released online, according to Emsisoft ransomware analyst Brett Callow, &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/russian-hackers-target-washington-dc-police-department-in-apparent-ransomware-attack-12288183"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky News &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;. The Justice Department reports that the average ransom demand has grown to over $100,000 as the attacks surged during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkE8CZ"&gt;The Biden administration is attempting to improve the USA’s cybersecurity defenses, with an executive order expected soon. The Justice Department also recently formed a task force to help defend against ransomware attacks, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ransomware-targeted-by-new-justice-department-task-force-11619014158"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. “By any measure, 2020 was the worst year ever when it comes to ransomware and related extortion events,” acting Deputy Attorney General John Carlin, who’s overseeing the task force, told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. “And if we don’t break the back of this cycle, a problem that’s already bad is going to get worse.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deepfake satellite imagery poses a not-so-distant threat, warn geographers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="DigitalGlobe high-resolution imagery of Hackley Park in Muskegon, Michigan." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m_fFbwxGOpvkzjNc4NmbTAkl05s=/0x500:6000x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69191733/922455274.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Satellite imagery can be seen as inherently trustworthy because of the expense in creating it. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: DigitalGlobe via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TW8OwK"&gt;When we think of deepfakes, we tend to imagine AI-generated people. This might be lighthearted, like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22314980/tom-cruise-deepfake-tiktok-videos-ai-impersonator-chris-ume-miles-fisher"&gt;deepfake Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt;, or malicious, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21519322/deepfake-fake-nudes-telegram-bot-deepnude-sensity-report"&gt;nonconsensual pornography&lt;/a&gt;. What we &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; imagine is deepfake geography: AI-generated images of cityscapes and countryside. But that’s exactly what some researchers are worried about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBN8fx"&gt;Specifically, geographers are concerned about the spread of fake, AI-generated satellite imagery. Such pictures could mislead in a variety of ways. They could be used to create hoaxes about wildfires or floods, or to discredit stories based on real satellite imagery. (Think about &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/China_hidden_camps"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; on China’s Uyghur detention camps that gained credence from &lt;a href="https://techjournalism.medium.com/open-source-satellite-data-to-investigate-xinjiang-concentration-camps-2713c82173b6"&gt;satellite evidence&lt;/a&gt;. As geographic deepfakes become widespread, the Chinese government can claim those images are fake, too.)  Deepfake geography might even be a national security issue, as geopolitical adversaries use fake satellite imagery to mislead foes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fzLjTd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fake satellite imagery could be used to misdirect military planners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pn6gMR"&gt;The US military warned about this very prospect in 2019. Todd Myers, an analyst at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, &lt;a href="https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2019/03/next-phase-ai-deep-faking-whole-world-and-china-ahead/155944/"&gt;imagined a scenario&lt;/a&gt; in which military planning software is fooled by fake data that shows a bridge in an incorrect location. “So from a tactical perspective or mission planning, you train your forces to go a certain route, toward a bridge, but it’s not there. Then there’s a big surprise waiting for you,” said Myers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0zOMz"&gt;The first step to tackling these issues is to make people aware there’s a problem in the first place, says Bo Zhao, an assistant professor of geography at the University of Washington. Zhao and his colleagues recently &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15230406.2021.1910075?journalCode=tcag20"&gt;published a paper&lt;/a&gt; on the subject of “deep fake geography,” which includes their own experiments generating and detecting this imagery. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l2XlvD80PHX9SGFkirwRUDTulR8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472732/Zhao_deepfake_geography_fig_4.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ‘&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15230406.2021.1910075?journalCode=tcag20" target="_blank"&gt;Deep fake geography? When geospatial data encounter Artificial Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;,’ Zhao et al&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bo Zhao and his colleagues at the University of Washington were able to create their own AI-generated satellite imagery (above). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rFZ4N3"&gt;The aim, Zhao tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; over email, “is to demystify the function of absolute reliability of satellite images and to raise public awareness of the potential influence of deep fake geography.” He says that although deepfakes are widely discussed in other fields, his paper is likely the first to touch upon the topic in geography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxH6UC"&gt;“While many GIS [geographic information system] practitioners have been celebrating the technical merits of deep learning and other types of AI for geographical problem solving, few have publicly recognized or criticized the potential threats of deep fake to the field of geography or beyond,” write the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2vUWt"&gt;Far from presenting deepfakes as a novel challenge, Zhao and his colleagues locate the technology in a long history of fake geography that dates back millennia. Humans have been lying with maps for pretty much as long as maps have existed, they say, from mythological geographies devised by ancient civilizations like the Babylonians, to modern propaganda maps distributed during wartime “to shake the enemy’s morale.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2u5PG"&gt;One particularly curious example comes from so-called “paper towns” and “trap streets.” These are &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-fake-places-that-only-exist-to-catch-copycat-cartog-1695414770"&gt;fake settlements and roads&lt;/a&gt; inserted by cartographers into maps in order to catch rivals stealing their work. If anyone produces a map which includes your very own Fakesville, Ohio, you know — and can prove — that they’re copying your cartography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XAWnvm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lying with maps has a long, rich history&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iZRDW6"&gt;“It is a centuries-old phenomenon,” says Zhao of fake geography, though new technology produces new challenges. “It is novel partially because the deepfaked satellite images are so uncannily realistic. The untrained eyes would easily consider they are authentic.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxXhTo"&gt;It’s certainly easier to produce fake satellite imagery than fake videos of humans. Lower resolutions can be just as convincing and satellite imagery as a medium is inherently believable. This may be due to what we know about the expense and origin of these pictures, says Zhao. “Since most satellite images are generated by professionals or governments, the public would usually prefer to believe they are authentic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fZrTY"&gt;As part of their study, Zhao and his colleagues created software to generate deepfake satellite images, using the same basic AI method (a technique known as generative adversarial networks, or GANs) used in well-known programs like &lt;a href="http://ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com"&gt;ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com&lt;/a&gt;. They then created detection software that was able to spot the fakes based on characteristics like texture, contrast, and color. But as experts have warned for years regarding deepfakes of people, any detection tool needs constant updates to keep up with improvements in deepfake generation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4BCHR"&gt;For Zhao, though, the most important thing is to raise awareness so geographers aren’t caught off-guard. As he and his colleagues write: “If we continue being unaware of an unprepared for deep fake, we run the risk of entering a ‘fake geography’ dystopia.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify launches podcast subscriptions, but you can’t subscribe in-app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e_WsJyrK5La6kuqLJzTLIq6WqV0=/1x0:2515x1676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69191642/spotifypodcastprofile.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify’s podcast subscription product will require podcasters to host their shows on Anchor. | Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6OeSjg"&gt;For the first time, Spotify is letting podcasters on its platform offer subscriptions to their shows. The company &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-27/spotify-ushers-in-new-era-of-podcast-monetization-with-new-tools-for-all-creators/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its paid podcast subscription product for the US today, which will initially allow select partners who host their shows on Anchor to charge for content. Twelve independent shows, including &lt;em&gt;Tiny Leaps, Big Changes &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Mindful in Minutes&lt;/em&gt;, will offer bonus subscriber-only content, and NPR will launch ad-free versions of popular shows. A waitlist will open today, so podcasters can sign up to be included in the expanded rollout in the coming months, which will include international market availability. Notably, no Spotify-owned shows will go behind a subscription wall at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JsBST0"&gt;Podcasters won’t have to pay Spotify anything for the first two years. Creators will, however, have to cover the cost of transaction fees through Spotify’s payment partner Stripe. In 2023, Spotify will begin taking a 5 percent cut of total subscription revenue. That’s significantly less than Apple will charge; its new subscription service will take 15 to 30 percent of revenue. Podcasters have three monthly pricing options to choose from: $2.99, $4.99, or $7.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Au8s7"&gt;Paid content on Spotify will be demarcated by a lock icon where a play button typically shows up. To unlock the show, potential subscribers will have to navigate to the program’s dedicated Anchor landing webpage. Podcasters can choose to point them to that link wherever they want — such as their show notes, episode descriptions, or bio. Basically, they want to put the link anywhere and everywhere to ensure people can find it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9bQf2"&gt;Notably, though, Spotify won’t have a big subscribe button at the top of every podcast page, and you won’t be able to subscribe directly within the app. Those limitations could make it harder for podcasts to sign up new subscribers. (This also means Spotify won’t have to pay Apple for any subscriptions sold under its App Store terms.) Apple’s subscription podcasts, on the other hand, will let you subscribe from right within its app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ppiGlXXG36pouHFXLQXQ8-tx9VI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472728/s4a_Success_Blog_1280x700_A__3_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Spotify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Anchor backend will allow podcasters to choose the content they want behind a paywall.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JD6g8j"&gt;Subscribers can listen to paid podcasts inside of Spotify or in a third-party app through a private RSS feed. Podcasters will not receive the names, email addresses, or any other personal information about their subscribers. Mike Mignano, head of podcaster mission, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Spotify is open to feedback and considering different ways to make that subscriber / podcaster relationship stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4o77f5"&gt;“It’s crucial to our model that we explore ways for creators to connect deeper with their subscribers, so you can anticipate us to be sharing more in the space soon,” he says. Content also does not need to be exclusive to Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAFOYt"&gt;All of this means that, yes, NPR will be using Anchor as a hosting service for its ad-free Spotify subscription shows, like &lt;em&gt;Planet Money Plus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; Planet Money &lt;/em&gt;is already available on Spotify for free, as it is on other podcasting apps, but &lt;em&gt;Planet Money Plus&lt;/em&gt; will be a separate show page where the paid content lives. Anchor hosting is still free to use, and Mignano says the company plans to keep it that way, meaning some podcasters might decide to operate a separate feed off of Anchor to provide paid content within Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIr2ZP"&gt;As for why anyone would want to make this effort, Mignano emphasizes that Spotify takes no cut of revenue at first and only a small cut starting in 2023 and that having paid content built into Spotify means a better chance of having content discovered. If people search for a type of specific show, a subscription podcast could show up and gain a paid follower. He also suggests Spotify could curate suggestions of shows that people might want to pay to hear. He also says, because this can all go through Anchor, the subscriptions shouldn’t require extra work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6Tl5T"&gt;“I view this as additive and in no way as an additional, or burdensome, step on behalf of the creator,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgKDWp"&gt;That said, it’s the only way to get subscription content onto Spotify for the time being since the app doesn’t support private RSS feeds. If a podcaster already runs a subscription business elsewhere but wants to offer their paid content on Spotify, they’ll have to start using Anchor in addition to their usual hosting provider. This also means managing a separate backend system for analytics. Apple Podcasts also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;just announced&lt;/a&gt; its own proprietary subscription service that requires podcasters to use its backend to host paid content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLuCGz"&gt;Along with the subscription news, Spotify also announced plans to eventually launch a way for podcasters who already run a subscription business outside Spotify to bring it into the app. It isn’t totally clear how this will work, and when asked whether Spotify will simply support private RSS feeds, which it currently doesn’t, Mignano says, “it’s new technology that we’re building now.” The team is working with select, but undisclosed, partners to make this work and will be detailing the technology in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CN0YXu"&gt;The company also provided an update on its ad marketplace and says, on May 1st, certain Anchor users will be able to make their show eligible to receive ads &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion"&gt;through Megaphone&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s other hosting service and ad marketplace provider. These ads can only be inserted through Spotify’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/8/21056336/spotify-streaming-ad-insertion-technology-ces-launch"&gt;Streaming Ad Insertion&lt;/a&gt; technology, meaning that the ads these podcasters receive will only populate when their listeners are streaming through Spotify. (Anchor’s sponsorships feature, which encourages hosts to read ads for products and receive a portion of the revenue, still exists, however, and works across platforms.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQD8Gw"&gt;The bigger podcast players are becoming increasingly interested in owning all parts of the podcasting ecosystem. Apple has historically taken a mostly hands-off role in the space, which has still somehow resulted in Apple Podcasts being the dominant listening app, but it’s now interested in making money off podcasters by taking a cut of any subscription revenue made on the platform. Spotify is not only interested in selling ads, but also subscriptions, and companies like Amazon and Google also seem to be interested in the ad-selling portion of the business. Although RSS has fueled the industry’s growth, it’s increasingly seeming like podcasters will have to operate various feeds on various hosting services and platforms to build out a full business.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams was down worldwide for many users for two hours</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Od4mhF_Z7ZCezs6tDdjeC14bRoQ=/0x0:2640x1760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69191527/microsoftteams.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NfZPUT"&gt;Microsoft Teams was down and experiencing an outage worldwide for many users for more than two hours today. The issues started at around 6:30AM this morning, and were blocking connectivity for lots of Microsoft Teams users across Europe and Asia. Microsoft says it has identified the root cause for the issues and has put a fix in place. “We’re seeing signs of recovery and will continue to monitor the service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73LpIF"&gt;The connectivity issues were affecting users globally, with some Microsoft Teams users reporting 401 error codes when attempting to access the service via the web. Others were able to see Teams and channels but were unable to send messages. Microsoft also warned that some users “may experience degraded performance with multiple features” and that “any user could be affected by this issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2HjpOo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’ve identified the root cause and performed mitigation actions. We’re seeing signs of recovery and will continue to monitor the service. Users still experiencing impact should restart their clients to expedite recovery. Further details can be found under TM252802.&lt;/p&gt;— Microsoft 365 Status (@MSFT365Status) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1387018404532473856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XEnOGT"&gt;This is the second Microsoft Teams outage this month, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362975/microsoft-teams-xbox-live-down-outage-issue"&gt;issues with the service at the beginning of April&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft also experienced Teams problems for more than four hours last month, after an authentication change &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332539/microsoft-teams-down-outage-connectivity-issues"&gt;knocked out access to the communications app&lt;/a&gt;. Azure Active Directory also experienced issues as part of last month’s outage, alongside Office web apps, Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and other Microsoft services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJs8ld"&gt;It appears Microsoft’s service issues are limited to Teams this morning, with no other signs of Azure, Xbox Live, Office, or other services experiencing issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LpJNy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, April 27th 8:40AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with fix details from Microsoft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ADT sues Ring over ‘virtually indistinguishable’ blue octagon design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sNKVE0A4KivSUlz6FZUkC8na25Q=/6x0:2994x1992/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69191406/510658996.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ADT’s octagonal blue sign.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gXzGWL"&gt;Home security company &lt;a href="https://investor.adt.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/ADT-Brings-Trademark-Suit-Against-Amazons-Ring/default.aspx"&gt;ADT is suing Amazon subsidiary Ring&lt;/a&gt;, claiming its recent designs are a “brazen” copy of ADT’s octagonal blue symbol. The firm cites Ring’s blue octagonal &lt;a href="https://ring.com/collections/accessories/products/alarm-outdoor-siren"&gt;outdoor siren&lt;/a&gt; as a recent example. In the filing, ADT lists a dozen of its trademark registrations dating back to the late 90s that feature a combination of blue and octagonal designs, and claims millions of its customers display this symbol to show that their homes use ADT’s security systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3BOOf"&gt;ADT claims Ring’s use of blue octagons risks confusing customers and misleading them into thinking the two companies are affiliated or associated. In &lt;a href="https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/e36bab66-adb7-42d5-85fa-e30082efed42"&gt;its filing&lt;/a&gt;, ADT says “the striking similarity” is evidence that Ring is trying “to reap the benefit of the goodwill associated with ADT’s brand and reputation.” It adds that “this type of confusion seriously undermines the goodwill that ADT has cultivated in its Famous Blue Octagon and irreparably harms ADT.“&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zC8MnDwVjLfbIwKj_qL53r2v438=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472686/msedge_hdavxHV40l.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ADT LLC v Ring LLC court filing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ADT’s filing compares the design of one of its signs with Ring’s Alarm Outdoor Siren.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GKvqrT"&gt;As well as the outdoor siren (pictured above), ADT cites an octagonal “Protected by Ring” yard sign that the company started selling in 2016. However, after ADT complained about the sign, Ring agreed to &lt;a href="https://ring.com/collections/accessories/products/solar-security-sign"&gt;make it less blue&lt;/a&gt;, and ADT took no further action at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oORNQ1"&gt;In the lawsuit, which was &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-27/adt-sues-amazon-s-ring-over-brazen-copies-of-blue-octagon-sign?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, ADT is asking the federal judge in Florida to order Ring to stop using the allegedly similar symbols in its products, and to pay ADT cash compensation. When contacted for comment, a spokesperson from ADT said that the company “is determined to protect its customers, its employees, and its investors, along with its intellectual property and its reputation.” Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7R5sJY"&gt;The two companies have butted heads before. Back in 2017, before Ring was acquired by Amazon, ADT filed a lawsuit that claimed Ring had benefited from its trade secrets after acquiring a company ADT had previously invested in. The lawsuit led to a judge issuing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/5/16609880/ring-barred-from-selling-security-system-adt-lawsuit-z1"&gt;preliminary injunction&lt;/a&gt; on the sale of Ring’s security system. The two companies reportedly ended up &lt;a href="https://www.securitysales.com/automation/smart-home/ring-reaches-settlement-with-adt-in-zonoff-lawsuit-plus-other-developments/"&gt;settling the suit&lt;/a&gt; the following year for $25 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfV7XS"&gt;Prior to these legal battles, the two companies had worked together on making their security systems compatible, and ADT showed off Ring’s Video Doorbell working with its security system back in 2016. ADT says it no longer “actively promotes” the Ring Video Doorbell, but will purchase it for customers who want to use it with its security system. However, &lt;a href="https://www.adt.com/alexa"&gt;ADT still advertises&lt;/a&gt; that its system is compatible with Amazon’s Alexa assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="how72L"&gt;While its relationship with Amazon’s Ring has faltered, ADT recently received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352360/google-adt-investment-nest-smart-home-security-alarms-machine-learning-alerts"&gt;a $450 million investment from Google&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21523967/google-discontinues-nest-secure-alarm-system"&gt;until recently&lt;/a&gt; sold a home security system under its own Nest sub-brand. Going forward, Google said it hopes its Nest devices will become the “cornerstone” of ADT’s smart home offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSL1uY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 27th, 7:15AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with statement from ADT.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will reportedly face EU antitrust charges this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q4GwVxJLGZYoi4O8bBiGe2akZVk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69191330/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pqoXp2"&gt;The European Commission will issue antitrust charges against Apple over concerns about the company’s App Store practices, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/df07e3f2-2d6e-4ced-a819-779e743d85ff"&gt;the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The commission has been investigating whether Apple has broken EU competition rules with its App Store policies, following an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263453/spotify-apple-app-store-antitrust-complaint-ec-30-percent-cut-unfair"&gt;initial complaint from Spotify&lt;/a&gt; back in 2019 over Apple’s 30 percent cut on subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCD0Ib"&gt;The European Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;opened up two antitrust investigations&lt;/a&gt; into Apple’s App Store and Apple Pay practices last year, and the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; only mentions upcoming charges on the App Store case. It’s not clear yet what action will be taken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOPots"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18530894/apple-music-monopoly-spotify-app-store-europe"&gt;Spotify has previously claimed&lt;/a&gt; Apple uses its App Store to stifle innovation and limit consumer choice in favor of its own Apple Music service. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292625/apple-rakuten-kobo-app-store-antitrust-complaint-europe"&gt;Rakuten filed a similar complaint&lt;/a&gt; to the EU last year, alleging that it’s anti-competitive for Apple to take a 30 percent commission on ebooks sold through the App Store while promoting its own Apple Books service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zcTxKN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s all about the Apple tax&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XZSIfm"&gt;Known as the “Apple tax,” this 30 percent cut has long been targeted by companies like Netflix and Spotify. Apple has defended its policies, arguing that the revenue it earns contributes toward the costs of maintaining the App Store and enforcing its content, privacy, and security guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKWX5p"&gt;Epic Games also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286998/epic-games-apple-european-comission-antitrust-complaint-app-store-fortnite"&gt;filed an antitrust complaint&lt;/a&gt; with the EU earlier this year, as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know/archives"&gt;ongoing dispute with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;developer has publicly criticized Apple’s App Store policies around distribution and payments, resulting in Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;attempting to circumvent&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s 30 percent cut on in-app purchases in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Apple quickly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removed the game from its App Store&lt;/a&gt;, and a legal battle is now in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTHG8Z"&gt;Despite Apple’s defense of its App Store, the iPhone-maker has already sought to ease pressure from regulators and developers with App Store policy changes over the past year. Apple now lets some video streaming apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203630/apple-amazon-prime-video-ios-app-store-cut-exempt-program-deal"&gt;bypass the App Store cut&lt;/a&gt;, and it has reduced its App Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;commission rate to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; for any developer that earns less than $1 million in annual revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JiDk0I"&gt;These changes alone haven’t been enough to ease the fears of EU regulators if the report from the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; is accurate, and we’ll now find out later this week exactly how the European Union will respond to one of the United States’ biggest tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
