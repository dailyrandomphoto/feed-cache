    <title>Hulu offers a first glimpse at Amanda Seyfried as Elizabeth Holmes</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="97Ck3p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://press.hulu.com/shows/the-dropout/"&gt;Hulu has finally given us a glimpse&lt;/a&gt; of Amanda Seyfried as Elizabeth Holmes in its own take on the real-life Silicon Valley drama. &lt;em&gt;The Dropout&lt;/em&gt; is a limited series that centers around Holmes’ fraudulent blood-testing startup, Theranos, and is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/10/18216012/dropout-podcast-abc-series-theranos-elizabeth-holmes"&gt;based on an ABC podcast&lt;/a&gt; that goes by the same name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DPvlrF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Naveen Andrews, best known for starring in &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt;, will play Sunny Balwani&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kQW7dj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18305303/kate-mckinnon-will-play-elizabeth-holmes-in-theranos-miniseries-dropout-podcast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; star Kate McKinnon&lt;/a&gt; was originally supposed to take the leading role, but she reportedly &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/kate-mckinnon-hulu-the-dropout-elizabeth-holmes-1234910973/"&gt;dropped out of the production in February&lt;/a&gt;. Seyfried was confirmed to &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/amanda-seyfried-elizabeth-holmes-hulu-the-dropout-kate-mckinnon-1234940063/"&gt;take McKinnon’s place&lt;/a&gt; back in March. So far, it looks like Seyfried fits the role quite nicely; she sports the same updo, red lipstick, and signature black turtleneck that Holmes is known for. Naveen Andrews, who previously starred in &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt;, will play Sunny Balwani, Holmes’ ex-boyfriend and former Theranos president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yT7UZF"&gt;Just before things came crashing down, Theranos was valued at $9 billion, and Holmes was considered the youngest self-made female billionaire. The startup garnered funding from hopeful investors, who believed in the company’s non-existent ability to accurately perform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22834348/theranos-blood-testing-innovation-drop-holmes"&gt;dozens of tests based using just a drop of blood&lt;/a&gt;. Holmes now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22792606/elizabeth-holmes-fraud-witness-stand-surprise"&gt;stands trial for 12 counts of wire fraud&lt;/a&gt; and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and faces up to 20 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgESbL"&gt;Rebecca Jarvis, Victoria Thompson, and Taylor Dunn, the same trio behind &lt;em&gt;The Dropout&lt;/em&gt; podcast, will be returning as executive producers on the show alongside showrunner Elizabeth Meriwether. The series is set to make its debut on Hulu on March 3rd, 2022. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22824561/apple-theranos-elizabeth-homes-jennifer-lawrence-adam-mckay-bad-blood"&gt;Apple announced &lt;em&gt;Bad Blood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, a movie that follows the Theranos saga and stars Jennifer Lawrence as Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New York becomes largest US city to ban new gas hookups</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Grand Opening Of Summit One Vanderbilt" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k4L9GllDfQIDH_w_u0QPS1Ked7k=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70279030/1236032332.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X9Wopu"&gt;The Big Apple just became the biggest city yet to say goodbye to gas hookups in new construction. New York City Council passed a &lt;a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4966519&amp;amp;GUID=714F1B3D-876F-4C4F-A1BC-A2849D60D55A&amp;amp;Options=&amp;amp;Search="&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; today that prohibits the combustion of fossil&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;fuels in new buildings, effectively phasing out the use of gas for cooking and heating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWjrJb"&gt;Addressing building emissions is critical to New York City meeting its &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/sustainability/our-programs/carbon-neutral-nyc-pr-04-15-2021.page"&gt;climate goals&lt;/a&gt;; they’re responsible for &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/sustainability/codes/energy-benchmarking.page#:~:text=Over%2070%20percent%20of%20New,on%20energy%20and%20water%20management."&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the city’s greenhouse gas emissions. The ban will apply to structures under seven stories tall starting in 2024 and to larger buildings in 2027. The measure will drastically cut down on pollution that fuels climate change: according to a recent &lt;a href="https://rmi.org/stopping-gas-hookups-in-new-construction-in-nyc-would-cut-carbon-and-costs/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by clean energy think tank RMI, it’ll slash 2.1 million tons of CO2 emissions by 2040, which has about the same impact as taking 450,000 cars off the road for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9ihBHS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Buildings are big problem for New York City’s efforts to tackle climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VaGBZc"&gt;For years, the so-called natural gas industry has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22280080/natural-gas-stoves-air-pollution-climate-change-history"&gt;sold itself&lt;/a&gt; as a cleaner alternative to other fossil fuels&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;like oil. But scientists, and a growing number of cities, are no longer buying the argument. Natural gas is primarily methane, a greenhouse gas that has more than &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials"&gt;25 times&lt;/a&gt; the global warming effect of carbon dioxide over a 100-year timespan. Methane &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aar7204"&gt;leaks&lt;/a&gt; along the natural supply chain from wells to people’s homes. During a high-profile climate summit in November, the US joined over 100 other countries in &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_21_5766"&gt;pledging&lt;/a&gt; to cut methane emissions by 30 percent this decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8u0zjf"&gt;Berkeley, California, became the first city in the US to ban gas hookups in new construction in 2019. Since then, the gas industry has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/22/967439914/as-cities-grapple-with-climate-change-gas-utilities-fight-to-stay-in-business"&gt;fought back&lt;/a&gt; by lobbying for policies that prevent local governments from implementing such bans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hm37i"&gt;New York City’s new measure, which Mayor Bill de Blasio is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/nyregion/nyc-gas-stove-heat-ban.html"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to sign into law, is significant not only because of the city’s size but because of its colder climate. Gas proponents have argued that it would be too difficult to ax gas heating in places with cold winters because electric heaters might overwhelm the grid and lead to power outages. The bill calls for studies on the feasibility of using heat pump technology and on how the measure will impact the city’s electricity grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0nXFr"&gt;But the measure already has support from Con Edison, a utility that provides both electricity and gas to New Yorkers. The grid “is well-poised to support the transition to heating electrification,” it said in a November &lt;a href="https://www.coned.com/en/about-us/media-center/news/20211117/submitted-testimony-of-con-edison-city-council-environmental-protection-committee-oversight-hearing"&gt;testimony&lt;/a&gt; to city council. That’s because the grid usually sees peak demand during the summer when residents blast their air conditioning, it says, and electricity use is typically lower in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IuofLF"&gt;“New York City is taking a massive step off fossil fuels, paving the way for the rest of the state and country to follow,” Food &amp;amp; Water Watch northeast region director Alex Beauchamp said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple delays full office reopening and promises $1,000 equipment bonuses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Park in Cupertino" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lnpnMzFmSPR6ZAIBNuxzY3gu6ns=/0x0:5149x3433/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70279002/1236193236.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WsOlSF"&gt;Apple has indefinitely delayed the date which corporate employees will have to return to the office, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1471237100255252484"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1471236946160619524"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News’&lt;/em&gt; Zoe Schiffer&lt;/a&gt;. CEO Tim Cook sent an email to staff on Wednesday saying the return-to-work date is “yet to be determined.” The company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the date hasn’t been determined. Cook also announced that Apple would be giving each corporate employee $1,000 to use for home office equipment, both Gurman and Schiffer reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YjAOP"&gt;The delay comes as COVID-19 cases rise and the omicron variant begins to spread. Workers were previously set to return to offices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789631/apple-employees-return-offices-february-1st-hybrid-work-pilot"&gt;on February 1st&lt;/a&gt; in a hybrid work pilot announced internally in November. That itself was already delayed; the company has shifted its plans in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633616/apple-delays-mandatory-office-return-january-covid-surge"&gt;past&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfoFF4"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22838172/apple-stores-close-retail-covid-19-cases-infections"&gt;closed three retail stores&lt;/a&gt; this week in response to growing COVID-19 infections. On Tuesday, it began requiring customers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834419/apple-retail-store-mask-requirement-december-2021-omicron-covid"&gt;wear masks&lt;/a&gt; while inside its retail stores.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple closes three more retail stores as COVID-19 infections rise</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t79lnqUGVPOcFLxZr7K3KmONZxQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278293/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sG1QiA"&gt;Apple has closed three of its retail stores following increased COVID-19 exposures and cases among employees, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-15/apple-temporarily-shuts-three-retail-stores-after-covid-19-surge"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjqhNE"&gt;The stores, which are located in the Brickell City Centre in Miami; Annapolis, Maryland; and downtown Ottawa, Ontario, will be closed temporarily. Right now, Apple’s website says the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/brickellcitycentre/"&gt;Miami store&lt;/a&gt; is closed until Friday and the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/annapolis/"&gt;Annapolis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/retail/rideau/"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; stores are closed until Saturday. Apple reportedly closed a store in Southlake, Texas &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826604/apple-store-closed-southlake-texas-covid-19-outbreak-black-friday"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; due to a COVID-19 outbreak, though the company’s website currently indicates &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/southlaketownsquare/"&gt;that store is open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtBXPn"&gt;The closures are happening as COVID-19 infections are on the rise. Though the omicron variant is beginning to spread, the delta variant “continues to be the main variant circulating in the United States,” &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/omicron-variant.html"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. On Tuesday, Apple once again began requiring customers to wear masks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834419/apple-retail-store-mask-requirement-december-2021-omicron-covid"&gt;inside its US retail stores&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UdCj7"&gt;“We regularly monitor conditions and we will adjust our health measures to support the wellbeing of customers and employees,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We remain committed to a comprehensive approach for our teams that combines regular testing with daily health checks, employee and customer masking, deep cleaning and paid sick leave.” Employees at the closed stores will have to be tested prior to reopening, the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwc7rS"&gt;Apple has also reportedly pushed back its plans to return its corporate workers to the office. Its latest plan was to have employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789631/apple-employees-return-offices-february-1st-hybrid-work-pilot"&gt;come back on February 1st&lt;/a&gt; under a hybrid work model, but that plan has been delayed to a “yet to be determined” date, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1471236946160619524"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;’ Zoe Schiffer&lt;/a&gt;. An email from Tim Cook announced that employees would get $1,000 to spend on their home office, Schiffer reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6m6ul"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 15th, 5:14PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Apple delaying its return to the office.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Luna runs on Windows — and yet it’s hiring Linux gaming engineers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_SC4OhN135n0AMU0C_ytBlGlPgw=/0x41:861x615/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278732/msedge_r3ufclrsdh.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C2kLyH"&gt;When Amazon’s cloud gaming service Luna launched last October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455610/amazon-luna-game-streaming-windows-nvidia-gpu-servers"&gt;the fact it ran on Windows set it apart&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike Google Stadia, it wouldn’t necessarily need to convince developers to painstakingly port their games to an unproven platform. But it now appears that Amazon is considering a shift to Linux-based servers, too — the company is hiring three software engineers to bring Windows games to Linux (via &lt;a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=Amazon-Linux-Graphics-Jobs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phoronix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drT7AE"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22779252/steam-deck-things-we-learned-from-valve-developer-summit"&gt;Valve’s Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt; — an upcoming gaming handheld that also runs on Linux — the idea isn’t to abandon Windows games. Both the Steam Deck and Amazon’s seemingly new Luna initiative will still run Windows games, but both of them will do it &lt;em&gt;through &lt;/em&gt;Valve’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Proton compatibility layer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GN3vNt"&gt;“[T]his role involves working with Proton - a compatibility layer to run Windows games on Linux using Wine. Luna is committed to working with the open source community around Proton. This role will commit code to open source projects such as Proton and Wine in pursuit of running games in a stable and performant manner,” each of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1840068/software-development-engineer-l5"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1840070/software-development-engineer-l5"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1840069/senior-software-engineer"&gt;descriptions&lt;/a&gt; reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5TxX4"&gt;All three jobs were posted on December 6th, and they also all mention “DXVK,” a helpful tool that translates from Microsoft’s Direct3D graphics APIs to Vulkan instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xuXLqH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Why Linux for Luna?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nLy4X6"&gt;It’s not quite clear why Amazon might want to adopt Linux; &lt;a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/amazon-looking-to-stream-windows-games-on-luna-via-linux/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neowin&lt;/em&gt; speculates&lt;/a&gt; it might be about keeping Amazon Luna’s games easily sandboxed so that new updates don’t break compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEwDRn"&gt;The Proton gaming community &lt;a href="https://www.protondb.com/"&gt;will be quick to tell you&lt;/a&gt; that Windows games can often run well on Linux these days, though some have issues — and one category in particular, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816279/valve-proton-battleye-anti-cheat-dayz-linux-steam-deck"&gt;multiplayer games with anti-cheat software&lt;/a&gt;, can be problematic. Valve is pushing to improve that in time for the Steam Deck’s launch in February, though, and now it seems Amazon may help convince developers, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlodIH"&gt;We don’t have any indications whether Amazon Luna has been a success. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525339/amazon-luna-hands-on-cloud-gaming-streaming-early-access-price-games"&gt;We weren’t very impressed in our launch hands-on&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve heard it’s gotten better since. It generally gets even less buzz than Google Stadia, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300851/amazon-marc-whitten-fire-tv-luna-cloud-gaming-unity-role"&gt;it lost its head executive in February&lt;/a&gt;. But whether Amazon will follow through with gaming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686351/amazon-games-christoph-hartmann-twitch-luna-new-world"&gt;has been an existential question, period&lt;/a&gt;, and yet the company finally has a hit in &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, which has continually kept a place on Steam’s top 10 list of the most-played games since its September launch. Maybe things are looking up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="30laMt"&gt;There’s an unusual opportunity for cloud gaming companies right now because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791886/ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-consoles-games-delays-supply-shorage"&gt;next-gen consoles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22698588/falcodrin-gpu-hunters-nvidia-amd-graphics-card-tricks-bots-scalpers-miners-gamers"&gt;graphics cards&lt;/a&gt; are so hard to find and so expensive to buy. Amazon has suggested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22663690/amazon-new-world-luna-cloud-gaming"&gt;that &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; might come to Luna, too&lt;/a&gt;, and if it does, it’ll be interesting to see if that spurs a wave of adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCyyDJ"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iW4HQm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Swift Playgrounds 4 is live on the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YYSvEvjw7Zi-az0QEAAqfGSjwKY=/0x57:2400x1657/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278648/12152021_iPad_Swift_Launch_create_ipad_screen.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pWNBaw"&gt;Apple’s Swift Playgrounds 4 is upon us. Announced earlier this year at Apple’s WWDC, the new app allows users to develop apps for iOS and iPadOS directly on an iPad. You can preview apps in real time while you work on them and send them directly to the App Store when you’re done. The program is now live on the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id908519492"&gt;App Store for iPad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mF8rza"&gt;“Swift Playgrounds is the best and easiest way to learn how to code,” Apple claimed in &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=v868vy6e&amp;amp;1639593362"&gt;its announcement&lt;/a&gt; on Apple’s developer website. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friendly, colorful interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eRp10i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11924120/apple-swift-playground-app-teaches-kids-to-code"&gt;Previous iterations of Swift Playgrounds&lt;/a&gt; have largely been targeted at children. They’re meant to teach beginners how to code in Swift, and they do so through a series of friendly and colorful puzzles. It has not, in the past, functioned as a standalone developer tool — this is the first time that coders will be able to build full apps within the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Mfm5p"&gt;Apps for iPhone and iPad are largely built and distributed in Xcode, a famously complicated application that only runs on macOS. Developers have been calling for an iPad version of Xcode for years, and while this isn’t exactly that, it could still help to lower the barrier to entry for new iPhone and iPad developers who want to try out their ideas without investing in a Mac. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel thinks the metaverse will need a thousand-fold increase in computing capability</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xYgk_5Q7kRlbPSFJ_5r-yDG-5LA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278616/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WOywTE"&gt;Intel made its first statement on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;metaverse&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday — its first public acknowledgement of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;that sometimes-nebulous future of computing&lt;/a&gt; which promises an always connected virtual world that exists in parallel with our physical one. But while the chip company is bullish on the possibilities of the metaverse in abstract, Intel raises a key issue with realizing any metaverse ambitions: there’s not nearly enough processing power to go around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hm2kWE"&gt;“The metaverse may be the next major platform in computing after the world wide web and mobile,” &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/opinion/powering-metaverse.html"&gt;an editorial begins from Raja Koduri&lt;/a&gt;, a senior vice president and head of Intel’s Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group. But Koduri quickly pours cold water on the idea that the metaverse is right around the corner: “our computing, storage and networking infrastructure today is simply not enough to enable this vision,” he writes. Crucially, Koduri doesn’t even think we’re close. He says that a 1,000x increase in power is needed over our current collective computing capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="luVGr3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What is the metaverse, and do I have to care?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"},{"title":"Mark Zuckerberg is betting Facebook’s future on the metaverse","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rCYqxn"&gt;A lot of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;metaverse hype&lt;/a&gt; has been built around what you’ll do there, be it virtual reality meetings, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;digital concerts&lt;/a&gt;, and of course, blockchain and NFT-based integrations. And there’s plenty of excitement about the future of virtual and augmented reality headsets, too, whether it be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Meta’s Quest products&lt;/a&gt; (formerly known as Oculus) or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22825675/apple-ar-headset-hand-tracking-controllers-kuo-report"&gt;Apple’s long-rumored headset&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYiK5h"&gt;But the actual building blocks of the metaverse aren’t just going to be software and virtual spaces (which, of course, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/27/tim-sweeney-the-open-metaverse-requires-companies-to-have-enlightened-self-interest/"&gt;is its own fight&lt;/a&gt;, given that today’s digital worlds are extremely self-contained) or even the headsets and gadgets people wear to “get” there. It’ll be in the computers and servers that run the vast shared virtual worlds the metaverse posits as the future of technology. And it’s there that Intel has the biggest reality check: today’s computers are just simply not powerful enough to make those dreams a reality. They’re not even close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DTRxCi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Today’s computers aren’t even close to powerful enough for the metaverse&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pJb49w"&gt;On the one hand, the statement here is almost laughably obvious. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22825139/meta-horizon-worlds-access-open-metaverse"&gt;Meta’s flagship VR space&lt;/a&gt;, Horizon Worlds, maxes out at 20 participants for a space, and that’s for basic, &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;-style animated worlds. The state of the art in VR still requires thousands of dollars of PC gaming hardware, with plenty of drawbacks (like requiring a tethered headset and graphics that still don’t measure up to what 2021’s best flatscreen games can offer). And even the biggest traditional video games that &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; dealing with the added demands of VR like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547946/ea-battlefield-2042-bots-ai-soldiers-128-player-backfill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can only handle up to 100 to 128 players at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dg18v0"&gt;As Koduri notes in his editorial, we can’t even put &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; people in a truly detailed virtual environment with today’s technology. “Consider what is required to put two individuals in a social setting in an entirely virtual environment: convincing and detailed avatars with realistic clothing, hair and skin tones – all rendered in real time and based on sensor data capturing real world 3D objects, gestures, audio and much more; data transfer at super high bandwidths and extremely low latencies; and a persistent model of the environment, which may contain both real and simulated elements.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rNtyn"&gt;And that’s just for two people — scaling up to the hundreds of millions of users that a &lt;em&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt;-style metaverse concept would require much, much more computing infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KG7Abl"&gt;Of course, Intel also has a vested interest in saying that we need more and better computers and servers. After all, Intel makes CPUs (and soon, GPUs) for consumer devices and data centers alike. And if the metaverse — the hottest buzzword technology of the future — needs a literal 1,000x increase in computing capacity, well that’s just good for business. It’s no coincidence that Intel explicitly called out both its client compute and cloud processors and graphics products in its metaverse brief. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/80M4gUmTkwFFZojMV-yrD6C1rxE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792255/intelarc2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eDyK3K"&gt;The problem, though, is that even &lt;em&gt;Intel&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t think that the hardware alone is going to get us to 1,000x. As Koduri explained in an &lt;a href="https://qz.com/2101581/intel-is-ready-to-talk-about-the-metaverse/"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Quartz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “We believe that a standard kind of Moore’s Law curve is only going to get us to about eight or 10x growth over the next five years.” (Moore’s Law generally is defined as computational capacity doubling every two years, which tracks with the eight to 10x growth that Koduri predicts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tu6OlT"&gt;Instead, Koduri is optimistically forecasting that algorithms and software improvements will make up the gap. Things like machine learning-powered neural nets, or AI-enhanced computational techniques of the sort that Intel already is using for things like &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/adaptix/deep-link.html"&gt;its Deep Link technology&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22631061/intel-arc-gpu-alchemist-xe-ss-super-sampling-ai-architecture-day-preview"&gt;upcoming XeSS super sampling&lt;/a&gt; it’s planning to debut with its Arc GPUs early next year. It’s a big ask, though — Intel is counting on algorithms or AI to offer a hundredfold (or more) improvement in computing capacity, all on top of the growth offered by its existing hardware roadmap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToJyoG"&gt;Koduri notes in the same &lt;em&gt;Quartz&lt;/em&gt; interview that improved software and algorithms won’t just be necessary to close the gap in the ambitious five-year timeframe he lays out; they’ll be crucial to helping mitigate the increased energy consumption that trying to brute force the problem would create, something that he compares to the current problems with cryptocurrency mining today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lTyzaJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hardware improvements alone won’t be enough, either&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ubMZ9o"&gt;It’s easy to just wave a hand and say that software will fill in any gaps hardware leaves behind (especially for a company like Intel, which primarily makes the hardware). Plenty of major tech companies have flocked to the idea that AI and machine learning will solve their computation issues, for everything from making smartphone cameras better to offering upscaled gaming visuals, and it’s appealing to think that they might. But it still seems like a tall order to rely on them to 100x tomorrow’s computing, which is forecast to only see a 10x jump based on hardware improvements alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nje6Oa"&gt;The fact that Intel is thinking about all this now — and stating the problem — is an encouraging sign, though. It’s easy to ride the hype and start pitching fantastical ideas of selling NFTs that will follow you from place to place in different games and virtual settings. Beefing up server infrastructure and working to reduce latency is less sexy; but as Intel’s presentation shows, if the metaverse is ever going to reach its sci-fi ambitions, there’s a lot more foundational work that needs to be done in the coming years to pave the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="XdmFNd"&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for moms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zeosgij68RQdPjnroiORldVLV2M=/0x2:2048x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70144233/Mom.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Gift ideas that go beyond the flower bouquet&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="5etm1R"&gt;If you were to ask your mom what she wants for the holidays, she’ll likely tell you “nothing” — followed by something equally unhelpful like “your happiness.” That’s because moms can be loving, selfless superheroes who often prioritize the needs of their loved ones over their own. While admirable, that also means you’re not going to get much help from them when it comes to buying the perfect gift, especially if you want to beat the upcoming shipping deadlines and pick something out that will arrive on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZ0tVR"&gt;Thankfully, we’ve gathered plenty of great presents you can surprise your mom with. We've included a monthly candle subscription for those in need of some relaxation ($10), as well as a transparent pot for saplings ($30) and an annual pass that allows for unfettered access to our national parks ($80). And for the fitness enthusiast, we opted for the Apple Watch SE ($270), a smartwatch that is — lucky for you — more affordable than other Apple wearables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrhYJI"&gt;Below, you’ll find other gifts that cater to all kinds of budgets and passions, ranging from books and instant cameras to Apple’s latest desktop. Peruse the list and see if there’s anything on here that might resonate with your mom this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ray-Ban Stories get software update adding Facebook Messenger support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E1uwGxs3znoMNMrZe0Kl2-ocR_Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278489/alopez_210907_4736_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amanda Lopez for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m6Y3N6"&gt;The Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses are getting the ability to let you send and receive Facebook Messenger messages right from your face, according to &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10114157023473271"&gt;a Wednesday post&lt;/a&gt; by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. He says that the features being rolled out are just the beginning for the product, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;made in partnership with eyewear titan Luxottica&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9eg9h"&gt;Zuckerberg says that you’ll be able to use the glasses’ built-in mics, speakers, and assistant to send messages, have messages read out to you, and make audio calls using Facebook Messenger. He also promises that more updates will be coming in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fNlGDX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sending messages using your glasses feels very Black Widow or Iron Man&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F3P6so"&gt;Adding the ability to use the Stories as a Tony Stark-esque communication device makes them significantly more useful as a piece of wearable tech. The glasses’ main selling point is that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;they put a camera on your face&lt;/a&gt;, but when they first launched they weren’t a whole lot more than that. You could use the assistant to take videos and pictures, and the glasses could act as wireless headphones, but beyond that there weren’t many smart features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAVHZt"&gt;The update should also make some improvements if you use your Stories as headphones — Zuckerberg says you’ll now be able to control volume and track playback with your voice, if you don’t feel like using the touchpad built into the frames. Of course, saying “hey Facebook, pause” is probably going to attract more attention than just tapping your glasses’ right arm, but you do you. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VKLlCc"&gt;Spatial, an early player in virtual reality workroom apps, is changing its focus to virtual art galleries showcasing non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. The company &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211214005169/en/Spatial-Unveils-New-Market-Focus-To-Pioneer-A-Free-And-Open-Metaverse-With-25-Million-In-New-Funding"&gt;announced the news&lt;/a&gt; yesterday alongside a $25 million funding round. It’s a potential indication of where some “metaverse” tech might be going in the near future — namely, away from VR-heavy, work-focused experiences and toward more entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCH5Kb"&gt;Spatial’s original pitch was a virtual workspace where people could don VR headsets, talk to co-workers in virtual meetings, and collaborate by examining virtual items. But over the past year, that’s changed. The company says it’s gone from 80 percent of its users wearing VR headsets to 80 percent accessing it through the web and mobile apps, many of these users are more interested in social experiences than work ones, and it’s adjusting its priorities accordingly. It’s ended nearly all its partnerships with major companies (with the exception of Mattel and Nestlé) and shut down apps on AR headsets like the Nreal Light and Magic Leap One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zJvw12"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In the world of work, convenience is really everything”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J0fAma"&gt;Instead, Spatial is focusing on collaborations with artists who want to show off their NFT projects. The latest iteration connects with MetaMask cryptocurrency wallets and lets people see a catalog of the NFT art they own. They can then place the images into gallery spaces like virtual paintings, letting guests mill around and talk to each other with avatars or live videos that float above the avatars’ heads. Moreover, Spatial will let artists either sell NFTs directly through the platform or import 3D spaces and mint the actual spaces as NFTs, which they could then sell. (For now, it’s only supporting the Ethereum blockchain, but it could support others — potentially ones with a lower carbon footprint — in the future.) Today, for instance, it’s hosting a gallery and NFT launch designed by Renaud Futterer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40dqUY"&gt;Spatial says it is making the shift based on how it saw people use its platform, but it could also speak to broader industry trends — particularly the idea that people will work in a 3D “metaverse.” Meta, formerly Facebook, has bet big on the idea this year and launched a Spatial-like service called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22629942/facebook-workrooms-horizon-oculus-vr"&gt;Horizon Workrooms&lt;/a&gt; for the Meta Quest VR headset platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bERGgb"&gt;Jacob Loewenstein, Spatial’s head of business, thinks that world is a ways away. “There will be a day when I think people are wearing headsets to work together all day. But that day is not today,” he says. The company has had more success with NFT art, where it adds a sense of heft to something that’s otherwise just a flat image. “Art is quite typically a very experiential medium,” says Loewenstein. “And you can’t do that by just throwing something on a boring old web page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4wBcx"&gt;It may simply be harder for a small company to compete head-to-head with a product from Meta, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"&gt;isn’t a new issue&lt;/a&gt; for VR developers. But “metaverse” platforms also remain clunky enough that making people use them for a required work event can be a recipe for frustration. When I entered Spatial for a meeting, I ended up encountering a bug that forced me to drop and conduct part of the interview over Zoom, and I’ve had a similarly frustrating experience syncing up with other people on Horizon Workrooms. “In the world of work, convenience is really everything,” says Loewenstein. Spatial is betting that in the world of art, people will be more willing to take a leap into its 3D world.&lt;/p&gt;
