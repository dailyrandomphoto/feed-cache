    <title>Moxie Marlinspike steps down as CEO of Signal</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ldO4TX"&gt;Signal founder Moxie Marlinspike is stepping down as CEO of the company, he announced &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/new-year-new-ceo/"&gt;in a blog post on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Executive chairman Brian Acton will serve as acting CEO until a replacement is found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgaLsG"&gt;“Every day, I’m struck by how boundless Signal’s potential looks, and I want to bring in someone with fresh energy and commitment to make the most of that,” Marlinspike wrote. “I now feel very comfortable replacing myself as CEO based on the team we have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEoFGO"&gt;Founded in 2014, Signal has grown into one of the most trusted and robust apps for encrypted messaging. The service has more than 40 million monthly users and is regularly recommended in security guides. Established as a nonprofit, the company is not supported by advertising or app sales, instead relying on donations and&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814934/signal-launches-in-app-sustainer-program-donations-messaging-secure"&gt; a recently launched sustainer program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDXg8m"&gt;The app saw a rush of new users in early 2021 in response to a new privacy policy from its competitor WhatsApp — but the success wasn’t without controversy. Workers within Signal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22249391/signal-app-abuse-messaging-employees-violence-misinformation"&gt;raised concerns to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s refusal to maintain content policies could lead to potential misuse of the service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned about the Shazam Chrome extension</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PqXZuwGh_djnMXZ6GVk4YQewQe8=/20x0:620x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370901/unnamed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shazam is available in yet another place.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Shazam&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kQ9wq6"&gt;Today I learned about &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shazam/mmioliijnhnoblpgimnlajmefafdfilb/"&gt;Shazam’s Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to have been out for about a month and can help you identify music playing on the webpage you’re viewing. Having the app directly in Chrome could help you figure out what song is playing in an ad, trailer, or livestream without having to mess around with your phone. (Thanks to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/10/shazam-chrome-extension/"&gt;finding and pointing out&lt;/a&gt; this nifty tool.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4avPNB"&gt;The extension does everything I’d expect it to — you go to the tab where music is playing, press the Shazam button, and it’ll try to identify the song. If it succeeds, it’ll give you a link to the song in Apple Music (serving as your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444506/apple-ios-14-2-beta-shazam-identify-music-phone-apps-headphones"&gt;occasional reminder&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17896350/apple-shazam-app-acquisition-complete-free"&gt;Apple owns Shazam&lt;/a&gt;). It’ll also keep track of the songs you’ve identified in a running list and let you link your Apple Music account. Doing so will let you listen to the entire song in the extension instead of just a preview.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E7ApkZRVK2gvI6yNVYB6ZRk3enI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23158838/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_10.51.51.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see the songs you’ve Shazamed, and listen to them if you’ve connected your Apple Music account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZbU8i"&gt;I had decent luck testing it out — it worked on YouTube, Twitch, SoundCloud, and even Wikipedia. Most of the time, it even got the song right, though that more so speaks to Shazam’s engine than the extension itself. I did occasionally notice that the actual audio coming out of my speakers would get a bit staticky or skip slightly while Shazam was doing its thing, but it didn’t happen every time and wasn’t unbearable when it did. It’s also worth noting that your mileage may vary here — &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/10/shazam-chrome-extension/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and several reviews on the &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shazam/mmioliijnhnoblpgimnlajmefafdfilb"&gt;Chrome Web Store&lt;/a&gt; report that they weren’t able to get the app working.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LEUrCCP_ervdCRcSHUHdqHG0cZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23158659/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_09.55.32.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I also learned today that Wikipedia captions songs, to incredible effect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kNBMPU"&gt;I’ll probably keep this extension installed because it’s easy to imagine times when it’d be useful — some tech companies play pretty great music before their livestreams, and I’ve wasted more time than I’d care to admit in the comment sections of movie trailers trying to sus out the song playing in the background. Of course, most of the time, I could just ask Siri what song’s playing (or use Snapchat, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/13/13936586/shazam-now-inside-snapchat-update"&gt;which has Shazam built into it&lt;/a&gt;), but when my phone’s in another room or I’m using headphones, having an extension to do the same thing could come in handy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Greenhouse gas emissions jumped in 2021, despite Biden’s climate pledges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-ECONOMY-TRANSPORT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tzvxXFkAQcxN70KxOZDZlGQy83s=/0x0:3263x2175/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370860/1236632579.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pbzVum"&gt;After falling more sharply than at any point &lt;a href="https://rhg.com/research/preliminary-us-emissions-2020/"&gt;since World War II&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, US greenhouse gas emissions rebounded from the pandemic in 2021 — likely growing faster than the nation’s economy did last year, according to a preliminary &lt;a href="https://rhg.com/research/preliminary-us-emissions-2021/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by research firm Rhodium Group. The rise in planet-heating pollution risks putting the US’s climate goals further out of reach, Rhodium warns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXIBkn"&gt;Greenhouse gas emissions rose 6.2 percent last year compared to 2020, Rhodium found. That’s slightly higher than initial estimates for economic growth in 2021: a 5.7 percent rise in GDP, according to Goldman Sachs.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It’s the latest evidence that as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309374/global-china-carbon-dioxide-emissions-rising"&gt;countries return to their old, polluting habits&lt;/a&gt;, the pandemic will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522736/carbon-dioxide-co2-record-climate-change"&gt;do little to slow down climate change&lt;/a&gt; in the absence of more intentional pollution cuts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u1yrQQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The pandemic will do little to slow down climate change in the absence of more intentional pollution cuts. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KBZfiL"&gt;The biggest culprits behind the US’s jump in pollution last year are diesel trucks and coal plants, Rhodium’s analysis found. Transportation was already the US’s &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks"&gt;biggest source&lt;/a&gt; of emissions before COVID-19 stalled economic activity in 2020. But a new trend emerged during the pandemic: demand for diesel outpaced gasoline. As people stayed at home to curb the spread of COVID-19, many picked up new hobbies, fixed up their homes, and shopped online more — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22800410/black-friday-holiday-shopping-supply-chain-pollution-ports-warehouses-california"&gt;keeping trucks busy with deliveries&lt;/a&gt;. Road freight was the only category of transportation that saw fuel demand surpass pre-pandemic levels in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5xPOD"&gt;Coal made a notable “comeback” last year, Rhodium says, after &lt;a href="https://grist.org/energy/coal-use-was-dying-then-2021-happened-carbon-emissions-rise/"&gt;falling steadily&lt;/a&gt; for more than half a decade. Coal-fired power generation grew for the first time since 2014. Low natural gas prices have largely contributed to coal’s demise over the years, but last year, natural gas prices soared after an unusual cold snap dealt a double whammy to the US — it froze production and drove demand up for heating. Low stocks of natural gas in the US and abroad &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=50778"&gt;continued to keep prices high&lt;/a&gt; for much of the year. At the same time, economic recovery from the pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641178/global-power-sector-emissions-rise-pandemic"&gt;upped demand for electricity&lt;/a&gt;. Altogether, it was a &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/coal-power-s-sharp-rebound-is-taking-it-to-a-new-record-in-2021-threatening-net-zero-goals"&gt;boon to coal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBluTL"&gt;There was some good news in the Rhodium analysis: renewable energy grew in 2021, reaching 20 percent of US electricity generation for the first time. Solar power is poised to have a pretty good year in 2022 — it’ll make up almost half of all newly installed capacity to the power grid, &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=50818"&gt;according to the US Energy Information Administration&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zxckiw"&gt;After Joe Biden stepped into office last year, he re-committed the US to the Paris climate agreement and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22394366/joe-biden-pledge-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2030"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; to slash the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions in half from peak levels in 2005 by the end of the decade. That will require a steady, year-on-year drop in greenhouse gas emissions. Rhodium’s latest tally, however, shows that the US was headed in the opposite direction last year. While the pandemic-related shutdowns dropped US greenhouse gas pollution by more than 22 percent from 2005 levels in 2020, emissions only fell by about 17 percent in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch Series 8 may not have a body temperature sensor after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The screen is 20 percent larger on the Apple Watch Series 7" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bDkDzzOZvg3BIpaWTSWwvJu1eow=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370410/vpavic_211006_4796_0039.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Series 7’s big update was a larger screen, which some found disappointing.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SqtZvC"&gt;If you were hoping for more exciting updates with the Apple Watch Series 8, you might have to start tempering expectations. While it was initially thought that the next-generation watch would have a body temperature sensor, it’s looking like that may not be the case after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVGhLU"&gt;A body temperature sensor for the Series 8 has been heavily rumored for some time now. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman — who has a pretty good track record when it comes to Apple rumors — first hinted &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=P6Q0mxvj"&gt;a body temperature sensor was coming&lt;/a&gt; in June. That was echoed by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; in September for &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-blood-pressure-measure-wrist-thermometer-in-watch-11630501201#refreshed?mod=latest_headlines"&gt;a potential fertility feature&lt;/a&gt;. Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/apple-watch-series-8-thermometer/"&gt;predicted a body temperature sensor&lt;/a&gt; that same month. All in all, there have been several solid reasons to believe this was in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ariKjy"&gt;However, in his latest &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, Gurman has backtracked. When speaking about the Series 8’s potential for body temperature sensing, blood glucose monitoring, and blood pressure capabilities, Gurman wrote, “Don’t expect any of these soon, though. Body temperature was on this year’s roadmap, but chatter about it has slowed down recently. Blood pressure is at least two to three years away, while I wouldn’t be surprised if glucose monitoring doesn’t land until later in the second half of the decade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLqx2T"&gt;For blood pressure and blood glucose, this makes a lot of sense. While there’s been a lot of headway in noninvasive, cuffless blood pressure monitoring in wearables, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677381/smartwatch-blood-pressure-samsung-fitbit-apple"&gt;the technology simply isn’t there yet&lt;/a&gt;. The same applies to blood glucose monitoring. Although the feature was &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rumor-has-it-the-next-samsung-apple-smartwatches-might-1846124296"&gt;rumored for the Series 7 and in Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt;, it never materialized. The tech does exist in a nascent form — a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/these-are-the-wearables-that-stood-out-at-ces-2021-1846053707?rev=1610579714156"&gt;prototype from Japanese startup Quantum Operation&lt;/a&gt; was featured at CES 2021 — but it’s nowhere near ready for consumer-grade devices. Of the rumored features, body temperature sensors seemed most likely as they’re already available in several other consumer wearables, including those from rivals like Fitbit. In fact, body temperature sensors in wearables gained a lot of attention in 2020, when researchers used them to try to determine whether &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535204/apple-watch-fitbit-oura-wearables-illness-prediction"&gt;smartwatches could&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/can-a-smart-watch-detect-covid-19-1833409102"&gt;detect COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QjT3c"&gt;Currently, body temperature sensors are mostly used for sleep and recovery tracking, though &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-this-fertility-apps-first-scientific-study-is-so-ex-1834849462"&gt;fertility wearables like Ava&lt;/a&gt; may also feature them. While Apple has added sleep and period tracking in the past few years, they’re on the simpler side. Adding a body temperature sensor would potentially help level up these particular features, especially if the company is planning on adding fertility-related features as reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. However, Apple is notorious for sitting on features other device makers have already implemented until it’s happy with its own version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x5M4RI"&gt;“Chatter slowing down,” as Gurman puts it, doesn’t mean a body temperature feature is completely dead. However, it does bring up another point: perhaps it’s unrealistic to expect Apple to introduce a new groundbreaking, industry-leading feature every year on its smartwatch. It’s true that since the Series 3, Apple has outpaced the competition when it came to advanced smartwatch capabilities. The Series 3 introduced cellular, the Series 4 changed the design and added FDA-cleared EKGs, the Series 5 added an always-on display, and the Series 6 added a SpO2 (blood oxygen) sensor. However, the additions have been less buzz-worthy starting with the Series 6. Not only have SpO2 sensors been on smartwatches since 2017, but the Series 7’s marquee feature was also just a larger screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id9Von"&gt;Right now, the Apple Watch is the &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/524806/global-smartwatch-vendor-shipments/"&gt;most popular smartwatch on the market&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple has a yearslong lead on the competition. Wear OS watches are amid a complicated transition to a new unified platform with Samsung. Fitbit and Garmin may have advanced health features and better battery, but they both lag in smart features like cellular connectivity. Samsung comes closest, but many of its health and fitness features aren’t quite as polished.  Technically speaking, there’s no &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; for Apple at the moment to dramatically shake things up in the short term — especially as it’s already investing resources in more groundbreaking health research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lYak6"&gt;Advanced health features, especially nascent ones like noninvasive blood pressure and blood glucose, will take a while before they’re ready for consumer use. And even when they are “ready,” they’ll probably have to go through the FDA clearance process. In the meantime, it’s more than likely that future Apple Watch updates will focus more on design, incremental hardware upgrades, and software updates that make use of existing sensors. Case in point: Gurman &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=P6Q0mxvj"&gt;also forecasted&lt;/a&gt; the Series 8 would see a rugged sports version and a new entry-level model. That said, perhaps we’d all settle down if Apple could finally figure out how to include multiday battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4riQuZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FCC’s still in a stalemate a year into Biden’s presidency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-RWj_Us-3s6Jx1ZnNyJdYe5ZH5E=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370245/acastro_170711_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tmkiI1"&gt;After nearly a year into Joe Biden’s presidency, new pressure is mounting on the Senate to expeditiously confirm nominations for positions at two of the federal government’s top agencies with control over broadband and data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDGCMl"&gt;In new statements issued on Monday, public interest groups Free Press Action and Fight for the Future called on the Senate Commerce Committee to fill the final seats at the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. Both Gigi Sohn and Alvaro Bedoya, for the FCC and FTC, respectively, have finished their confirmation hearing processes, but neither nomination has received a final committee vote to set them up for floor confirmation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6itOiX"&gt;“Americans are in desperate need of these consumer protection agencies as their dependence on affordable access to the open Internet has grown during the pandemic,” &lt;a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2022-01-10-senate-democrats-need-to-stop-dragging-their-feet-on-fcc-and-ftc-nominations/"&gt;Fight for the Future said in a statement on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. “Industry insiders have openly admitted that they are pushing for these delays because it benefits their bottom line, at the expense of the public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3tgbU"&gt;With open seats at these agencies, the FCC and FTC are unable to press forward on any partisan measures or Democratic policy priorities, like net neutrality. Late last year, Jessica Rosenworcel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787261/biden-fcc-net-neutrality-jessica-rosenworcel-gigi-sohn-broadband"&gt;was confirmed as FCC chair&lt;/a&gt;, but no votes have been lined up for Sohn, Biden’s pick as the last remaining Democratic commissioner. Democratic FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra stepped down from the agency after he was confirmed to lead the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau in October, leaving the FTC at a 2-2 deadlock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2BfPD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/04/nominations-sent-to-the-senate-54/"&gt;Biden renominated Sohn and Bedoya on January 4th&lt;/a&gt;, setting the nominations up for further consideration by the Senate Commerce Committee. &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2022/01/10/antitrust-enforcers-are-drowning-in-mergers-799773"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Politico &lt;/em&gt;on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, the committee plans to vote on nominees on January 24th, and the markup may include Sohn and Bedoya, but the final agenda has not been released as of publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TOoiRQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s no time to waste”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TBS5Bd"&gt;“There’s no time to waste and so much to get done at the FCC: ensuring the billions being invested in broadband actually reach those who need it most, restoring Net Neutrality and Title II, reckoning with media regulators’ history on race and repairing the damage of the Trump years,” Craig Aaron, Free Press Action co-CEO, said in a Monday statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PA2Ec3"&gt;As FCC and FTC nominations saw some movement in the Senate last year, Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-media-censor-for-the-fcc-gigi-sohn-joe-biden-nominee-11636408804"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;editorial board&lt;/a&gt; argued that Sohn was a telecom policy extremist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27p3VK"&gt;“Gigi Sohn is a complete political ideologue who has disdain for conservatives. She would be a complete nightmare for the country when it comes to regulating the public airwaves,” Graham said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1458222266395811849?s=20"&gt;in a tweet thread last November&lt;/a&gt;. “I will do everything in my power to convince colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject this extreme nominee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsGsnj"&gt;So long as every Senate Democrat, including Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), votes in favor of both Sohn and Bedoya, no Republican support would be necessary to confirm them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otTWl1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izA6yL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM finally bends the knee to California’s authority to set vehicle pollution rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Freeway Construction" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L4KCWe5jgghc2CqJrRK51pKUcNs=/101x0:5900x3866/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370221/1237448695.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o2kftz"&gt;General Motors isn’t done wiping the egg off its face from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21026865/general-motors-ev-day-trump-emissions-rollback-climate-crisis"&gt;misguided decision to back then-President Donald Trump’s failed effort&lt;/a&gt; to take away California’s ability to set fuel efficiency standards. In a letter sent to the state’s governor today, the automaker said it “recognizes California’s authority to set vehicle emissions standards” under the Clean Air Act and offers itself up an EV supplier for the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ox1i2W"&gt;This represents a reversal of GM’s position three years ago, when it joined Fiat Chrysler and Toyota in supporting the Trump administration’s escalating battle with the state over vehicle emission rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qetMHf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a reversal of GM’s position from three years ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RmiuxP"&gt;Under the Clean Air Act, California has historically been allowed to set its own emissions standards, which are tougher than federal guidelines and typically set the bar for the entire auto industry in the US. California is the largest auto market in the US and the 10th largest in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6blrht"&gt;

&lt;iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" title="Governor Gavin Newsom 1.09.22" src="https://www.scribd.com/embeds/552080508/content?start_page=1&amp;amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;amp;access_key=key-RPOOQCBwMYWNf7hgABsN" data-auto-height="false" data-aspect-ratio="0.7729220222793488" scrolling="no" id="doc_31037" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H5GwTZ"&gt;After Trump declared his intention to roll back the Obama-era fuel economy standards, California stated that it would go its own course and keep enforcing the earlier, stricter standards. Trump sued the state, prompting the auto industry to take sides in the legal battle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGyinm"&gt;Nearly two dozen states &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272179/attorneys-general-sue-trump-administration-fuel-efficiency-standard-rollback"&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; the Trump administration in response and other major car companies balked at the administration’s attempt to roll back the fuel efficiency mandate. While GM and a few others supported Trump, Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, and BMW all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20727261/trump-emissions-rollback-ford-volkswagon-honda-bmw-california-deal"&gt;sided with California&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ajVhFQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;But after Trump’s defeat, the effort was essentially moot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qomGnU"&gt;But after Trump’s defeat, the effort was essentially moot. President Joe Biden announced his own plan to hasten a transition to electric vehicles in an effort to combat climate change — and GM scrambled to get on board. Two weeks after Trump’s loss, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611607/gm-trump-california-car-emission-pollution-biden-fuel-efficiency-standards"&gt;GM renounced its support for the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; and called on other automakers to join it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhzIec"&gt;Now, the company is furthering its efforts to get on California’s good side, and it seems to be working. The state has agreed to add GM to its list of auto manufacturers to consider for fleet vehicle purchases. This is important especially as GM releases new electric work vehicles, such as the BrightDrop delivery vans and the Chevy Silverado EV pickup truck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxF0Tc"&gt;“GM is joining California in our fight for clean air and emission reduction as part of the company’s pursuit of a zero-emissions future,” Newsom said in a statement. “This agreement will help accelerate California’s nation-leading commitment to tackling the climate crisis. We welcome GM in our clean vehicle revolution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1IAJFD"&gt;GM has said it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;stop selling gas-powered vehicles by 2040&lt;/a&gt; and has committed to spend $35 billion on electric and autonomous vehicles by 2025. California has said it wants to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;ban the sale &lt;/a&gt;of new internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035. To date, 14 other states have &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/nevada-california-zero-emission-vehicle-standards/#:~:text=More%20EVs%20for%20Nevada.&amp;amp;text=This%20decade%2C%20Nevada%20will%20become,%2C%20climate%2Dfriendly%20future.%22"&gt;adopted its progressive zero-emission vehicle program&lt;/a&gt; for passenger vehicles, which was launched in the early 1990s and has spurred automakers into developing hybrid and fully electric cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7E5rHt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHkxbr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LinkedIn to launch audio events later this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="LinkedIn logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BnfqTUuzRKqHGU1wvuCamhHF5Vg=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70369916/1237155405.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8tpXLK"&gt;The live, Clubhouse-like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;audio feature LinkedIn confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it was working on last year will debut later this month in beta as part of the company’s new events platform, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/virtual-events-here-stay-how-were-investing-build-better-jake-poses/"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; a company blog post. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11920938/microsoft-linkedin-acquisition-why-report"&gt;Microsoft-owned LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; said last March that it was doing “early tests to create a unique audio experience connected to your professional identity,” which was confirmed in the blog post by Jake Poses, LinkedIn lead for video, creators &amp;amp; events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNEbrI"&gt;“This month, we’re taking a big step forward and building on the success of LinkedIn Live broadcasts by launching an entirely new interactive events experience that allows our members to more actively participate in the conversation,” Poses writes in the post. Users cam participate in live conversations, join speakers “on stage” as part of the discussion, and, will be able to make connections with others at an event to network after the event ends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Gofjx"&gt;As first reported by &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/linkedin-is-launching-interactive-clubhouse-style-audio-events-this-month-in-beta-a-video-version-will-come-this-spring/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, LinkedIn’s all-virtual events platform will eventually include moderated panel-style discussions, roundtables, and fireside chats, with the formats left up to the event hosts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8crZqE"&gt;The virtual events will be built on LinkedIn’s in-house tools, and a video version is expected to be available later in the spring. &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;reports that unlike other companies with audio chat features, such as Twitter’s Spaces, LinkedIn doesn’t plan to include ticketed events, where organizers could charge for access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cluF4V"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380290/clubhouse-social-audio-twitter-facebook-platforms"&gt;Clubhouse drew in a big audience&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic with its invite-only audio events (it’s now open to all, even without an invitation to join), it’s been overshadowed in recent months by competitors from established social platforms. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187490/twitter-spaces-test-voice-chat-rooms"&gt;Twitter began testing its Spaces&lt;/a&gt; to a limited audience in December of 2020 (and made it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739249/twitter-finally-letting-everyone-create-spaces"&gt;more widely available&lt;/a&gt; last year); Spotify introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22535214/spotify-greenroom-locker-room-live-audio-app"&gt;its live audio app, Greenroom&lt;/a&gt;, and Facebook added its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22540508/facebook-live-audio-rooms-clubhouse-rival-spaces-greenhouse"&gt;Live Audio Rooms&lt;/a&gt; in June; and Discord &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;launched its Stage Channels&lt;/a&gt; last March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJQurZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 10th 12:53PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; adds details from and link to LinkedIn blog post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snag a Sonos Beam 2 refurbished for almost $50 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_TK5EC_EnBu7NhQPOvN4pP9103M=/0x0:1903x1269/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70369479/cwelch_290921_4780_5699.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qNfMRW"&gt;Last year, Sonos raised its prices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667044/sonos-speaker-price-increases-announce-september-12"&gt;for some of its most popular products&lt;/a&gt; due to the pandemic’s negative effect on the supply chain. But one of its latest releases, the Sonos Beam 2 soundbar in white, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoeDa42cbI" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is almost $50 off&lt;/a&gt; when you buy refurbished at Best Buy right now. It comes with a 90-day warranty via Best Buy, and the Beam 2 includes all original accessories, including the soundbar itself, a power cable, an HDMI 2.0 cable, and a Sonos optical audio adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxkkN6"&gt;Sonos touts Dolby Atmos as being the Beam 2’s big spec upgrade over the first-generation model. But my colleague Chris Welch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701137/sonos-beam-gen-2-atmos-soundbar-review-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;stated in his review&lt;/a&gt; that Atmos shouldn’t be the sole reason why you buy it. It does feature wider, more expansive sound than the first iteration, but it’s the sleeker design (ditching fabric for cleaner-looking perforated plastic), and the addition of HDMI eARC, enabling Atmos and eliminating video and audio sync issues that plagued the first-gen Beam, that make this one worth checking out. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701137/sonos-beam-gen-2-atmos-soundbar-review-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z69mir"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10970437"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dvBeDf"&gt;Amazon’s tiny Echo Show 5 (2021 version) is back down to the best-ever price that we last saw during Black Friday. It originally sold for $84.99 (though it’s usually always cheaper than that), but you can pick it up at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoeZhdn3Ym" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-5-2nd-Gen-2021-release/dp/B08J8FFJ8H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $44.99. This is an affordable way to connect to friends and family with its built-in camera or to listen to music and hear the news read aloud to you by Alexa. What’s more, both sites are offering a Blink Mini smart camera (usually $34.99) for just $5 on top of the cost of the Echo Show 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fHKUHP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873822"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n0QXSQ"&gt;If you missed out on some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22825859/ps5-best-games-playstation-5-sony-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best PS5 games of 2021&lt;/a&gt; (as well as some that came out closer to the console’s November 2020 launch), you can save on several right now. Some retailers are offering discounts on disc copies of games like &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Returnal&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Tsushima-Directors-Cut-PlayStation-5/dp/B098G34GBT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and more. Additionally, Sony is matching most (but not all) of these deals with its sale on digital games, which is convenient if you have the PS5 digital version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q5fhdX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="RyvfUJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10687661"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="V7xwpN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10510093"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="QUJft2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685362"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lJwsuv"&gt;Other deals you may want to check out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tJa6ct"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Cam-Link-Broadcast-Camcorder/dp/B07K3FN5MR?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elgato’s Cam Link 4K&lt;/a&gt;, an external capture card that can make it simple to connect your DSLR to your PC (up to 1080p / 60fps, or 4K / 30fps), costs $106.15 at Amazon. This is a 20 percent discount off its usual $129.99 price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="y7PPqP"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=vergedeals01102022&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airtag-4pk-14" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s AirTags come in a four-pack at Woot for $93.99&lt;/a&gt;, down 5 percent from its usual $99 price.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgofoCeuxh4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The latest Microsoft Surface Pro X&lt;/a&gt; (SQ2 processor, 16GB RAM, 256GB storage, Wi-Fi + 4G-ready) is $1,299.99 at Best Buy, down from its usual $1,449.99 asking price. Note that it doesn’t include a Type Cover with purchase.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p id="EEQY9y"&gt;Take-Two Interactive, the video game publisher that owns Rockstar and 2K Games, is &lt;a href="https://ir.take2games.com/news-releases/news-release-details/take-two-and-zynga-combine-bringing-together-best-class"&gt;set to acquire&lt;/a&gt; social game developer Zynga in a deal valued at $12.7 billion (via &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/videogame-maker-take-two-interactive-to-buy-zynga-in-12-7-billion-deal-11641818298"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The cash and stock transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023, pending regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvPgRW"&gt;Take-Two Interactive’s acquisition of Zynga marks the company’s foray into the mobile game market. Take-Two is behind some of the most well-known game series, including &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UPMKwY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Take-Two’s $12.7 billion acquisition is one of the biggest in video game history&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IuMoTW"&gt;Meanwhile, Zynga has a pretty impressive portfolio of its own, defining a genre by planting some of its earliest games, like &lt;em&gt;FarmVille&lt;/em&gt;, on Facebook. The mobile game developer also created the ultra-popular &lt;em&gt;Words With Friends, &lt;/em&gt;which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/2/15504996/zynga-words-with-friends-facebook-messenger"&gt;eventually made its way to Messenger&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also set to roll out an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679557/snapchat-games-revamp-zynga-among-us-clone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;-like game on Snapchat, called &lt;em&gt;Revamp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5qqSP"&gt;“Combining Zynga’s expertise in mobile and next-generation platforms with Take-Two’s best-in-class capabilities and intellectual property will enable us to further advance our mission to connect the world through games,” said Frank Gibeau, the CEO of Zynga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xwYr9"&gt;Take-Two’s $12.7 billion acquisition is one of the biggest in video game history, by a pretty big margin — ahead of even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;Microsoft’s $7.5 billion purchase of Bethesda&lt;/a&gt;, which was finalized last March, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/21/11986712/tencent-supercell-softbank-majority-stake-acquisition"&gt;Tencent’s $8.57 billion acquisition of a majority stake in Supercell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vRv9FC"&gt;Former Huawei sub-brand Honor has just announced its first foldable smartphone, the Honor Magic V. It uses a similar folding form factor to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold devices, combining a large internal folding display with a smaller external display that can be used while the device is folded. Today is the foldable’s Chinese launch, where its price starts at ¥9,999 (around $1,569) for its 256GB storage model. It will go on open sale on January 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puGB6W"&gt;The Magic V’s flagship feature, its internal folding screen, measures 7.9 inches from corner to corner, has a resolution of 2272 x 1984 with a refresh rate of 90Hz, and an aspect ratio of 10:9. That’s slightly bigger than Samsung’s Z Fold 3, whose internal screen is 7.6 inches with a resolution of 2208 x 1768. Honor says the Magic V’s internal screen is like using two 21:9 screens side by side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWMekK"&gt;The Magic V’s external screen is also slightly larger than the Z Fold 3 at 6.45 inches (compared to 6.2 for Samsung), with a resolution of 2560 x 1080, a 120Hz refresh rate, and a 21:9 aspect ratio. Honor says this will help make the device more usable when you don’t want to unfold it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M4iOVM251Pj5YM_WPRwb-g8SZHc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23158009/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_12.29.52_PM.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honor’s foldable, folded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jym1Eh"&gt;When folded, the Magic V measures 72.7mm wide, 14.3mm thick, and has a height of 160.4mm, and when unfolded it expands to 141.1mm wide and is 6.7mm thick. That’s slightly wider than Samsung’s latest Z Fold, while being slightly thinner overall when folded. Honor’s foldable is slightly heavier, however. It’s available in three colors: orange, silver, and black, and Honor CEO George Zhao says it should survive being folded and unfolded 200,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hr0esu"&gt;Internally, the Magic V is running Qualcomm’s latest chipset, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, which is paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB or 512GB of storage. It’s got a 4,750mAh battery that can be charged at up to 66W, which gives you a 50 percent charge in 15 minutes. It’s 5G compatible and is running Honor’s Magic UI 6.0 software on top of Android 12, which supports the display of multiple app windows at the same time, Honor says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNoWvQ"&gt;In terms of cameras, Honor has included a trio of 50-megapixel sensors on the rear of the foldable, which include a main sensor, an ultrawide camera, and something Honor is calling a “spectrum enhanced camera.” We’ve followed up with the company for details on what exactly this third camera does. The Magic V has a pair of 42-megapixel selfie cameras, one embedded in the outer display, and one embedded in the inner folding screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NjOIA"&gt;Honor joins an increasingly long list of companies that have either announced or have started to sell foldable smartphones. Most recently, we saw Oppo announce its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837149/oppo-find-n-hands-on-announcement-specs-price"&gt;Find N&lt;/a&gt; late last year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;Honor’s former parent company Huawei&lt;/a&gt; also have foldable devices of their own. We’ve followed up with Honor to find out if, or when, the Magic V might see a global release. &lt;/p&gt;
