    <title>At the Epic trial, Phil Schiller got away clean</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;phil schiller wwdc 2013&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ohf59d"&gt;Phil Schiller is one of the biggest names at Apple, and at the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, his job was to make Apple feel small. Over two days of testimony including several hours of cross-examination, he didn’t always succeed — but he left the stand without facing some of Epic’s harshest lines of attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0iCoi"&gt;Schiller, whose title is simply “Apple Fellow,” has spent more than 30 years with the company. In his testimony, he recounted joining Apple in the ‘90s and watching Steve Jobs reorganize the then-failing computer maker. He reminisced about the iPod and name-dropped largely forgotten competitors like Handango and BlackBerry Messenger. In court, Epic Games has portrayed Apple as a scolding, disingenuous bully that locks users into a walled garden and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429267/epic-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-trial-peely-day-6"&gt;gets mad at cartoon bananas&lt;/a&gt;. Schiller countered with an iOS product showcase and Apple history lesson, and Epic didn’t do much to stop him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zsPov4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Schiller countered Epic with an Apple history lesson&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L4INfY"&gt;The iPod bit was a great encapsulation of Schiller’s time on the stand. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441304/apple-phil-schiller-epic-iphone-testimony-app-store"&gt;As my colleague Liz Lopatto notes&lt;/a&gt;, Schiller famously served as Apple’s longtime marketing head. But at the prompting of an Apple lawyer, Schiller mentioned on Tuesday that he’d also helped invent the iPod clickwheel — one of Apple’s most distinctive hardware designs. And why, Apple’s counsel asked, was a marketing executive working on hardware design? “Product marketing works hand-in-hand with engineering on all of our projects,” Schiller explained. Different parts of Apple simply aren’t siloed into neat divisions; it’s one tight-knit company that makes a many-featured product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="or3Ysc"&gt;That anecdote buttressed a more legally pertinent claim: because of this management system, Apple allegedly has no idea how much the App Store makes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbpYiD"&gt;One Epic-paid expert witness has pegged Apple’s operating margins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414402/epic-expert-apple-app-store-fortnite-court-profit"&gt;between 70 and 80 percent&lt;/a&gt;, something Epic calls evidence of monopoly power. Epic used one of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2017%2F06%2Fdeveloper-earnings-from-the-app-store-top-70-billion%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F18%2F22442395%2Fat-the-epic-trial-phil-schiller-got-away-clean" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s PR statistics&lt;/a&gt; to estimate the App Store made $20 billion or more in commissions by 2017. Schiller didn’t dispute the number. But he said Apple never calculated its overall profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iSlQkC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Product marketing works hand-in-hand with engineering on all of our projects”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vcyx62"&gt;“We don’t deny that it likely is. It’s just that we haven’t managed the business that way,” Schiller said of the App Store. He rattled off iPhone features that require lots of work and benefit App Store developers, but don’t involve spending money on the store itself. Epic attorney Katherine Forrest was incredulous: “Apple can do accelerometers, and machine learning, and have some of the most sophisticated technology around, and it can’t figure out if the App Store is profitable — is that what you’re saying?” Schiller, however, never changed his story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QtsNu"&gt;Apple used Schiller to put a new spin on Epic’s other evidence against it. Epic has cited a 2008 message where he said opening up iOS would mean “throwing out the whole plan” for the operating system. But where Epic described that plan as a single monopolistic gambit, Schiller says he was just describing the straightforward goal of a central App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bkt8Dr"&gt;“You keep going back to that sentence referring to ‘the plan,’ as if there was one special plan that we referred to,” he complained at one point. Where Epic has pointed out phrases like “lock-in” and seeking “stickiness” on iOS, Schiller emphasized that the “stickiness” involved trying to add features that would discourage phishing. “If there’s any plan here, it’s simply to come up with new features to help protect users from security and privacy scams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n72rMO"&gt;Some choices are tougher to spin as fair-minded altruism. One court filing suggests Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;kept iMessage off Android&lt;/a&gt; to discourage switching ecosystems, and another recounts a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;list of sweetener deals&lt;/a&gt; that Apple discussed offering Netflix, despite claims to not favor individual developers. iMessage and the App Store play a huge role in consumer technology, and Epic’s counsel had a chance to push Schiller on them, helping the rest of us better understand how Apple makes these calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjggQl"&gt;But mostly, Epic... just didn’t. Cross-examination touched on topics like iMessage, but Epic’s counsel favored exhaustive readings of policies and lists that could show Apple in an unfavorable light, including every time it mentions relying on open source software and the search results for “BDSM” on the App Store. Little of this related to Schiller himself, although we did glean details like his favorite &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skins (&lt;a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Rogue_Agent"&gt;Rogue Agent&lt;/a&gt; and the New England Patriots), his use of Reddit (“I tried it once”), and whether knows what Pornhub is (allegedly, no.) And while Schiller occasionally sounded frustrated, he stuck to his central claims: the App Store can’t be carved out or measured, and even if it’s made Apple rich, it’s helped everyone else as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify and YouTube Music will bring much needed offline tunes to Google’s Wear watches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z6kJ4haWEfqAd8S4oNpCKg3ae4g=/110x0:1910x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69308705/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_3.50.46_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h0Yflx"&gt;Spotify’s product lead for cars and wearables teased an exciting new feature coming to Wear devices &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/D_mVOAXcrtc?t=2515"&gt;during Google’s Developer Keynote&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday: the ability for the streaming services’ &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/company-info/"&gt;356 million users&lt;/a&gt; to download music directly to their watch, and listen to it at times when they don’t want to carry their phone (&lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/spotify-download-music-podcasts-wear-os/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The feature isn’t included in the redesign that was just released, but Spotify says that it’s currently in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkmrOK"&gt;The announcement came alongside Google’s reveal that it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;merging Wear OS with Samsung’s Tizen&lt;/a&gt;. During Tuesday’s I/O keynote, Google promised that the updated OS would bring faster performance and longer battery life, which are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22314135/ticwatch-pro-3-fossil-gen-5-lte-review-smartwatch-wear-os"&gt;currently still issues&lt;/a&gt; for Wear OS watches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oZVpLZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Spotify: &lt;a href="https://t.co/wpZFJh8hVN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wpZFJh8hVN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kirubhas Shankar (@KirubhasWasHere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KirubhasWasHere/status/1394771887796854784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jBcOmX"&gt;The YouTube Music app is also getting an update, which will similarly add the ability to download music directly to Wear devices, allowing users to listen without a phone nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G_N-IMmAkdb8WH9BRzslPy_HcF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22524354/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_5.21.04_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube Music will also support downloads. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HhjlXA"&gt;Google’s smartwatch OS has lagged behind Apple’s in many ways, including offline music listening. The Apple Watch has been able to play songs downloaded through Apple Music when away from a phone for years, and it got to the point where Google decided to release its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21518580/youtube-music-apple-watch-app-wear-os-wearable-problems"&gt;YouTube Music app for the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; before its own Wear OS. When &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-to-listen-to-your-music-on-any-smartwatch-1845624102"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;put out an article&lt;/a&gt; last November on how listen to music phone-free on smartwatches, its Wear OS recommendation was more or less an app that acted as an MP3 player, requiring the transfer of local files that you already own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWzjZE"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/google-play-music-wont-work-soon-on-wear-os-smartwatches"&gt;the shutdown of Google Play Music&lt;/a&gt;, Wear OS users haven’t had many options for offline music. But now, Google’s Wear watches could potentially even leapfrog the Apple Watch when it comes to offline Spotify playback — to get your Spotify on an Apple Watch without carrying around your phone, you currently need an active internet connection to stream it to one of Apple’s pricier cellular Apple Watch models, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549483/spotify-apple-watch-streaming-music-rolling-out"&gt;a feature added late last year.&lt;/a&gt; Some other watches have had offline Spotify playback in the past, though, like Garmin’s flagship Forerunner sports watches and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/au/support/mobile-devices/listen-to-spotify-offline-from-galaxy-wearable/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some Samsung Galaxy wearables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNvaLL"&gt;You can check out the Spotify and YouTube Music app reveals for yourself in Google’s Wear-specific session from I/O. The YouTube Music announcement starts at 2:38, and the Spotify demo starts at 12:50 in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Top streamer says Twitch revoked her ability to run ads without warning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sFR3Mi6W2tBTO3hBbr95mhfXf4U=/124x0:1885x1174/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69308051/amouranth.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amouranth during an ASMR stream. | Image: Amouranth / Twitch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Apva6"&gt;Twitch has removed the ability for Kaitlyn “Amouranth” Siragusa, one of the most popular streamers on its platform, to run ads on her videos — even though it’s unclear that she broke any of the site’s rules. Siragusa said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Amouranth/status/1394699159983243268"&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; that it’s because her streams are “not advertiser friendly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EuP4jt"&gt;Siragusa is known for streaming herself chatting and gaming while wearing swimsuits. She’s hugely popular, with more than 20,000 subscribers — putting her among the site’s top 20, &lt;a href="https://twitchtracker.com/subscribers"&gt;according to TwitchTracker&lt;/a&gt;. She’s also been the target of relentless criticism because of her appearance, including sexist attacks from Twitch users who argue that the success of some women on the platform is unearned or illegitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cgMxDn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is an ALARMING precedent and serves as a stark warning that although content may not ostensibly break community guidelines or Terms of service, Twitch has complete discretion to target individual channels &amp;amp; partially or wholly demonetized them for&lt;/p&gt;— Amouranth (@Amouranth) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Amouranth/status/1394699454654124033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LSQZSq"&gt;The advertising ban comes months into what’s become known as the “&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/twitchs-hot-tub-meta-has-sparked-off-yet-another-debate-1846600932"&gt;hot tub meta&lt;/a&gt;” on Twitch. It’s become a trend for creators to stream themselves hanging out or playing games in hot tubs or inflatable pools. Siragusa has been a contributor to that trend, streaming from what appears to be a small plastic pool set up inside her home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tD8PJS"&gt;But it’s not known why Twitch revoked Siragusa’s ability to run ads — a punishment the site has never doled out before, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-takes-away-most-popular-hot-tub-streamers-abilit-1846919420"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That’s part of what makes this situation so concerning for streamers: Twitch has an explicit set of rules that streamers need to follow to avoid a ban, but there’s no specific rules around who can and can’t be supported by advertising. Twitch allows streamers to appear in swimwear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnQ0mM"&gt;Siragusa said on Twitter that she reached out to Twitch after discovering she had lost advertising revenue and was told yesterday that she had been “indefinitely suspended” from running ads. “This is an ALARMING precedent,” she wrote, saying there were no communicated guidelines for why her ad privileges were revoked. “There is no known policy for what results in a streamer being put on this blacklist,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vmItW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Twitch for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google employees call for company to support Palestinians and protect anti-Zionist speech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-WDZSvVvFSo47HQfjNm592iqnxc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69307824/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C6DJ9Y"&gt;A group of Jewish Google employees is calling on the company to increase its support of Palestinians amid Israel’s deadly bombing campaign in Gaza. The conflict started with Israel’s attempt to evict Palestinians from their homes in East Jerusalem, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/5/10/22428819/israel-palestine-jerusalem-mosque-violence-biden"&gt;and escalated when militants fired rockets toward Jerusalem and Israel responded with airstrikes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBOoOW"&gt;In an internal letter, Google workers ask CEO Sundar Pichai to put out a statement condemning the attacks, including “direct recognition of the harm done to Palestinians by Israeli military and gang violence.” The letter currently has 250 signatures. (&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSck0yb4OgXJlf5N2Ap21BhW-QNTL0rigFSYsW_o09QkJOJVbw/viewform"&gt;An external version of the note can be found here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SK3kAr"&gt;The request is coming from a new employee resource group which formed last year in response to pro-Zionist sentiment within “Jewglers” — Google’s official Jewish ERG. While Jewglers has tried to be apolitical, two current workers say it has supported pro-Israel discussions and is not a safe space to express anti-Zionist beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tTJrb"&gt;This rift led to the formation of the Jewish Diaspora in Tech — a group of Jewish anti-nationalists within Google. “We were compelled to form our own space because of the fact that we were quite literally not allowed to express our viewpoints in the ERG,” says a product marketing manager in the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHYeKc"&gt;Now, members of the new organization are calling on Google to support freedom of expression internally — particularly around anti-Zionist viewpoints. “Google is the world’s largest search engine and any repression of freedom of expression occurring within the company is a danger not only to Googlers internally but to all people around the world,” they wrote in an FAQ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lKJZG"&gt;They also want Google to terminate any business contracts which support “Israeli violations of Palestinian human rights, such as the Israeli Defense Forces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KE5dZ"&gt;Members of the group say they were inspired to write the letter after Jewglers failed to put out a statement condemning the violence against Palestinians. One worker told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that people in the group were promoting pro-Israel funding opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsOKf8"&gt;Read the entire letter below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="DZ2qtm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10507005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cFYBP3"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon extends ban on police use of its facial recognition software ‘until further notice’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2sz0ifqs-3Qj8Eel3feJqezTrzI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69307460/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GNVmPJ"&gt;Amazon has extended its moratorium on law enforcement use of its facial recognition software “until further notice,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com./technology/exclusive-amazon-extends-moratorium-police-use-facial-recognition-software-2021-05-18/?utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The ban was set to expire in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEU0CY"&gt;As early as 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/22/17492106/amazon-ice-facial-recognition-internal-letter-protest"&gt;Amazon employees&lt;/a&gt; had pushed Amazon to scale back the project, arguing that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/3/18291995/amazon-facial-recognition-technology-rekognition-police-ai-researchers-ban-flawed"&gt;documented racial bias in facial recognition&lt;/a&gt; could exacerbate police violence against minorities. Amazon defended the project until June 2020, when increased pressure from widespread protests led to the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287101/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police-ban-one-year-ai-racial-bias"&gt;announcing a yearlong moratorium&lt;/a&gt; on police clients for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYv8TW"&gt;Rekognition is offered as an AWS service, and many of Amazon’s cloud computing competitors have similar technology. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288053/microsoft-facial-recognition-police-law-enforcement-pledge-regulation"&gt;Microsoft announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would also not be selling its facial recognition services to police the day after Amazon’s pledge, and IBM said that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21284683/ibm-no-longer-general-purpose-facial-recognition-analysis-software"&gt;would stop developing or researching&lt;/a&gt; facial recognition tech altogether the same week. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075001/facial-recognition-ban-google-microsoft-eu-sundar-pichai-brad-smith"&gt;doesn’t commercially offer its facial recognition technology&lt;/a&gt; to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCvvsi"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately respond to request for comment about why the ban was being extended. In a statement provided when the ban on law enforcement use was first issued, Amazon said it hoped Congress would use the year provided by the moratorium to implement rules surrounding the ethical use of facial recognition technology. Part of its statement read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ofTctf"&gt;We’ve advocated that governments should put in place stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology, and in recent days, Congress appears ready to take on this challenge. We hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules, and we stand ready to help if requested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xRb4bl"&gt;So far, no federal legislation has addressed police use of facial recognition, but a number of state and local measures have passed paring back use of the technology. San Francisco was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18623013/san-francisco-facial-recognition-ban-vote-city-agencies"&gt;the first US city to ban government use of facial recognition&lt;/a&gt; in May 2019, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697821/oakland-facial-recogntiion-ban-vote-governement-california"&gt;Oakland following soon after&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429960/portland-passes-strongest-facial-recognition-ban-us-public-private-technology"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21536892/portland-maine-facial-recognition-ban-passed-surveillance"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; cities of Portland also passed legislation around the tech in late 2020. The state of Massachusetts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179245/facial-recognition-bill-ban-rejected-massachusetts-governor-charlie-baker-police-accountability"&gt;failed to pass a proposed ban&lt;/a&gt; in December 2020 but &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/07/982709480/massachusetts-pioneers-rules-for-police-use-of-facial-recognition-tech"&gt;has recently passed a modified bill&lt;/a&gt; that adds some restrictions on police use of facial recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 public beta is now available: here’s how to install it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rhzGfRd8tVHG9KHkxSRLx4kT19U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69307041/vpavic_210517_4586_0027.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SGc5DS"&gt;Google unveiled Android 12 at its opening &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432922/google-io-2021-rumors-news-announcements"&gt;I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt;  keynote, and now you can try the new update yourself as part of the first public beta. The Android 12 public beta is currently available for Google’s Pixel phones (Pixel 3 and up) and will also come to devices from OnePlus, Lenovo, Asus, Oppo, Realme, Sharp, Tecno, TCL, Vivo, Xiaomi, and ZTE. You can enroll your Pixel phone on &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta"&gt;Google’s Android beta site&lt;/a&gt; or find specific instructions for other supported phones on &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/devices"&gt;the Android Developers page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blkQBw"&gt;Android 12 brings a cornucopia of new features, but the most exciting are the new visuals. Along with new animations, widgets, and a modified lock screen, Android 12 also offers theming, with the ability to change the colors used across the OS just by changing your wallpaper. Not all of the dramatic visual changes will be available in this first beta, but they should roll out over time as we get closer to release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3nlq1"&gt;Google is tweaking other aspects of the Android experience as well, like notifications and quick settings. It’s also making some improvements to privacy and security, with indicators for when your phone’s camera or microphones are in use, and easier access to all of your apps’ various permissions in one dashboard. For a more in-depth look at Android 12, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22203818"&gt;check out our full preview&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to get started with the beta right now, head below for instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="Wofbdn"&gt;

&lt;li id="4WKaBi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tcl.com/global/en/android-12-beta.html"&gt;TCL 20 Pro 5G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Rf6h0u"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.vivo.com/doc/detail?id=103"&gt;Vivo iQOO 7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vKmMME"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mi.com/global/service/support/androidsbeta.html"&gt;Xiaomi Mi 11, Mi 11 Ultra, Mi 11I, Mi 11X Pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="m4HRC0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ztedevices.com/en-gl/developer/android-12/"&gt;ZTE Axon 30 Ultra 5G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8q22Yu"&gt;as well as models from &lt;a href="https://k-tai.sharp.co.jp/support/developers/android12_betaprogram/"&gt;Sharp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://spot.tecno.com/global/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;amp;tid=98054&amp;amp;id=98054"&gt;Tecno&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.realmebbs.com/post-details/1393156430865309696"&gt;Realme&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pqo2S3"&gt;How to install the Android 12 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DcweJw"&gt;The process of how you get Android 12 beta on your phone ranges from requiring just a few clicks to something more involved. For this beta download, it’s considerably easier to get the it on one of the supported Google Pixel phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nukaT"&gt;For a Pixel, begin by &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta"&gt;visiting the Android 12 beta site to enroll your phone in the beta&lt;/a&gt;. You should be able to find your phone listed when you click “View your eligible devices.” After you enroll your device, you might be nudged via a notification on your phone that the software is ready to install. If you want to check manually, open the settings menu on your phone, then head to System &amp;gt; System Update. Tap “Check for update” to see if you can download the new software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5turHD"&gt;If nothing happens right away, your only option is to keep waiting. In the past, I’ve gotten the beta update on my phone within minutes of enrolling, though sometimes it takes hours. It may take over 24 hours for the software to be ready to install on your phone, so hang tight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feWDkB"&gt;As for supported phones from other brands like OnePlus, Realme, Sharp, and others, &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/devices"&gt;follow the instructions on each page&lt;/a&gt; from Google’s list of eligible phones, as the process for installation seems to differ depending on the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google I/O 2021: the biggest announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kkeRgl_86di19oO3JMVfXRca3Jk=/2x0:1060x705/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69307106/Sundar_Pichai_03.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EkVd2G"&gt;Google just finished its live &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432922/google-io-2021-rumors-news-announcements"&gt;Google I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt; keynote, where the company unveiled a huge number of announcements, including a new look coming to Android, a bunch of features coming to its Google Workspace productivity suite, and even a new AI that talked as if it were Pluto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mS9wd0"&gt;Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn followed the whole thing in real time right here &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22200447"&gt;on our live blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But if you just want to get caught up on the biggest news from the show, read on for our recap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DkHZX1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22203818"&gt;Android 12 has a radical and bubbly new look&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P90YgdXDdWW1P3VSYbBXQhVEW_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520874/1._Android_12_Keyword_Header.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1c73tP"&gt;Google revealed that Android 12 will have a brand-new “Material You” design with a whole lot of new changes. It offers a lot of color and customization, and the new mobile OS will even be able to change system colors to be able to better match your wallpaper. It also offers some new privacy features, including a new privacy dashboard. A beta will be available today, and it works with phones from 11 device makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CBb7TW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22204267"&gt;Google is making Workspace more interconnected&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RTeFfIl9I0B8MWwLTNF2wjtrphE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523240/352_2021_05_18_352_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cowa7t"&gt;Google announced “smart canvas,” a new initiative for its Workspace office software that will make it easier to work between products. Features include “smart chips” that let you link to other Workspace apps and the ability to start a Meet video call right from Google Doc, Sheet, or Slide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="80KR8v"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442328/google-io-2021-ai-language-model-lamda-pluto"&gt;Google showed off its new LaMDA AI language model and demoed conversations with Pluto and a paper airplane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dhDtRdII62zzec9EqYWyL1kiXb0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523253/374_2021_05_18_374_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6HGlLD"&gt;Google CEO Sundar Pichai showed off some impressive (but pre-recorded) demos of someone having a conversation with an AI powered by its new LaMDA conversation technology. In the demos, the AI “talked” as Pluto and a paper airplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bKzWnN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;Google and Samsung are merging Wear OS and Tizen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hpSHh2ndDTF6MB1d23EjQd-iqO8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523443/image__2_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h45GDO"&gt;Google announced Wear OS (now called just Wear) and Samsung’s Tizen will be combined into a unified platform. That should lead to apps launching faster and longer battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cXcHU0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442336/google-project-starline-3d-video-chat-platform"&gt;Project Starline creates a 3D model of a person sitting across from you&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DmpbYBSZ0g5j7u-cN9S9zKuI9wA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523498/511_2021_05_18_511_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rTZeBL"&gt;Google demonstrated Project Starline, which uses high-resolution cameras and depth sensors to create a real-time 3D model of a person who is “sitting” across you to re-create the feeling of having a face-to-face meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="91C4pv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442515/google-camera-app-inclusive-image-equity-skintones"&gt;Google is building a camera that’s more inclusive of skin tone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/joJ43KdXHMbjL8ix5F7SKm5VYgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523549/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_12.13.28_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nA7uJh"&gt;Google is working on updates to its camera and imaging products to make them better at capturing and reproducing skin tones accurately in images. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vY7MSx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442466/google-photos-cinematic-moments-animated-android-ios-machine-learning"&gt;Google Photos will be able to make animated photos from still shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WKUyCO6Y4QApjUKXvL5Hb5QV6Y0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523418/E855_Photos_IO_Social_Assets_CinematicPhotos_Part01_v01_cl_6zNG70C.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4EgBOh"&gt;Google Photos is getting impressive new “cinematic moments” that use two photos to create a moving image. You can see what they look like in the GIF above. Google is also adding new types of Memories, including ones based on visual patterns in your photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BRvgzn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442416/google-photos-locked-folder-private-hidden-pictures"&gt;Google Photos will let you store photos in a locked folder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GAtAoN8Qab_ufv6jIjh-UDJu5Z4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523384/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_11.05.05_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lGUYZz"&gt;Google is adding a feature in Google Photos to let you store photos in a password-protected space on your phone. These photos won’t appear when you’re scrolling in the app. It’s launching first on Google Pixel and coming to more Android devices “throughout the year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iq3h87"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442247/google-chrome-password-manager-android-compromised-duplex"&gt;Google will let you change a site’s password right from inside its password manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Kh8kGQ6nFRc9_zWctCeJnITzMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523364/Automated_Password_Change.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MrIpOw"&gt;Google announced that it’s adding a way to change a stored password for a website right from inside Google’s password manager. It’s rolling out gradually to Chrome on Android in the US and will be widely available in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pt3Li1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442451/google-maps-live-view-update-features-ai-ar"&gt;Google Maps’ AR Live View tool will show more information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FE3QX9"&gt;Google is making some changes to Google Maps, including rolling out new features for its Live View augmented reality tool. Google is also adding features to make maps more informative, such as showing different restaurants at different times of day, pointing out local landmarks if you’re visiting a new city, and showing how busy a certain area is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nxdXJq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22436367/google-io-android-private-computer-core-machine-learning-data-privacy"&gt;Google is adding a privacy-friendly sandbox for machine learning data in Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zVaIUi"&gt;Google is adding a number of privacy-focused features to Android, including a sandbox in Android, the Private Compute Core, that will securely store data used for machine learning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="I8k6FF"&gt;Google announced that there are now more than 3 billion active Android devices. That’s a lot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LbB6BH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22436410/google-android-auto-os-pixel-phone-key-io"&gt;Android will support digital car keys so you can unlock your car with your phone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Google is trying to make its image processing more inclusive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A9Ksvm0sHS2BV49oSkg36S1_KjM=/133x0:1588x970/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69307084/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_12.13.28_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google says its tweaked image processing will avoid over-brightening black and brown faces.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9UcfQR"&gt;It’s a long-standing problem that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d16LNHIEJzs"&gt;dates back to the days of film&lt;/a&gt;: image processing tends to be tuned for lighter skin tones and not that of black and brown subjects. Google announced an effort to address that today in its own camera and imaging products, with a focus on making images of people of color “more beautiful and more accurate.” These changes will come to Google’s own Pixel cameras this fall, and the company says it will share what it learns across the broader Android ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWA364"&gt;Specifically, Google is making changes to its auto-white balance and exposure algorithms to improve accuracy for dark skin tones based on a broader data set of images featuring black and brown faces. With these tweaks, Google aims to avoid over-brightening and de-saturating people of color in photos for more accurate representation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GHfks7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2DXY9cR7vN4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NgaflI"&gt;Google has also made improvements for portrait mode selfies, creating a more accurate depth map for curly and wavy hair types — rather than simply cutting around the subject’s hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7v270"&gt;The company says it still has much to do — and it has certainly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai"&gt;stumbled in the past&lt;/a&gt; on the image recognition and inclusion front — but it’s a welcome step in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google previews Project Starline, a next-gen 3D video chat booth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TMp0GHzssKJj6RUdGhIz_ytf8OY=/65x0:928x575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69306950/Booth_Blog.max_1000x1000.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Project Starline | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dxbVYh"&gt;Google is working on a next-gen video chat booth that makes the person you’re chatting with appear in front of you in 3D. You can see them from different angles by moving around and even make eye contact, Google said during a preview of the project at its I/O conference today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2vuID"&gt;The system is called “&lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/research/project-starline/"&gt;Project Starline&lt;/a&gt;,” and it’s basically a really, really fancy video chat setup. The platform uses multiple cameras and sensors to capture a person’s appearance and shape from different perspectives. It then stitches those together into a 3D model that’s broadcast in real time to whomever they’re chatting with. In Google’s preview, Starline was used for person-to-person calls (not group chats), and both sides seemed to be using specialized tech so it could all work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDuL6H"&gt;In a demo video, people using the tech describe seeing people like they were in the same room together. It’s “as if she was right in front of me,” one person says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3e6TG"&gt;Right now the system is big. It appears to be an entire booth, complete with lights, cameras, and a bench to sit on. Google says it relies on “custom-built hardware and highly specialized equipment.” &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-project-starline/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the booth contains more than a dozen different depth sensors and a 65-inch “light field display” to make people appear in 3D. Light field tech has popped up in some promising applications over the past decade (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/2/29/2821763/lytro-review"&gt;Lytro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/1/16070188/avegant-light-field-display-ar-headset-next-level-video"&gt;Avegant&lt;/a&gt; both used it), but it’s yet to catch on as a way to present people clearly in 3D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7G9Sz"&gt;The video chat booth is currently only available in “a few” of Google’s offices, and it plans on testing the tech with business partners later in the year. Google mentioned health care and media as two industries from which it was seeking feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWeFrH"&gt;After a year of constant reliance on video chatting — and as companies plan futures where they rely on video chats more than ever — the promise of more realistic remote calls is exciting. Google makes it sound like Project Starline is a ways away from being something found in every office, let alone in your home. But it means the company is at least working toward something that’s significantly better than the blurry calls we’re used to. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google announces health tool to identify skin conditions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cartoon image of a person using a smartphone to photograph a rash on their hand." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Z4Vkr4CXtSJXjODsaYEL1sDYH8=/162x0:1935x1182/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69306833/Copy_of_derm___hero_image_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google developed a tool to help people identify skin conditions.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="maDmL0"&gt;Google’s latest foray into health care is a web tool that uses artificial intelligence to help people identify skin, hair, or nail conditions. The company previewed the tool at I/O today, and it says it hopes to launch a pilot later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3c2bq7"&gt;People can use their phone’s camera to take three pictures of the problem area — for example, a rash on their arm. They’ll then answer a series of questions about their skin type and other symptoms. The tool then gives a list of possible conditions from a set of 288 that it’s trained to recognize. It’s not intended to diagnose the problem, the company said in a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/ai-dermatology-preview-io-2021/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/530ZzjZDimv-GMJ7SdULjDFNRJU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521171/Copy_of_01_derm_summary.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google tool asks people to take three photos of a skin problem, and then it offers possible conditions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZiMGjX"&gt;Google decided to tackle skin conditions using artificial intelligence because of their prevalence, says Karen DeSalvo, the chief health officer at Google Health. “People are coming to Google to ask questions about skin conditions. We get about 10 billion annual skin condition queries,” she said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, experts can help people determine if it’s something simple or indicative of a more serious illness, but there’s a shortage of dermatologists all over the world. DeSalvo hopes this tool can help get people accurate information about potential conditions, quickly, without having to spend hours doing their own online research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z34oxw"&gt;The team trained the model on millions of images of skin problems, thousands of images of healthy skin, and 65,000 images from clinical settings. The model takes factors like age, skin type, sex, and race into account when suggesting possible conditions. When it was tested on around 1,000 images of skin problems from a diverse range of patients, Google says it identified the correct condition in the top three suggestions 84 percent of the time. It included the correct condition as one of the possible issues 97 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="horSJJ"&gt;The new system builds on Google’s past work using artificial intelligence tools to identify skin conditions. The company published the first iteration of its deep learning system in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0842-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last spring. That paper showed that the system could identify 26 common skin conditions just as accurately as dermatologists and more accurately than primary care doctors. In April, the company published &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2779250"&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; showing that the system could help non-dermatologist physicians diagnose skin conditions more accurately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvaVHD"&gt;Google is also working with a Stanford University research team to test how well the tool works in a health care setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JeP573"&gt;The company obtained a Class I medical device mark for the tool in the European Union, designating it as a low-risk medical device. It has not been evaluated by the United States Food and Drug Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
