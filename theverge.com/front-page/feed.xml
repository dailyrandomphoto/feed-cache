    <title>You can now explore a surreal Gucci garden inside Roblox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pgpRta3TQ9-eomcvltUbDco4TXQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298531/Come_as_You_Are_RSVP_Gucci_Garden_on_Roblox.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NuOkjI"&gt;For the next two weeks, the virtual realm of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is getting a dose of high fashion. Currently, fashion house Gucci is hosting an artsy garden space, &lt;a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/05/gucci-garden-experience/"&gt;which will be available for &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; users to explore starting today through to May 31st&lt;/a&gt;. The space was conceived as a virtual counterpart to a real-world installation called the Gucci Garden Archetypes, which is taking place in Florence, Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4FOyMd"&gt;Both the virtual and IRL spaces are described as multimedia experiences, which are divided into a series of themed rooms with names like “urban romanticism” and “Tokyo tribe.” It all sounds pretty surreal. Here’s the official description of what you’ll be doing in the digital version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aI3qdw"&gt;As they enter the Gucci Garden experience, visitors will shed their avatars becoming a neutral mannequin. Without gender or age, the mannequin symbolizes that we all begin our journeys through life as a blank canvas. Wandering through the different rooms, visitors’ mannequins absorb elements of the exhibition. With every person experiencing the rooms in a different order and retaining different fragments of the spaces, they will emerge at the end of their journey as one-of-a-kind creations, reflecting the idea of individuals as one among many, yet wholly unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;aside id="Vw2bjX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The latest modern art installation is inside Fortnite","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21308391/fortnite-creative-manchester-international-festival-art-exhibition-laturbo-avedon"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Roblox" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EchAEqIEazWTV726-7yNGSZ63cE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520042/In_Bloom_room_Gucci_Garden_on_Roblox.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Roblox" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L-ASMYD12TUlob9vXV110_g8VZc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520058/The_Collectors_Room_1__Gucci_Garden_on_Roblox.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Roblox" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/of3NgwnFmYVj-OyfGQF8Dkj2OGU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520063/Tokyo_Tribe_room_Gucci_Garden_on_Roblox.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1VLZKw"&gt;It may sound like a strange combination, but over the last year, fashion and gaming have become much more closely connected. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22340775/honor-of-kings-burberry-skin-fashion-video-games"&gt;Burberry launched in-game outfits for a Chinese strategy game&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/26/21721371/balenciaga-afterworld-the-age-of-tomorrow-fashion-launch-video-game"&gt;Balenciaga made a post-apocalyptic world in place of a traditional runway show&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937187/league-of-legends-true-damage-hip-hop-group-kda-louis-vuitton"&gt;Louis Vuitton dressed up a virtual hip-hop group made up of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; characters&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, this isn’t even Gucci’s first foray into the space; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340621/gucci-virtual-25-sneaker-ar-vrchat-roblox"&gt;the company previously made a pair of virtual sneakers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqt1Nf"&gt;Just remember: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340621/gucci-virtual-25-sneaker-ar-vrchat-roblox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is definitely not a video game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Redbox still exists, plans to go public</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Redbox 3 1024" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FgpRPR080ir28LDsgQgl1DJq0YU=/0x0:1017x678/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298429/DSC_0952-VERGE.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H3UqZd"&gt;If you live in a major metropolitan area with great high-speed internet, you will be forgiven for forgetting Redbox exists. But the company that rents new releases from big red kiosks at grocery stores is still alive and kicking, and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/redbox-goes-public-spac-1234974560/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; is reporting&lt;/a&gt; it intends to go public after it was acquired by the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Seaport Global Acquisition Corp. The new company is reportedly valued at $693 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VSrAkF"&gt;Redbox has had success operating completely counter to Netflix, Disney Plus, HBO Max, and all the other behemoth streamers that rely on set-top boxes, new TVs, and solid internet to function. According to Redbox, around 70 percent of its customers would be classified as “late adopters.” They’re people who still use CRT TVs, dabble with DSL, and if they’re anything like the Redbox users I know, glare at cloud-based computing suspiciously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJwA8E"&gt;However, despite focusing on what appears to be my mother and her best friend, the company has begun to branch out from kiosks. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21138485/redbox-free-live-tv-ad-supported-streaming-platform-launch-rollout"&gt;February 2020, it launched an ad-supported streaming service&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165692/redbox-ad-supported-free-streaming-movies"&gt;added videos on demand in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hdd085"&gt;Redbox told &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;it plans to use the cash from going public to pay down debt and expand its VOD services. With just 40,000 kiosks and 39 million subscribers, it will need to do some rapid expansion to keep up with its rivals. Disney Plus, which launched in 2019, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320332/disney-plus-100-million-subscribers-marvel-star-wars-wandavision"&gt;over 100 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. Netflix, which Redbox began as a rival to in 2002, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/20/netflix-new-subscriber-numbers/"&gt;has over 200 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXwknU"&gt;Redbox is expected to go public in the third quarter this year with the ticker symbol “RDBX.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s PC gaming starter kit is just $69 at Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Viper comes included in the Power Up bundle.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EUblBp"&gt;At Walmart, the Power Up Bundle from Razer, which contains its Viper ambidextrous mouse, the Kraken X Lite headset, and Cynosa Lite keyboard, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRazer-Power-Up-Bundle-Cynosa-Lite-Viper-Kraken-X-Lite%2F163841868%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_wVZS-5xxbxyLWBEwUx0Mo38eUkB2pO0pWwrKwo0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_10451%26clickid%3DwVZS-5xxbxyLWBEwUx0Mo38eUkB2pO0pWwrKwo0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D567111%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=TheVergeDeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $69&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15028426-69-razer-power-up-bundle-cynosa-lite-viper-and-kraken-x-lite-walmart-com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This kit was originally priced at $160 but usually sells for around $100. This could be a great gift for anyone looking for affordable accessories to complement their PC build. You can spend a lot on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;best gaming mice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;gaming headsets&lt;/a&gt;, and on a keyboard. But if you or the recipient of this kit isn’t picky, this should be a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rKHkAs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10504166"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LG0fDN"&gt;Mesh Wi-Fi routers from Amazon’s Eero 6 lineup are discounted both at Amazon and at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740809378744705856#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Just one router &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eero-6-Router/dp/B085VM9ZDD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $103&lt;/a&gt; instead of $129, but if you want a Wi-Fi router and an extender to cover more space with Wi-Fi signal, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B085WS7H6K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that’s $159&lt;/a&gt;, down from $199. Both of these options are good for small living spaces without a bunch of devices that don’t require being hard-wired to Ethernet. (Note: the Eero 6 router has two Ethernet ports, while extenders have none.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbzxo9"&gt;However, if you live in a bigger place or you want to ensure that all of your favorite gadgets are wired in instead of using Wi-Fi, get the three-pack of Eero 6 routers at Amazon for $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="73cgv7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536532"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YDdcJR"&gt;LG’s 65-inch CX OLED 4K TV is $1,896 at a few retailers, which is the same price that we saw during Black Friday and Cyber Monday last year. Amazon currently has this price, as does Costco, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740810152791662584" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This TV model is well-suited to handle any kind of content, with unparalleled picture quality and contrast. It also has HDMI 2.1 ports, so you’ll be able to get up to a 120Hz refresh rate at 4K resolution in devices that support it, like the Xbox Series X, PS5, and PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8gQEdb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9534696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n9i28m"&gt;If you want to save $20 or so on the Apple AirPods Pro and you don’t mind betting on a refurbished set, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740810617716332006#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is selling certified refurbs for $170. The page description says that this model includes small and large silicone ear tips, a wireless charging case, and a Lightning to USB-C cable for recharging. The most affordable price for a new set is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$197&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ve seen them sell new for $189 regularly. If you can’t wait, this deal at Best Buy might be worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SbdXVk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10504234"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i9mIqm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cadence of Hyrule&lt;/em&gt;, the rhythm-based &lt;em&gt;Zelda &lt;/em&gt;game for the Nintendo Switch, is available digitally at Walmart for a good price (via &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15028339-cadence-of-hyrule-crypt-of-the-necrodancer-season-pass-nintendo-switch-digital-23-60" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). You can get the base game and its season pass that includes downloadable content &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCadence-of-Hyrule-Crypt-of-the-Necro-Dancer-Featuring-The-Legend-of-Zelda-Season-Pass-Bundle-Nintendo-Switch-Digital-Download%2F622755446&amp;amp;subid1=TheVergeDeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $23.59 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (normally $40). If you like the older top-down &lt;em&gt;Zelda &lt;/em&gt;games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677194/cadence-of-hyrule-crypt-of-the-necrodancer-zelda-nintendo-hands-on-release-date-e3-2019" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this is an interesting twist on the formula&lt;/a&gt; that was made in collaboration with the team that made &lt;em&gt;Crypt of the NecroDancer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon stops charging extra for lossless music as Apple enters the fray</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tm0pn5XlTNwwYyvAmjOSZLokV1U=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298248/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UN6rLG"&gt;Faced with new competition from Apple, Amazon today announced that it will no longer charge an added fee for the “HD” tier of Amazon Music that lets customers stream audio at CD quality and above. From now on, lossless audio will be available to all Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers at no extra charge. &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9573513/amazon-music-hd-unlimited-hi-fi-price-streaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; was first to report the development&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ki5Wg"&gt;This makes Amazon the first company to offer lossless music at the industry’s standard $9.99 subscription rate. Amazon Music Unlimited is even cheaper ($7.99 per month) for Prime customers. And yes, the high-quality audio will also now be available for customers paying that price. Family plans are eligible for Amazon Music HD at no added cost, but student plans are exempt. Before Amazon entered the picture, the going rate for a lossless music subscription was $19.99; that’s what Tidal continues to charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jByEyy"&gt;What’s making this change possible? Well, as &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; points out, with all the music streaming heavyweights now going in on lossless audio, music labels care more about pushing up subscriber count totals across these services than the higher subscription premiums that they previously demanded for hi-res audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f77R4W"&gt;The price drop for Amazon Music HD comes on the very same day Apple announced the launch of lossless audio on Apple Music. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439885/apple-music-tease-hi-fi-lossless-music-streaming"&gt;teased significant news&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend after rumors began swirling late last week about the possibility. The company’s Apple Music Android app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;spilled the details a bit early&lt;/a&gt; and signaled that an announcement could be imminent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZkkTB"&gt;Amazon Music HD has been performing strongly for Amazon. A previous &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; report said the service is up 100 percent year over year. The service offers over 70 million songs in CD quality, with over 7 million exceeding that and available in “ultra HD” quality. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces lossless Apple Music is coming in June at no added cost</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wvFk2LBC5fkulgzL0s-p--sSWlA=/0x0:2490x1660/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298201/applemusic.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bIrmwc"&gt;Apple Music is getting two big updates next month: support for high-quality, lossless audio and for spatial audio through Dolby Atmos. But even more surprising, the features will be available for free to all subscribers, including those on family and student plans. The company says it’ll have 75 million lossless audio songs in its catalog by the end of the year and 20 million to start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swGTf9"&gt;Apple has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that lossless audio is exclusive to Apple Music and thus subscription-only. The company won’t offer music purchases in lossless quality, nor will there be any way to upgrade owned tracks to lossless with the paid iTunes Match service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8ZY83"&gt;To turn on lossless audio, subscribers must run the latest version of Apple Music and can go to Settings &amp;gt; Music &amp;gt; Audio Quality. There, they can opt into different resolutions for different connections, like cellular, Wi-Fi, or for download. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8F2ptn"&gt;Apple Music’s lossless audio starts at CD quality, which is 16 bit at 44.1 kHz, and goes up to 24 bit at 48 kHz natively on Apple devices. It tops out at 24 bit at 192 kHz. For the highest-quality “High-Resolution Lossless” experience, there’s one major catch: subscribers will need external equipment like a DAC to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BiJjoi"&gt;Spatial audio and Dolby Atmos audio could prove to be an even bigger deal for Apple Music listeners. It’ll provide more immersive mixes for anyone listening through recent AirPods or Beats headphones that use the H1 or W1 chip. Spatial audio will also play through the built-in speakers on the latest versions of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac by default. To turn it on for other headphones, users will have to go to Settings &amp;gt; Music &amp;gt; Audio and set Dolby Atmos to “Always On.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WP2Mt3"&gt;Spatial audio will be compatible with most Apple devices made in the last few years, including the Apple TV 4K connected to a compatible TV or receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DF8j3E"&gt;Lossless audio is now becoming standard across the biggest music streaming apps. Amazon just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440058/amazon-music-hd-price-cut-apple-lossless-audio"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s making Amazon Music HD available for free to Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers, and Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;plans to launch&lt;/a&gt; its HiFi tier later this year. Tidal also offers what it calls “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://tidal.com/masters&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22059314__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tidal Masters&lt;/a&gt;” that can even exceed high-resolution 96 kHz / 24 bit audio.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parler returns to Apple App Store with some content excluded</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Parler’s logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qhBZOnx2uDbyOXB0f_Ta1m-KoEg=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298112/1230591653.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x7GbGt"&gt;The iOS app for conservative-leaning social media platform Parler is back in the Apple App Store today, after what the company says were “months of productive dialogue with Apple.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MU99pp"&gt;“The entire Parler team has worked hard to address Apple’s concerns without compromising our core mission,” Parler interim CEO Mark Meckler said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Monday. “Anything allowed on the Parler network but not in the iOS app will remain accessible through our web-based and Android versions. This is a win-win for Parler, its users, and free speech.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNY0VW"&gt;Parler, which bills itself as a free speech alternative to Facebook or Twitter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"&gt;was banned by&lt;/a&gt; Apple, Google, and Amazon following the January 6th insurrection at the US Capitol. The companies said Parler had not adequately handled violent threats and hateful content on its platform that encouraged the riot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgPcBu"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391943/apple-parler-app-store-lawmakers-hearing-google-play"&gt;reaccepted Parler&lt;/a&gt; last month, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324028/apple-parler-app-store-ban-upheld-nazi-symbols"&gt;initially rejecting its application&lt;/a&gt; for re-entry in March; Apple said at the time Parler still had “highly objectionable content,” including Nazi imagery and other hate symbols. Parler says its algorithm can now “automatically detect violent or inciting content, while still preserving user privacy. Such content has always violated Parler’s guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77C8aG"&gt;Parler remains banned in Google’s Play Store, although users can still sideload the app on Android. Parler sued Amazon, which had provided the site’s web hosting, but the suit has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310873/parler-amazon-aws-lawsuit-antitrust-hosting-free-speech"&gt;so far not fared well&lt;/a&gt; in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JCsSa"&gt;As Meckler noted in his statement, Parler’s iOS app adheres to Apple’s requirements and “excludes some content that Parler otherwise allows,” the company said in a press release. “However, that content is still visible, at the user’s discretion, on the web-based and Android versions of the platform.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPtXyE"&gt;After the January deplatforming, Parler struggled to resurface on the web. Former CEO John Matze said at one point even the company’s vendors and lawyers had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223956/parler-ceo-john-matze-lawyers-vendors-abandoning"&gt;“ditched” him&lt;/a&gt;. Matze was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265298/parlers-ceo-has-been-fired"&gt;fired in February&lt;/a&gt;, he said, by a board that included Rebekah Mercer, of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/14/21565344/parler-funding-conservative-mercer-app-trump-twitter-facebook"&gt;prominent conservative&lt;/a&gt; Mercer family.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch is lowering subscription prices — but says streamers will earn more money</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a3t2lTOVOT4HT950rHqBVP2-l64=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298026/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EfzRyU"&gt;Twitch is announcing a big change to subscription prices — but not for users in the US. Most countries outside of the US will be getting lower prices that will be localized to their specific country, starting with Turkey and Mexico on May 20th. Those lower prices will mean less money for streamers, but Twitch believes they’ll translate to more subscribers and higher earnings in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PoD0J"&gt;Right now, the most affordable Twitch subscription, which lets fans pay streamers and get perks like custom emotes, currently costs $4.99, a price that is currently translated into local currencies around the world. That translated price can be prohibitively expensive to some Twitch users, however, Mike Minton, Twitch’s VP of monetization, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GBZOTM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Making subscriptions more affordable for Twitch’s global audience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iZv52R"&gt;The upcoming change is intended to make subscriptions more affordable for Twitch’s global audience. And early tests from Twitch seem promising: the company tested localized pricing in Brazil and saw that streamer revenue and total subscriber count “more than doubled,” &lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/2021/05/17/building-global-communities-with-local-subscription-pricing/"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BGRsp"&gt;But Twitch is also preparing for a potential scenario where streamers could see their revenue fall as a result of the price changes, because streamers will need more subscribers — potentially a lot more — just to match their current earnings. If a streamer’s revenue falls below their usual baseline (which Twitch calculates for every streamer) after the localized prices roll out, Twitch will pay that streamer a “revenue adjustment incentive” to help make up the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3B2Zr"&gt;Here is a basic description of how the incentive will work, according to Twitch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hZCktt"&gt;Twitch will cover 100% of baseline channel and Prime sub revenue (if needed) for three calendar months, including the month of the price change. After that, we will slowly decrease incentive payments by 25% every three months over the following 9 months, totaling a 12-month period of providing revenue adjustment incentives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1NdWLp"&gt;You can read the full details &lt;a href="http://help.twitch.tv/s/article/local-subscription-pricing"&gt;about the incentive here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNrsYY"&gt;The rollout starts first with Turkey and Mexico, where prices for a subscription will be lowered to 9.90 Turkish lira (the equivalent of $1.20) and 48 pesos (the equivalent of $2.41). Twitch plans to bring localized pricing to “most countries in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe starting in Q3 2021,” according to Twitch’s blog. Localized pricing will carry over to the two more expensive tiers of subscriptions and for gift subscriptions as well. And prices won’t be raised anywhere, just lowered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wNwD5f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Prices won’t be raised, just lowered&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XQYTyz"&gt;The changes come as many platforms are looking to give their creators better ways to monetize their followings. Twitter is testing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;a new Tip Jar feature&lt;/a&gt; and will begin rolling out ticketed social audio rooms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;in the coming months&lt;/a&gt;, and Clubhouse now lets people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368929/clubhouse-direct-payments-creators-stripe"&gt;pay creators directly&lt;/a&gt; (though not everyone can receive payments yet). While Twitch isn’t announcing any new monetization features today, the lowered subscription prices could lead to more people paying streamers directly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams launches for friends and family with free all-day video calling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4hwg3ymhuc2uesnnvB3FxCztGTU=/0x3:660x443/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298016/microsoftteamspersonal.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nkHMn2"&gt;Microsoft is launching the personal version of Microsoft Teams today. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298766/microsoft-teams-personal-launch-preview-accounts"&gt;previewing the service&lt;/a&gt; nearly a year ago, Microsoft Teams is now available for free personal use amongst friends and families. The service itself is almost identical to the Microsoft Teams that businesses use, and it will allow people to chat, video call, and share calendars, locations, and files easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXixZQ"&gt;Microsoft is also continuing to offer everyone free 24-hour video calls that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21579076/microsoft-teams-free-video-calling-web-zoom-competition"&gt;introduced in the preview version&lt;/a&gt; in November. You’ll be able to meet up with up to 300 people in video calls that can last for 24 hours. Microsoft will eventually enforce limits of 60 minutes for group calls of up to 100 people after the pandemic, but keep 24 hours for 1:1 calls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TAtbph9awqewKmplaGR_lO5-PWA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519798/Image_1_Together_Mode_GIF.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams’ Together mode feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B7cHjX"&gt;While the preview initially launched on iOS and Android, Microsoft Teams for personal use now works across the web, mobile, and desktop apps. Microsoft is also allowing Teams personal users to enable its Together mode — a feature that uses AI to segment your face and shoulders and place you together with other people in a virtual space. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189010/skype-together-mode-microsoft-teams-feature"&gt;Skype got this same feature&lt;/a&gt; back in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNan6W"&gt;Speaking of Skype, Microsoft hasn’t announced any plans to replace Skype with Microsoft Teams on the consumer side yet. Microsoft said it was “fully committed to Skype” last year when it launched the preview of this personal version of Microsoft Teams, but the rise of Zoom during the pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200844/microsoft-skype-zoom-houseparty-coronavirus-pandemic-usage-growth-competition"&gt;certainly highlighted Skype’s irrelevance&lt;/a&gt; amongst consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4Brin"&gt;As we noted last year, the personal version of Microsoft Teams is part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199376/microsoft-365-subscriptions-office-family-safety-app-teams-features-price"&gt;broader effort by Microsoft to remain relevant with consumers&lt;/a&gt; after a series of exits from consumer-friendly services. Microsoft isn’t looking to compete with iMessage, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or other chat apps, but it’s clear Zoom is in the company’s sights after its huge rise with consumers during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsLvTz"&gt;If you’re interested in trying out Microsoft Teams for personal use, you can download the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1113153706"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.teams"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-teams%2Fteams-for-home" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;desktop apps&lt;/a&gt;, or simply head to &lt;a href="https://teams.live.com/"&gt;Teams on the web&lt;/a&gt; and avoid downloading anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another report claims Samsung will ditch Tizen for Wear OS with next smartwatch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KyyIibgvawlbLIXaCAlbeSLLhs0=/467x0:5498x3354/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297955/dseifert_200811_4139_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 3 from last year.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CVFizi"&gt;Samsung seems ready to ditch its own Tizen operating system in favor of Google’s Wear OS for its upcoming smartwatches, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/exclusive-galaxy-watch-4-feature-wear-os-confirmed/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company reportedly has as many as three smartwatches on the way soon, including one with a rotating bezel, and two others with sportier designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTGNC4"&gt;Although Samsung’s smartwatches are often recommended as the best options for Android phone users, the company has opted for its own Tizen operating system over Google’s Wear OS. But rumors of the company’s upcoming switch to Wear OS have been circulating for a couple of months now. Back in February, leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1362697174694301700"&gt;IceUniverse said its new watch&lt;/a&gt; would make the switch from Tizen, and in March, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-android-wear-os/#update1:~:text=Merlot,-%E2%80%9D%20device"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on mentions of “WearOS” discovered in the Galaxy S20’s source code alongside the codename of an unreleased device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zQy3Em"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A new walkie-talkie-style feature is reportedly on the way&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n4KDxV"&gt;Samsung will reportedly pair a new version of One UI with Wear OS so that its new watches are consistent with previous Tizen models, &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; notes. Other new features include a walkie-talkie feature similar to what the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17428180/walkie-talkie-apple-watch-facetime-audio-wwdc-2028"&gt;Apple Watch already offers&lt;/a&gt; as well as new SmartThings features for Samsung’s smart home ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7UK3K"&gt;As one of the &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartwatch-shipments-market-share/"&gt;biggest smartwatch alternatives&lt;/a&gt; to Apple, Samsung switching to Wear OS would be a big deal for Google’s platform. It could potentially bring a lot more users to Wear OS, which would give developers more of an incentive to build apps for it and address one of the long-standing criticisms of the platform. But this is just one of a litany of issues people have with Wear OS, and my colleague Dieter Bohn recently argued that the platform is “overdue for an overhaul.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzeXve"&gt;But arguably, Samsung’s own smartwatches are just as in need of a change as Google’s OS. When we reviewed last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368752/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Galaxy Watch 3&lt;/a&gt;, we said it was a fine product but that it didn’t feel like much of a generational leap over Samsung’s previous wearables. Like Wear OS, Tizen also suffers from a lack of app support, but it’s also saddled with its terrible Bixby voice assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="moeiXt"&gt;There’s no official word on when we might see a Wear OS-equipped Samsung smartwatch release, but &lt;em&gt;SamMobile &lt;/em&gt;speculates that we could see an announcement alongside new foldables in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqmUlV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ‘Charlie bit my finger’ video is being auctioned as an NFT — then deleted ‘forever’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-wH4ZMr-zXS9tRpyMcoKRLOO2pM=/52x0:457x270/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297806/hqdefault.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/HDCYT" target="_blank"&gt;Image: HDCYT on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbpNKC"&gt;The creators of the classic “Charlie bit my finger - again !” video are now auctioning it off as an NFT, but with a twist. At the end of the auction, which will begin on May 22nd, the original video will be deleted from YouTube forever, according to a press release, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OBlgSz8sSM"&gt;where it currently has over 880 million views&lt;/a&gt;. The auction will kick off on the video’s 14th anniversary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="HTKfSl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sfahRo"&gt;Since NFTs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;exploded onto the cultural landscape&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, we’ve seen plenty of early-to-mid 2000s memes being sold on the blockchain, with many of them fetching higher prices than I would’ve ever have imagined. A non-exhaustive list includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422993/david-after-dentist-meme-nft-real-life"&gt;David After Dentist&lt;/a&gt;: sold for around $11,500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="vGiLCq"&gt;Seeing these numbers, some people (including myself) have snidely said something along the lines of “why would you pay that much for something that’s not actually scarce? I can see Nyan Cat on the internet whenever I like.” Deleting &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/bvixd4/oc_top_10_most_viewed_youtube_videos_20062019/"&gt;one of the most well-known videos from YouTube&lt;/a&gt; does at least somewhat solve that argument, since whoever ends up with the NFT will actually be able to lay claim to something scarce. That is, assuming the buyer doesn’t just repost the video themselves (and ignoring the re-uploads that currently exist across the internet).&lt;/p&gt;
