    <title>Nvidia warns the great GPU shortage will continue throughout 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tiEQDe"&gt;If you were hoping to pickup a new RTX 30-series GPU in the coming months, Nvidia is warning about supply shortages for the rest of 2021. “We expect demand to continue to exceed supply for much of this year,” said Colette Kress, Nvidia CFO, on an &lt;a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-first-quarter-fiscal-2022-revenue-tracking-above-outlook?ncid=afm-chs-44270&amp;amp;ranMID=44270&amp;amp;ranEAID=kXQk6*ivFEQ&amp;amp;ranSiteID=kXQk6.ivFEQ-u_56nr2EJ2TBzDSKQ9NTsg"&gt;investors call earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pzGEDh"&gt;That means the difficulties of finding a new 30-series GPU will likely continue, possibly into 2022. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;Nvidia previously warned&lt;/a&gt; that supplies would “likely remain lean” through its fiscal Q1, and now that we’re approaching that milestone (end of April) it’s clear that supply hasn’t improved significantly to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uw36tF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385240/tsmc-chip-shortage-2022-intel-ceo-earnings-graphics-cards-cpus-gpus"&gt;TSMC and Intel are also both warning&lt;/a&gt; that chip supply issues could last through 2022. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; has forced some car manufacturers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22222166/semiconductor-shortage-ford-idle-kentucky-toyota-nissan-volkswagen"&gt;scale back production&lt;/a&gt;, and consumers have found it near impossible to find new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;, CPUs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297039/playstation-ceo-ps5-supply-2021-stock-consoles-jim-ryan"&gt;PS5s&lt;/a&gt;, and Xboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lugFpP"&gt;Nvidia does note that despite the issues, supply should still increase as 2021 progresses. “We will see supply continue to increase throughout this quarter as well as throughout the year,” said Kress. Regardless, it’s still going to be difficult to find a new GPU when you have to compete with fellow gamers, cryptominers, and scalpers that are pushing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;real prices of GPUs way out of control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ZTE Axon 30 Ultra 5G is coming to the US with a 144Hz display and a whole lot more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EkhPadMVYUi0mDj-aJ7Ot6tlvas=/164x0:1373x806/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69129504/Axon_30_Colors_1536x806.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra 5G offers a whole bunch of rear-facing cameras.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: ZTE&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8TTDaP"&gt;ZTE has unveiled the Axon 30 Ultra alongside two other 30-series devices — the Axon 30 and Axon 30 Pro — though the Ultra has at least one unique feature: it will be sold in the US and Canada. Exact availability and pricing are still TBD, but we do know that the 30 Ultra has all of the trappings of a high-end Android device. It will offer a Snapdragon 888 processor with 8GB or 12GB of RAM, a 6.67-inch 1080p OLED with adaptive refresh rates up to 144Hz, four rear cameras including a 5x zoom, and 66W fast charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IB0C0e"&gt;The 30 Ultra features a prominent camera bump that houses plenty of pixels, starting with a 64-megapixel f/1.6 main camera with optical image stabilization. There’s another 64-megapixel camera — unstabilized with a 35mm-equivalent f/1.9 lens — and an ultrawide with (you guessed it) a 64-megapixel sensor. A periscope-style telephoto lens is coupled with an 8-megapixel sensor and includes optical stabilization. Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;Axon 20 5G&lt;/a&gt;, it offers a traditional hole-punch 16-megapixel selfie camera around front; no under-screen camera here, which is a good thing in our book. Video recording from the main camera tops out at 8K/30fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lnvIjV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10447167"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SFwKTt"&gt;ZTE calls the phone’s 6.67-inch display a “borderless, curved” OLED panel with a 95% screen-to-body ratio. It’s protected with Gorilla Glass 5 — as is the rear panel — and includes HDR10 support. It offers adaptive refresh rates of 60Hz, 90Hz, 120Hz, and 144Hz, which it uses depending on the application to save battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvmXfH"&gt;Rounding out the feature set, the Axon 30 Ultra 5G includes a large 4,600mAh battery that supports fast 66W wired charging. It ships with Android 11 and offers an in-screen fingerprint reader for biometric unlock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCRBLq"&gt;The step-down Axon 30 Pro still includes the Snapdragon 888 chipset, but features a different rear camera configuration, a non-variable 120Hz screen, and less-speedy 55W charging. The Axon 30 base model is the only one to get the next iteration of the in-display selfie camera, &lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/01/20/zte-teases-axon-30-smartphone-will-have-an-under-display-camera/"&gt;as teased by ZTE&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1mW1C"&gt;For now, the Ultra looks like a whole lot of phone, but it’s hard to judge just how competitive it will be in the US until we have a confirmed price. When it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; available, it’ll be &lt;a href="https://www.ztedevices.com/en/"&gt;sold online&lt;/a&gt; unlocked from ZTE. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chip manufacturer TSMC warns shortages could continue through 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TAIWAN-ECONOMY-SEMICONDUCTORS-TECHNOLOGY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tyiRs0MALULXRot3KLFwxYIYhB0=/5x0:4775x3180/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69129467/1231936348.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by SAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rHjFEX"&gt;TSMC, which makes processors for Apple, Qualcomm, AMD, and numerous other big consumer tech companies, has warned that chip shortages could last through 2022. “We see the demand continue to be high,” TSMC CEO C. C. Wei said in comments &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-15/tsmc-profit-beats-as-chip-shortage-shows-no-sign-of-abating?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “In 2023, I hope we can offer more capacity to support our customers. At that time, we’ll start to see the supply chain tightness release a little bit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQshNE"&gt;Wei’s comments mirror predictions made by Intel’s new CEO Pat Gelsinger earlier this week, who warned that it could take a few years to address the shortage, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/13/intel-ceo-semiconductor-chip-shortage/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. “It just takes a couple of years to build capacity,” Gelsinger said. Likewise, Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress &lt;a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-first-quarter-fiscal-2022-revenue-tracking-above-outlook?ncid=afm-chs-44270&amp;amp;ranMID=44270&amp;amp;ranEAID=kXQk6*ivFEQ&amp;amp;ranSiteID=kXQk6.ivFEQ-u_56nr2EJ2TBzDSKQ9NTsg"&gt;recently said&lt;/a&gt; the graphics card manufacturer expects “demand to continue to exceed supply for much of this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pU048f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In 2023, I hope we can offer more capacity to support our customers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aeQ2m0"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; has impacted everyone from automakers to games console manufacturers. Car manufacturers have had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22222166/semiconductor-shortage-ford-idle-kentucky-toyota-nissan-volkswagen"&gt;scale back production&lt;/a&gt;, while anyone looking to upgrade their gaming setup has struggled to find stock of new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;, CPUs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297039/playstation-ceo-ps5-supply-2021-stock-consoles-jim-ryan"&gt;PS5s&lt;/a&gt;, and Xboxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TppA3m"&gt;TSMC does have good news for its automaker clients, saying they could expect chip supply to improve next quarter. But comments from TSMC, Intel, and Nvidia suggest that the broader shortages are unlikely to abate anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjXwkJ"&gt;TSMC says it’s already running its fabs at “over 100 percent utilization,” but in the medium term it’s increasing investment in new production. “We have acquired land and equipment, and started the construction of new facilities. We are hiring thousands of employees and expanding our capacity at multiple sites,” Wei said in comments &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tsmc-results-idUSKBN2C20IH"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeuzF5"&gt;TSMC now plans to invest $30 billion on upgrading and expanding its production capacity this year (up from a previous forecast of between $25 and $28 billion). It reiterated that construction at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259094/apple-tsmc-factory-chips-arizona-a-series"&gt;$12 billion Arizona plant&lt;/a&gt; is still scheduled to begin this year. Overall, the company plans to invest $100 billion to increase capacity in its plants over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This is the best Windows File Explorer design concept I’ve ever seen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-HnCHUXF1kw4jH_5hTJ9MhrxO8s=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69129461/fileexplorer.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;File Explorer concept.&lt;/em&gt; | Alur2020 (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/mqsp10/redesigned_file_explorer/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K62khu"&gt;Microsoft’s Windows File Explorer has existed in the operating system since Windows 95, and it has served as a focal point for design concepts ever since. I’ve seen a variety of mockups over the years that try to redesign the File Explorer and modernize it, but &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/mqsp10/redesigned_file_explorer/"&gt;Reddit user Alur2020&lt;/a&gt; has really nailed what modern file management should look like in Windows 10. This is the best Windows File Explorer concept I’ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdnNDA"&gt;The concept, spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/mouth-watering-user-concept-of-windows-10-file-explorer-has-reddit-salivating/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neowin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is immediately striking for its sheer simplicity and usability. The default home area imagines a location where you can quickly see pinned items, drives, and recently used files. It’s a simple location to find anything important. Alur2020 has also incorporated Microsoft’s new Windows 10 system icons, and even color coded groups for files and folders much like macOS’ Finder.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nIGZkSYosBT6JmlQ7tNU2z6rcjQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445533/qr815nfao5t61.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Alur2020 (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/mqsp10/redesigned_file_explorer/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;File Explorer concept.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J487z5"&gt;Aside from the pure design, this concept also imagines what tabs might look like in a modern File Explorer. It looks very similar to Microsoft Edge browser tabs, allowing File Explorer users to open up multiple folders in a single view. Microsoft was working on its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/7/17092752/microsoft-windows-10-file-explorer-tabs"&gt;Sets feature for Windows 10&lt;/a&gt; that included tabs in File Explorer, but the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512250/microsoft-windows-10-sets-feature-app-tabs-removal"&gt;put this work on hold&lt;/a&gt; a couple of years ago. It’s not clear whether File Explorer will ever officially get tabs support in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMnxS4"&gt;This concept File Explorer also offers up a cleaner way to deal with images in folders, with a minimalist ribbon of options. There’s even nested folders on the side panel, allowing Windows users to quickly switch between folders that are buried deep in multiple folder structures. The breadcrumb bar has worked well for navigation at the top of the File Explorer for years, but this nested folders option offers even more ways to navigate around.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AI-F_tfre5N0nthEHeXpWMj8r4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445534/d24v4rfao5t61.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Alur2020 (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/mqsp10/redesigned_file_explorer/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This File Explorer concept also imagines how nested folders would work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="os25cz"&gt;Alur2020’s concept has proved &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/mqsp10/redesigned_file_explorer/"&gt;popular over on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, with hundreds of comments praising the design, thousands of upvotes, and a number of Reddit awards. The concept comes just weeks after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348639/microsoft-windows-10-file-explorer-new-icons-system-update"&gt;Microsoft unveiled new File Explorer icons&lt;/a&gt; as part of a larger visual overhaul for Windows 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ON73aX"&gt;Microsoft has also created &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313037/microsoft-windows-10-new-system-icons-ui-overhaul-sun-valley"&gt;new system icons&lt;/a&gt; for Windows 10 this year, as part of a planned “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;,” codenamed “Sun Valley.” The company is expected to detail its Windows UI plans and more about the future of the OS in the coming months as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261997/microsoft-news-events-gaming-cloud-windows"&gt;dedicated news event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s GeForce Experience now optimizes settings for creative apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d_dC01ffSimR3w9c8JJfjka0CuM=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69129299/NVIDIA_Studio_Optimal_Settings.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ua1U8O"&gt;Nvidia has &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/04/14/studio-gtc-apr-14/"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; a new feature for its GeForce Experience software that helps users of creative applications make sure they’re getting the best performance out of their GPUs. GeForce Experience can now tell you whether you have the best settings enabled for more than 30 creative apps including DaVinci Resolve, Adobe’s Lightroom and Illustrator, and Autodesk’s AutoCAD. If certain GPU features aren’t active, you can turn them on from within GeForce Experience itself “with a single button press.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wdtG3"&gt;For example, DaVinci Resolve users can automatically optimize settings for GPU acceleration in various modes, which may or may not have been switched on already. The idea is that GeForce Experience can now be a central hub for creative apps that helps you maximize performance. Nvidia isn’t doing anything specific here to actually improve how the apps work — though it is also releasing a new Studio Driver today for creative software — this is just a convenient way to make sure that you’ve set them up in the best way possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NlyN5F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nvidia focuses further on creators&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2aIAAX"&gt;GeForce Experience is an application for Nvidia GPU owners that’s usually associated with gaming-related functionality. For example, Nvidia releases “Game Ready Drivers” through GeForce Experience that optimizes new games for its GPUs, and the application can serve as a launcher for those games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3qs7R"&gt;With this move, the software is further expanding its focus to encompass creative users as well, which is an area that Nvidia continues to concentrate on. Earlier today the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383572/open-broadcaster-software-obs-nvidia-noise-removal-rtx-voice-broadcast"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that its RTX-powered audio noise removal feature would be directly integrated into Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), the popular streaming software.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bang and Olufsen’s latest speaker disappears into your bookshelf</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VuFnBC2uAegi9TLsdcL8eDwFkh8=/0x1:1920x1281/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69129265/Beosound_Emerge_0037.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Emerge’s design was “inspired by the compact form factor of a book.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cXyBDB"&gt;Bang and Olufsen’s latest connected speaker is the Emerge. Its thin form-factor should blend right in to most bookshelves, and that’s no accident. In a press release &lt;a href="https://press.bang-olufsen.com/d/gKpSDxqk8eyT/news#/april-2021/bang-olufsen-introduces-beosound-emerge-an-incredibly-slim-yet-powerful-home-speaker"&gt;announcing the speaker&lt;/a&gt;, the company says its design was “inspired by the compact form factor of a book” with side panels that wrap around like a cover, and a logo on the front that’s meant to evoke a title printed on the spine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seJuu6"&gt;It’s a nice contrast from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/7/9470909/40000-speaker-bang-olufsen"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; of Bang and Olufsen’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/29/17795192/bang-olufsen-edge-speaker-price-release-date-ifa-2018"&gt;previous speakers&lt;/a&gt;, which have had huge, hulking form-factors that are hard to imagine in any normal home. Instead, the Emerge takes a similar approach to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound"&gt;Ikea’s Symfonisk speakers&lt;/a&gt;, which have pulled double duty as lamps or shelving to help them blend in with the rest of your furniture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ej1XNnSteAinXaMG66GaGIq6uyY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445488/Beosound_Emerge_0041.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get it? Like a title on a book spine?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jM8rD4"&gt;B&amp;amp;O says the Emerge speaker’s small form-factor shouldn’t make it a slouch in the sound quality department, however. “The vision for Beosound Emerge was to create the slimmest speaker possible that could still deliver full range, ultra-wide sound despite its size through its revolutionary driver configuration,” says the company’s head of product management Christoffer Poulsen. Internally there’s a triple-driver configuration consisting of a 4-inch woofer, a 1.45-inch mid-range, and a 0.6-inch tweeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZ5ETC"&gt;In terms of connectivity, the Emerge supports all the standards you’d expect out of a modern connected speaker. There’s Spotify Connect support, Bluetooth 5.0, Airplay 2, and Chromecast streaming, as well as a built-in microphone with Google Assistant support. Physical connections include a line-in/optical jack, Ethernet, and a USB-C port for power. And yes, you can pair two Emerge’s together to create a stereo pair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snGSOu"&gt;B&amp;amp;O says the speaker uses the same replaceable connectivity module that appeared in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22264409/bang-and-olufsen-beosound-level-modular-streaming-smart-speaker-bluetooth-airplay"&gt;recent Beosound Level&lt;/a&gt;, which will allow it to receive “new performance updates and features for years to come.” Eventually this module can be replaced if it gets outdated, B&amp;amp;O says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGB7po"&gt;The Bang and Olufsen Emerge is available in select European markets starting today, and will release globally this autumn. Pricing starts at £539 / €599 9around $717) for the black model, while the gold model which has an oak wood cover costs slightly more at £669 / €749 (around $879).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UBIzWt"&gt;We may never see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22296298/lg-rollable-denial-not-on-hold-or-cancelled"&gt;LG’s incredible rollable phone&lt;/a&gt; come to market, now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;its smartphone days are done&lt;/a&gt;, but at least the rollable TV we’ve been eagerly tracking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/9/16866060/lg-display-rollable-oled-tv-65-inch-ces-2018"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt; is finally making it to the United States. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fglobal%2Flg-signature%2Frollable-oled-tv-r&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F14%2F22384789%2Flg-rollable-tv-usa-united-states-price-release-date-availability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can now “inquire to buy” one&lt;/a&gt; at the company’s website, as spotted by &lt;a href="https://hdguru.com/lg-quietly-fielding-inquiries-in-u-s-for-rollable-oled-r-tvs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HD Guru&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-rollable-oled-r-available-us-222137792.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98g18O"&gt;While the company doesn’t list a price, we highly doubt you’ll nab one for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21054005/lg-rollable-oled-4k-tv-shipping-price-release-date-ces-2020"&gt;the $60,000 originally promised&lt;/a&gt;; the motorized TV-in-a-box &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21524338/lg-rollable-tv-available-price-on-sale-korea"&gt;went on sale in South Korea&lt;/a&gt; last October for 100 million won, or over $89,000 in today’s US dollars. We also wouldn’t be surprised if you have to pay for more than just the TV itself, seeing how we reached the voicemail of a “custom integration specialist” when we called the provided number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijQ78S"&gt;While the rollable TV will be quite the conversation piece, you should also know it’s a couple years behind the times when it comes to certain specs and image processing. Then again, if you’re the kind of person who can afford one, you can probably retire to the bedroom when you crave more power, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/11/27/21723138/samsung-98-inch-tv-deal-sale-black-friday-8k"&gt;your 98-inch 8K set&lt;/a&gt; is no doubt ready to embrace you with every one of its 33 million pixels.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Goodbye, funky hacks: you’ll soon be able to download albums on the Spotify desktop app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/biwCHYYymRmaLMwyZlMKgHrfxxg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69127866/acastro_180213_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TI2zLe"&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-25/introducing-a-new-spotify-experience-across-desktop-app-and-web-player/"&gt;Spotify’s desktop app refresh&lt;/a&gt; seems to be rolling out to users, and it brings with it a very handy feature: album downloads. The app has supported downloading playlists to your computer for quite a while. The update should make it easier to keep your library managed if you want to keep the music going even when you’re offline. It is worth noting that this feature is limited to Premium subscribers — according to Spotify’s documentation, free users are only able to download podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PukiGg"&gt;Downloading an album works similarly to downloading a playlist: just navigate to the album’s page and press the download button. It should then be available the next time &lt;a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/listen-offline/"&gt;you go into Offline mode&lt;/a&gt;. This should make it easier to manage your offline library if you’re the type of person who’s very particular about what you want to listen to. (For example, I had a carefully curated playlist called “Downloads” that I would dump songs and albums into as a workaround to not being able to save individual things for offline listening.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pcd0e7zo3xrpiKlsp_bvUkhnkbI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444463/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now I can download individual albums and set my Downloads playlist free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zRVmau"&gt;The update also features tweaks to the look of the desktop and web player, as well as how playlist management works. It appears to be currently rolling out — some &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staff got it yesterday, others today. So if you’re not seeing it, just hang tight. You should see a screen letting you know that you’ve got the update.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A74ZJo4uGApYH1E0e467pzs6g1M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444480/image__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who doesn’t love offline use?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine pause continues as officials ask for more data  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Grubb’s Pharmacy" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y-UC2A2v8PuRvFHcyyAESVoqr8k=/0x0:4364x2909/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69127761/1232272873.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PLAw0r"&gt;Use of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine remains paused in the United States as officials gather more information about the rare clots reported in six people who got the shot. An independent advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it didn’t have enough information yet to say which groups might be at risk of the clots or to recommend who should get this vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxuo3v"&gt;“I don’t think we have enough information today,” said Grace Lee, associate chief medical officer for practice innovation at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital in California, during the committee’s meeting on Wednesday. The group will reconvene as rapidly as possible — likely next week — after gathering more data and evaluating that information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6G5E2F"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended Tuesday morning that the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381469/covid-vaccine-pause-blood-clots-johnson-fda-cdc"&gt;pause use&lt;/a&gt; of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine in light of six reports of unusual blood clots in people who got the shot. Although there is no proven relationship between the clots and the vaccine, and the events are probably rare, the agencies wanted time to investigate the reports and give doctors information on how to treat the condition. The agencies said Tuesday that they hoped to resolve the pause as quickly as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B2i8Dx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The agencies said Tuesday that they hoped to resolve the pause as quickly as possible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WVe4Dx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/14/johnson-johnson-vaccine-pause-whos-affected/"&gt;Underserved communities&lt;/a&gt; in the US are most affected by a Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson pause. The easy-to-store, one-shot vaccine was being used for homebound seniors, at pop-up clinics in rural areas, and for people experiencing homelessness. The effect of this pause on those groups was a serious topic of conversation during the meeting today. “This one and done vaccine that didn’t require the cold chain is a significant loss,” said Camille Kotton, the clinical director of transplant and immunocompromised host infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital. That group, though, might have the most challenges getting treatment for a clot if they do develop one, noted Helen Talbot, an associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9a2B3"&gt;The CDC received the six reports between March 19th and April 12th through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Unusually, all six patients had cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (a type of blood clot in the brain) in combination with low levels of platelets, a type of blood cell involved in clotting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="brVGST"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RRYHx1"&gt;The CDC was keeping a special eye out for reports of these clots because of the issues seen with the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/04/07/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-linked-to-blood-clots/"&gt;AstraZeneca vaccine&lt;/a&gt; in Europe and the United Kingdom, Tom Shimabukuro, a member of the CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force, said during the committee meeting. “This is a really good example of how robust the US vaccine safety monitoring system is and how in this case, during a large-scale national mass vaccination program, the system worked in various functions exactly as planned,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ayk4lD"&gt;The COVID-19 working group at the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) met earlier this week to go over the reports. The six people who had clots were all young women. Even though they were rare, they occurred at a higher-than-expected rate in that group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9VQtd"&gt;Sara Oliver, an epidemic intelligence service officer at the CDC, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-04/05-COVID-Oliver-508.pdf"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during today’s meeting that the working group noted how much we still don’t know about these clots. It’s not clear how often the combination of both the clots and low platelets would normally appear in the general population, which makes it difficult to say how far above the norm these reports are. We also don’t have a good sense of the risk factors for developing this condition. There also could still be more reports — nearly 4 million people received doses in the past two weeks, and those people are still in a window where a clot may occur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PUw8Kl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine isn’t the only shot available&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AlFICg"&gt;The group also noted that the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine isn’t the only shot available in the US. Officials aren’t seeing the same problems in people who got the Pfizer / BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. Only around 5 percent of vaccines given in the US so far were the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXQD1D"&gt;“We are very fortunate because we have multiple other alternatives in the US to end the health pandemic,” Talbot said. “We’re in a different position and can be more cautious.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2d8hb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVrUUD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 10’s Timeline feature is going away</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o-ts_3kNOlrALTUPkU-VhXmVJ1E=/16x0:2392x1584/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69127703/Screen_Shot_2021_04_14_at_5.21.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LEMbfp"&gt;Windows 10 is officially losing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/11/15610612/microsoft-windows-10-timeline-feature"&gt;once-ambitious Timeline feature&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft announced today. Timeline, first launched in 2017, was designed to make it easier for users to swap between multiple devices — transitioning seamlessly from a Windows 10 PC to an Android or iOS phone and back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87JrNs"&gt;It’s no surprise that Timeline is getting deprecated: it was a feature that heavily relied on Microsoft’s Cortana assistant, which would prompt users to resume tasks from device to device. Cortana was a particularly important part of building out the Timeline experience on iOS and Android devices, where Microsoft (obviously) had less control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uirryj"&gt;Given that Cortana’s prevalence in Windows has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349827/microsoft-cortana-shutdown-devices-ios-android"&gt;heavily diminished&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/16/20967875/microsoft-cortana-ios-android-app-removal-countries-support-document"&gt;the mobile apps completely discontinued&lt;/a&gt;, it makes sense that Microsoft would sunset Timeline as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3LIeX"&gt;The news was announced as part of the changelog for the &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/04/14/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-21359/"&gt;Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 21359&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0Kmr2M"&gt;If you have your activity history synced across your devices through your Microsoft account (MSA), you’ll no longer have the option to upload new activity in Timeline. AAD-connected accounts won’t be impacted. To view web history, Edge and other browsers have the option to look back at recent web activities. You can also view recently used files using OneDrive and Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="CquIKS"&gt;Insider build users should already see the changes once they’ve installed the new update, while users on the standard update track should see the removal of Timeline in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NUlxxV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:57PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft has changed its blog post and contacted us to say that Timeline is not actually going away, only “a capability within Timeline that is specific to roaming across devices.” But since the whole point of Timeline is roaming across devices, it still sounds like the feature as we know it is dying. We’re asking Microsoft for clarification. The company’s blog post now adds: “Note: Timeline and all your local activity history still remain on Windows 10.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
