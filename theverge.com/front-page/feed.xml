    <title>Tesla delivered close to one million vehicles in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yGNZG2"&gt;Tesla delivered a record 936,172 vehicles in 2021, as outlined in a &lt;a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q4-2021-vehicle-production-deliveries"&gt;report from Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, representing an 87 percent increase over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210191/tesla-delivery-goal-elon-musk-vehicles-2020"&gt;499,550 vehicle deliveries Tesla made in 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zRznkj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Great work by Tesla team worldwide! &lt;a href="https://t.co/lsDTCJtMrp"&gt;https://t.co/lsDTCJtMrp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1477700424933253123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 2, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FFS2cd"&gt;The company managed to deliver 308,600 cars in the last quarter of 2021 alone, up from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22704830/tesla-sold-241300-cars-third-quarter"&gt;241,300 deliveries in the third quarter&lt;/a&gt;. Of those deliveries, 11,750 were for the Model S and X, while 296,850 were for the Model 3 and Y. Both the Model 3 and Y also made up the majority of deliveries throughout the entire year at 936,172 shipments, compared to the 24,964 Model S and X deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1leKyH"&gt;Tesla previously stated that it plans on increasing its deliveries by about 50 percent every year, and although it didn’t hit one million shipments, it has still surpassed its annual growth goal. In November, an internal memo revealed that Tesla CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807387/tesla-quarterly-deliveries-end-rush-elon-musk-memo"&gt;told his employees to stop rushing&lt;/a&gt; to make deliveries by the end of the quarter and to instead focus on cutting costs, noting that he expected a wave of vehicles from Tesla’s factories in California and China to reach customers in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAcH8e"&gt;The ongoing chip shortage has caused a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787339/chevrolet-trucks-heated-seats-2022-models-chip-shortage-supply-chain-issues"&gt;number of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701086/cadillac-super-cruise-2022-escalade-semiconductor-shortage"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765709/bmw-chip-shortage-touchscreen-car-suv-manufacturing"&gt;manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; to pump their brakes, Tesla included. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;Tesla rewrote its own software&lt;/a&gt; to help mitigate the impact of the shortage, and also had to briefly &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-temporarily-halted-u-s-production-over-parts-shortage-11614295075"&gt;shut down production at its California plant&lt;/a&gt; in February. Some customers even reported that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/13/22780037/tesla-reportedly-shipping-cars-without-usb-ports"&gt;USB ports were missing&lt;/a&gt; in their vehicles, potentially because of the shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBvReC"&gt;Despite all this, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744504/hertz-tesla-order-100000-vehicles-electrify-fleet"&gt;Tesla’s value exceeded $1 trillion&lt;/a&gt; in October after rental car company Hertz added 100,000 Teslas to its fleet. The company even had its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736859/tesla-q3-earnings-profit-chip-shortage-sales-elon-musk"&gt;most profitable quarter ever&lt;/a&gt; in the third quarter of 2021, but that may change, considering that earnings for the final quarter of 2021 have not yet been released.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter permanently suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene’s personal account over COVID-19 misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Republicans Hold Press Conference On Biden Administration’s Agenda" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t_hzYIcVSq41Esbnggm55wZMayY=/0x3:8024x5352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70339167/1353869875.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7gX8gH"&gt;Twitter has permanently suspended Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene’s personal account for repeatedly violating the platform’s &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/medical-misinformation-policy"&gt;rules on COVID-19 misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, as noted in a report by &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/02/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-twitter-suspension/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Since the ban only affects Greene’s personal Twitter account, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mtgreenee"&gt;@mtgreenee&lt;/a&gt;, she can still access and tweet from her governmental account, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepMTG"&gt;@RepMTG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rjEzGq"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Twitter spokesperson Katie Rosborough explains that the platform “permanently suspended” Greene’s account “for repeated violations” of the platform’s COVID-19 policies. “We’ve been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KFJmI0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter implemented a five-strike system for COVID-19 misinformation last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="15W4ec"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307919/twitter-covid-19-vaccine-labels-five-strike-system"&gt;Twitter implemented a five-strike system&lt;/a&gt; in March 2021, which puts a lock on users’ accounts if they post tweets containing misinformation about COVID-19 — the more strikes a user accrues, the longer they're temporarily barred from their account. If a user receives five strikes, however, their account gets permanently suspended. Twitter didn’t confirm which tweet was Greene’s final strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VuhjQv"&gt;Greene responded to the situation &lt;a href="https://t.me/RealMarjorieGreene/1432"&gt;in a post on Telegram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/MarjorieTaylorGreene/photos/a.1809748895981879/2911583609131730/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. “Twitter is an enemy to America and can’t handle the truth,” Greene states. “Social media platforms can’t stop the truth from being spread far and wide.” She also claims she was suspended for tweeting out data from the &lt;a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/"&gt;Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)&lt;/a&gt;, a database that stores information about potential adverse reactions to vaccines — including the COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KtKtcw"&gt;Last year, Greene was suspended from Twitter several times for violating the platform's policies. Her account was temporarily banned for &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/twitter-temporarily-suspends-gop-rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-n1254557"&gt;violating Twitter’s civic integrity policy&lt;/a&gt;, and was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/technology/marjorie-taylor-greene-twitter.html"&gt;later suspended&lt;/a&gt; on two &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/twitter-temporarily-suspends-rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-over-false-covid-n1276414"&gt;separate occasions&lt;/a&gt; after tweeting misleading information about COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new smart monitor can control your IoT devices, stream games, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Smart Monitor M8" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i5wVEnX0rwO584TlhacItMi7nPs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70338930/smartmonitorm8.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yotMIp"&gt;Samsung is adding onto its lineup of smart monitors with the 4K 32-inch M8. Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/15/21562738/samsung-smart-monitor-m5-m7-tizen-smart-tv-airplay-2-usb-c-release-date-price-features"&gt;models&lt;/a&gt; that are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22450796/samsung-smart-monitor-m5-m7-new-sizes-43-inch"&gt;currently&lt;/a&gt; on sale, this new one can deliver smart TV-like functionality, including offering access to streaming apps, in addition to being able to plug into a computer like normal monitors. The company hasn’t revealed a release date or price, but the initial details we’ve learned prove that Samsung is going a few steps further with the M8 to make it even more useful to a variety of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LUPSf"&gt;This smart monitor is 11.4mm-thick, which Samsung says is significantly thinner than prior models. Perhaps the most impressive feature is its magnetic and moveable SlimFit camera that can attach to the monitor for video calls. The monitor itself supports video chat apps like Google Duo. With Samsung’s other smart monitors, you need to bring your own webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung Smart Monitor M8" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g6MKWL4bOX__PWSkVGsWhP-jsz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23139309/m82.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VyMP3Z"&gt;Samsung’s also integrating a SmartThings IoT Hub into the M8, allowing you to see a floor map of your various smart devices and control them directly from the smart monitor. Samsung says the M8 also has a new feature called Workspace, which gathers work-related web services, like Microsoft 365, into an intuitive hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9C1bR"&gt;One other new feature is Game Home, which turns the M8 into a cloud game streaming monitor. Samsung says that owners will be able to use the M8 to stream games from game streaming services, and even connect wireless controllers to it. Though, it stopped short of naming services or controllers it’ll support. The company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that more information will be shared about this feature closer to its launch later in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWz9AI"&gt;Samsung hasn’t shared all of the ports the M8 will feature, though it mentioned that it has a USB-C port that can support 65W charging passthrough. Nor has it mentioned price or availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4ax09"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22624053"&gt;The company also announced a 32-inch Odyssey Neo G8 curved gaming monitor&lt;/a&gt; ahead of CES 2022. It features 4K resolution and a 240Hz refresh rate, which Samsung says it’s the first to achieve on a 1000R curved monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announced a smaller 4K version of its curviest, best-looking gaming monitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Odyssey Neo G8" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Cwp9x_XgHyOe_xCGNdWmkGS0qg=/0x0:4757x3171/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70338912/odysseyneog8.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="naES2u"&gt;Samsung has announced a smaller version of its Odyssey Neo curved gaming monitor. The Odyssey Neo G8 is a 32-inch gaming monitor with the same 1000R curvature of the $2,500 49-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv"&gt;Odyssey Neo G9&lt;/a&gt;. The R stands for radius and, compared to 1800R and 1500R curvature, which are both common in the monitor market, Samsung specializes in the  1000R curvature that’s far more, well, curvy. It makes 1800R look like a flat panel by comparison. The G8 similarly has 2,000 nits of peak brightness and promises brilliant picture quality with its Quantum Mini-LED panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blHF8P"&gt;Samsung hasn’t shared a price or a release date for the Odyssey Neo G8, but it’s offering up just a few images and details until a later date. Aside from the difference in size, the Odyssey Neo G8 has a similar design language to the G9, though the key difference is that the G8 boosts the resolution from QHD Plus to 4K. Notably, Samsung says this is the first 4K monitor to support a 240Hz refresh rate and a 1ms response time. It’s also compatible with AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and Nvidia’s G-Sync adaptive sync tech, so your games should run stutter- and tear-free, assuming your GPU’s powerful enough to push 4K resolution at fast frame rates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung Odyssey Neo G9" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sxh6kjKcQI2fG7XfAMK49ePbjUA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23135165/odysseyneog82.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VXxxiX"&gt;Samsung has opted to share this news just before the onslaught of CES 2022 announcements, though we’ll have to wait until after the trade show to find out more about the Odyssey Neo G8, like price and availability. Until then, check out the other monitor that Samsung just announced: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22624070"&gt;the M8 smart monitor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AirPods Pro 2 may come with lossless audio support and a charging case that makes sound</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k2MZr9hKJFLErqLATTZzsy5XyxE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70338848/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i6y4qD"&gt;The second-generation AirPods Pro may support Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC), and could even come with a case that makes a sound to help you find it, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in a note to investors seen by &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/01/02/airpods-pro-2-charging-case-trackable-like-airtag-may-come-with-health-sensors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/02/kuo-airpods-pro-2-to-offer-lossless-support-new-form-factor-more/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aogMFl"&gt;There currently isn’t an AirPods model that supports lossless audio, a form of file compression that preserves all of the data in the original audio file, resulting in higher quality sound. Each AirPods model — even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440788/apple-airpods-max-lossless-music-explainer-spatial-audio"&gt;pricey AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; — uses Bluetooth to deliver audio, which limits the devices to using Advanced Audio Codec (AAC), a lossy form of audio compression. Thus far, the only Apple devices that can take advantage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;lossless audio on Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; (and elsewhere) include the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV 4K, and Apple HomePod. The main downside to lossless audio is that its files take up more storage space on your device, and streaming it online can quickly eat up mobile data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dZtNl1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a number of tricks we can play to maximize or get around some of the limits of Bluetooth”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gdZRpc"&gt;If the AirPods Pro 2 does support ALAC, Apple will either have to ditch Bluetooth or jump over some of the technology’s hurdles to accomplish that. The limitations of Bluetooth were brought up in &lt;a href="https://www.whathifi.com/features/is-bluetooth-holding-back-apples-airpods-we-asked-the-man-who-made-them"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Hi-Fi’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;s recent interview with Gary Geaves, the vice president of acoustics at Apple. During the interview, Geaves said the company will need to work hard to get the most out of Bluetooth technology, and also noted that “there’s a number of tricks we can play to maximize or get around some of the limits of Bluetooth,” but “more bandwidth” would be ideal — a potential hint of what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERAT6V"&gt;As for the possibility of a charging case that emits sound, this may help you find your case if it’s ever separated from your AirPods — right now, only the AirPods themselves make a noise when you try to locate them via the Find My app. Also noted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;, Kuo predicts that the AirPods Pro 2 could sport a redesign and may have a focus on fitness, something that was &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458155/new-airpods-pro-2022-fitness-release-dates-report-design-features"&gt;previously rumored by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, Kuo says that Apple may release the AirPods Pro 2 in the fourth quarter of 2022, about three years after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;release of the first AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="mX5DZJ"&gt;We are officially in 2022. Know what that means? That’s right: It means Microsoft has failed at its stated goal of bringing Android 11 to the Surface Duo by the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="je2iK7"&gt;Attentive readers may recall that Microsoft said the following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690003/microsoft-surface-duo-android-11-update-release-date"&gt;this past September&lt;/a&gt;: “We remain committed to providing updates to Surface Duo, and we’re working to bring Android 11 to existing customers before the end of this year.” Okay, so the company wasn’t exactly &lt;em&gt;promising&lt;/em&gt; Android 11 by the end of 2021 — but that was the heavily implied intention, and it likely gave some Surface Duo users a lot of hope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="leiZWq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re working to bring Android 11 to existing customers before the end of this year.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2pB5Ox"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-fails-deliver-android-11-surface-duo-end-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first reported, Duo devices still haven’t received Android 11. While this may be disappointing to the owners of those devices, it’s also not without precedent. Update hiccups are par for the course with Android — all kinds of manufacturers consistently fail to get them out in a timely manner. “The story on upgrades is the same today as it was a decade ago: first-party Google devices get updated quickly, everything else takes months or doesn’t get updated at all,” summarized &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;executive editor Dieter Bohn in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20847758/google-android-update-problem-pie-q-treble-mainline"&gt;a 2019 newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xE9SI4"&gt;Microsoft also needs to make Android work with additional controls and functionality in order to accommodate the Duo’s two screens — Android, as an operating system, is “woefully unprepared for devices like the Surface Duo,” Bohn noted in his&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt; review of the device&lt;/a&gt;. One might expect such a product to take a bit to roll out. Still, Duo users haven’t received major software improvements since the device launched 15 months ago — and that’s a long wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6cMdQ"&gt;Microsoft has not yet responded to a request for comment, and &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt; claims to have gotten a “useless no comment” in response to their inquiry. Fortunately, &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt; has heard from sources that “the Android 11 update for Surface Duo is in fact done and should begin rolling out once the update has been certified by Google and AT&amp;amp;T.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oL5U0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Square Enix promises ‘decentralized games’ in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Super Smash Bros. Cloud" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q9-lV3XQCiAsEMXjRGgSBtS5Goc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70337245/WiiU_SuperSmashBros_111215_screen_01_bmp_jpgcopy.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AjLClb"&gt;What would a &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex&lt;/em&gt; look like if it were partly powered by the blockchain, so gamers could make money from their contributions? You may get to find out: Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda has revealed that the company’s New Year’s resolution is to release “decentralized games” starting in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1vvSc"&gt;While you won’t find any details &lt;a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/2022/html/a_new_years_letter_from_the_president_2.html"&gt;in Masuda’s letter discussing the company’s strategy for the new year&lt;/a&gt;, you will find a good sense of his cautious-but-optimistic stance — not surprising, given how &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisofts-nft-announcement-has-been-intensely-disliked-1848182203"&gt;other game companies&lt;/a&gt; that recently Leeroy Jenkins’d their way into NFTs saw such &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840383/stalker-2-developer-explain-nfts-gsc-game-world-deleted-tweet"&gt;immediate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840488/stalker-2-nft-metahuman-gsc-web3-canceled"&gt;whiplash&lt;/a&gt; you could practically feel the vibrations over the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1N2hN"&gt;Here’s the most relevant section, which comes near the end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YT7ivP"&gt;From having fun to earning to contributing, a wide variety of motivations will inspire people to engage with games and connect with one another. It is blockchain-based tokens that will enable this. By designing viable token economies into our games, we will enable self-sustaining game growth. It is precisely this sort of ecosystem that lies at the heart of what I refer to as “decentralized gaming,” and I hope that this becomes a major trend in gaming going forward. If we refer to the one-way relationship where game players and game providers are linked by games that are finished products as “centralized gaming” to contrast it with decentralized gaming, then incorporating decentralized games into our portfolio in addition to centralized games will be a major strategic theme for us starting in 2022. The basic and elemental technologies to enable blockchain games already exist, and there has been an increase in the societal literacy and acceptance of crypto assets in the past few years. We will keep a close eye on societal shifts in this space while listening to the many groups of users that populate it, and ramp up our efforts to develop a business accordingly, with an eye to potentially issuing our own tokens in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QwMBoq"&gt;It also probably helps that Square Enix doesn’t name any &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; games that might get the blockchain / token treatment, so there aren’t any specific communities of fans ready to come out bearing pitchforks quite yet, unlike with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822410/ubisoft-nfts-quartz-digits-ghost-recon-breakpoint"&gt;Ubisoft’s Ghost Recon NFT announcement&lt;/a&gt; or GSG’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22834567/stalker-2-nfts-metahuman-dmarket"&gt;&lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59OVKv"&gt;When gigantic gaming companies are faced with the realization that oodles of cash are locked up in the buzzwords “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;Metaverse&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt;,” they’re usually happy to say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22832490/niantic-ceo-john-hanke-metaverse-pokemon-go-ar-vr-podcast-decoder-interview"&gt;they’ve been-there, done-that&lt;/a&gt;, if they — like Square Enix — have been plugging away at the whole fantasy-meets-reality and / or multiple-world thing for years. Square Enix could have brought up how it already merged &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; with beloved Disney lands via its &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; series of games, or how it brought Cloud and Sephiroth and some &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; items, stages, and music &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168749/next-smash-bros-character-sephiroth-fighters-pass-2"&gt;to Nintendo’s &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — the very sort of cross-game pollination that metaverse proponents suggest we’ll see a lot more of once we figure out the technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jS8cO9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How NFTs are creating a generational divide between platforms  ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22735719/nft-generational-divide-steam-epic-gaming"},{"title":"How to create an NFT — and why you may not want to","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22809090/nft-create-opensea-rarible-cryptocurrency-ethereum-collectibles-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mxzxP2"&gt;Instead, the company is dipping a philosophical toe in the water, strongly signaling its intent, and — perhaps — waiting to see how its passionate fanbases react to the idea of Square Enix issuing its own tokens, Square Enix designing more economies into its games, and those games becoming somewhat more about money than they are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qp6601"&gt;Square Enix is also promising “ample investments in the cloud space,” though it’s not clear if the company is talking about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18683382/what-is-cloud-gaming-google-stadia-microsoft-xcloud-faq-explainer"&gt;cloud gaming&lt;/a&gt;. “We are exploring potential efforts in the cloud space from two primary perspectives, the first being leveraging cloud technologies to distribute content and the second being developing content that offers customers new forms of excitement enabled by the cloud’s attributes,” Matsuda writes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb will hide guests’ names to fight discrimination (but only in Oregon)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logo Illustration In Athens" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NAcTtaaWOdnWUf7UQZp_Mahpog0=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70337003/1236360050.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TsvRLF"&gt;Airbnb announced that it’s changing the way guest profiles are displayed in its app — for Oregon residents specifically. Airbnb hosts who are based in Oregon will now see a potential guest’s initials, rather than their full name, until after they’ve confirmed that guest’s booking request. The change will fully roll out by January 31st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6AQxz"&gt;The change aims to prevent racial discrimination among hosts, &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/update-for-guests-who-are-oregon-residents/"&gt;per the company’s announcement&lt;/a&gt;, by stopping them from gleaning a guest’s race from their name. &lt;a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/racial-discrimination-in-the-sharing-economy-evidence-from-a-field-experiment"&gt;A 2016 study&lt;/a&gt; found that Airbnb guests with names that sounded Black were 16 percent less likely to have bookings confirmed than guests with names that sounded white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQMlsB"&gt;The announcement follows a &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2019/08/airbnb-settles-oregon-discrimination-suit.html"&gt;voluntary settlement agreement&lt;/a&gt; that Airbnb reached in 2019 with three Portland-area women who had sued the company. The plaintiffs, all Black, alleged that the platform allowed hosts to discriminate against Black users in requiring guests to attach names and photographs to their profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSu5PR"&gt;After settling with the plaintiffs, Airbnb announced that it would “review and update the way profile names are displayed to hosts as part of the booking process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLeeaH"&gt;The company has been vocal about its support for racial justice in the past. It now requires users to agree to an &lt;a href="https://blog.atairbnb.com/the-airbnb-community-commitment/"&gt;Airbnb Community Commitment&lt;/a&gt; certifying that they won’t discriminate. It also launched &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fresources%2Fhosting-homes%2Fa%2Fa-new-way-were-fighting-discrimination-on-airbnb-201&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Project Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative to uncover and research discrimination on its platform, in the summer of 2020. Prior to the launch of that program, the company says it did not have a way to measure “larger trends and patterns related to discrimination” across its bookings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kfx67i"&gt;Airbnb guests are not required to provide profile photos (though hosts can require them in order to book their properties). Since 2018 (&lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/front-porch/2017/03/oregon_woman_sues_airbnb_says.html"&gt;post-lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, pre-settlement), the platform has also &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fresources%2Fhosting-homes%2Fa%2Fairbnb-answers-guest-profile-photos-77&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;kept guest photographs invisible to hosts&lt;/a&gt; before bookings are confirmed. That change, also intended to combat discrimination, has proved somewhat controversial among Airbnb’s users, some of whom worry that it could put marginalized guests in dangerous situations they’d otherwise avoid. “I’d rather get declined for a reservation than beaten or killed!” one user lamented in the company’s &lt;a href="https://community.withairbnb.com/t5/Hosting/Horrible-And-Dangerous-New-Profile-Pic-Policy/td-p/924339"&gt;community center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4jvtz"&gt;But if the company does expect such a strategy to reduce discrimination, why is it limited to Oregon? Reached for comment, Airbnb spokesperson Liz DeBold Fusco did not directly address whether this feature will expand in the future. Fusco pointed to language in Airbnb’s announcement post, which reads, “As part of our ongoing work, we will take any learnings from this process and use them to inform future efforts to fight bias.” The company added that it plans to “continue working with our Hosts and guests, and with civil rights leaders to make our community more inclusive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwJeX9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new ad invites you to imagine dying alone without a Watch on your wrist</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EsscqcojoVWyol0sEAfxmpAttbo=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70336936/maxresdefault__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cx6aL7"&gt;Apple wants you to know that buying a $400 smartwatch could be a matter of life-and-death — and it’s brilliantly, gruesomely captured that feeling in a new TV ad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJXVSP"&gt;Titled “911,” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ2JiwEARFo"&gt;the one-minute ad spot&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t show any of the gory details — you simply hear three phone conversations between 911 operators and people who managed to use their Apple Watch when facing seemingly imminent death: one who might drown in a sinking car, one who fell a great distance and broke his leg, and a paddleboarder who got swept out to sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiOZiV"&gt;They each have a happy ending, Apple informs us: “With the help of their watch, Jason, Jim, and Amanda were rescued in minutes.” But the underlying message is brutally clear: if they didn’t have this miraculous life-saving product on their wrists, they could have died alone. Apple is well known for commissioning heartstring-plucking ads, and this one is no exception: it’s painfully easy to imagine myself bleeding out or drowning, with no help on the way, when I listen to their scared voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPI9Bg"&gt;I’m torn about this marketing, because it partially rings true. You don’t have to search long to find people who believe the Apple Watch genuinely saved their life. I nearly bought one for my dad a while back, believing it a small price to pay just in case it made a difference. (He declined; for one thing, he’s on Android.) Even though there are other smartwatches that could theoretically make emergency calls, I don’t think it’s a stretch to say an Apple Watch is the obvious choice, particularly if you believe the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936113/apple-watch-emergency-sos-fall-detection-set-up-how-to"&gt;fall detection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702151/apple-watch-heartbeat-irregular-pulse-afib"&gt;irregular heartbeat flagging&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527707/apple-health-data-eldery-falls-walking-privacy"&gt;walking steadiness indicator&lt;/a&gt; might also help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ff3a22"&gt;But that doesn’t change the fact that Apple is now selling you on &lt;em&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt;, edging into shady insurance salesman territory to do so. It’s a good ad, but it feels a little shameless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0wCqeo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new health features bring new focus to elder care technology","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527707/apple-health-data-eldery-falls-walking-privacy"},{"title":"Apple is bringing car crash detection to the iPhone, says the Wall Street Journal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757102/apple-iphone-car-crash-detection-feature-onstar"},{"title":"The Apple Watch heart monitor sends too many people to the doctor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496813/apple-watch-heart-monitor-ekg-false-positive"},{"title":"Apple Watch Series 7 review: time and time again","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Ussr4T"&gt;Besides, the feature Apple’s showing off here is still &lt;em&gt;a &lt;/em&gt;phone call — something you can also do with a phone. This is an optional, pricey gadget you have to remember to put on your wrist, compared to the phone that every Apple Watch customer already owns and keeps on their person — except, perhaps, in the middle of a car accident or a paddleboarding excursion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9brOLs"&gt;If I were in a life-or-death situation like these, would I really dial 911 from my watch? Perhaps I would, and be grateful. But I think it’s more likely I’d have my phone, rather than the Apple Watch that spends most of its time forgotten on my bedside shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TP2Sbu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T and Verizon may have to delay 5G deployments another two weeks over airline safety fears</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQc0cfDVFbOQyriJ8meFsw6J9eQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70336748/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OOFwVV"&gt;US officials have asked AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon to further delay new 5G deployments so that the Federal Aviation Administration can have more time to determine where they might interfere with airlines. US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and FAA Administrator Steve Dickson sent a letter to the CEOs of the two telecoms on Friday requesting a delay of “no more than two weeks,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-officials-ask-att-verizon-delay-5g-wireless-over-aviation-safety-concerns-2021-12-31/"&gt;according to Reuters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8V1bx"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon had already delayed these deployments by a month over regulators’ concerns and planned to start the rollout on January 5th as a result. The two telecoms now &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/buttigieg-delay-5g-service-airline-safety-concerns-verizon-wireless-att-2022-1"&gt;tell &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;they are reviewing the latest request for a further delay. Buttigieg and Dickson write that, even with an additional delay, they expect 5G deployment will still begin in January “with certain exceptions around priority airports.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RXyjNT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Carriers are miffed about the delays&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EnAkNi"&gt;The two telecoms are eager to start deploying the new 5G spectrum that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;they bought in early 2021&lt;/a&gt;, which uses the so-called C-band frequencies. Those frequencies of spectrum allow radio waves to hit a sweet spot between high speeds and long distances, allowing for higher-speed 5G deployments than traditional LTE spectrum can achieve, without the stifling distance limitations that come with millimeter wave 5G. Getting these deployments out is a critical step for AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon to make 5G a worthwhile upgrade and stay competitive with T-Mobile, which has &lt;a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/t-mobiles-mid-band-5g-network-surpasses-200m-people-covered/2021/11/"&gt;already started deploying&lt;/a&gt; its own similar spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNSRyV"&gt;Officials have been concerned that C-band frequencies could interfere with altimeters and prevent the use of guided landing systems meant for times of low-visibility, threatening the safety of aircraft. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822875/5g-faa-rule-c-band-landing-airport-bad-weather-visibility"&gt;On December 7th&lt;/a&gt;, the FAA went so far as to tell pilots they wouldn’t be able to use those guided and automatic landing systems at airports where there’s deemed to be interference, which could theoretically lead to many flight delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXBwPU"&gt;Buttigieg and Dickson want to identify “priority airports” and mitigation strategies so that most large commercial aircraft can “operate safely in all conditions.” Some proposals revolve around placing 5G “buffer zones” around airports, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/airlines-brace-for-flight-restrictions-in-5g-standoff-11639929603"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOIwwt"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are pretty unhappy about the delays. On Friday, the companies accused the aerospace industry of holding deployment “hostage” unless they covered the cost of altimeter upgrades. Verizon also went in on the airline industry, telling &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, “This industry which got a $54 billion taxpayer-funded, government bail out over the past couple years clearly has much bigger issues to worry about.”&lt;/p&gt;
