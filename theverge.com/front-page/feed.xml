    <title>Go read this timeline of how MacKenzie Scott is donating her Amazon wealth</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PECPb0"&gt;It’s no secret MacKenzie Scott has committed some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345440/mackenzie-scott-jeff-bezos-amazon-wealth-donation-philanthropy"&gt;stunning acts of philanthropy&lt;/a&gt; of late. She gave surprise gifts totaling $410 million to historically Black colleges and universities in December 2020 alone, adding to the nearly $6 billion she gave away last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMteYt"&gt;But a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2021-bezos-scott-philanthropy/?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;new &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; makes excellent use of a visual timeline to provide some perspective on just how much more generous Scott has been with her money compared to her ex-husband Jeff Bezos: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Fay60q"&gt;Since 	their divorce in 2019, she’s become one of the most consequential philanthropists of her generation. Scott, who now controls one-quarter of the former couple’s combined wealth of more than $250 billion, gave away almost $6 billion last year to working charities—organizations that do good on a daily basis, rather than just steward philanthropic money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="y6dAyP"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; timeline shows how the pace of giving shifted after the couple divorced; prior to 2019, they made several million- and multimillion-dollar donations here and there. (I’m still chuckling at the image for the year 2014 when the Bezoses donated a total of $2.25 million to fund clinical food allergy research at Stanford University: a photo of peanuts. It works on two levels!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoXM13"&gt;The article also notes that Bezos and Scott tend to differ in&lt;em&gt; how&lt;/em&gt; they donate their money. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/875418348598603776"&gt;Bezos said in 2017&lt;/a&gt; he wanted to include “right now” donations among his mostly long-term philanthropic efforts since the bulk of his donations went to foundations. But Scott gave directly to charitable organizations: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="PqCbnJ"&gt;Chuck Collins, director of the Program on Inequality and the Common Good at the Institute for Policy Studies, notes that cash went directly to charities, rather than sitting in a foundation. “The money hit the street,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WTyKD2"&gt;Scott also won praise from philanthropy experts for the way she donated her money: without strings attached. Many donors of large amounts have specific instructions for how they want charities to use their funds. But Scott’s gifts in 2020 were unrestricted, indicating she trusted the people on the ground doing the work, and it gives lie to the idea that it’s “hard” to make billion-dollar donations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYUYr2"&gt;Bezos is following in the footsteps of other famous billionaires who turned their focus toward philanthropy after retiring from the day-to-day of running a business. He’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;stepping down as Amazon CEO&lt;/a&gt; later this year and says he plans to focus on “other passions,” including the Bezos Earth Fund, the Day 1 Fund, and &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhmRRd"&gt;If he needs some pointers on how to have a meaningful impact with his gigantic fortune, he could do a lot worse than to take a few tips from his ex. She seems to have a handle on how to do the most good as directly as possible. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2021-bezos-scott-philanthropy/?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Go read this &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; for a detailed look at how she’s done it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose’s best over-ear headphones are $150 off refurbished at eBay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gkRbDKf1YWfUPUSa9jHVfWBxCGw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68803251/akrales_190716_3546_0060.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YAv6bT"&gt;eBay is hosting a President’s Day sale specifically on refurbished products. One of the best offers we’ve spotted is for Bose’s over-ear Noise Canceling 700 Headphones. These normally sell for $380, but you can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frover.ebay.com%2Frover%2F1%2F711-53200-19255-0%2F1%3Fmpre%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebay.com%252Fitm%252FBose-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-700-Certified-Refurbished%252F153863412679%26campid%3D5338421468%26toolid%3D10001%26customid%3Dvergedeals&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F2%2F11%2F22278008%2Fbose-headphones-refurbished-deal-ebay-ring-fit-switch-magic-keyboard#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get a certified refurbished pair for just $224 (before tax)&lt;/a&gt; by putting in the code &lt;strong&gt;PREZDAY20 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. This is an exciting deal because each color is currently available, and Bose is the seller here, so it has handled the refurbishment process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBXgHL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frover.ebay.com%2Frover%2F1%2F711-53200-19255-0%2F1%3Fmpre%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebay.com%252Fitm%252FBose-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-700-Certified-Refurbished%252F153863412679%26campid%3D5338421468%26toolid%3D10001%26customid%3Dvergedeals&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F2%2F11%2F22278008%2Fbose-headphones-refurbished-deal-ebay-ring-fit-switch-magic-keyboard#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;On the page&lt;/a&gt;, it says that each set of headphones is in “pristine, like-new condition” and that it’ll be “in new packaging with original and new accessories”. Also, if you live in the US, eBay automatically tacks on a two-year warranty through Allstate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nNyr8s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9586877"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N41PE8"&gt;If you own an 11-inch iPad Pro or a fourth-generation iPad Air and want to grab a keyboard accessory for your tablet, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863BQJMS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Magic-Keyboard-for-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2nd-generation%2F984505060&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have discounted the price on Apple’s Magic Keyboard, bringing it down to its best-ever price of $199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qQATyg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MlieND"&gt;When it comes to getting in shape, you don’t need to spend a ton of money on expensive exercising equipment or even on a gym membership — just use (or buy) a Nintendo Switch and consider picking up &lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;. This is an exercising RPG game that includes a Ring-Con Pilates ring and a Leg Strap. Usually $80, you can get the game for $70 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XV4NHHN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728851577196507064" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Ring-Fit-Adventure-Black%2F434503657&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s foldable Surface Duo price drops to $999, arrives in Europe next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Microsoft Surface Duo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yHOvPt0_vDvMK1sHhn8PvDQ8wVs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68803217/vpavic_4176_20200905_0038.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZcDeKL"&gt;Microsoft is dropping the price of its foldable Surface Duo device to $999, and launching it in Europe and Canada next week. The Surface Duo will be available in the UK, France, Germany, and Canada on February 18th. It’s the first time the dual-screen Surface Duo has been available outside the US, for both businesses and consumers. Priced from £1,349 in the UK, the Surface Duo will be available at the Microsoft Store in the UK and retailer Currys PC World. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4IaMQ"&gt;The Surface Duo is also launching in Canada, France, and Germany on February 18th. The device will be priced at 1,549 euros in Germany. Microsoft first launched the Surface Duo in the US in September 2020, and it has taken the company around five months to complete an international release.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ePn1AN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsurface%2Fdevices%2Fsurface-duo%3Factivetab%3Doverview" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$400 price drop&lt;/a&gt; to $999 certainly makes it a more affordable device, but when we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21426955/microsoft-surface-duo-folding-android-phone-history"&gt;reviewed t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;h&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21426955/microsoft-surface-duo-folding-android-phone-history"&gt;e Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt; last year we praised the hardware and found the buggy modified version of Android made it difficult to use at times. The device also lacked many non-Microsoft apps that took advantage of the dual screens. TikTok was one of the bigger third-party apps that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176724/microsoft-surface-duo-availability-canada-europe-tiktok-support"&gt;got updated specifically for the Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt; last year, but there are still not enough apps taking advantage of this unique hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikIuS4"&gt;While Microsoft has promised monthly updates for the Surface Duo, the company &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-needs-step-if-they-want-surface-duo-be-taken-seriously"&gt;failed to deliver an update&lt;/a&gt; in December. The updates haven’t done enough to improve the software experience of using the Surface Duo, despite its obvious potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Lt5uC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, February 11th 10:00AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with Surface Duo launch details in other markets and updated US pricing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A brief chat with iamBrandonTV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0IWibcGZyE1O54BFcozX8ruf3u8=/68x0:826x505/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68803188/iambrandon.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DkrAfG"&gt;There are as many ways to make it on Twitch as there are streamers. Even so, there is a culturally recognized type. And you can picture him — yes, &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; — now, can’t you? A young white guy in a gaming chair, playing something like a shooter or possibly an MMO, averaging hundreds or thousands of viewers with the subs and bits to match. This isn’t meant to be prescriptive, obviously — your fav is probably not this made-up guy — but I think it’s important to talk about who we typically think of when we talk about streamers because &lt;em&gt;so &lt;/em&gt;many streamers &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; fit the stereotype, and we should recognize them, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8vx8l"&gt;Brandon Stennis is one of those people. He goes by &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/iambrandon"&gt;iamBrandon on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, and he’s an energetic, unapologetic queer Black advocate for marginalized people on Twitch. (He’s also fun as hell to watch.) Stennis was partnered on Twitch in 2016, a couple of years after he started streaming. Today, he’s also the influencer relations manager at Reverb Games, a position he’s had since last April — and yes, he says his experience as a content creator makes him better at his job. “I just have the upper hand because I know what it’s like to get an offer from a company,” he says. “It’s just easier for me to understand where a streamer’s coming from.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAxnws"&gt;In the beginning, however, he didn’t want to be a streamer. He wanted to be a journalist, someone who went out in the field and came back with a good story. It didn’t pan out. “When I was looking for jobs, they basically told me that I didn’t have experience, online experience, with like a portfolio or anything,” he tells me when I reach him over Discord. So in 2012, the summer after he graduated from college, he ended up spending a lot of time at home playing video games. “And that was my very first experience with online gaming,” he says. It led him to start his own blog, &lt;a href="http://UGRgaming.com"&gt;UGRgaming.com&lt;/a&gt;, a gaming news and reviews site. He eventually found a staff to help him out. Things were going well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dsMpE"&gt;They decided to update their social strategy and landed on Twitch. Stennis jumped in. “I quickly learned that you can’t promote a website on Twitch, it doesn’t work like that, it’s more about people’s personalities,” he says. “So I kind of just started, you know, being myself and playing games that I enjoyed, and wanted to play.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qIhu7K"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hi, I am no longer going by UGR Gaming. I’ve decided to change my name to iamBrandon. UGR Gaming was an idea I had long ago. But I feel like it was time for me to market myself as myself, not an old brand I had in the past. Find me at &lt;a href="https://t.co/bK03UG8sLW"&gt;https://t.co/bK03UG8sLW&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Z82ScTVxsF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Z82ScTVxsF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— iamBrandon  ️‍  (@iamBrandonTV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iamBrandonTV/status/929565923513692161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 12, 2017&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OBk00m"&gt;People started gravitating toward his streams, which, at the time, were mostly &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;. “I was starting to see that people actually liked my personality. So I thought that streaming would be something that I wanted to fall into a little bit more,” Stennis says. He kept at it, founding a popular &lt;a href="http://www.twitchchicago.com/"&gt;Twitch Chicago meetup&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. “I kind of fell into it and didn’t realize what I was getting myself into, but then it turned into something that built up my career,” he says. UGR Gaming ended in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fq4Ztd"&gt;Back then, when Stennis started, Twitch was a lot different. If you weren’t partnered, you didn’t have a sub button, which meant you couldn’t earn money from streams. You had to have more than 50 viewers to upgrade the quality of your streams, too. And, he says, there was no real sense of community. After &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; came &lt;em&gt;Outlast&lt;/em&gt; and speedrunning; Stennis managed to find his people and earned his partner badge. But he’s still vocal about how Twitch can do better at helping people find each other.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNATXy"&gt;“I know, there’s good people who work for the company,” Stennis says. “But there are some people who just don’t care.” One of the things he’s been vocal about online is the issue of a trans tag on Twitch for the LGBTQ community, which streamers have wanted for a while. “The CEO of Twitch came out a few months ago on a live stream and basically said that they didn’t want to do it because they didn’t want to send harassment to trans streamers — but trans streamers and LGBT people and people of color are already dealing with harassment on the platform, because Twitch is not doing any good with the harassment that that’s already happening,” says Stennis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bQFghQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=SteamyRefinedWheelNerfRedBlaster&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wHe0BJ"&gt;Twitch not being able to curb its harassment problem isn’t an excuse for standing in the way of a marginalized community trying to find each other. “They should have done it a long time ago. The community is very vocal about that,” he says. “And there’s been, you know, other tags that have come along very quickly and very fast that I feel are not as important as this one.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2Js1h"&gt;Twitch’s issues with its non-cis, non-white, and non-male populations are pretty well-documented online. During our chat, Stennis pointed out that Twitch is doing better this Black History Month than it has in the past. Even so, he was shocked that he had a pleasant experience being on Twitch’s front page, which has been highlighting Black streamers all month. (For people who don’t fit the traditional streamer stereotype, being featured on the front page of Twitch can be an exercise in harassment.) “I was taking a look at the total number of streamers on there, and it’s like 116,” he says. “And so it’s just like, obviously, there is an issue with visibility of Black creators and POC creators on this platform. If there’s only 116 people on this team — that’s very small compared to our counterparts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZKEuz"&gt;The work, as they say, continues. Despite everything — quarantine, COVID-19, etc. — Stennis says he’s doing well. “I’ve been able to finally take control of my streaming career in a really big and positive way,” he says. “I never thought I would be doing like... being a guest star on Rooster Teeth and all this kind of stuff. And there’s a lot more to come,” he says. And it’s at this very moment that G4, the gaming TV network, tweets at him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="No9pR2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In honor of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackHistoryMonth?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#BlackHistoryMonth&lt;/a&gt;, G4 would like to celebrate award-winning variety content creator, cosplayer and host, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iamBrandonTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@iamBrandonTV&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Watch his Twitch and see even more of his work here➡️&lt;a href="https://t.co/5BVnOkvJoA"&gt;https://t.co/5BVnOkvJoA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/fnuAcvIeix"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fnuAcvIeix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— G4TV (@G4TV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/G4TV/status/1357418656272179200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xlOd41"&gt;“It’s just been crazy to see because like, you know, I watched G4 when I was a teenager, grew up on all the shows, and to see them recognize like me as a person,” he says. “And talk about me in that kind of way. It’s like literally insane, you know what I mean?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQTl4G"&gt;Stennis says he wants his streaming career to grow, but more than that, he wants to show other queer Black people that they have a space in gaming. “I knew when I walked into doing all this, I was walking into a white male-dominated field. That I was not going to be received well, so I did several different things,” he says. He hid who he was. “But as soon as I let that go, and I decided to be myself truly and open and honest, I saw so much love and saw how I was inspiring other people to just be themselves.” And that, I think, is a worthy goal. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How you can help astronomers hunt for undiscovered worlds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T8o0DsFLRooVZkQv2rbYY0H2D5k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68803027/Feed_Image.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kIFBQf"&gt;Astronomers discovered the stars closest to our Solar System more than 100 years ago. There’s the three-star &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/images/alpha-centauri-a-triple-star-system-about-4-light-years-from-earth.html"&gt;Alpha Centauri&lt;/a&gt; system about four light-years away and &lt;a href="https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/barnards-star/"&gt;Barnard’s star&lt;/a&gt; about six light-years out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTyif2"&gt;But our celestial neck of the woods might be more crowded than we ever thought possible. In the past 25 years, astronomers have been identifying new objects that are also just a few light-years away: mysterious worlds known as brown dwarfs. Too large to be a planet but too small to become a star, brown dwarfs put out very little visible light, yet they glow brightly in the infrared. New infrared-enabled telescopes can image brown dwarfs effectively and have led to a raft of new discoveries — including &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/news/wise20130311.html"&gt;a pair of dwarfs&lt;/a&gt; just past Barnard’s star. This pair is now the third-closest known system to ours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohYnHh"&gt;There are untold thousands of unidentified brown dwarfs hiding in telescope imagery right now, but they aren’t exactly easy to pick up: they register as tiny smudges against a sea of other stars, galaxies, and photographic aberrations. It takes a careful human eye to spot them, so researchers interested in brown dwarf discovery find themselves in a bind: how to manually sift through millions of images of the night sky?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qm8y33"&gt;A few years back, a group of astronomers came up with a clever solution to that problem: a worldwide citizen-science effort that allows anyone with an internet connection to search through telescope imagery for new worlds. The project leverages an age-old trick to tease movement out of celestial imagery, and it’s allowed volunteers to locate thousands of new brown dwarfs. The effort may unearth worlds even closer to our Solar System than Alpha Centauri and could even turn up the Bigfoot of our Solar System: a hypothesized Planet 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnRbQA"&gt;Check out the video above to see how world-hunting works, and &lt;a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/marckuchner/backyard-worlds-planet-9"&gt;try it out for yourself&lt;/a&gt; on the project website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Call of Duty League will look very different in its second season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Call of Duty League - Launch Weekend" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nevRALAyQHFhUA_9phy1x7_gVws=/98x0:4303x2803/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68803008/1196607733.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Hannah Foslien/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TxVO1a"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; League kicked off its inaugural season last year with a bang. The CDL launched with an ambitious vision to merge esports with city-based teams, and it all started with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/24/21078871/call-of-duty-league-opening-weekend-esports-activision-blizzard"&gt;a live event at the Minneapolis Armory&lt;/a&gt;. Not long after, that vision was forced to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFTxvZ"&gt;Like most gaming leagues around the world, the CDL was forced to shift to an online format, eschewing in-person events. Perhaps surprisingly, the season was still a success; the league says last year’s finals between Dallas and Atlanta was the most-watched &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; match ever, with a peak of 330,000 viewers. (The winning team even won &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21401584/call-of-duty-league-cdl-championship-throne"&gt;an actual throne&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwws6s"&gt;According to CDL commissioner Johanna Faries, the league was able to learn from the experience of running a remote competition last year and make some notable changes for season 2, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CODLeague"&gt;which starts today&lt;/a&gt;. “There’s so much that we’ve done structurally with the season, but also strategically with how we celebrate our community and deliver world-class experiences, that I’d argue will be more of an improvement over last year,” Faries tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ht9PrE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nadeshot on getting back into Call of Duty with the Los Angeles Thieves","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552513/100-thieves-call-of-duty-league-cdl-la-nadeshot-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RWfOx6"&gt;The list of changes for season 2 is large. The league is adopting a new structure centered on five “major” tournaments throughout the year, and it has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fesports%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F29779791%2Fcall-duty-league-moving-4-4-season-2&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F11%2F22276595%2Fcall-of-duty-league-cdl-2021-season-preview-johanna-faries-interview#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shifted to 4 vs. 4&lt;/a&gt; competition, meaning each team had to drop a starting player from its roster. Games will also be played on PC this year, and — in one of the more unique aspects of competitive &lt;em&gt;COD&lt;/em&gt; — the game itself will shift to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21612873/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-review-zombies-warzone-multiplayer-impressions"&gt;last year’s &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Other changes are slightly smaller in scope, like the ability for teams to design their own jerseys. There’s even a new team: Optic Gaming has moved from LA to Chicago, opening up a spot for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552513/100-thieves-call-of-duty-league-cdl-la-nadeshot-interview"&gt;the new Los Angeles Thieves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="US2N0l"&gt;Faries says players and teams are involved in all of these decisions, particularly the ones that impact them most directly, like the roster changes. “Players and teams were exceedingly involved in that process,” she says of the move to 4 vs. 4. “We tend to mine for feedback pretty rigorously. We don’t like to make decisions in a silo or a vacuum. And I love that the outcome was well received, but we had a sense that that would be the outcome given how collaborative the process was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WFVeFO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DrQM5Q_jMxs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fy0nVM"&gt;The structural changes, meanwhile, were put in place to ensure that there are still plenty of big moments throughout the regular season, while also making each individual match feel important. “We love this notion of stage-based play, where nearly every month there’s going to be a new run at winning a major tournament in the regular season,” Faries explains. “That said, what’s also good about it is that every match is going to matter.” Teams will earn points from every match, and the top eight clubs will make it to the playoffs at the end of the season. “It all adds up,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGAspA"&gt;The 2021 season is also kicking off at an opportune time. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; is arguably as popular as it’s ever been. Not only was &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt; one of the top-selling titles of 2020, but the franchise has also reached new audiences through &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Mobile&lt;/em&gt; and the battle royale &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not clear how the CDL plans to take advantage of that, but Faries admits that there’s “such an opportunity” to bring new fans into the league through those games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdAcuT"&gt;Of course, the other big question is when the league will return to in-person events. Faries says that having teams based in cities around the world playing matches in home arenas is still the ultimate vision for the CDL. “We all want that,” she says. “We’re going to do it when it’s safe to do so, responsible to do so.” So while the 2021 season will start out online, the future of the league depends on both the global popularity of &lt;em&gt;COD&lt;/em&gt; and tapping into those major cities across the globe. “The two working together is really where the power of the vision of the CDL comes from.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tern HSD P9 review: the everything e-bike</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A midtail cargo bike for the whole family&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="gt7YoQ"&gt;The best measure of an electric bike is how easily it slots into your everyday life. By that metric, the Tern HSD P9 is one of the better ones I’ve tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u85wvq"&gt;Tern let me borrow one at the end of July, and I rode it at least 12 miles every day around my suburban New Jersey neighborhood for about a month and a half. I took my son to daycare, went to the grocery store, the farmer’s market, the liquor store, the drug store, and a variety of other places too menial to remember. It kept me socially distant from my neighbors as I rode around town and kept me out of my car, which I always appreciate. And whether I was hauling dual panniers loaded with groceries or just myself, the ride quality was impeccable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l65OxH"&gt;To be clear, this isn’t the fastest, most powerful, or even the best-looking e-bike I’ve ever ridden. But it was a solid workhorse that got the job done. That’s mostly due to the Bosch Active Line Plus mid-drive motor, one of the best on the market today, silently churning away between the cranks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uZ2Peb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10334626"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xjnKEF"&gt;But it’s also because the HSD is an extremely flexible e-bike. The low-step frame combined with the adjustable handlebars and seat post, as well as a custom SunTour front suspension fork, help make this a bike that can easily be passed around among family members or friends. Riders of all shapes and sizes will feel at ease on the HSD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3Frk3"&gt;If it looks a bit shrunken down for a cargo bike, that’s by design. Those in need of something larger can level up to the Tern GSD, which has an extended rack that can carry even more stuff than the HSD. (I’m testing a GSD right now, and I’m very infatuated with it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="IFka33"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If it looks a bit shrunken down for a cargo bike, that’s by design&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jtTctO"&gt;During my month-and-a-half test period, the HSD barely demanded my attention, nor did it draw any stares from passers-by or take up too much space in my garage. (I got one looky-loo from a lady who was impressed with the fingernail red paint job.) And while the $3,199 price tag means this won’t be an affordable option for many, you do get a lot of bike for that price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BS6ed"&gt;Regardless, when it comes to cargo bikes, I try not to compare it to other non-electric bikes, but rather to the car I am trying to replace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wR-HPXOjlyEwtv2E4163cKHZH2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21870576/ahawkins_200825_4180_0034.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MyRzySaRCRvLT_lGIE0EPn557j0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21870575/ahawkins_200825_4180_0040.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BzcvFwZkGHqu4v1dXSoFbLtf1wU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21870568/ahawkins_200825_4180_0098.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zMY4vHGvK_wLokFkMhojoMFgqPM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21870578/ahawkins_200825_4180_0025.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rf7WIR"&gt;Tern got its name when several founding members of the company were hanging out poolside after a bike conference in Las Vegas, drinking beer and talking about the 2010 surfing documentary &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1407927/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;180° South&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a deep discussion about how people live with nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rizl40"&gt;Cycling through some possible names for their nascent company, the group eventually settled on Tern, the name for an Arctic migratory bird that is lightweight, a global traveler, and long-lived. It was also a homophone for “turn,” which fed into the group’s idea of “turning around and moving forward to face the challenges head-on,” according to Tern’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZSnkir"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Terns are Arctic migratory birds that are lightweight, global travelers, and long-lived&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o6AFMq"&gt;Tern, which is headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan, fancies itself an urban transportation company, but it’s mostly known for its non-electric, folding bikes. In August 2014, the company announced its first electric bike, the eLink, which weighed 46 pounds (21 kg) and could fold in under 10 seconds. The following year, Tern launched its first lineup of electrified models using BionX motor systems. Later, the company shifted to using more popular powertrain systems by Bosch and Bafang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrQqDN"&gt;The HSD P9, which first came out in 2019, is described as “enormously useful [and] surprisingly small.” Indeed, the HSD is a great bike for anyone looking for cargo-carrying power without those cumbersome cargo bike specs. It’s not exactly lightweight, clocking in at roughly 56 lbs. But when compared to electric cargo bikes from companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20791435/radwagon-electric-cargo-bike-review-car-replacement"&gt;Rad Power Bikes&lt;/a&gt; (73 lbs), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21269590/carqon-cargo-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;Carqon&lt;/a&gt; (88 lbs), or &lt;a href="https://www.urbanarrow.com/"&gt;Urban Arrow&lt;/a&gt; (104 lbs), the HSD P9 is practically a featherweight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MyIcYhKuX4sYzQg3hntO08h3QJ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21870566/ahawkins_200826_4180_0128.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="751kW5"&gt;Speaking of specs, here’s what you need to know about the Tern HSD P9:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1u2JZz"&gt;Motor: Bosch Active Line Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GFgZBF"&gt;Top speed: 20 mph (32 km/h)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VYdgw5"&gt;Range: 26–69 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uvuVgv"&gt;Battery: 36V 11Ah (400 Wh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5X79xj"&gt;Weight: 56.5 lbs (25.7 kg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aY6imz"&gt;Brakes: Shimano hydraulic disc brakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WD4dK1"&gt;Tires: 20 inches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mLEZPw"&gt;Extras: SunTour suspension front fork&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2Jrlt4"&gt;Price: $3,199&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vLT3lL-OiZlHdRX3lmcIrF25C7s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21870580/ahawkins_200825_4180_0019.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MJrcQK"&gt;The HSD P9 is a Class 1 electric bike in the US, meaning it’s pedal-assist with no throttle and a top speed of 20 mph. There were times when I missed the twist throttle, especially when getting started from a standstill on a steep incline with a kid and extra cargo on the rear rack. But I also understand why some manufacturers abhor the throttle — and honestly believe that throttles will eventually run into regulatory issues in the future — so I try not to begrudge any bike for its exclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTyGU1"&gt;HSD stands for “haul stuff daily” — or if you’re out of earshot of your kids, “haul shit daily.” Arleigh Greenwald, the eponymous Bike Shop Girl who recently got a job as a product manager at Tern (congrats, Arleigh!), &lt;a href="https://bikeshopgirl.com/tern-hsd-the-crossover-of-electric-bikes/"&gt;calls the HSD&lt;/a&gt; “the crossover of electric bikes,” and I wholeheartedly agree. If Riese and Muller’s Load 75 is the Cadillac Escalade of e-bikes and the RadWagon is the Chevy Suburban, then Tern’s HSD is definitely the Toyota Rav4 — a highly capable daily driver with just enough space for a kid and some cargo.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="33cpZs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;HSD stands for “haul stuff daily”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YLX9s7"&gt;The HSD isn’t completely incognito — just look at that cherry red paint job. It does have some interesting design touches, from the “HSD” logo carved out of the frame below the head tube to the rear rack that also doubles as a stand for when you want to park the bike vertically. That’s a great space-saver for anyone who keeps their bike in their apartment, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzg20E"&gt;Tern makes a couple of folding bikes, like the Vektron, BYB, and fantastically named Verge. I would classify the HSD as a quasi-folding bike since it lacks the full folding capabilities of Tern’s other models. The handlebars can fold down, but that’s about it. Still, it’s a useful feature if you need to transport the bike in the back of your car, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkwmAZ"&gt;The rear rack is rated for 132 lbs, while the whole bike can carry a combined weight of 374 lbs. Tern sent me two of its Cargo Hold 37 panniers, each of which can hold several big grocery bags. When empty, the bags can be cinched tightly to the side of the bike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqA7Cy"&gt;Performance-wise, I wasn’t that impressed with the 400Wh battery pack. While Tern claims the HSD has a range of 69 miles (110km), I found myself needing to recharge the battery after as little as 30 miles of riding on mostly flat surfaces with a few steep hills mixed in. This may seem paltry, but it’s fairly standard across e-bikes, especially while riding in the highest setting offered. This is my preferred riding style, and I know that’s true for many others. That said, more range would be nice, especially considering the HSD’s $3,199 price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/in1L_t3ByfNTUgXKOFZWrgSUO2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21870573/ahawkins_200825_4180_0048.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TlWHZl"&gt;The battery, while not integrated in the frame like I would prefer, was neatly stored behind the seat post, parallel to the rear rack. It’s a placement that I think is fairly unique to Tern, and it avoids the unsightliness of a bulging battery pack perched on the downtube. Plus, it helps distribute the weight to the back of the bike, which helps prevent it from toppling over when parking it vertically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s04u3M"&gt;The HSD’s small, fast wheels mean there’s a much lower center of gravity than most cargo bikes, which made cornering much more fun. And it’s shorter than the average road bike, which makes it easier to maneuver and store. The upright seating position gave me a good vantage point to see the cars around me, which made me feel safer while I rode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anHeyc"&gt;I find myself torn over the value proposition of the Tern HSD. It’s a smaller, lighter cargo bike than most, which is certainly an advantage, and yet, it costs noticeably more than other, more powerful cargo bikes. What do you get for that extra cash? Easy storage is nice, but most of that cost is for the Bosch mid-drive motor. The German company arguably makes one of the most reliable and dependable systems in the world — and that comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIqCaP"&gt;Overall, the Tern HSD P9 is a sturdy electric cargo bike that’s easy on the eyes and easy to stash away when needed. It’s highly adaptable and has a decently powerful drivetrain that shrinks most hills down to size. While I don’t think the HSD is for everybody, I do believe that it aspires to be easy and approachable enough that anyone can ride it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram bans prominent anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy, but Facebook page remains active</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ufIisGyjuh50ystlC9Ak90E55ds=/0x0:4261x2841/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68802684/1093808886.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Scarnici/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DSjqhU"&gt;Facebook-owned Instagram has permanently banned Robert F. Kennedy Jr, a prominent anti-vaccine activist who had over 800,000 followers on the platform, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/instagram-bans-robert-f-kennedy-jr-over-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-11613029259?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. A spokesperson for the service said his account was removed “for repeatedly sharing debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines.” His account on Facebook, however, is still live, with Facebook &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/instagram-bans-robert-f-kennedy-jr-vaccine-misinformation-1234905740/"&gt;telling &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it has no plan to remove the page “at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmwJXb"&gt;Kennedy has been cited as one of the top spreaders of COVID-19 misinformation by the nonprofit organization Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes. He also founded Children’s Health Defense, which &lt;a href="https://252f2edd-1c8b-49f5-9bb2-cb57bb47e4ba.filesusr.com/ugd/f4d9b9_fddbfb2a0c05461cb4bdce2892f3cad0.pdf"&gt;CCDH calls&lt;/a&gt; a leading anti-vaccine charity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GvZw0Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;His Facebook and Twitter pages are still live&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q62dAz"&gt;Kennedy’s removal from the platform comes just a few days after Facebook announced it’s stepping up efforts to combat vaccine misinformation on its platforms. Although it banned anti-vaccination ads &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514535/facebook-anti-vaxx-ad-ban-moderation-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;last October&lt;/a&gt;, and started removing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150425/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-misinformation-ban"&gt;vaccine misinformation in December&lt;/a&gt;, this week it said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272883/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-expanded-removal-autism"&gt;expanding the list&lt;/a&gt; of false COVID-19 and vaccine-related claims it would remove. In particular, it will remove posts that claim COVID-19 is man-made, or that vaccines are dangerous or ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWKPWD"&gt;Children’s Health Defense has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373530/robert-kennedy-childrens-health-defense-facebook-zuckerberg-fact-checking-lawsuit"&gt;previously challenged&lt;/a&gt; Facebook’s vaccine fact-checking initiatives. In a lawsuit filed last year, the group claimed that initiatives like fact-checking labels placed on its page created a “falsely disparaging” image of the organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="az8Ur0"&gt;Although Kennedy’s Instagram account has been removed, his pages are still live on Facebook and Twitter, with hundreds of thousands of followers between them. On Facebook itself he has over 300,000 followers, with 215,000 followers on Twitter. As of this writing, his most recent posts on both platforms contain links to Children’s Health Defense.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord iOS update makes it easier to steal memes from Twitter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mDVBbs0fisUCZrUXbbA6o-i1Ljg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68802537/acastro_210129_1777_discord_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GO5hjj"&gt;Meme thieves rejoice! Discord’s latest &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/discord-talk-chat-hang-out/id985746746"&gt;update on iOS&lt;/a&gt; adds a new option to make it easier to save images from Twitter embeds, handy if you want to save memes from tweets dropped in the server. Or, as the changelog for version 60.0 of the iOS app puts it, “Meme-stealing powers are about to go super saiyan.” To use it, long press on the tweet in question, and then select “Save Image.” It’s a lot simpler than the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/jb457z/help_save_failed_check_your_system_network_and/gaadubs?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;workarounds people were previously forced to use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QkY4uX0hFNYk_kj86xf5ovOtOeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22296898/IMG_0407.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The changelog shown in Discord’s latest iOS version.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1eSXCh"&gt;There’s no mention of the feature for the service’s Windows or Android apps, which both also received updates this week. However, on Android it already seems to be possible to save images from tweets by tapping the image to make it fullscreen, and then using the download button on the top of the screen. Although the new iOS feature allows you to download static images, it doesn’t appear to work with gifs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8z8s9S"&gt;As well as the new feature for meme thieves, Discord now supports mobile screen share on iPad “so you can now do art together, play mobile games on your tablet, and watch Robert get his math homework wrong for the 5th time from the comfort of your bed.” You can read the full changelog in Discord’s settings menu on desktop and mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft tried to acquire Pinterest, FT reports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P0U7lTqcZExaXNBK1KbliNbXHTc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68802499/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FJeGdt"&gt;Microsoft has reportedly held talks with Pinterest in an attempt to acquire the social network. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f88b8474-e791-4efb-a9f6-54c8222680fe"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the software giant approached Pinterest in recent months about a deal, but that the talks are “currently not active.” Had a deal taken place, it would have been Microsoft’s biggest to date, given Pinterest is valued at $51 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDwlAN"&gt;Microsoft’s potential interest in Pinterest could signal an emerging strategy for its continued cloud push, though. The Windows maker has been trying to convince more big online services to use its Azure cloud offerings. Amazon’s AWS dominates this part of the market, and big names like Pinterest could draw in additional Azure customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3qXKcQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft wanted a similar deal for TikTok&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QRHSDB"&gt;It’s an approach we saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352309/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-deal-why-us-countries-data"&gt;Microsoft attempt with TikTok&lt;/a&gt;. While not successful, a TikTok deal would have offered Microsoft valuable data and an outlet for its myriad of other services, and also act as a giant ad for its partners and resellers that try to convince businesses to go with Azure and not AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbOmzK"&gt;Microsoft has acquired some significant companies under CEO Satya Nadella. A $7.5 billion deal saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17422788/microsoft-github-acquisition-official-deal"&gt;GitHub join Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; a few years back, and Microsoft’s $26.2 billion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11920938/microsoft-linkedin-acquisition-why-report"&gt;acquisition of LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; was Nadella’s first major acquisition. Microsoft is also in the late stages of finalizing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21449178/microsoft-xbox-bethesda-zenimax-media-acquisition-xbox-game-pass"&gt;Bethesda acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, valued at $7.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
