    <title>An AI model shows health centers in California aren’t prepared for power outages  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sylmar Converter Station, a piece of power grid infrastructure operated by LADWP, for a story about how an Oregon wildfire almost caused the lights to go out in California on Friday night. Sylmar Converter Station is the terminus of the Pacific DC Intertie" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wwynCGxiwSa8a-fu_1uvIT0Pb-c=/42x0:3959x2611/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581619/1233958488.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wildfires in the West can lead to power outages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f1lvuv"&gt;There are around 20 federally qualified health centers in the areas touched by the Lava, Tennant, and Salt fires, which started in Northern California at the end of June. The centers are part of the state’s healthcare safety net and offer &lt;a href="https://www.chcf.org/publication/californias-federally-qualified-health-centers/#related-links-and-downloads"&gt;primary care&lt;/a&gt; to low-income patients in the area. Despite the fire risk to the facilities, none of those 20 centers had backup generators, says Andrew Schroeder, who runs analytics programs at the humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJc5Zw"&gt;That’s key information for officials and aid groups: if the power went out because of the fires, those centers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20932780/california-blackout-healthcare-electricity-fires"&gt;might not be able&lt;/a&gt; to keep medications and vaccines refrigerated or turn on computer systems with patient medical records. But before May, that’s not information Schroeder or anyone else working on response efforts would be able to look up. Despite the threat of outages and shutoffs during extreme heat and fire season, states and industry associations often don’t know which facilities have backups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5pumI"&gt;“We had a lack of information about where health centers have generators, where they have solar panels, have people installed battery backups for refrigerators, and things like that,” Schroeder says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWvjjA"&gt;Now, thanks to a new AI model finished at the end of May, they have a better picture of the backup plans at these health centers just in time for what’s projected to be a devastating fire season. It shows a sparse landscape: only around 30 percent of facilities have backup power and access to refrigeration for medical supplies, says Jeni Stockman, senior program manager at artificial intelligence company Macro-Eyes, which built the tool. “It suggests there’s a huge gap in the resiliency of sites,” she says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PiBQFO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a huge gap in the resiliency of sites”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qO57FN"&gt;The information is acutely important for the response to the COVID-19 pandemic because the vaccines for the disease have to be stored at cold and ultracold temperatures. Sending shots to a place that couldn’t keep them cold during a power disruption &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/science/2021/2/16/22285394/covid-vaccine-power-outage-freezer"&gt;risked losing the doses&lt;/a&gt;. So Macro-Eyes worked with the California Primary Care Association (CPCA) on a project funded by Direct Relief to build a tool that would map out the resources at each center. The groups soon realized it could have other applications outside of COVID-19, like where to direct aid in other emergencies, says CPCA Acting President Robert Beaudry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mD36bZ"&gt;“Because of the fires, and because of [power company] PG&amp;amp;E’s ongoing problems, we have power outages in California. We wanted to know which of our health centers could continue to operate,” Beaudry says. “The more information that we had around these types of issues, the more we could inform emergency preparedness in California.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RXozT"&gt;The project was modeled off of work Macro-Eyes did in Sierra Leone mapping out what resources health facilities had at any given time. The government didn’t have good information about which health centers had access to electricity and which didn’t, says Benjamin Fels, the founder and CEO of Macro-Eyes. “In the context of COVID-19, when you get these really scarce vaccines, you don’t want to send them to a point on the map where they cannot be kept cold — because that basically means you’re throwing them away,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DfUQSD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When you get these really scarce vaccines, you don’t want to send them to a point on the map where they cannot be kept cold”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yeNln4"&gt;In conversations with Schroeder and Direct Relief, the company realized people in California didn’t have that information, either. Hospitals in the US that get federal funding are required to have backup generators. But outpatient and community care clinics, including federally qualified health centers, often don’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WaUF6R"&gt;The facilities can charge Medicare and Medicaid for services, so they have to report certain information to the federal government — demographic information about the patients they serve, insurance status of those patients, and so on. It’s a very extensive form, Schroeder says. “What it doesn’t contain is much of any information about the actual infrastructure of the places,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="py9avA"&gt;The CPCA has surveyed centers to find out what resources and power sources they had available, but those haven’t dredged up much information. Beaudry says the association had a sense of the power resources for around 8 percent of the sites in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeZ4zT"&gt;Macro-Eyes’ model helped fill in the rest of the picture. It pulls in data from a range of publicly available sources — like lists of places that had permits for generators and satellite images for solar panels. From there, it’s able to infer which similar types of health sites might have the same features. If, for example, the model already has information from survey data on three health centers out of 10 that have similar locations and serve a similar number of people, it could project that the remaining seven would have the same resources as the first three. Health centers can then confirm whether the model got it right, which helps the AI continue to learn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Goz5Hd"&gt;Mapping out the data helped CPCA see where there are limitations in access to power. Officials and aid groups could use that information to decide where they should send supplies. That could include anything from COVID-19 vaccines (which need to be frozen) to insulin, which has to stay refrigerated, Schroeder says. “We often support needs for insulin after disasters,” he says. “We need to know where we’d feel confident sending things that require cold storage, without also sending some kind of ability to back up their refrigeration capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="61xhz3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We need to know where we’d feel confident sending things that require cold storage”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="62n3G9"&gt;The data could also help organizations figure out which places in the state could use extra generators. “We can see where there’d be islands of rural health populations that would be potentially disconnected,” says DeeAnne McCallin, the director of health information technology at CPCA. She says the California Department of Public Health recently told CPCA that they may have extra freezers or refrigerators available and asked if there were any health centers that could use them. That’s the kind of inquiry the data could help answer.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGnAN4"&gt;It’s also valuable for the health centers themselves because they’re able to see during an emergency if there’s a nearby facility with access to a generator or a refrigerator that they could direct patients to or use to store supplies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNw0Gc"&gt;The Macro-Eyes modeling tool can be used in places other than just California. The company and Direct Relief think that the Gulf Coast, which has been battered by increasingly devastating hurricanes, could be a good next target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8u3Q1"&gt;Major disasters — like those Gulf Coast storms, Hurricane Maria, and the California fires — have made it clear that having a backup power plan is a key piece of preparedness. That’s especially true for healthcare, which is vital during disaster response. “We’ve designed a health care system which is really in some ways very sophisticated, and very unequal, but really fragile when it comes to access to power,” Schroeder says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x31Zze"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BV4E2E"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9aYM4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcVRLH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>European Union proposes roadmap for slashing greenhouse gas emissions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="European Union Unveils Landmark Climate Plan" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bY4h7gohhRCtwXLFEQ_iYvGGCoE=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581493/1233974542.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aR3LPZ"&gt;The European Union put out a sweeping set of proposals today that could drastically cut its greenhouse gas emissions if the plan ultimately becomes law. Internal combustion vehicles would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576994/european-union-gas-vehicle-ice-ban-2035-electric-cars"&gt;phased out by 2035&lt;/a&gt;, and it would rope industries like aviation and shipping, which were previously exempt from some EU climate policies, into compliance. The bloc also intends to influence polluters outside its borders by potentially making importers pay for their pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPPqKd"&gt;All in all, it’s a roadmap to achieving a goal that Europeans have been hashing out for years. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21019624/europes-green-deal-on-climate-change-failed-its-first-test"&gt;In 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, put forward a “Green Deal” to get the continent to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Reaching that target requires incremental progress. So last year, the EU said it would cut its greenhouse gas pollution by 55 percent by 2030, compared to pollution in 1990. (That’s why the EU is calling its new set of proposals “Fit for 55,” a name that’s elicited some &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/horny-for-40-fit-for-55-eus-climate-plan-branding-raises-eyebrows/"&gt;teasing&lt;/a&gt; online.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="cp75sc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is the ultimate now or never moment.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BxlyqV"&gt;While that’s ambitious, it’s the kind of action that’s needed to meet the scale of the climate crisis. Planet-heating emissions globally need to drop in half this decade and ultimately reach close to zero by the middle of the century, &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;climate scientists have found&lt;/a&gt;. That would spare us some of the worst effects of climate change by meeting one of the targets of the landmark Paris agreement, which is to limit global warming to roughly 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Humans have already pushed global average temperatures to 1.1 degrees of warming, triggering more extreme weather, coastal flooding, and species loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lsl5aX"&gt;“This is the ultimate now or never moment,” European Commissioner for Economy, Paolo Gentiloni Silveri, said in a &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3541"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “With every passing year the terrible reality of climate change becomes more apparent: today we confirm our determination to act before it is really too late.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTd5SN"&gt;Perhaps the biggest change that EU residents will feel is in transportation, which accounts for 22 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in the bloc. The commission proposed ratcheting up emissions standards for new cars and vans. Under the existing proposal, they would need to slash their pollution by 55 percent in 2030 and 100 percent in 2035. That will ultimately take new gas-powered cars off the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ryA1Hv"&gt;Fuel used for shipping, aviation, and heating buildings would also change under the plan. One of the biggest tools the EU has for regulating pollution is its Emissions Trading System (ETS). That places a cap on how much pollution certain industries are allowed to produce and sets a price on carbon. Aviation used to get free emissions allowances, but the commission now wants them to fully pay for their carbon like other industries. Shipping would be regulated under the Emissions Trading System under the new plan, and a similar but separate system would be created for road transport and buildings. That would incentivize each sector to increase energy efficiency and more hastily turn to cleaner fuels.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T59iN6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tougher environmental standards for industries globally&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9PnHzE"&gt;The EU doesn’t want its carbon price to disadvantage European businesses or encourage more polluting abroad. So it also proposed putting a carbon price or tax on imports for products like steel and cement that have large carbon footprints. This provision could cause a kerfuffle with the World Trade Organization, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/world/europe/climate-change-carbon-green-new-deal.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. But the measure aims to encourage tougher environmental standards for industries globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zuJPMI"&gt;Renewable energy will need to replace most fossil fuels if the EU is to reach its climate ambitions. The commission now envisions that renewables will make up 40 percent of the bloc’s overall energy production by 2030. Renewable energy, including solar and wind, made up just over 15 percent of the EU’s &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/infographs/energy/bloc-2a.html"&gt;energy mix&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXX7Ve"&gt;Beyond slashing greenhouse gas emissions generated by people, the EU also wants to get better at drawing them down through natural carbon sinks like forests. It wants to plant 3 billion trees across the continent by 2030. Conserving forests and other ecosystems is important for plants, people, and animals. But repairing the climate by planting new trees has been a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;tricky, controversial enterprise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0dC53"&gt;That makes the EU’s other proposed schemes for reducing pollution the most important priorities for the roadmap. But the plan won’t materialize right away. It could take a couple of years just for the proposals to be approved by the European Parliament and member states.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcMF2w"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bFCXc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s rollable OLED TV is finally coming to the US for a staggering $100,000</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ZMj2BPZ9XNcv2YyQ_8EZJpQWxE=/15x0:794x519/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581247/LGR2.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="djPmP4"&gt;LG’s futuristic rollable OLED 4K TV is coming to the US for an eye-popping price of $100,000. First introduced as a stunning prototype at CES 2018 (and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18171013/lg-rollable-tv-oled-4k-tv-features-photos-video-release-ces-2019"&gt;turned into a real product&lt;/a&gt; the next year), the 65-inch set can roll itself up and then back down to fully disappear into its housing unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQi67S"&gt;That cabinet also contains a front-firing Dolby Atmos sound system. The OLED R has a middle mode between being fully unfurled and rolled down. LG calls this Line View, and you can use it to display a clock, photos, music controls, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VlgKH07tBx51aEoBWMjncUrJcpA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13673293/backspedup.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is what the back of the OLED R looks like when rolling down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nNvg2F"&gt;From a picture quality perspective, the OLED R has technically already been surpassed by newer LG models; the more traditional G1 series introduced earlier this year can get brighter than any of the company’s prior OLEDs, including the rollable. But the OLED R’s panel still checks all of the boxes you’d want from a modern TV: it’s got Dolby Vision, 120Hz 4K gaming, variable refresh rate, auto low latency mode, and more. And as I’d damn well hope for $100,000, all four of its HDMI ports are HDMI 2.1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbMjkq"&gt;But if you’re shelling out this kind of money for a television, you’re in it for the rolling trick more than anything else. The OLED R is rated for 50,000 unfurls, which should give you many years to blow the minds of everyone visiting whichever of your mansions you put it in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6SbJU"&gt;LG says preorders will open for the OLED R in August, but I’m already seeing an “add to cart” button &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Ftvs%2Flg-oled65r1pua-signature-oled-4k-tv&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F14%2F22577063%2Flg-oled-r-rollable-tv-us-pricing-features-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on the company’s store&lt;/a&gt;. For the absurdly rich out there, it’s got to be a tough call between this and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166062/samsung-110-inch-microled-4k-tv-announced-features"&gt;Samsung’s 110-inch MicroLED TV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Teenage Engineering’s OP-1 finally gets USB audio support a decade after it was released</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Auj3RgIqdnxUGmv555upqZeMW0=/1x0:4095x2729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580989/6076a6c4f88c8300047961c1_original.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YEEjEm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/28/3270259/teenage-engineering-op-1-accessories-launch-profile"&gt;Teenage Engineering’s OP-1&lt;/a&gt; has one of the most iconic synthesizers around since it was first released over a decade ago, but the music-making machine is still getting new features: the company just announced its 243rd firmware update that adds USB audio support to the OP-1 for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VzU4P"&gt;The added feature turns the OP-1 into a full-fledged external audio unit. That means you can directly send audio from an OP-1 to DAW software like Ableton Live, Pro Tools, or Logic Pro on a PC or Mac or mobile versions of those applications on iOS and Android (like Garageband) without having to use any workarounds or hacks. Additionally, you’ll be able to sample and record on the OP-1 directly from a connected USB audio device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XuJsyL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Send audio right to Ableton, no tricks or workarounds required&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="THciGL"&gt;It’s a major addition to the device, which should help make it a lot more useful for creators looking to use their favorite software to put together new tracks and remixes using the OP-1.   Teenage Engineering says it was able to add the new functionality by applying the work it had done in developing a similar USB audio feature for its newer OP-Z synthesizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2opj77"&gt;The new firmware update (like the previous 242 ones) is free to all OP-1 owners, which is a nice touch to see for such a big update. Additionally, it’ll work on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; OP-1 units, no matter how old. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="4Sjai9"&gt;The European Union has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com./business/retail-consumer/eu-proposes-effective-ban-new-fossil-fuel-car-sales-2035-2021-07-14/"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; phasing out gas-powered internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035, part of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/world/europe/climate-change-carbon-green-new-deal.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;a sweeping new plan&lt;/a&gt; to drastically reduce carbon emissions on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oplpo4"&gt;If passed, the legislation would require a 55 percent cut in overall CO2 emissions from new vehicles by 2030 compared to current levels. As it stands, the EU only currently requires a 37.5 percent cut by 2030 — which is weaker than even the United States is targeting. By 2035, though, the EU proposes a 100 percent cut, effectively banning new gas and even hybrid cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCCagJ"&gt;The effective ban would be an effective tool for cleaning up air pollution, as passenger cars make up about 12 percent of the total CO2 emissions in the EU. It would also be a big boost to all-electric vehicles, and the companies that have committed the most money to developing them like Volkswagen, which says it wants &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/13/volkswagen-wants-half-of-its-vehicle-sales-to-be-electric-by-2030.html"&gt;half of its total vehicles sold in 2030&lt;/a&gt; to be fully electric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPSvOx"&gt;To support the switch to electric, the EU said Wednesday in its proposal that it wants member countries to install public charging stations no more than 60 kilometers (37.3 miles) apart on major roads by 2025. The EU ultimately expects 3.5 million new charging stations by 2030 and 16.3 million by 2050. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4dq42c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A big buildout of charging infrastructure is also part of the proposal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OVDdmq"&gt;The proposal, which was developed by the EU’s executive branch, must be approved by the entire 27-country bloc. Some countries have already announced similarly aggressive targets, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287284/ford-electric-vehicles-ev-europe-2030"&gt;handful of automakers&lt;/a&gt; have laid out a roadmap for phasing out new gas-powered vehicles on the continent as well. But there could be resistance. France, for instance, is currently targeting an internal combustion phase-out by 2040 and is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-12/france-pushes-back-against-eu-banning-combustion-cars-by-2035"&gt;looking for more wiggle room on hybrids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0OTS7"&gt;Outside the EU, the United Kingdom has announced plans to ban the sale of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21572312/uk-ban-combustion-engine-vehicles-sale-electric-cars"&gt;new combustion engine cars by 2030&lt;/a&gt;, while California is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;looking to do the same by 2035&lt;/a&gt;. The EU’s regulations are particularly important, though, because it is home to many of the world’s biggest automakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoMgm7"&gt;At the federal level in the United States, President Joe Biden has started to unwind Trump-era decisions to weaken vehicle emissions standards. In April, he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404403/california-tailpipe-standards-epa-transportation-department"&gt;moved to restore California’s power to set its own standards&lt;/a&gt;, and later this year, his administration is expected to set &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/climate/biden-electric-cars-tailpipe-emissions.html"&gt;average fuel economy standards of 51 miles per gallon by 2026&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to find and create live videos on TikTok</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qrm2yiI-kFOfKgpQoEtrRb9qkAA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580942/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YJ9iXn"&gt;If you’re just starting to explore TikTok and you want to do a live video (as opposed to the usual recorded TikTok video), I’m afraid I have some bad news for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSmOSp"&gt;You can’t — at least, not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjdXmm"&gt;Unlike Facebook / Instagram, which let anyone create a live video, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/foundations-for-success/going-live/"&gt;TikTok only makes live videos available&lt;/a&gt; if you’re 16 years old or older and have more than 1,000 followers. Once you qualify, though, it’s a relatively simple process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeLidK"&gt;But before we go into making a live broadcast, here’s a quick tip on how to find one. Note that, at present, you can only see live feeds from people you are following, so if you are really into live broadcasts, the best thing to do is follow a bunch of people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hn42n6"&gt;To find a live video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="pxut3B"&gt;Tap the Inbox icon at the bottom of the screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xw5zRT"&gt;Look for the entry that starts with “TikTok: LIVE now:” If there is a current live feed happening, you’ll see it listed here. Otherwise, if you tap on the entry, you’ll see a listing of past live broadcasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eWag3c"&gt;To gift a favorite creator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tsFIb3"&gt;Live videos offer one of the few ways that people can show their appreciation of their favorite TikTok personalities in a practical way. TikTok calls it Live Gifting, and while the process is a little convoluted, it is actually a way to toss a coin to your TikToker (but only if you’re at least 18 years old). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uMWBDD"&gt;Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JfU0R6"&gt;First, you have to purchase some virtual coins. Go to your profile page (by tapping the “Me” icon in the lower-right corner).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JhK51q"&gt;Tap the three lines in the upper-right corner to go to “Settings and privacy.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gpmCDs"&gt;Select “Balance” &amp;gt; “Recharge.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SH1wfM"&gt;Select the number of coins you want to buy. For example, you can purchase 70 coins for 99 cents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uNGZ6P"&gt;Select your payment method (through Google Pay, Apple Pay, a credit card, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can recharge your coin account on your balance sheet." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1EUzSNEWNI3exNkJNlwfndFbh2E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716882/Screenshot_20210714_092917.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can recharge your coin account on your balance sheet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Choose how many coins you want to buy." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lBmff8yvv7CSqZ7JYHX1CgH3OFI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716878/Screenshot_20210714_092953.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose how many coins you want to buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6jrmU3"&gt;Now, when you are watching a live TikTok video and you like what you see, you can tap the gift icon at the bottom of the screen to select what kind of virtual gift you want to send. (This only works for livestreams, not for recorded content.) Each gift has a different value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To gift a live creator, tap the “gift” icon on the bottom of the screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/riJ41Dfocp3IjKFh1CxRvdJeqmU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716801/Screenshot_20210713_172047.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To gift a live creator, tap the “gift” icon on the bottom of the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Then choose the gift you want to send." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LypEUd3N-6GHoknmi9t0EU6kEDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716802/Screenshot_20210713_172306.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then choose the gift you want to send.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DSTw4y"&gt;What does the creator get? Well, besides good feelings from the virtual gift that just jumped across the screen, the creator does get cold, hard cash — although how much isn’t really clear. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/virtual-items?lang=en"&gt;According to its description&lt;/a&gt;, TikTok takes your virtual gift and transforms it into what it calls Diamonds. The creator can then exchange those Diamonds for real money. How much? Says TikTok, “The applicable monetary compensation will be calculated by us based on various factors including the number of Diamonds a user has accrued.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHzkyk"&gt;Want to get in on this? Well, if you’re over 16 and have at least 1,000 followers, here’s how to begin a livestream on TikTok:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BJ7eRA"&gt;How to go live&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="nLlBso"&gt;Tap on the plus sign at the bottom of the screen (the same one you always do to start a new video).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4ugq4L"&gt;Below the record button, where it usually just says “Camera” and “Templates,” you’ll also have a new label that says “Live.” Tap it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NEm1cb"&gt;On the top of the screen, you can now add a description and a cover photo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gwl7u2"&gt;Tap the big “Go Live” button. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ivgut0"&gt;And you’re there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3477P"&gt;According to TikTok, if you tap the three dots during your broadcast, you can change several visual settings and filter comments. (And since you’re live, you can also answer comments during the broadcast.) You can also add up to 20 moderators if things start to get busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GUIVRy"&gt;How to check your Diamonds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uw0HCG"&gt;If you want to see how many gifts you’ve gotten during your live feed, then you just go to the same place you’d buy virtual coins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="M2NZpK"&gt;Tap the three lines in the upper-right corner to go to “Settings and privacy” &amp;gt; “Balance.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SzBLQo"&gt;Tap “LIVE Gifts” to see how many Diamonds you got today, how many you have in total, and how much actual cash is in your balance. You can withdraw cash by tapping on the “Withdraw” button at the bottom of the screen. Tap on the icon in the upper right corner to see your total earnings and how much you’ve withdrawn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="UkzZ7o"&gt;If you’re serious about your TikTok feeds, then going live is a great way to interact with your fans and friends and to encourage them to check out your recorded videos. And who knows? You may find yourself with a few virtual gifts to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is changing the way it buys renewable energy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Helen Kendrick of SunPower Corp. walks alongside SunPower Co" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O_ukEuTk8fd9fM3ZtvVEO4V94Ig=/3x0:2961x1972/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580797/94619674.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Solar panels that were installed on four buildings on the Microsoft Corp. campus in Mountain View, California, Wednesday, April 25, 2007.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Tony Avelar/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hCwEiw"&gt;With a new strategy for how it purchases renewable energy, Microsoft hopes to push electricity grids to get clean. The tech giant is now focused on making a local impact in the places where it operates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYNkCE"&gt;Since 2012, the company has purchased enough renewable energy to match how much juice it uses to power its operations globally. But Microsoft isn’t actually running on renewables 100 percent of the time. All of those&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;clean energy purchases don’t necessarily connect&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to the same electricity grids that the company is plugged into. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fIYNw7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Clean energy purchases don’t necessarily connect&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to the same electricity grids that the company is plugged into&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bkXG8G"&gt;That could change if Microsoft is successful in its new goal. By 2030, it wants to make sure that its clean energy purchases are actually feeding into the local grids where it operates. The move is part of a broader push within tech and environmental advocacy to ensure that big energy guzzlers help phase out dirty fossil fuels wherever they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZU9jaW"&gt;“[In 2012], we were like a kid building with those big chunky wooden blocks. The tools and the resources we had were somewhat rudimentary,” says Brian Janous, general manager of energy at Microsoft. But those building blocks are evolving, Janous says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhjL9D"&gt;The company has pledged to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;carbon negative by 2030&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it plans to capture and store more carbon dioxide than it emits. The carbon removal technology necessary to achieve that goal doesn’t exist at scale yet, but Microsoft is funneling money toward its development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBbVCp"&gt;Using less electricity in the first place will be a key part to achieving Microsoft’s climate aims. As part of that effort, the company has tried submerging its servers in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436746/microsoft-project-natick-data-center-server-underwater-cooling-reliability"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22369609/microsoft-server-cooling-liquid-immersion-cloud-racks-data-centers"&gt;liquid baths&lt;/a&gt; to make them more energy-efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxY65c"&gt;When it comes to using renewable energy, Microsoft and other companies with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;goals to tackle climate change&lt;/a&gt; were limited to how much renewable energy electricity grids could provide them. In the US, renewable energy still only makes up about 20 percent of the electricity mix. So companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook often rely on Renewable Energy Credits to show that they’re funneling money to renewable projects elsewhere, which help offset some of their greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="b2gVVx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Every hour of every day, we need zero carbon resources being generated.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6EwSIc"&gt;Moving forward, that won’t be enough for Microsoft to fulfill its new climate target. To get enough locally generated renewable energy, the company is starting to change its power purchase agreements to demand more of its energy suppliers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKlHzQ"&gt;“What we’re moving towards is a model where we’re really working with our providers to say, ‘Look, we have this goal and we’re putting out this goal publicly.’ Every hour of every day, we need zero carbon resources being generated,” Janous tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DY4C6o"&gt;Microsoft is now one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy in the world, but it isn’t alone in its new emphasis on local impact. Adobe, Google, Hewlett Packard, and several environmental groups sent a &lt;a href="https://www.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Federal-Higher-Impact-Carbon-Free-Electricity-Procurement-Memo.pdf?utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosgenerate&amp;amp;stream=top"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to the Biden administration in March advocating for policies that support what they call “higher-impact electricity procurement.” That’s a similar model of sourcing renewable energy from nearby sources on a 24/7 basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YKafUp"&gt;Google set a &lt;a href="https://sustainability.google/progress/energy/"&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; last year of running on clean electricity around the clock by 2030. On an even broader scale,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;President Biden has set a goal of getting US electricity grids to run on 100 percent clean energy by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Razer Blade 17 packs more GPU power into the same slim chassis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/98LZKPa-0OJBntUZxzS43-CYDB8=/0x0:1504x1003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580790/Razer_Blade__D17_7___2021__Lifestyle_Shoot_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f2wW2p"&gt;Razer’s largest laptop is getting big upgrades. The new mid-2021 refresh of the Blade 17 will add newer CPUs, higher-powered GPUs, and an updated webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8gU4b"&gt;The new Blade 17, which drops the “Pro” designation of earlier models, catches the larger laptop up to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22428604/razer-blade-15-gaming-laptop-mid-2021-intel-h-series-nvidia-rtx-3080-thin-15-inch-specs"&gt;Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this year. It now comes equipped with the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;Intel 11th Gen H-Series processors&lt;/a&gt;, with a choice of the Core i7 11800H (2.3GHz base clock, 4.6GHz boost clock), or the top-tier Core i9 11900H (2.5GHz base, 4.9GHz boost), which isn’t available on Razer’s smaller models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxaTkt"&gt;The laptop also features GPUs from Nvidia’s latest RTX lineup, including the 3060, 3070, and the 3080, with up to 16GB of video memory. Crucially, Razer has increased the Blade 17’s GPUs’ total graphics power to 130 watts, up from the &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Blade-15-Advanced-RTX-3080-TGP-95-W-beats-RTX-2080-Super-Max-Q-TGP-95-W.537439.0.html"&gt;95 watts&lt;/a&gt; of the Blade 15 Advanced. That additional power means more heat generated, which might be mitigated in part by the Blade 17’s larger chassis. But we can’t say for sure whether heat will be an issue until a full test of the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jkeZPz"&gt;Speaking of the laptop’s size, it stays the same with dimensions of 0.78 inches (19.99mm) x 15.5 inches (395mm) x 10.24 inches (260mm) and weighs 6.06 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y1bvSwstEIT8nnpnc_SPQJgJtBE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714938/Blade_17__2021__UHD_Render__3_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Blade 17.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E1C2T4"&gt;Razer has built the Blade 17’s RAM and storage drives to be user-upgradeable. The laptop ships with a 1TB PCIe NVME drive, with an extra M.2 slot for expanded storage, and up to 32GB of RAM. The motherboard supports up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8fMU9"&gt;The Blade 17’s display options range from a 1440p display with a 165Hz refresh rate to a 1080p resolution with a quicker 360Hz refresh. One variant of the Blade 17 also packs a 4K touch display, though it only has a refresh rate of 120Hz. The sweet spot for most people is probably the 1440p model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xR6f9W"&gt;Some of the new features that round out the Blade 17 are the addition of anti-fingerprint coating previously added to the Blade 15 Advanced as well as an upgraded 1080p webcam with Windows Hello. The speaker system has also been upgraded, now with two speakers on each side of the laptop instead of just one.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M9D05y"&gt;The Blade 17 will charge through USB-C at 100W and will ship with Razer’s standard 230W charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7f3ln0"&gt;There are also upgrades to the Blade 15 Base model as well, including the option of an i7-11800H processor and two PCIe 4.0 SSD slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWkTC7"&gt;You can preorder the Blade 17 and Blade 15 starting today, and Razer expects the laptops to ship in July–August.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft puts PCs in the cloud with Windows 365</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MJxL7uNhcfQiiLoAbhIW6H0hEo=/30x0:930x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580792/windows365.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4xzS5c"&gt;Microsoft is putting Windows in the cloud. Windows 365 is a new service that will let businesses access Cloud PCs from anywhere, streaming a version of Windows 10 or Windows 11 in a web browser. While virtualization and remote access to PCs has existed for more than a decade, Microsoft is betting on Windows 365 to offer Cloud PCs to businesses just as they shift toward a mix of office and remote work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A1naOU"&gt;Windows 365 will work on any modern web browser or through Microsoft’s Remote Desktop app, allowing users to access their Cloud PC from a variety of devices. “Windows 365 provides an instant-on boot experience,” according to Wangui McKelvey, a general manager for Microsoft 365. This instant access lets workers stream their Windows session with all of their same apps, tools, data, and settings across Macs, iPads, Linux machines, and Android devices. “You can pick up right where you left off, because the state of your Cloud PC remains the same, even when you switch devices,” explains McKelvey.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D98Md45TfMYubBLAPoFCerUGy-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716693/windows365web.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 365 streams Windows to a web browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jceXwr"&gt;Windows 365 will only be available for businesses when it launches on August 2nd, with a per-user monthly subscription cost. Microsoft is not detailing exact pricing details until the service launches next month, but Windows 365 is designed for one-person businesses all the way up to enterprises with thousands of employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYdHAL"&gt;There will be two editions of Windows 365: Business and Enterprise. Both are powered by Azure Virtual Desktop, and individual Cloud PCs can be configured with a single CPU, 2GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage at the low-end, all the way up to eight CPUs, 32GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. Microsoft is offering 12 different configurations for both Windows 365 Business and Enterprise, and businesses will be able to scale processing power so there will be lots of options to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMkrCI"&gt;Technically, Microsoft offering Windows in the cloud isn’t much different to the myriad of choices that businesses could already opt for with virtualization right now. Microsoft has already offered similar technology with Azure Virtual Desktop, and Citrix has been offering cloud-hosted desktop PCs for years. Where Microsoft is trying to differentiate is in both ease of use and management. “Windows 365 is really going to make a huge difference for organizations that wanted to try virtualization for various reasons but could not — maybe it was too costly, too complex or they didn’t have the expertise in house to do it,” says McKelvey.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xcFKhsU9JB2OYIXt1AggC8Q1quQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716703/windows365management.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Businesses can create Cloud PCs within minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ry7L6v"&gt;Businesses will be able to create Cloud PCs within minutes and assign them to employees, avoiding the need for dedicated physical hardware. That could be appealing for many businesses hiring remote workers or even temporary contract staff that need to securely access a corporate network. As your entire Windows PC is in the cloud, employees don’t need to navigate VPNs or worry about security on personal devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVdIBQ"&gt;While Windows 365 seems perfectly timed for businesses looking to tackle the complexities of remote work, Microsoft has been working on the service for years. The operating systems group at Microsoft had been working on a project codenamed “Arcadia,” a service to stream video games from the cloud. Arcadia dates all the way back to Microsoft demonstrating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/26/4774418/microsoft-demonstrates-halo-4-streaming-from-the-cloud-to-windows-and"&gt;Halo running on a Windows Phone in 2013&lt;/a&gt;. This early virtualization work eventually led to Windows 365 and a focus on making it consumer-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZhYlv"&gt;“When we built this team, we brought in a couple of leaders who had experience with virtualization, but for the most part we brought in people who had experience with Windows and experience with consumer experiences because that was the bar we wanted to set,” says Scott Manchester, director of program management for Windows 365.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zTONjxrY9lwV6QOCTXbe8ts1amQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716695/windows365ui.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 365 is designed to be easy to use for businesses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I2lboO"&gt;The pandemic accelerated work on Windows 365, and Microsoft’s broader focus on hybrid work. Microsoft has been steadily improving Microsoft Teams over the past year and laying out its vision for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447048/microsoft-teams-future-meetings-features"&gt;future of meetings&lt;/a&gt;, remote work, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6idKl"&gt;While Windows 365 is only for businesses right now, it’s easy to imagine a future where Microsoft could offer more powerful PC computing to consumers directly in a browser. A startup called Mighty is offering a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408818/mighty-browser-chrome-cloud-streaming-web"&gt;$30-a-month web browser that lives in the cloud&lt;/a&gt;, designed to offer a better web experience on older laptops and PCs. Windows 365 might just be the first significant step toward a future where you don’t need a dedicated Windows PC to use Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says FTC chair shouldn’t help decide the future of its antitrust case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Commerce Committee Considers Nominees For NASA Administrator And Federal Trade Commissioner" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z635KtxZuFfo9VbGWOF2PeuFzCA=/0x0:5324x3549/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580701/1232438844.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PjAfPL"&gt;Facebook has asked recently confirmed Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan to recuse herself from the agency’s antitrust fight against Facebook, claiming her previous criticism of the company disqualifies her from fairly judging its conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqS4Fv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-recusal-of-ftc-chairwoman-in-antitrust-case-11626267605?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; first reported&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Facebook-Inc.s-Petition-to-Recuse-Chair-Khan.pdf"&gt;Facebook’s petition&lt;/a&gt;, which was filed with the FTC today. In the petition, Facebook attorneys write that “Chair Khan has consistently and very publicly concluded that Facebook is guilty of violating the antitrust laws. She has built her career, in large part, by singling out Facebook as a professed antitrust violator.” Facebook cites Khan’s previous anti-monopoly work at the nonprofit Open Markets Institute, her contribution to a congressional antitrust investigation, and her popular and academic writings about tech industry monopolies, as well as her tweets, which include praise for FTC antitrust enforcement against Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="coly0P"&gt;The petition claims that Khan has “prejudged Facebook’s alleged antitrust liability” by supporting the FTC’s earlier enforcement actions and by conducting academic and congressional investigations where she concluded Facebook had monopoly power. Khan’s opinions have been unusually high-profile, but it is not unusual for government officials to have worked in advocacy positions or expressed opinions on their subjects of expertise, and it’s rare for a confirmed appointee to be disqualified on that basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4z6QlZ"&gt;Facebook is following a playbook set by Amazon, which also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557456/amazon-lina-khan-recusal-petition-federal-trade-commission-antitrust"&gt;asked Khan to recuse herself&lt;/a&gt; from potential Amazon proceedings. (“Facebook agrees with Amazon’s arguments concerning the circumstances where a commissioner’s prior statements require recusal and incorporates those legal arguments,” the petition notes.) But Facebook facing an even more immediate risk: last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court"&gt;a judge threw out&lt;/a&gt; a federal antitrust lawsuit against Facebook and gave the FTC until July 29th to amend and refile it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oCwJBB"&gt;Khan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;joined the FTC shortly&lt;/a&gt; before the Facebook case was dismissed, and, as chair, she could play a pivotal role in deciding its future. Facebook wants Khan to refrain from “participating in any decisions concerning whether and how to continue the FTC’s antitrust case against the company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5HnCH"&gt;Recusal petitions against FTC commissioners are not commonly granted, and Khan was confirmed largely because of bipartisan support for her sharp and public criticism of tech companies. She has not indicated plans to recuse herself from cases involving Amazon — and it seems unlikely that she’ll do so with Facebook either.&lt;/p&gt;
