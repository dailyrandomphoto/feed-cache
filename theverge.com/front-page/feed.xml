    <title>Google slashes Stadia’s revenue share to try to attract developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9TmPR7HBxHP07UkssT35ddEot3M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576554/akrales_191113_3779_0284.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PLMLVP"&gt;Google is revising how much of a cut it takes from Stadia games in a bid to try to attract more developers. Starting on October 1st, Google will take 15 percent of sales up to $3 million through the end of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oJa4Vi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I0oNK-XHp0I?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=319&amp;amp;start=319" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e6iQcy"&gt;With the change, Google seems to be trying to make its cloud gaming platform a more enticing option for developers — a proposition that has likely become much harder since the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;shut down its own in-house studios&lt;/a&gt;. Google has also tried offering exclusive games to try to bring developers on board (which it presumably paid hefty sums to acquire), but many of those games &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/16/stadia-exclusive-games-available-xbox-playstation-nintendo/"&gt;have since been released on other platforms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0pfrs"&gt;The news comes as revenue shares between developers and platform holders have come under intense scrutiny as of late. Google’s change with Stadia isn’t the first it’s made recently for its stores: the company reduced its Play Store cut to 15 percent for a developer’s first $1 million in annual revenue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;. That move followed a similar one from Apple in November, which announced that developers who earn less than $1 million per year on the App Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;would qualify for a program&lt;/a&gt; where Apple would take a 15 percent cut of their revenues instead of the standard 30 percent fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63jMJF"&gt;Tuesday’s news was announced at the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0oNK-XHp0I&amp;amp;list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIb7hcy-YBGDlCxq8LyRdVA&amp;amp;index=1"&gt;Google for Games Developer Summit&lt;/a&gt;. As part of the event, on Monday, Google announced that Android 12 will let you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573033/google-android-12-games-download-dashboard-developer-summit"&gt;play games as you’re downloading them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just launched an official $99 MagSafe battery pack for the iPhone 12 lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eEfRxBW8iTYh7R0OOqdpnq9_tFI=/0x30:2052x1398/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576513/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_9.56.00_AM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new MagSafe Battery Pack.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4KJcDV"&gt;Apple has launched the MagSafe Battery Pack for its iPhone 12 lineup. One of the magnetic batteries costs $99, and you can order one &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJWY3AM%2FA%2Fmagsafe-battery-pack%3Fafid%3Dp239%257C10078%26cid%3Daos-us-aff-ir&amp;amp;sharedid=AppleMagSafeBatteryVerge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;right now from Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;. For me, the website is showing delivery between July 22nd and July 26th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPH0mk"&gt;Apple has released battery cases for iPhones in the past, but the new pack attaches to the iPhone 12 phones thanks to embedded magnets. And it will work with all four of the phones in the iPhone 12 family — the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ARo_k-GReC54LvtfihaLu6EYvzg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22715091/MJWY3_AV1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One side of the MagSafe Battery Pack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6AepQM"&gt;While the iPhone 11 battery cases had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974475/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-camera-smart-battery-case-shortcut-button"&gt;physical camera shortcut button&lt;/a&gt;, since this accessory is just an attachable pack, that means it doesn’t come with any other features besides giving you some extra juice for your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHGFx6"&gt;Apple says it charges with up to 5W of power, so the new pack won’t be the fastest way to charge your phone. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212174"&gt;In a support page&lt;/a&gt;, Apple also says the battery requires iOS 14.7 — a software update that’s not out yet. Since Apple’s website is showing delivery times for the battery pack for as early as July 22nd, it seems like that update will be out soon to support it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u31Zpm"&gt;Apple also offers a &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMK0E3ZM%2FA%2Fiphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-arizona%3Fafid%3Dp239%257C10078%26cid%3Daos-us-aff-ir&amp;amp;sharedid=AppleMagSafeBatteryVerge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wallet that can stick magnetically onto the back of your phone&lt;/a&gt; as well as a MagSafe wireless charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hwn2Mg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 13th, 1:14PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added details of charging speed and that the pack requires iOS 14.7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Republicans call for Amazon to testify on Pentagon relationship</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="George Floyd’s Brother Testifies Before House On Policing And Law Enforcement Accountability" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QPHt3VysPutxcPNC3F0smm8KzGM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576230/1219099045.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Greg Nash-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OifnVL"&gt;Republicans are questioning Amazon’s relationship with the Pentagon after newly released emails show that defense officials praised tech executives vying for a $10 billion contract during the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92PnzZ"&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/13/us/politics/amazon-jedi-contract.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on previously unreleased emails that show Pentagon officials applauding Amazon executives while the company sought out a lucrative defense contract between 2017 and 2018. The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure project, or JEDI, set out to find a tech company that would move the Defense Department’s computer networks over to the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1FiF6"&gt;In one instance, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/13/us/politics/amazon-jedi-contract.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;the&lt;em&gt; Times &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that former Trump Defense Secretary Jim Mattis traveled to Silicon Valley to meet with executives from companies like Apple, Amazon, and Google in 2017. During this trip, Mattis was made “uncomfortable” while Amazon representatives aggressively pitched their cloud-computing products to him. A former Mattis adviser, Sally Donnelly, also referred to Bezos as “the genius of our age.” Donnelly, who later sent Mattis a list of reasons he should meet with Bezos, had previously worked at a consulting firm where her clients included Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rZPGmy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is exactly what we were concerned about”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WSQDiB"&gt;“This is exactly what we were concerned about, and it contradicts Amazon’s insistence that there is nothing to see here,” Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) said in a joint statement Tuesday. “It’s become more and more clear that Amazon used its market power and paid-for connections to circumvent ethical boundaries and avoid competition in an attempt to win this contract.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdyau8"&gt;Microsoft won the multibillion-dollar contract in 2019 after a closely watched bidding fight between Amazon. In the months leading up to the contract’s winner announcement, former President Donald Trump dialed up his criticism of Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos, accusing the Bezos-owned &lt;em&gt;Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;of unfair media coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VK5FWo"&gt;But earlier this month, the Defense Department announced that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/06/technology/JEDI-contract-cancelled.html"&gt;it would cancel its contract&lt;/a&gt; amid an ongoing legal battle alleging that Trump wrongfully interfered in the bidding process. In canceling the prior contract, Amazon is given a second chance to win the $10 billion deal. But Republicans in Washington are calling for the company to testify regarding its Pentagon relationships in light of the newly released emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woSvPm"&gt;“Now, more than ever, we need to ask Amazon, under oath, whether it tried to improperly influence the largest federal contract in history,” the lawmakers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C81bVy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgzBxT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 is full of delightful detail</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XdhOQzt4TyF-I_LZIWvUiJwOmys=/0x100:600x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576125/windows11animations.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft Design&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SaVnKH"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt;Windows 11 preview&lt;/a&gt; has been available for a couple of weeks now, but I’m still discovering new animations and details in this new OS that put a smile on my face. While the new Start menu and centered taskbar are the obvious changes in Windows 11 that you’ll notice straight away, it’s the small animations throughout the OS that really make it feel a lot more fresh and alive than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrYuFo"&gt;Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/windows-11-designing-the-next-generation-of-windows-490c02fb6373"&gt;started detailing&lt;/a&gt; some of the design approaches it has used for Windows 11 and its &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRHkSraHhTA/"&gt;attention to detail for daily micro-interactions&lt;/a&gt;. That includes things like a checkbox that has an animated tick to subtly let you know when you interact with it, or a settings cog that spins when you hover over it. Plenty of buttons in Windows 11 pop with faint signs of life or bounce as you move around the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s82-gwVEIYem2h081qCsKU98LuM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714875/windows11button.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft Design&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Windows 11 button pops into life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/52fLGKG9SrDzD87iCsgj5xww4bE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714879/windows11pop.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft Design&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These tiny animations can be found throughout Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5VXVr"&gt;It’s this attention to detail that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt;makes Windows 11 feel fresh and new&lt;/a&gt; but still familiar to use on a daily basis. The animations are often playful but in equal parts useful to provide an important visual cue for what you’re interacting with. Thankfully, they’re not in your face, slow, or annoying, mostly because Microsoft designed them to be calming. “Calmness is much needed in today’s world... Windows 11 facilitates this through foundational experiences that feel familiar, soften formerly intimidating UI, and increase emotional connection,” &lt;a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/windows-11-designing-the-next-generation-of-windows-490c02fb6373"&gt;says Microsoft’s design team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7YRvyC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Windows 11 is a new and refreshing approach to an old and familiar home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"},{"title":"Microsoft releases Windows 11 preview, available to download now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553639/microsoft-windows-11-download-available-preview-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5gVYmW"&gt;While the subtle animations might be calming, the choice to center the taskbar and change the Start menu is the more striking change in Windows 11. “After listening to people express a need for more efficiency and less noise when using Start, we designed a cleaner and simpler experience that puts people at the center by prioritizing the apps they love and the documents they need,” says Microsoft’s design team. “It also adapts to modern device form factors and enables easier access for all screen sizes, from a Surface Go to an ultrawide monitor.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SQwMy_37u1vf8OR4648a6ThS55A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714884/windows11startmenucompare.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft Design&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Windows 11 Start menu versus Windows 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2xCqEK"&gt;Windows 11 also improves the out-of-box experience (OOBE) of when you set up a machine for the first time. The settings you configure are a lot more useful than in Windows 10, including naming your PC and setting up a PC for how you intend to use it. Sometimes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22338205"&gt;it’s the little things that count&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HO5LTJ"&gt;Microsoft has also added rounded corners to most parts of Windows 11, new iconography, and an updated Segoe UI Variable font. Like most of Windows 11, these are subtle changes that you only really start to notice after using the OS for a few days. Microsoft even worked with design studio &lt;a href="https://sixnfive.com/"&gt;Six N Five&lt;/a&gt; to create most of the wallpapers you’ll see in Windows 11. They’re mostly centered to match the Start menu. “We want your journey into Windows 11 to be literally centered from the start,” says Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOjaCl"&gt;The Windows 11 design certainly isn’t perfect, though. It’s a work in progress, but there’s still a lot of inconsistency in this preview that needs to be ironed out. At times, it still feels like Microsoft is mashing together Windows from a decade ago with this modern and simple UI. There’s a lot that goes into overhauling something as big and sprawling as Windows, so hopefully the final product smooths up some of the early and rough edges.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why small design decisions can matter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/17G7ICTe46Jq7FmIdSSxdFV23Io=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576081/vpavic_4547_20210421_0050.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tci1Is"&gt;While we usually look for major features in a device — speed or sound quality or picture sharpness — sometimes it’s the little things that can make or break your experience with that device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOmJGb"&gt;I realized this recently when I bought myself a pair of Jabra Elite 75t earbuds for day-to-day use. I really liked my new earbuds. But while my previous headset came with a detachable loop that you could use to attach it to a bag or a keyring or whatever, the Jabra case has no way of attaching to anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkyroV"&gt;Now, I wasn’t about to return the earbuds because of this, but it did cause me to growl a little. In order to get that same convenient functionality I had enjoyed with my previous earbuds, I had to buy a cheap silicone cover for the case — one that came with a carabiner that I could hook onto my bag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2klN3s"&gt;It also started me thinking about other easily overlooked design features that we may not even think about when we buy a device but become issues once we start using the device on a day-to-day basis. For example, about five seconds after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22570161/apple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison"&gt;Apple’s AirTags&lt;/a&gt; hit the market, it was followed by a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394331/apple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin"&gt;veritable onslaught of accessories&lt;/a&gt; (a number of them made by Apple itself) with one purpose and one purpose only: to fix the fact that the AirTag doesn’t come with a hole so that you can attach it to anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A rugged AirTag case from Spigen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8DcdqCayePsBxP8zc6ye9XhXgWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457915/detail_airtags_rugged_armor_01.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rugged AirTag case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yx8ONJ"&gt;Of course, you can look at the positive viewpoint: that, as with my Jabra Elite 75t, the lack of a convenient attachment provides a lot of companies with an additional source of income. And after all, what’s another few dollars added to the cost of something as nifty as the AirTag? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpNgAD"&gt;That is until you consider there are design decisions out there that are just as unnecessary but convenient and are included with the device. In fact, some of these are features you may not even know were needed until you realize how useful they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wOKbf"&gt;Here’s an example: I’m one of those people who tends to have a tangle of plugged-in white and black cables in several corners of my home — tangles that I have to search every time I want to, say, use a USB-C cable for my phone or the power cable for my MacBook. Most of the time, I have to pick up one of the cables and follow it to the end to make sure it’s the one I need. However, I can find the cable for my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; laptop in a couple of seconds because the end of the cable has a small LED that is always lit when the other end is plugged into power, making it really easy to find. Dell didn’t have to put that LED in there — but I’m incredibly glad it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BA9jmE"&gt;There are loads of other small design pluses that are out there making life just a little bit easier for many of us, like ridges on the bottom of laptops to make it a little easier to carry the thing without dropping it (and simultaneously making it more comfortable to type on) or low-tech shutters that can block off the camera on the Echo Show 8 to provide that extra bit of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbBgSV"&gt;Perhaps the conclusion to be drawn from this is even the smaller design decisions that are made when creating a new tech device can affect our feeling about that product — maybe even enough so that we as consumers might take those decisions into consideration when the next model comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgx5p6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cx2Z27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram tests a ‘reshare’ sticker, which actually makes it harder to share posts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jz_o5RkCCtK1IYXNf3ACVetbEqE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576046/reshare.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9eRaUr"&gt;Instagram doesn’t want you to spam your friends with all of the posts you come across and like. So today, it’s starting a test to make sharing to Stories slightly trickier. The company is testing a “reshare” sticker that can be placed in Stories. When selected, a “recently viewed” tab will surface and let users choose from posts they’ve seen in the last hour, saved, or posted, which they can then share in their story. They can insert IGTV, reels, and feed video content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MW17xu"&gt;You can get an idea of what the test looks like in the image above. Previously, if you wanted to share a feed post to your story, you had to so manually from the post itself. This test will replace that functionality, effectively requiring you to navigate away from the post itself and into the create mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9cIur"&gt;An Instagram spokesperson says the test is designed to make people more “intentional” and “deliberate” about what they post. Presumably, this means they don’t want people to just tap a share button from a post and instead are introducing slightly more friction to do so. At the same time, Instagram likely wants people to engage more with content on the app, and this might raise the bar of what people see and, therefore, get them to tap through on various photos and videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Zp4Yj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s weather app won’t say it’s 69 degrees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h8ZFtqx_zBsNmgKO6joOOfjyJKA=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69575922/weatherapps_watermarked.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A weather forecast on iOS 15 compared to the rounded forecast on iOS 14.6 | Photo: Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M4uruv"&gt;If you’re an iPhone user, the weather is always a particularly nice 70 degrees. Or 68 degrees. Any temperature but 69 degrees, actually, because it turns out that the built-in weather app on some versions of iOS — including the current version, iOS 14.6 — will refuse to display &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/06/why-69-is-the-internets-coolest-number-sex.html"&gt;the internet’s favorite number&lt;/a&gt;, even if the actual temperature in a given location is, in fact, 69 degrees, along with several other (less meme-able) numerals like 65 and 71 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WSxGM0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KPPrmh"&gt;It’s not clear if this is a bug or an intentional attempt from Apple to cut down on 69-related humor. The rounding is only visible in the weather app itself: clicking through to Apple’s source data from &lt;a href="http://Weather.com"&gt;Weather.com&lt;/a&gt; will show the proper temperature, as do Apple’s home screen widgets. But the iOS weather app will refuse to show 69 degrees anywhere in the forecast, whether it’s for the current temperature, the hourly forecast for the day, or the extended forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaKu8h"&gt;A possible explanation for the issue (as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/theMarcDufresne/status/1414981789052030987"&gt;pointed out by several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nannerb/status/1414981582318878722"&gt;people on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) is that Apple may be sourcing data for its iOS Weather app in Celsius and then converting it to Fahrenheit. For example, 20 degrees Celsius converts to 68 degrees Fahrenheit, while 21 degrees Celsius converts to 69.8 degrees Fahrenheit — which rounds up to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The app appears to have similar issues with temperatures like 65 degrees (where 18 degrees Celsius converts to 64.4 degrees Fahrenheit, while 19 degrees Celsius is 66.2 degrees Fahrenheit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CU5IC3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10650148"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vei02X"&gt;It’s not clear when Apple introduced the rounding here. A phone running iOS 11.2.1 shows accurate data of 69 degrees, as did phones running iOS 15, so it’s possible that the issue is specific to Apple’s most recent update (or has been identified and fixed already). Other weather sources, including Dark Sky — which is owned by Apple — have no issue displaying 69 degrees, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="heuj6P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Apple for additional comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDuY4o"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, July 13th, 12:59PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added potential explanation for the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Barracuda X wireless headset plays nicely with PS5, Switch, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Barracuda X" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zuJzYOyFZTw0ebqvnKp2dp7Jdi0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69575639/cfaulkner_210705_4660_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Barracuda X borrows the sleek design of Razer’s Opus headphones.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9cBpNd"&gt;Razer has introduced the Barracuda X, a multiplatform wireless gaming headset that takes design cues from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262459/razer-opus-review-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones-thx-over-ear-price-specs"&gt;the company’s Opus noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;. They’re &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/2rjgJG"&gt;available starting today for $99.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is more aggressive than I expected, given that the company usually comes in at a premium price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKOmKi"&gt;The Barracuda X is a big step for Razer in that it’s finally jumping into USB-C connectivity — both in terms of how the headset charges and how it transmits audio wirelessly. Included in the box is a small USB-C wireless transmitter that’s almost identical to the one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20836987/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-usb-c-nintendo-switch-gaming"&gt;SteelSeries has included with some of its headsets since 2019&lt;/a&gt;. It allows compatibility with the Nintendo Switch in portable mode, the PS5’s front-facing USB-C port, and some phones and tablets directly through their USB-C ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LGT7f"&gt;Razer includes a five-foot USB-A cable with a USB-C female end that the transmitter can plug into for devices that don’t have a USB-C port, like a PC, PS4, or the Switch’s dock. It can also serve as an extender if there’s some interference between the headset and your USB-C port. None of this is cutting-edge in the headset world at this point, but it’s a broad amount of compatibility for $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60JUcI"&gt;The headset also works wired, and includes a 3.5mm cable. The headset isn’t compatible with Xbox consoles due to the fact that they operate on Microsoft’s own wireless protocol, which is unsupported. This is disappointing, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21502286/steelseries-arctis-7p-7x-xbox-series-x-s-ps5-usbc-wireless-gaming-headset"&gt;SteelSeries’ Arctis 7X&lt;/a&gt; includes a similar dongle with a toggle switch to work on Xbox and other platforms. Razer will likely get there at some point, but not today. You can plug the Barracuda X audio cable into your Xbox controller’s 3.5mm jack. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Barracuda X" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4O3ZZEbAnRSgwg5X-dqKXmv0-fA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22703920/cfaulkner_210706_4660_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C transmitter is relatively low-profile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1CmULe"&gt;This product is the first in the line of Barracuda headsets, and it’s setting a strong precedent  for future iterations. The style of the Barracuda X is a far cry from the likes of the Kraken and the BlackShark V2, looking more like headphones than a gaming headset. Razer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was aiming for a design that appears platform-agnostic, so as to indicate to people that this is a headset that’s likely made for your preferred platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E8A2bm"&gt;The Barracuda X weighs 250 grams, and Razer says this is its lightest wireless headset yet. After wearing it for about a week, I can vouch that it’s comfortable to wear after several hours of use. The ear pads are soft and breathable, yet dense enough to create some passable noise isolation. The cups themselves can swivel 90 degrees, which is handy for slimming their profile for storage in a bag. But that swivel feature works backwards when you’re wearing them. For some reason, Razer engineered them to swivel in the opposite direction than I prefer, resting the hard side of the cups against your chest instead of the soft ear cups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Barracuda X" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zsqmrV-GjuLLdWiRutAdW4aO0gM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22703918/cfaulkner_210705_4660_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The mic and all the controls are placed along the edge of the left ear cup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4WUFiL"&gt;In terms of performance, these sound great for a $100 headset. These employ the same “TriForce” driver design &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345836/razer-blackshark-v2-x-budget-friendly-wired-gaming-headsets"&gt;originally found in the BlackShark V2 headset&lt;/a&gt;, with three distinct sections for delivering bass, mids, and treble. Though, the drivers are a bit smaller in the Barracuda X: 40mm compared to 50mm in the BlackShark V2 series. I still need to test them a bit more to give a verdict, but &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; on PS5 rivaled Sony’s Pulse 3D Audio headset — both in terms of sound quality and positional audio capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsjXgK"&gt;Other hardware features to note include a detachable boom microphone (which doesn’t support mic monitoring, unfortunately), and its on-headset controls are all located along the edge of the left ear cup. There’s a mute button, a volume wheel, and a power button, which can serve as a multifunction button when connected to some devices. Tapping it once while connected to my Android phone paused music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOUxYY"&gt;One thing to note is that it’s possible Razer may release a more fully-featured version of the Barracuda. Historically, products with an “X” in the name tend to be the low to mid-end offering, and usually a “Pro” model follows after a few months. It’s tough to say what a Barracuda Pro (if that’s what it’d be named) would offer over this version announced today, but features like Bluetooth, an extra dial for game and chat audio mixing, mic monitoring support, or Xbox wireless compatibility are just a few that are on the table. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Machine learning model from the largest US COVID-19 dataset predicts disease severity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RwWxaKeng6za8B_d0QYnCWxcwkM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69575644/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1eMdQ9"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522863/health-data-records-covid-coronavirus-model-nih-privacy-n3c"&gt;centralized repository of COVID-19 health records&lt;/a&gt; built last year is beginning to show results, starting with a &lt;a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.16901?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=071321"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published today. The repository is the largest set of COVID-19 records to date, and was built by a team of researchers and data experts last year to help make sense of COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RCAq3"&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, looked at risk factors for severe cases of COVID-19 and traced the progression of the disease over time. The authors&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;built machine learning models to predict which hospitalized patients would develop severe disease based on information collected on their first day in a hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCS2UP"&gt;Using the centralized database, called the National COVID Cohort Collaborative Data Enclave, or &lt;a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/n3c"&gt;N3C&lt;/a&gt;, meant the research team was able to include hundreds of thousands of patients’ records in its analysis. The study used data from 34 medical centers and included over 1 million adults — 174,568 who tested positive for COVID-19 and 1,133,848 who tested negative. It includes records stretching from January 2020 to December 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00yL1U"&gt;The analysis shows how treatment for COVID-19 changed over the course of 2020, as doctors tried new treatments and gained more experience with the condition. The percentage of patients who were treated with the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which was promoted by former President Donald Trump before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21291694/fda-hydroxychloroquine-emergency-authorization-trump-barda"&gt;proving to be ineffective&lt;/a&gt;, dropped off to nearly zero by May 2020. Use of the steroid dexamethasone ticked up in June, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292765/steroid-coronavirus-survival-data-results-dexamethasone-oxford"&gt;studies showed&lt;/a&gt; it could improve survival rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JNxWq"&gt;It also confirmed that survival rates for patients with COVID-19 improved over the course of 2020. In March and April, 16 percent of people admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 died. In September and October, that dropped to just under 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsKwQH"&gt;People who had higher heart rates, breathing rates, and temperatures when they arrived at the hospital were more likely to need drastic interventions like ventilation. They were also more likely to die. Abnormal white blood cell count, inflammation, blood acidity, and kidney function were also linked to more severe cases. The research team built machine learning models using those and other data points that could predict which patients would get seriously ill. The models could eventually be used as the basis for decision-making tools with additional testing, the authors wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNzShh"&gt;Researchers have been analyzing the trajectory of COVID-19 since the very start of the pandemic. This study has the advantage of pulling from a large and diverse dataset — it’s not restricted to one hospital or one state. In the US, researchers are often limited to studying the medical records from patients at the institutions where they work. That means the number of records they’re able to include in studies can be limited, and they’re not able to easily check if their conclusions would apply in other places. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0m1Xss"&gt;A resource like N3C, which pulls together records from dozens of institutions, sidesteps those limitations. By now, N3C includes data from &lt;a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/news/releases/2020/access-to-N3C-COVID-19-data-analytics-platform-now-open"&gt;73 health institutions&lt;/a&gt; and has records from over 2 million COVID-19 patients. More than &lt;a href="https://covid.cd2h.org/projects"&gt;200 research projects&lt;/a&gt; using the data are underway, including studies examining risk factors for COVID-19 re-infection and the disease’s impact on pregnancy. It’s not perfect — standardizing information across hospitals is hard, and there may not be complete data on many patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C90pPt"&gt;Still, having such a large set of data is invaluable. Researchers are using the resource to run studies that they may not have been able to tackle with just their own institution’s resources, Elaine Hill, a health economist at the University of Rochester working on pregnancy research, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522863/health-data-records-covid-coronavirus-model-nih-privacy-n3c"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last fall&lt;/a&gt;. “It makes it possible to shed light on things we wouldn’t be able to,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

At the same time, we’re also focused on protecting the health of everyone at Tango,” the announcement reads. “Our new release window will give us time to bring the world of &lt;em&gt;Ghostwire&lt;/em&gt; to life as we’ve always envisioned it.” The game was previously slated for release in fall of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="SQCsiM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghostwire: Tokyo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18660695/e3-2019-trailers-nintendo-microsoft-square-enix-ubisoft-ea"&gt;was announced&lt;/a&gt; at E3 2019, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21277231/ps5-playstation-5-game-trailers-launch-release-dates-sony-event"&gt;first gameplay&lt;/a&gt; was revealed in June 2020, when Sony touted the game as a timed PlayStation 5 (and PC) exclusive. A few months later, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448877/microsoft-bethesda-softworks-zenimax-acquisition-xbox-game-pass-series-x"&gt;acquired Tango’s parent company ZeniMax&lt;/a&gt;, making &lt;em&gt;Ghostwire&lt;/em&gt; one of two Microsoft-owned but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449121/microsoft-bethesda-ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-consoles-exclusives"&gt;initially PlayStation-exclusive games&lt;/a&gt;. The other exclusive, Arkane’s &lt;em&gt;Deathloop, &lt;/em&gt;was also delayed but is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442372/deathloop-preview-arkane-studios-ps5"&gt;scheduled for a September release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSuO0K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghostwire&lt;/em&gt; puts players in a Tokyo that’s been nearly deserted by humans and invaded by ghosts. Its executive producer is Tango founder Shinji Mikami of &lt;em&gt;The Evil Within&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; fame, although it’s &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ghostwire-tokyo-everything-we-know/"&gt;supposedly less focused&lt;/a&gt; on survival horror than those games. Original &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2019/6/9/18659141/ikumi-nakamura-bethesda-e3-2019-ghostwire-tokyo-presenter"&gt;creative director Ikumi Nakamura&lt;/a&gt; stepped away from Tango soon after the initial announcement, later &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/ikumi-nakamura-talks-about-her-new-studio-while-explori-1846546822"&gt;saying she’d left&lt;/a&gt; because of health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
