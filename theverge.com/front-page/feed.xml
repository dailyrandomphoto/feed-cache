    <title>HaptX says Meta copied its patented design for haptic glove</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Reality Labs haptic glove" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PWf9YWpYpinN-0C3hP8usR7ImJs=/0x2:2000x1335/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70157001/RL___Haptic_Glove_1scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Meta Reality Labs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rveZ5m"&gt;Haptics company HaptX claims Meta (formerly Facebook) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HaptX/status/1460754319553163264"&gt;copied its patented designs&lt;/a&gt; in a glove that the tech giant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22782860/meta-facebook-reality-labs-soft-robotics-haptic-glove-prototype"&gt;revealed yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. HaptX — a longtime player in the virtual and augmented reality industry — says parts of the glove appear “substantively identical” to its own work using pneumatics to simulate physical touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btwi0x"&gt;“We welcome interest and competition in the field of microfluidic haptics; however, competition must be fair for the industry to thrive,” said HaptX founder and CEO Jake Rubin in a statement. “While we have not yet heard from Meta, we look forward to working with them to reach a fair and equitable arrangement that addresses our concerns and enables them to incorporate our innovative technology into their future consumer products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JwSS4u"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our statement on Meta's microfluidic glove prototype &lt;a href="https://t.co/v4G5LqkHsY"&gt;https://t.co/v4G5LqkHsY&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/q33BQ5D6jF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q33BQ5D6jF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— HaptX (@HaptX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HaptX/status/1460754319553163264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rC0sjD"&gt;The Meta glove is an in-progress design that won’t be commercialized for years, if ever. However, Meta Reality Labs — a VR- and AR-focused research division — believes touch is a vital piece of future consumer-focused VR / AR systems. The glove uses inflatable rubber pads and a sophisticated control system to create a sensation of pressure or resistance when users touch virtual objects. HaptX developed a similar &lt;a href="https://haptx.com/technology/"&gt;inflation-based system&lt;/a&gt; that it sells to professional clients rather than consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFZGB5"&gt;HaptX, formerly known as AxonVR, &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/axonvr-making-haptic-exoskeleton-suit-bring-body-mind-vr/"&gt;debuted publicly in 2016&lt;/a&gt; after four years in stealth mode. Meta researchers say they developed their first glove prototype in mid-2015, not long after the tech giant acquired VR startup Oculus. However, Meta has substantially expanded on its initial prototype, and HaptX claims the two companies have had extended interactions. “Over the years, we’ve hosted many engineers, researchers, and executives from Meta to demonstrate our groundbreaking haptic technology,” said Rubin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XU0SMX"&gt;Meta has been accused of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"&gt;unfairly competing against VR software developers&lt;/a&gt; by cloning their products while limiting access to the Quest platform. This situation is slightly different because HaptX is accusing Meta of direct patent infringement — something that could potentially lead to legal action. Reached for comment, HaptX declined to comment on what it would consider a fair agreement with Meta, as well as whether it might pursue a lawsuit if it fails to reach one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2mnnh"&gt;A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram to shut down Threads as Meta consolidates its messaging platforms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Threads logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T2vfL5yqs4vhJw3DcqMJJAzmeqU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70156527/acastro_190826_3618_IG_threads_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9lYCD"&gt;Instagram’s standalone messaging service Threads will cease to exist by the end of 2021, Meta has confirmed to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/instagram-will-shut-down-its-companion-app-threads-by-year-end/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The app will display a notice prompting users to return to Instagram starting November 23rd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUlsgT"&gt;Threads was a similar idea to Facebook Messenger — it allowed users to send and receive Instagram DMs in a dedicated messaging interface outside of the main app. It had a collection of quirky features, including automatic statuses that the app could set for you based on what your phone was doing. All of those tools will be available in Instagram itself by the time Threads shuts down, the company said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y7XiNU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re bringing the fun and unique features we had on Threads to the main Instagram app.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="59fwRh"&gt;Meta is also in the process of consolidating its many messaging platforms. Messenger and Instagram now both support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495068/facebook-messenger-instagram-cross-platform-messaging-integration"&gt;cross-platform messaging&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has said it intends to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197228/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-merge-messaging-services-mark-zuckerberg"&gt;incorporate WhatsApp as well&lt;/a&gt;. Threads — an app solely connected to Instagram — may make less sense the more the lines blur between Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEBcEu"&gt;But it’s also the case that not a heck of a lot of people were using Threads to begin with. The app had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21506712/instagram-threads-app-update-close-friends-direct-messaging"&gt;just over 200,000 users&lt;/a&gt; as of last year, which is a tiny percentage of Instagram’s billion-plus user base. Meta tried a number of things last year — it redesigned the app entirely and expanded its use cases from just the close friends list to all users — but it seems they weren’t enough to save it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yt0wlo"&gt;Reached for comment, Instagram spokesperson Christine Pai provided the following statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: “We know that people care about connecting with their close friends, and we’ve seen this particularly over the past few years with the growth of messaging on Instagram.” Pai added, “We’re now focusing our efforts on enhancing how you connect with close friends on Instagram, and depracating the Threads app.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KOXaf9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated November 17th, 4:36M ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from Instagram.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PlayStation boss reportedly calls out Activision Blizzard in staff memo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inside The 2020 CES Event" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Am8irxWXtxzYJzxGBvuq5Bc_ypc=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70156557/1192349807.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RUByU4"&gt;PlayStation leadership has asked Activision Blizzard how it will address the allegations in the shocking &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report about the embattled studio, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/playstation-chief-criticizes-activision-response-to-allegations"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. PlayStation boss Jim Ryan reportedly informed employees of the action in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykC4Gm"&gt;“We outreached to Activision immediately after the article was published to express our deep concern and to ask how they plan to address the claims made in the article,” Ryan wrote, reports &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “We do not believe their statements of response properly address the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwRuHy"&gt;Activision Blizzard and Sony didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. We’ve asked Microsoft and Nintendo if they have communicated concerns to Activision Blizzard.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Jmlrwd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The WSJ alleges Kotick has been aware of sexual misconduct allegations at the company for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FJ9eRa"&gt;Activision Blizzard has been under intense scrutiny for months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;the state of California filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; alleging the company created a culture of sexual harassment and discrimination. Activision Blizzard has made some changes, including ending forced arbitration and adopting a zero-tolerance harassment policy, and CEO Bobby Kotick took a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750450/activision-blizzard-ends-forced-arbitration-bobby-kotick-paycut"&gt;significant pay cut&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;WSJ’s&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; alleges that Kotick has been aware of sexual misconduct allegations at the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt; and that he has his own history of harassment and abusive behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WzCXXC"&gt;In a statement Tuesday, Activision Blizzard said the &lt;em&gt;WSJ’s&lt;/em&gt; report “presents a misleading view of Activision Blizzard and our CEO.” Kotick reiterated the company was moving forward with its zero-tolerance policy in a video to employees. And the company’s board of directors published a statement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785776/activision-blizzard-board-statement-ceo-bobby-kotick"&gt;in support of Kotick’s leadership&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gidos9"&gt;Activision Blizzard employees &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22786117/activision-blizzard-walk-out-bobby-kotick-resignation-demands"&gt;walked out on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in response to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ’s&lt;/em&gt; report. A group of Activision Blizzard shareholders representing a small portion of the company’s total shares has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787484/activision-blizzard-shareholders-demand-ceo-bobby-kotick-resignation"&gt;demanded Kotick’s resignation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wyze Buds Pro review: budget Bluetooth buds worth buying</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;My Amazon pods are headed to the recycler&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="if0XJo"&gt;Wyze has built a reputation for astonishingly affordable gadgets. Sure, they don’t always knock it out of the park: while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/19/17029516/wyzecam-v2-security-camera-price"&gt;the company’s $20 security cam&lt;/a&gt; put an entire industry on notice, we ultimately decided &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21726548/wyze-watch-44-47-smartwatch-price-release-date-features"&gt;the barebones $20 Wyze Watch&lt;/a&gt; was too much a work-in-progress to give it a review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KY6J1O"&gt;But this May, I took a chance on the new Wyze Buds Pro, a $74 pair of wireless earbuds, and couldn’t believe how good they are. They offer true active noise cancellation and wireless charging at a previously unheard-of price while &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; punching way above their weight in audio quality. I put them head-to-head against the $80 Jabra Elite 3, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676362/jabra-elite-3-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;which we recently praised for nailing the essentials&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn’t even a competition: I’d pick the Wyze Buds Pro every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjyAJj"&gt;Well, except for exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ebqoDj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10871303"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rObzyz"&gt;It’s tempting to compare the Wyze Buds Pro to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;. They certainly look similar — pod-shaped earbuds with offset silicone tips and long stems, housed in almost identically sized pill-shaped charging cases, with LED indicator dots up front and the same exposed metal hinge on the backside. Heck, they almost make the same &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; flipping open and closed. You can almost hear Wyze marketers whispering: “Why would you pay three times as much for Apple?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SJ6ZekUwU8wdS134DDZc7hKk_Ls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23022563/shollister_4884_20211117.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The metal hinge, in particular, seems to work identically.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TnY-gWF-vj4hZ-vgcWsjPAdzlSM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23022562/shollister_4884_20211117_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wyze Buds Pro vs. Apple AirPods Pro &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vXRTDX"&gt;That’s not a fair comparison, though. The AirPods automatically pair to Apple devices, offer spatial audio tricks, and sound a bit better on balance (Apple’s sound is not as clear but is less harsh). I’m not talking about Apple when I say the Wyze Buds Pro punch way above their weight, much less class-leading earbuds like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;. I’m talking about the entire rest of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QI3kOV"&gt;At the time I ordered them in May, I couldn’t find a single other product with both noise canceling &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; wireless charging for under $100, much less $74. Previously, I owned a pair of first-gen Amazon Echo Buds, which originally cost $130 with neither of those features and a last-gen Micro USB charging port. And yet, those Echo Buds were themselves &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937559/amazon-echo-buds-wireless-earbuds-review-features-bose-noise-reduction-price"&gt;considered aggressively priced just two years ago&lt;/a&gt; for managing to fit Bose noise reduction and always-on Alexa access for that much money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgdJ6A"&gt;But after a single day with the Wyze Buds Pro, I was ready to throw my Amazon pods in the battery recycling can.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YdD-slEMWF3hBprTbJJ3kEpWtBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23020485/shollister_211109_4884_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Hi, it’s me, Sean, shooting a sideways selfie during the pandemic with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/5/22216064/iphone-vlogging-video-apple-watch-viewfinder" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;an Apple Watch as a viewfinder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AK4WQp"&gt;It’s the clarity. Even as my favorite songs layer on instrument after instrument, I can make out the &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt;, lyrics which can generally feel a tad drowned out by the mix. This audio is &lt;em&gt;sharp&lt;/em&gt;, sometimes even to a fault: the snazzy processed sound can make the Wyze Buds Pro’s highs too tinny in songs that heavily rely on electronics. (When I finished &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fchvrches%2Fasking-for-a-friend%3Fin%3Dchvrches%2Fsets%2Fscreen-violence-1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22787814%2Fwyze-buds-pro-review-earbuds-headphones-audio-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chvrches’ excellent new album &lt;em&gt;Screen Violence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; I was very ready to give my ears a rest.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="990uXh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10871279"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W5KgTA"&gt;But when I tried on the $80 Jabra Elite 3, or the OG Echo Buds, or even my Steelseries Arctis Pro Wireless, I couldn’t believe how much muddier my other headsets sounded — how much mud it felt the Wyze Buds Pro had removed from my ears. I could pick out instruments with ease, even ones that aren’t supposed to be there; the clink of silverware during &lt;a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/gravity/373177616?i=373177625"&gt;a live recording of Vienna Teng&lt;/a&gt;, for example. You also get a remarkable amount of bass for true wireless buds, even without the bass boost feature turned on. Despite the fatiguing highs, I still cranked up the volume to revel in the clear mids and deep, booming lows when I went out each evening for my daily walk. (The mic is not particularly good, but callers told me I sounded fine.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSmOGa"&gt;Walking is about as far as I’d trust these as a pair of exercise headphones, though. I admit my ears are finicky about buds of all kinds, but there’s no question the Wyze Buds Pro are designed to fit loosely, held in only by the slight pressure of an oval silicone eartip up front and the way your ear (hopefully) cups the glossy smooth plastic pod around back. They threatened to fall out more than once when I tried anything as brisk as a jog, the right one gets a little looser when I chew, and I did drop them several times trying to put them in, including right under my cramped seat (twice) on a long flight to NYC. That wasn’t a problem with the Jabra, whose beefy round eartips and sculpted shape felt locked into my ears.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/anOwM9QdvDiaSpmH9JfExO0nDxw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23020486/shollister_211109_4884_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;They’re a fairly loose fit in my ears, though not as loose as Apple’s third-gen AirPods. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTjCx6"&gt;And while Wyze’s noise cancellation held up admirably on the flight, deadening that jet-engine sound quite a bit, I have no idea why the company advertises “wind noise reduction” for your music — even walking in a light breeze buffets the noise-canceling microphones enough to ruin my music. It also doesn’t help that Wyze expects you to carefully stab a tiny touch-sensitive spot on the top of the stem a precise number of times to skip tracks, change the volume, or summon a voice assistant. I wound up using my phone or smartwatch for all of that, ignoring the buttons except when I wanted to switch to Wyze’s transparency mode to pipe more of the world around me. Again, not optimal for exercise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5SXWIT"&gt;The other kind of person who probably shouldn’t buy the Wyze Buds Pro is the constant listener, someone who depends on music all day. With noise canceling on and the volume and bass cranked up the way I like, I saw a little over three hours of use on a charge. That’s not great. But it also wasn’t a problem for me: I tend to put them back in the case after an album or a podcast or a long evening walk, and the battery case charges them quickly: I saw 20 percent in the tank after 12 minutes, 65 percent after 20 minutes, and they were fully charged when I checked back an hour later. I was able to stay away from a charger for two whole weeks of casual use, racking up 15 hours and 42 minutes of total battery life during that time. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DL08gq76Mfn_J2CcZSjBIz7wkRM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23020480/shollister_211109_4884_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I like that they don’t have any visible logos sticking out of my ears. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8WmW1R"&gt;Sure, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;the class-leading $278 Sony XM4s&lt;/a&gt; can go eight hours on a charge with ANC on and 24 hours with their charging case... but for now, for $74, I’m satisfied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Bsld1M"&gt;Recently, I’ve heard that Wyze may not be the only game in town anymore for inexpensive quality earbuds with true active noise canceling, wireless charging, and USB-C — reviewers are saying good things about the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Cancelling-Wireless-Charging-Sleeping/dp/B093SLWMS7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$80 Anker SoundCore Life P3&lt;/a&gt; as well, which come with a notably less pocketable case but also offer a lot more battery life in exchange. Maybe I’ll try that next. Or maybe I’ll wait a couple more years and see if we experience yet another dramatic improvement in Bluetooth value for money. Here’s hoping the next wave comes with multipoint audio to connect to two devices at a time. Even the top-shelf Sonys don’t have that on lock.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fisker’s electric Ocean SUV has a rotating center screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mkku43RbeA5HG1Sr2ym2XIpYBQk=/71x0:569x332/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70156474/fisker_ocean_screen.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OJlSci"&gt;EV startup Fisker Inc. has revealed the production version of its first electric vehicle, the Ocean SUV, at the 2021 LA Auto Show. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21050802/fisker-ocean-electric-suv-solar-roof-range-price-ces-2020"&gt;largely similar to the first prototype that debuted at the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show&lt;/a&gt;, though there are a few new standout features — including a 17.1-inch touchscreen that rotates from portrait to landscape orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O477EW"&gt;“When you use your phone and type on it, you hold it like this, and when you take a picture or if you want to watch a movie, you turn the phone around,” Fisker Inc. founder and CEO Henrik Fisker said while miming a phone during a livestream of Wednesday’s event. “In our vehicle we have a screen, on a push of a button, it changes from portrait mode to landscape mode. It just rotates. That is a really cool feature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djiV7c"&gt;Fisker didn’t elaborate any further on why a rotating touchscreen the size of a small TV may be useful. But buyers who want it will have to pony up $68,999, because it’s only available on the top trim — the aggressively named Fisker Ocean Extreme — or the limited-edition launch version of the SUV (which is more or less the same as the top trim). The screen defaults to portrait orientation; the 17.1-inch screen in the lower trims doesn’t rotate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="g5ciGh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That is a really cool feature.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QnTXjg"&gt;Also locked to the top trim of the Ocean is the solar roof — a feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21050802/fisker-ocean-electric-suv-solar-roof-range-price-ces-2020"&gt;that was touted in the original prototype&lt;/a&gt;. Fisker Inc. says the panels will be able to capture enough energy from the sun to power up to 1,500 miles of driving per year. (Fine print on the company’s website says this assumes that the system is operating at 5.4kWh per square meter.) Ocean Extreme buyers get a better sound system, front and rear heated seats, and a few other exclusive features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3S8u2e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10871331"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6UC64N"&gt;The middle trim, the Ocean Ultra, will cost $49,999, while the base Ocean Sport runs $37,499. Fisker says it will offer an all-inclusive flexible lease option for the Ocean Sport that costs $379 per month (with a $2,999 “initiation and activation fee”) and has a 30,000-mile annual driving limit. All three trims will come with the advanced driver assistance system Fisker Inc. is developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnbsVg"&gt;Performance-wise, Fisker Inc. claims the Ocean Sport will get around 250 miles of range. The company is working with Chinese battery supplier CATL to put lithium iron phosphate batteries in the Sport — similar to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/20/tesla-switching-to-lfp-batteries-in-all-standard-range-cars.html"&gt;what Tesla is starting to do with its shorter-range cars&lt;/a&gt;. The Ocean Sport takes the power from that battery pack and sends it to just a single motor at the front of the car with 275 horsepower at its peak. Still, Fisker Inc. claims it will go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 6.9 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDmqY0"&gt;The Ocean Ultra and Ocean Extreme both use a pack built with lithium-manganese-cobalt-oxide batteries that can stretch the range to 340 miles and 350 miles, respectively, Fisker Inc. claims. That’s despite those two trims being outfitted with an all-wheel drive setup that uses two electric motors. The dual-motor setup on the Ocean Ultra will generate up to 540 horsepower and can hit 60 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds, while the Ocean Extreme’s touches 550HP and clears 60 miles per hour in 3.6 seconds. Both versions offer torque vectoring, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="XsSk5n"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There will be three versions of the Ocean SUV&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T99k1w"&gt;“This is the most advanced powertrain I think in the world right now,” Fisker said onstage Wednesday. “I’ve actually driven this on a track — an early prototype — and you can drive about 10 miles [per hour] faster than you even think is possible ... you will actually experience that you feel like a Formula One driver when you drive this vehicle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpuLZp"&gt;Fisker Inc. says all three versions of the Ocean will be able to charge other electric cars or an owner’s home, part of the startup’s larger mission of promoting clean energy. That larger mission includes using recycled materials in the Ocean’s interior, relying on hydro power at the plant where the SUV will be built and the solar panels on the top trim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6rkFu"&gt;The final version of the Ocean revealed Wednesday is what will get built late next year by Austrian automotive supplier Magna, as Fisker Inc. is taking an extraordinarily asset-light approach to being an automaker. Instead of owning and operating its own factory, Fisker Inc. will lean on Magna and, for other future models, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298878/foxconn-fisker-ev-electric-vehicle-wisconsin-deal-fsr-suv"&gt;Foxconn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71yYZx"&gt;That asset-light approach arguably helped Fisker Inc. survive long enough to bask in the SPAC-merger boom, which helped it raise more than $1 billion. The startup was close to running out of cash in early 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22526209/fisker-electric-popemobile-papal-transport-ocean-suv-vatican"&gt;according to a lawsuit from its former marketing VP&lt;/a&gt;, and it had wound up in that position after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22279995/fisker-inc-electric-vehicle-interview-solid-state-batteries-ocean-suv-spac"&gt;pivoting away from solid state batteries and a fancy, expensive sports car&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kia’s EV9 concept car is a big, boxy vision of our electric future</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AG8wOofkC3-QDDm1L5q3Ry5f7YE=/0x0:6192x4128/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70156470/18205_Concept_EV9.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vBZxLx"&gt;Kia revealed the EV9 SUV, an extra-large concept EV with Soul-like angularity and an estimated range of up to 300 miles. Like the previously unveiled EV6, the EV9 will be built on Hyundai’s new Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP) that the automaker says will serve as the basis for an entire family of planned EVs. The concept made its debut at the 2021 Los Angeles Auto Show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8wi2B"&gt;The EV9 may have the angles of a Soul, but it has the body of a Telluride. The concept SUV measures 194 inches in length, 81 inches in width, 70 inches in height, and has a wheelbase of 122 inches. That’s taller, longer, and wider than the Kia Telluride and certainly would fall into the category of “dangerously huge SUVs” if it ever gets made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q9368P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The EV9 may have the angles of a Soul, but it has the body of a Telluride&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tSZw3"&gt;With the automaker calling this the “clearest signal yet” as to what is coming from Kia’s future lineup of EVs, it’s a good bet that some version of the EV9 makes it into production. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ncr7SGZKEj1kFF_LtgvdBMvg8GI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23022507/18195_Concept_EV9.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ThEabU"&gt;E-GMP is Hyundai’s scalable electric architecture that underpins the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"&gt;Ioniq 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357654/kia-ev6-revealed-specs-photos-electric-car-release-date"&gt;Kia EV6&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/genesis/gv60"&gt;Genesis GV60&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the recently unveiled (and equally ginormous) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787672/hyundai-seven-electric-suv-concept-la-auto-show-2021"&gt;Hyundai Seven concept&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the EV6’s refreshingly modest footprint, the EV9 seems primed to win over Telluride and Cadillac Escalade customers with its aggressive dimensions and copious interior space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jOK7Z2"&gt;That means it’ll also have the same 800-volt architecture as those other EVs, allowing it to accept DC fast charging at speeds up to 350 kilowatts. Like the Hyundai Seven, Kia says the EV9’s battery can charge from 10–80 percent in 20 to 30 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PMM48"&gt;The Kia EV9 sports a reinterpretation of the automaker’s nose grille, which it calls its “iconic Tiger Face facade.” Cars without dirty internal combustion engines don’t necessarily need a grille. But automakers are having a difficult time transitioning away from criteria built around the function and needs of an ICE and toward one without those same requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fPnKigagF6G9JTmjA1JWpA8T6c4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23022619/18232_Concept_EV9.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LaCrjc"&gt;Kia is going in the Tesla direction by getting rid of the traditional grille and opting for “a full body colored front that clearly conveys sustainability values.” In other words, it’s a virtue-signaling snout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tnLjq3"&gt;Despite its boxy shape, Kia said it was “inspired by water.” That wasn’t a reference to the shape, though, but rather the exterior and interior color pallet. Kia describes the exterior paint as mimicking the “expansive depth of the ocean,” while the interior color choices are as “clear blue” as the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XXOHIh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Despite its boxy shape, Kia said it was “inspired by water”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h1yFhj"&gt;The interior is dominated by a 27-inch central touchscreen, which is about as wide as it gets in SUVs today. And the steering wheel, while not a full yoke like the Tesla Model S Plaid, is definitely more yoke-ish than a wheel. Kia calls it a “pop-up steering pad,” but it’s unclear from the renderings what purpose the shape serves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SWRvR1"&gt;Kia won’t confirm whether the EV9 will make it into production, but it seems highly likely, given the South Korean automaker’s commitment to release seven dedicated battery electrics by the end of 2027 and to sell half a million battery cars annually by 2026. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If your iPhone 12 or 13 is having issues with calls, updating iOS may help</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13, in pink." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hzOzZiGzLh0VtWA7ztijbsr3KgM=/0x0:2019x1346/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70156363/vpavic_210916_4760_0069.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p8Gk5O"&gt;A new iOS update is starting to hit phones — no, not the seemingly feature-packed iOS 15.2, but iOS 15.1.1, which Apple says will solve an issue with calls dropping. According to the update note, the new version of iOS “improves call drop performance on iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 models.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWdorh"&gt;While we haven’t seen large amounts of users complaining about their new-model iPhones dropping more calls than normal, it’s nice to see that Apple is paying attention to how its phones perform as, well, phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OWl7X5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;15.1.1 is worth updating to if you’ve been having issues with calls dropping&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="igyTso"&gt;You can update to iOS 15.1.1 by going to Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Software Update. If you find updating to be a pain and haven’t been experiencing any call issues, though, it may be best to just wait for iOS 15.2 — the beta has been absolutely packed with features, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778650/apple-iphone-13-pro-beta-macro-mode-button-auto-switching"&gt;improvements to the iPhone 13 Pro’s macro mode&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22749352/apple-app-privacy-report-ios-15-2-beta-feature"&gt;addition of the App Privacy Report&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774124/ios-15-2-beta-2-airtag-tracker-scan-privacy-invasion"&gt;manually scan for suspicious AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, and more. That update seems to be coming soon, so waiting to go through the update process would be understandable, especially given that Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222"&gt;not reporting any major security patches in 15.1.1.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Withings’ ScanWatch takes an extra step to start using its EKG</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bZw95knh35qcRj46887pkVZYHo4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70156305/akrales_200916_4186_0036.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9LgKrv"&gt;In order to use the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22772984/withings-scanwatch-blood-oxygen-sleep-apnea-watch-fda"&gt;EKG feature on the newly available Withings ScanWatch&lt;/a&gt;, people have to first get the tool unlocked through a prescription from a healthcare provider — a first for EKG-enabled smartwatches on the market. Other smartwatches like the Apple Watch let people start using the feature right out of the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsNtCc"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407741101457-ScanWatch-Frequently-asked-questions-about-ECG-US-users-only-"&gt;requirement&lt;/a&gt; was part of Withings’ Food and Drug Administration authorization, &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf20/K201456.pdf"&gt;which says&lt;/a&gt; that the device can track heart rhythms and detect atrial fibrillation “when the monitor is prescribed or used under the care of a physician.” The extra step of obtaining a prescription came out of the company’s initial conversations with the agency, Shikha Anand, Withings’ chief medical officer, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ebBmW"&gt;“We don’t imagine that will be true for in perpetuity or even for very long,” she says. “This is really around sort of satisfying our needs” of the initial launch.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xV22gF"&gt;Withings has partnered with the telehealth platform Heartbeat Health to give out those prescriptions. When someone takes their first EKG reading with the ScanWatch, Withings’ app batches the recording off to Heartbeat, which matches the user with a cardiologist in their state. The cardiologist then reviews the reading and can unlock the full EKG tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ece3P0HSnk8CIqbAElm_fxRbWMs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23022530/IMG_2047.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Victoria Song&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ScanWatch requires a healthcare provider review before the EKG feature is turned on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B77iID"&gt;The providers at Heartbeat Health review the EKG and give the users information on what it showed — like whether it was normal or if it showed any signs of atrial fibrillation. In some cases, if the reading was unclear (like if someone was moving around too much), they might ask the user to take another EKG, Anand says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vMRVl"&gt;But there aren’t really any situations where the Heartbeat Health provider &lt;em&gt;wouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; give a user a prescription and unlock full access to the EKG. The only restriction is around age, says Jana Goldberg, the Medical Director at Heartbeat Health — the feature is only available to people over 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8AyGk"&gt;Otherwise, the review is more to make sure that the recording looks like an EKG recording should, not necessarily to make any sort of medical determination about the user, Anand says. She told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the external review reflected the company’s focus on quality and scientific credibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfJAEd"&gt;“We really wanted that added layer of quality control,” she says. “And that added layer of quality control comes with a person — that is still the gold standard.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BuMBUY"&gt;Still, the company has already filed with the FDA to get clearance for a version of the device that wouldn’t need users to get that that third-party review, Anand told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3GSqr"&gt;Withings hopes to build out a more comprehensive relationship with Heartbeat Health that could let users talk to providers about their heart health, Anand says. Heartbeat Health also sees the relationship as a step towards their expansion into working with wearable device makers, Goldberg says: “This is probably the first step in terms of the clinical-consumer device partnerships.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Heated seats for 2022 Chevy trucks are the latest victim of the chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7D8Vj8"&gt;If you’re looking to buy a 2022 Chevrolet (or nearly any GM vehicle) this winter, you might want to invest in a warmer pair of sweatpants: the company has announced that due to the ongoing chip shortage, it’ll no longer be able to offer heated or ventilated seats on virtually all its upcoming SUVs and pickups, &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/gm-removes-popular-heated-seats-option-much-lineup-due-chip-shortage"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ci1MRQ"&gt;“By taking these measures, it will enable continued production and delivery of inventory to help respond to the strong customer and dealer demand for all our products as the industry continues to rebound and strengthen,” a letter to dealers from GM obtained by &lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt; reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYz0sq"&gt;The change went into effect earlier this week on November 15th and affects a wide range of Chevy and GMC vehicles. As one &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chevyknowhow/video/7030921030700993798?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"&gt;Chevy dealer explained on TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, virtually all 2022 SUVs and trucks — barring a few high-end trims — won’t be getting heated seats anymore. Seat warmers aren’t the only feature to be impacted, either: heated steering wheels are set to get the axe on November 22nd on most models, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4lfL48"&gt;&lt;q&gt;No heated seats or steering wheels on most models&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cydcCU"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/heated-seats-steering-wheel-general-motors-chip-shortage-chevy-buick-cadillac-gmc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roadshow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, GM says that the change is intended to be “temporary” as it tries to wrangle more chips but is expected to impact the entire 2022 model year. Buyers will instead get credit towards their new car of $150 to $500 to make up for the missing feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5lF8S"&gt;The lack of heated seats is one of the more tangible impacts of the chip shortage on cars yet and speaks to just how important chips are to modern cars — even for features like seat warmers, which you wouldn’t necessarily be particularly reliant on semiconductor technology. It’s the latest in a &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/g38179550/new-cars-tech-features-missing-chip-shortage/"&gt;series of issues with chips for automakers&lt;/a&gt;, which have also seen some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765709/bmw-chip-shortage-touchscreen-car-suv-manufacturing"&gt;BWM models recently remove touchscreens&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/13/22780037/tesla-reportedly-shipping-cars-without-usb-ports"&gt;Teslas lose USB ports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2RBRV"&gt;It’s not all bad news, though: in the same announcement to dealers, GM also noted that thanks to better supplies of chips, it was able to bring back digital temperature displays, side blind spot alerts, and its Super Cruise driver-assist technology — three features that it was forced to remove earlier in the year due to supply shortages. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says it’s improving fingerprint scanner performance with a Pixel 6 update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uN_XFSCdx54aHN63T8GT35iSso4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70156269/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qnscZx"&gt;Google quietly rolled out a Pixel 6 update that addresses fingerprint scanner issues, as first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pixel-6-november-update-fingerprint-bug-fixed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The update details have been confirmed in a post on a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/135866170/november-software-update-for-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-us-and-japan-only-selected-carriers"&gt;Google Support page,&lt;/a&gt; which vaguely notes that it includes “minor bug fixes and some fingerprint sensor performance improvements for Pixel 6 and 6 Pro,” without really giving us any details about how the sensor was improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9NzPW"&gt;Dan Siefert called out the fingerprint reader in our reviews of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro last month&lt;/a&gt;, noting that it’s often finicky to use or slow to recognize your print. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/7/22768853/google-explains-pixel-6-fingerprint-scanner-unreliable"&gt;Google responded&lt;/a&gt; by saying that the scanner’s “enhanced security algorithms” may result in sluggish or unreliable performance. Google never really indicated whether the scanner’s performance had something to do with issues in the device’s software or hardware, and its initial response implied that the scanner was supposed to be slow for its security features to work properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y1ts1F"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jPm4ouSR_NI?rel=0&amp;amp;start=288" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LANtM2"&gt;But now that Google has rolled out an update, the issue might be software-related after all. To see if the update actually made a difference, I asked some of my colleagues at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;about their experiences with the fingerprint scanner after downloading the Pixel 6 update. Here are our findings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="G6OY1P"&gt;I haven’t noticed a difference in the scanning, but it seems like it’s making me use my fingerprint less to unlock the phone. —Richard Lawler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUQj0P"&gt;I think the fingerprint reader does work better — I never had trouble with the left thumb, but the right thumb always took two or three tries, and now it seems to work pretty quickly. —Barbara Krasnoff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbN0jN"&gt;It’s certainly not so much faster (or more accurate?). But even best case, it’s still slower than an S20. —Dieter Bohn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X2GE4n"&gt;Overall, the results of the Pixel 6 update are a mixed bag. It seems like it offers &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; improvement, but it still doesn’t put it on par with fingerprint scanners from other companies. Reactions from users on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/qvg2nz/google_releases_surprise_pixel_6_november_update/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; offer the same kind of varied results; while &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/qvg2nz/comment/hkxbxai/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;some say&lt;/a&gt; the update fixed the problem, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/qvg2nz/comment/hkyc83e/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;others say&lt;/a&gt; the difference is there, but only slightly. It’s unclear whether the update to the fingerprint scanner will be the last of its kind or if Google has another one planned in the future. Then again, the issue may be related to the fact that Google decided to use an under-the-screen optical scanner instead of an ultrasonic one — and in that case, Pixel 6 owners may be stuck with the issue. For now, the sensor seems to be &lt;em&gt;just good enough&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baH1vl"&gt;Google says that the update — which consists of two software builds: one for Verizon-specific devices (SD1A.210817.037.A1) and one for international models (SD1A.210817.037)  — has started rolling out today and will “continue over the next week.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41vb7N"&gt;It’s also worth noting that while the update is just 14.56MB, Google says it takes about 25 to 30 minutes to download and install depending on the number of apps you have, which my colleagues can also attest to. The update will be available to you in November if your device is on any of the major wireless carriers in the US or Japan, including AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Google Fi. You can view the full list of carriers on &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/135866170/november-software-update-for-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-us-and-japan-only-selected-carriers"&gt;Google’s website&lt;/a&gt;. If your carrier isn’t listed, the update will be pushed to your device in December.&lt;/p&gt;
