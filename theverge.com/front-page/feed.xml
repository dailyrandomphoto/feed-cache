    <title>Here are all the AirTag accessories we know about </title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fYC-sV9f26gLYdwC4ya5f937KLY=/821x0:2261x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159412/airtag_accessories_header_202104.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="afQCgp"&gt;The Apple AirTags &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;have finally been announced&lt;/a&gt;, and with them come a ton of accessories to make them easier to use (so much easier than if it had, say, a built-in way to attach it to things). While a small tracking puck could be carried in a bag, there are a variety of other things that you may want to put an AirTag on that require some sort of holder or the judicious use of tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aibtVD"&gt;These are all the accessories we could find that are either listed for preorder on the maker’s site or have a page on Apple’s store. We don’t have official ship dates for most of them, but it’s probably a safe bet that the ones on the Apple Store will become available when the AirTags do, on April 30th. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Belkin’s AirTag holder. Tie it to anything!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pAbwNc"&gt;Belkin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RWmQC6"&gt;Belkin currently has two offerings, a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHNPR2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-secure-holder-with-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D4a11a0f92a3f82e2bc68e69e973caa245ea296126f6a1dea5da19b97d0d9b65242da69bc60433105cb23b3dcbfae194c6018f7a0e0a92d0ee1a81f4dc9a5d78ffd2ec296ae3f8902c56b9bb67e4de40bd67223cf08e2e2b4ddc7c848f910584ae10043f1f735c80aea4750706def61ce&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;key ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHNPX2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-secure-holder-with-strap%3Ffnode%3D4a11a0f92a3f82e2bc68e69e973caa245ea296126f6a1dea5da19b97d0d9b65242da69bc60433105cb23b3dcbfae194c6018f7a0e0a92d0ee1a81f4dc9a5d78ffd2ec296ae3f8902c56b9bb67e4de40bd67223cf08e2e2b4ddc7c848f910584ae10043f1f735c80aea4750706def61ce&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a strap&lt;/a&gt;, which both sell for $12.95. Both products have a circular holder for the AirTag and come in white, black, blue, and pink. They’re currently listed as unavailable in Apple’s online store and as “coming soon” on Belkin’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ACO1OVMfOG9bRTqGaMafFuiVKRI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457922/7245bb43_16cd_47d2_9cb4_94bc7f177b9a.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nomad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I genuinely love this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lTlcNk"&gt;Nomad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="678fYv"&gt;Nomad also offers its take on &lt;a href="https://www.pjtra.com/t/8-10090-88849-119386?sid=VergAirTag042121&amp;amp;website=309942&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtags-leather-keychain" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a keychain&lt;/a&gt;, but (characteristically) its version is a leather pouch that encases the AirTag. The company also has &lt;a href="https://www.gopjn.com/t/8-10090-88849-119386?sid=VergAirTag042121&amp;amp;website=309942&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtags-glasses-strap" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a glasses strap&lt;/a&gt;, which acts both as a strap to keep your glasses handy and as an AirTag holder in case you manage to misplace them. Both are listed for $39.95 but are marked down to $29.95 if you preorder, which you are able to do now on Nomad’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8DcdqCayePsBxP8zc6ye9XhXgWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457915/detail_airtags_rugged_armor_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Spigen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spigen’s rugged AirTag case. Maybe you could attach it to your rock climbing gear?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XGObNE"&gt;Cyrill / Spigen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IwxThP"&gt;Cyrill is offering a &lt;a href="https://www.cyrill.com/collections/airtag/products/black-airtag?variant=36909671776414"&gt;vegan leather keychain accessory&lt;/a&gt; in two colors, black and “stone” (which is a light gray). It costs $19.99 and seems to be available now. Spigen, Cyrill’s parent company, is also offering its own AirTag cases: a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spigen.com%2Fcollections%2Fapple-keynote%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-case-valentinus%3Fvariant%3D32709738725423&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;keychain accessory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spigen.com%2Fcollections%2Fapple-keynote%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-case-rugged-armor%3Fvariant%3D32709737971759&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a ruggedized case&lt;/a&gt; with a hefty clip connector (and what appears to be a bottle opener, though it’s not listed as a feature). Both are $24.99 — the keychain is available to order today, and the rugged case is available for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the bag charm. I dare you to put it on a Gucci or Louis purse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kuvoxz"&gt;Hermès&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5fM4hd"&gt;Apple has a history with Hermès; the French luxury company made some jaw-droppingly expensive Apple Watch bands. True to form, the Apple Store lists a leather &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX872AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;key ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX8A2AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-luggage-tag%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;luggage tag&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX862AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-bag-charm%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bag charm&lt;/a&gt; made by Hermès — costing $349, $449, and $299 respectively. It is worth noting, though, that the accessories do include an AirTag with a custom “Hermès” engraving, so you can flex while you find. The key ring and bag charm come in orange, brown, and what looks like black but is listed as “bleu indigo.” The luggage tag is currently only shown in brown. Like Belkin’s offerings, they are currently unavailable through the Apple Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="p5SyxI"&gt;Apple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pqFTWr"&gt;Of course, Apple offers its own first-party accessories.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hard-shell version is meant for drones, bike seats, luggage, and the like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ndRFmc"&gt;Moment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WmqR6X"&gt;Moment, known for making add-on lenses for your phone, is now making some interesting AirTag accessories: they’re little patches, in a variety of materials, that let you discreetly stick an AirTag places, whether that’s on the inside of a backpack, jacket, bike seat, etc. The mounts are available for pre-order today, with the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fstretch-fabric-mount-for-airtags%2Fstretch-fabric-mount-for-airtags&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fabric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fcurved-surface-mount-for-airtags%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;curved-surface&lt;/a&gt; mounts costing $14.99 and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fhard-shell-mount-for-airtags%2F%23productImage1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hard-shell&lt;/a&gt; mount costing $19.99.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: dbrand&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It looks like an evil red eye, which dbrand would probably appreciate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Jk00Y1"&gt;dbrand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="B4yP8n"&gt;Device-customization company dbrand &lt;a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/apple-airtag-skins"&gt;is offering pre-orders for its skins&lt;/a&gt; (which sounds very creepy, without context) that allow users to change the color of their AirTags. A pack that allows you to add a dot of color to the front and back of the tracker will cost $4.95, and comes with dbrand’s promise to “make your tiny frisbee look and feel like it’s worth the four full-sized frisbees that your $29 could have bought instead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxKfm0"&gt;The company is also creating a case, which adds the much-needed (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;or not, depending on who you ask&lt;/a&gt;) lanyard loop that Apple left off the AirTags. The case is available for pre-order, includes a lanyard loop, and costs $15 — there’s also a $19.95 pack &lt;a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/grip/apple-airtag-cases"&gt;that also includes a skin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ENSzYI"&gt;Everybody else &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CeOHhl"&gt;Of course, with how long AirTags have been rumored, there were some manufacturers that wanted to get a head start with their accessories.

    <title>Disney inks a huge Sony deal to bring Spider-Man and other films to Disney Plus and Hulu</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rOLcX8CHnWx5PdaDVmIMDu7Ps6M=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69166381/SpiderHaal.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Sony Pictures Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yeoaDF"&gt;Disney and Sony Pictures have signed a multi-year “content licensing agreement” that will bring new Sony theatrical releases, starting with its 2022 films, to Disney-owned platforms. The deal also gives Disney the rights to many of Sony’s older films, including &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; titles — meaning that movies starring the web-slinger, which are notably absent from Disney Plus’ collection of Marvel films, could eventually make their way to the streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuEnFE"&gt;Sony’s theatrical releases from 2022 through 2026 are included in the deal, and Disney will get access to them following their “Pay 1 TV window.” Starting in 2022, that window, which follows a film’s theatrical and home video runs, will be owned by Netflix, thanks to a deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373997/sony-pictures-movies-netflix-starz-pay-one-window-streaming-deal"&gt;announced earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. (That means new Sony films will hit theaters first, then paid rentals and purchases, then Netflix, and then finally head over to Disney platforms, possibly including Disney Plus.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUj2O2"&gt;So even though Disney and Sony’s deal means that Disney won’t have new &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; films right after their theatrical runs, the company will get to include them in its streaming catalogue over the long term — something that Disney arguably values more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxBPVh"&gt;Giving people access to yet another set of movies in its ever-growing collection of Marvel properties could give people more reason to subscribe to Disney Plus. The company continues to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22231578/wandavision-marvel-studios-disney-plus-streaming-characters-mcu-audience"&gt;connect the many Marvel films and shows to each other&lt;/a&gt; so you’ll always want to watch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22229076/wandavision-marvel-studios-disney-plus-streaming-loki-falcon-winter-solider-black-widow-theatrical"&gt;the next new MCU thing&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s continuing to invest heavily in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394275/emilia-clarke-olivia-colman-marvel-secret-invasion-disney-plus"&gt;courting big names for future series&lt;/a&gt; to give you even more reasons to keep your subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEPolr"&gt;That all said, if &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; films do make their way to Disney Plus, that won’t make Disney’s infinity gauntlet of films complete: 2008’s &lt;em&gt;The Incredible Hulk&lt;/em&gt; (the one starring Edward Norton as the Hulk) would still not be available on the service. Unless Disney strikes some sort of deal with Universal, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Gzzq8"&gt;Other Sony Pictures properties, such as &lt;em&gt;Jumanji&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hotel Transylvania&lt;/em&gt;, are also included in the deal, according to a press release. Disney’s Hulu will also have access to “a significant number of library titles” as soon as this June, according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Capcom’s Resident Evil 4 VR remake launches later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7yottfu6J-YKOPo1ZxBM_WjjMlM=/40x0:1405x910/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69166374/Screen_Shot_2021_04_15_at_6.52.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Capcom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IlnUy8"&gt;Facebook Reality Labs has offered more detail about a virtual reality remake of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;, following Capcom’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386496/resident-evil-4-vr-remake-oculus-quest-2-announced"&gt;original announcement last week&lt;/a&gt;. The game will launch later this year exclusively on Facebook’s Oculus Quest 2 headset, although the exact date is still a mystery. As Capcom’s first trailer indicated, it’s a first-person VR adaptation of the 2005 third-person game, with a focus on making weapons and movement feel more natural with Oculus Touch motion controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oR87r6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; for VR uses the game’s original levels and animations, revamped with remastered textures, and Oculus says cutscenes will be rendered “in their original format.” But developer Armature Studio has added VR-friendly locomotion options like the ability to teleport or walk around a room-scale environment, in addition to using Touch controller analog sticks. You physically pick up weapons and items from the environment, and you can equip different weapons for each hand. The game’s enemies will also attack in ways that are optimized around first-person combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bAEbAB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bu7vJYpakPU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ywAXlE"&gt;These additions evoke features popular in other VR first-person shooters like &lt;em&gt;Arizona Sunshine, &lt;/em&gt;whose creator Vertigo also released a new trailer for its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Ffrom-the-creators-of-arizona-sunshine-after-the-fall-brings-four-player-co-op-action-to-vr-in-summer-2021%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;upcoming cooperative game&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;After the Fall&lt;/em&gt; today. The &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; remake is part of &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/oculus-gaming-showcase/"&gt;a larger slate of upcoming VR games&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6BPFNxv8jQ"&gt;a sequel to the original Oculus Rift title &lt;em&gt;Lone Echo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that’s launching this summer, as well as a horror stealth game called &lt;em&gt;Wraith: The Oblivion – Afterlife&lt;/em&gt;, which will launch tomorrow on Oculus Quest and Rift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="260xge"&gt;Capcom previously made &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt; playable on PlayStation VR, but this is the first full-length &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil &lt;/em&gt;game designed for VR. &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; is also the first Quest 2 app that won’t be playable on the original Oculus Quest. Oculus required all launch titles for the Quest 2 to be compatible with its predecessor, but it left the door open for an exclusive game that required the extra power of a newer headset — and &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; is apparently that game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QJ9cyi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_FJFnm9PCfY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The US has a long way to go to make up for its part in the climate crisis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks And Signs Executive Actions On Climate Change And Creating Jobs" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fUIAzRoMeumpooDurKj8-5b2UNg=/0x0:5676x3784/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69166361/1230821705.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;US President Joe Biden prepares to sign executive orders after speaking about climate change issues in the State Dining Room of the White House on January 27th, 2021, in Washington, DC. Biden signed several executive orders related to the climate change crisis.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cTxnEI"&gt;The US plans to officially ratchet up its climate commitments going into Earth Day tomorrow, but many advocates are skeptical that it will be ambitious enough to balance out the nation’s inordinate role in creating the climate crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9Z8HUM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No possible ethically justifiable story in which the United States does not do more”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ajesja"&gt;Biden is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/04/20/biden-climate-change/"&gt;expected to commit&lt;/a&gt; the US to slashing its greenhouse gas emissions by at least half compared to what they were in 2005. That’s already a significant ramp-up compared to the trajectory the US was on before. (Barack Obama committed the US to a roughly 27 percent cut by 2025.) But there’s still somewhat of a mismatch between what the US is willing to commit to and what some say it owes to the rest of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMAWhE"&gt;“There exists in my mind no possible ethically justifiable story in which the United States does not do more,” says Tom Athanasiou, executive director of the activist think tank EcoEquity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qaRsp1"&gt;Two specific targets have emerged as rallying calls since a landmark United Nations &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;2018 report&lt;/a&gt; set out pathways to achieving the goals set in Paris: global emissions should reach net zero around 2050 and drop in about half compared to 2010 levels this decade. (While the United Nations report uses a 2010 baseline for pollution cuts, different countries use different years. The US uses 2005, around the time that its emissions peaked.) Biden’s been talking about reaching that 2050 goal domestically since he was on the campaign trail. Since then, hundreds of companies and some mainstream environmental groups &lt;a href="https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/ambitious-u-s-2030-ndc/"&gt;have called for him&lt;/a&gt; to commit to the 2030 target, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fqcd4t"&gt;But others say that target falls short and that the US should do much more because of how much fossil fuel pollution it’s created. China is currently the country that releases the most carbon dioxide emissions each year, so it also has a lot of responsibility. But cumulatively, the US has pumped out nearly &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1007454/cumulative-co2-emissions-worldwide-by-country/"&gt;twice as much&lt;/a&gt; carbon dioxide as China since 1750. Even today, the US’s modern &lt;a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/each-countrys-share-co2-emissions"&gt;per capita emissions&lt;/a&gt; are more than double that of China’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cvCtx"&gt;That’s why Athanasiou, and the Climate Action Network that he’s part of, say that the US’s “&lt;a href="https://usfairshare.org/"&gt;fair share&lt;/a&gt;” of the work to address the climate crisis is much higher than the 50 percent reduction target for this decade. “If there’s a global average number, and you’re doing something fair, then the United States has to do more than the global average. End of story,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="CKrjE8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US’s “fair share” of the work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RvTMDy"&gt;They’re asking the US to slash its emissions by 70 percent. The Climate Action Network also says the US has the responsibility and financial capacity to help developing nations with their emissions cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvA0P1"&gt;Another independent &lt;a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/publications/1o5C-consistent-benchmarks-for-us-2030-climate-target/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that for Biden to hit his aspiration of net zero emissions by 2050 and help the rest of the world do the same, he needs to up the ante. The US should slash pollution by between 57 to 63 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, according to the analysis by the nonprofit organizations NewClimate Institute and Climate Analytics. It also said that the US would need to support other countries’ efforts to lower emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhmjbJ"&gt;So far, the US seems to be falling short when it comes to investing in pollution cuts elsewhere. An important piece of the Paris agreement is a Green Climate Fund established to help developing countries transition to clean energy. The Obama administration committed $3 billion to the fund but was only able to fulfill about $1 billion of it. Donald Trump then pulled the US out of the agreement and reneged on the remaining funds. When Biden recommitted the US to Paris, many thought he would follow through — and maybe even put down more cash. But they were &lt;a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2021/04/13/joe-bidens-1-2bn-budget-green-climate-fund-falls-short-campaigner-demands/"&gt;disappointed&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month when the president’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/FY2022-Discretionary-Request.pdf"&gt;budget proposal&lt;/a&gt; only laid out an additional $1.2 billion for the fund — not even enough to make up for what Trump had previously backed out of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4J08dO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The world is teetering ever closer to catastrophe&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="17IleY"&gt;The US has a long way to go to show the world that it is actually serious about tackling the crisis again. When the US helped strike the Paris climate agreement in 2015, it promised, along with all of the other signatories, that in five years, it would submit even more ambitious commitments to tackle climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plVJG8"&gt;Those five years are up. Now, the world is teetering ever closer to catastrophe: it’s already heated by &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/2020-was-one-of-three-warmest-years-record"&gt;1.2 degrees&lt;/a&gt; Celsius, close to the 1.5 degree threshold that the Paris agreement hoped to avoid. That’s why people around the world are holding their breath to learn what governments’ new commitments are. Of the almost 200 countries that signed the accord, some &lt;a href="https://www.climatewatchdata.org/2020-ndc-tracker"&gt;80 have already turned in&lt;/a&gt; their homework. Notably, the two top greenhouse gas polluters, China and the US, have not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyhaRj"&gt;“Many countries around the globe that are kind of hiding and saying, ‘Okay, we don’t move forward because we don’t see that the big economies are moving forward,’” says Gustavo de Vivero, a climate policy analyst at the NewClimate Institute and one of the authors of its recent analysis. “It’s extremely important [that the Biden administration] show commitment, show that it’s possible to go as high as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52hhCM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaHvpv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bill Nelson backs NASA’s Moon plans, climate change work in confirmation hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBXnLI_OBhpKDa2jkLHQHmE9K7E=/0x0:5128x3419/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69166281/_MG_3326.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nelson smiles for cameras before his Senate confirmation hearing to be NASA’s 14th administrator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qeJKfO"&gt;President Biden’s pick for NASA administrator, former Sen. Bill Nelson, breezed through his Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, as expected. Facing questions from his “old buddies” about NASA’s commercial partnerships, climate change, and workforce diversity, Nelson’s hearing was uneventful and garnered bipartisan praise. He backed the agency’s current plan to send its first crew of astronauts to the Moon on a SpaceX rocket and emphasized NASA’s role in studying climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5mJKa"&gt;Just over a month after being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337787/biden-nasa-chief-choice-senator-bill-nelson"&gt;tapped&lt;/a&gt; by Biden for NASA chief, Nelson told lawmakers he supported the president’s 2022 summary budget request for NASA and defended the $2.3 billion it set out for the agency’s Earth sciences wing — a 15 percent increase from the prior year. “It’s a very important increase. You can’t mitigate climate change unless you measure it, and that’s NASA’s expertise,” he said. “Understanding our planet gives us the means to better protect it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFSUok"&gt;In his &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/4AB228AD-89D0-459D-9ADD-16CBBB76838A"&gt;testimony&lt;/a&gt; and remarks to lawmakers, Nelson, a former congressman and a three-term US senator from Florida, made “constancy of purpose” his priority if confirmed by the Senate. He plans to maintain the moonshot momentum that brewed under the Trump administration, while upping support for climate-focused objectives championed by Biden, including “climate change, educating and inspiring a diverse STEM workforce, building back better through innovation, and using space to create and strengthen global alliances and ensure U.S. global leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_31bc60Wv6m_75u0by3jXM28R0g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22460769/_MG_3360.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before his Senate confirmation hearing to be NASA administrator, Bill Nelson greets Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Nelson’s former colleague in the Senate and the first Republican to endorse Nelson’s nomination.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="POtBHt"&gt;The hearing came less than a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;NASA picked Elon Musk’s SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; to build the country’s first human lunar lander since 1972, one of the most significant awards from the agency in years. The sole award was a surprise to many who expected NASA to pick two providers, either Blue Origin or Dynetics, who had also been developing rival landing systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Samh18"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nelson: “Space is hard”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9Z17Rc"&gt;Asked by senators where Nelson stands on NASA’s commercial partnerships and the Artemis program — the Trump administration’s agenda to land humans on the Moon by 2024 — Nelson supported the program and the agency’s decision to award SpaceX a sole lunar lander contract to mature Starship for NASA’s first two missions to the Moon (one uncrewed, the other crewed). Based on what he read in the news about SpaceX’s award, he said, NASA still has a shot at getting to the moon by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttenBM"&gt;“I think you may be pleased that we’re gonna see that timetable try to be adhered to, but recognize that with some sobering reality that space is hard,” Nelson said. Without naming SpaceX, he said NASA’s current “awardee” for the lander means NASA should try to stick to its 2024 date, a goal set by then-Vice President Mike Pence in 2019 that has been widely viewed as unrealistic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44iCoo"&gt;That 2024 date wasn’t realistic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22323621/trump-moon-program-artemis-biden-nasa-timeline"&gt;Biden’s transition team found&lt;/a&gt;, because of funding shortfalls from Congress. But that was when NASA was still expected to pick two lunar lander providers&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Now with Starship as NASA’s initial ride to the Moon, which came at a price far lower than SpaceX’s rivals, agency officials might publicly stick with the 2024 goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45bR7G"&gt;Nelson’s support for the sole-source selection seemed reserved only for the initial phase of NASA’s human landing system program. NASA plans to invite more companies to compete for future lunar lander contracts. Asked if other elements of Artemis, like space suits, should be built by multiple companies instead of just one, Nelson said, “I do, senator. And competition is always better than sole-sourcing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajRaeW"&gt;Throughout the hearing, Nelson sprinkled praise for Jim Bridenstine, the former NASA chief whose past experience as a congressman proved crucial to rallying support for Trump’s Artemis program. Nelson railed against Bridenstine for being a politician during his confirmation hearing in 2018 but switched gears on Wednesday. “Jim had tremendous success in growing political and public support for NASA, particularly around the Artemis program,” Nelson said in written testimony. “If confirmed, I look forward to continuing to work with him and will seek his advice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k6RJ6H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think he has all the tools necessary to be a great NASA administrator.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8UgVqE"&gt;The Senate Commerce Committee is slated to vote on sending Nelson’s nomination to the Senate on April 28th, and it’s all but certain he’ll clinch confirmation.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Wednesday’s hearing was a “total love fest,” one NASA source said, echoing characterizations made on Twitter. “I think you are seeing exactly why Joe nominated him.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9umeY"&gt;In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; Bridenstine said he expects that Nelson “will sail through the confirmation process,” given his support among Republican senators. “If there are members of the Senate who are considering not supporting him, I am very happy to say I think that’s a mistake. I think he has all the tools necessary to be a great NASA administrator,” Bridenstine said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiSOzO"&gt;Republican Sens. Ted Cruz, who held up two of Biden’s nominees in March, and Rick Scott, who defeated Nelson in his 2018 reelection bid, made the bipartisan vibes clear at the end of the hearing. Scott said, “It’s nice to see a Floridian nominated for NASA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPjH8K"&gt;Cruz, smiling, said to Nelson: “There are not many Biden nominees about whom I am enthusiastic, and your nomination is a notable exception to that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Congress is diving into the App Store fight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rw1jktUqu509TLPu7lluKOhSU4E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69166179/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s App Store was in the hot seat of Wednesday’s hearing&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="CxLVIP"&gt;For years, tech companies like Facebook and Amazon have faced the brunt of antitrust criticism by Congress, and Apple has gotten far fewer questions. But that changed on Wednesday, when Congress finally sunk its teeth into Apple as part of a hearing titled “&lt;a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/antitrust-applied-examining-competition-in-app-stores"&gt;Antitrust Applied: Examining Competition in App Stores&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUPicq"&gt;The hearing brought in representatives from companies like Spotify, Tile, and Match Group, a dating app company, to explain how Apple’s App Store fees and walled-garden business strategy harms their companies. All three companies gave harsh testimony, accusing the iPhone-maker of anti-competitive behavior over the burdensome fees it charges some app developers on its App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="azEotX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If Apple turned on us, it can turn on anyone.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EJuIjq"&gt;The timing couldn’t be worse for Apple, coming just a day after the company announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;an iPhone-linked item tracker&lt;/a&gt; called the AirTag in direct competition with Tile. Speaking to Congress, Tile’s General Counsel Kirsten Daru said that once Apple decided to develop its own item-tracking devices and services in 2019, the two companies’ friendly relationship dissolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsTAHu"&gt;“If Apple turned on us, it can turn on anyone,” Daru told lawmakers. “And Apple has demonstrated that it won’t change unless someone makes them, making legislation so critical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2St8f"&gt;Apple’s shifting platform relationships were a theme in the hearing, with each company testifying to how quickly Cupertino’s collaborative outreach could turn competitive. Match’s Chief Legal Officer Jared Sine told lawmakers that app store fees amount to the company’s single largest expense, totaling around a fifth of the company’s total sales. Spotify’s Head of Global Affairs and Chief Legal Officer Horacio Gutierrez said that Apple’s business model equated to “a classic bait and switch,” luring developers into its app store and suddenly changing the terms to benefit the iPhone-maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qe8U0"&gt;“We all appreciate app stores and the roles that Apple and Google have played in helping to create many of the technologies that have defined our age,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar, chair of the subcommittee, said on Wednesday. “We’re not angry about success... It’s about new products coming on. It’s about new competitors emerging. This situation, to me, doesn’t seem like that’s happening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6GEOwR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IT MEANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pyU24Q"&gt;Sen. Klobuchar, who chairs the committee, is using these hearings to build support for her Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Act, which &lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/2/senator-klobuchar-introduces-sweeping-bill-to-promote-competition-and-improve-antitrust-enforcement"&gt;she introduced in February&lt;/a&gt;. The bill’s provisions don’t line up perfectly with the App Store problem, but there are a few key provisions that would make it easier for companies like Tile to push back against Apple. In particular, the bill would make it less difficult for law enforcement to bring cases against tech companies for engaging in “exclusionary” conduct, something Sen. Klobuchar has been eager to highlight in interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0S7kA"&gt;“I don’t think people realize there’s this 15 to 30 percent tax on major companies people enjoy getting music from, like Spotify, that Apple or Google assesses, that there’s all this exclusionary conduct going on,” Klobuchar &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/senate-targets-apples-tight-app-store-reins-19bee492-bf13-4112-b3de-b0baeeb81b8f.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6GKPtd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They are fighting so hard because it’s core to the maintenance of their monopoly”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kqu77n"&gt;For the most part, the companies giving testimony seemed happy to agree. Throughout the hearing, all three representatives argued that legislation is necessary for companies like Apple to change their behavior. But Spotify and Tile argued that the committee should also look into proposing federal legislation specifically targeting app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZxDjp"&gt;“We respectfully request that some consideration be given to app stores right now,” Tile’s Daru said in light of discussion over Klobuchar’s larger bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyAQy4"&gt;Outside of federal legislation, states like Arizona have introduced their own measures to make developer-friendly changes to Google and Apple’s app stores. Many of these bills, like Arizona’s, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22357121/arizona-hb2005-app-store-bill-dead-apple-google-big-tech-lobbying"&gt;have failed following intense lobbying&lt;/a&gt; efforts by tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbI3M2"&gt;“They are fighting so hard because it’s core to the maintenance of their monopoly,” Sine said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8SL72e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE HIGHLIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="K79ERn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346828/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-biden-nomination-facebook-google-doj-garland"&gt;Biden’s nominee&lt;/a&gt; to be the next Democrat on the Federal Trade Commission is also ready to turn up the heat on the App Store. At Lina Khan’s &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/4/nomination-hearing"&gt;confirmation hearing&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday, Klobuchar asked Khan about the power companies like Apple and Google have in regards to their app stores:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hcnZF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khan: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s really the source of the power. Basically, there’s two main options so that gives these companies the power to really set the term in this market in some cases. I think you’re absolutely right that certain terms and conditions really lack any type of beneficial justifications. So, I think in those cases we need to be especially skeptical and really look closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O3cXgJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT’S NEXT? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M4e0Mv"&gt;Earlier this year, Klobuchar said that the committee would hold &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338763/facebook-google-antitrust-cicilline-ftc-slaughter-monopoly"&gt;a series of hearings&lt;/a&gt; aimed at competition in the tech sector, including Facebook and Google’s dominance in the ad market. The hearings have yet to be scheduled. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyundai stops making the Kona EV for South Korea after battery recall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pPNLRfEOUqa5Lok-uW5UsJkZnt0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69166116/akrales_180329_2351_1035.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6a3MIM"&gt;Hyundai is discontinuing its first mass-market electric SUV, the Kona EV, in South Korea following a massive recall due to a fire risk in the battery pack, the &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210421006400320"&gt;Yonhap news agency reports&lt;/a&gt;. The automaker will instead turn its focus to the forthcoming Ioniq 5 (and the EVs that will follow it), though Hyundai will still sell the Kona EV in the United States, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/hyundai-kona-electric-discontinued-battery-fire-recalls/?PostType=link&amp;amp;TheTime=2021-04-21T20%3A06%3A46&amp;amp;ftag=COS-05-10aaa0b&amp;amp;UniqueID=19DEE852-A2DD-11EB-B8AB-C34416F31EAE&amp;amp;ServiceType=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roadshow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mg2tuB"&gt;More than a dozen reports of fires in Kona EV battery packs have been documented since 2019, and so this February, Hyundai finally decided to spend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299121/hyundai-kona-electric-recall-battery-fire-lg"&gt;nearly $1 billion to recall 76,000 Kona EVs across its home country&lt;/a&gt; (though &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/03/04/hyundai-profit-electric-car-recall-lg-chem/"&gt;battery supplier LG Chem is contributing a big portion&lt;/a&gt;). It also recalled some Ioniq sedans and electric buses that used the same battery technology. Sales of the Kona EV &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/hyundai-kona-electric-discontinued-battery-fire-recalls/?PostType=link&amp;amp;TheTime=2021-04-21T20%3A06%3A46&amp;amp;ftag=COS-05-10aaa0b&amp;amp;UniqueID=19DEE852-A2DD-11EB-B8AB-C34416F31EAE&amp;amp;ServiceType=twitter"&gt;dropped dramatically following the recall&lt;/a&gt;, and some owners have said the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hyundai-motor-electric-recall/kona-ev-owners-say-hyundai-mishandling-recall-for-battery-fires-idUSKBN2BG3ET"&gt;process of getting the battery replaced has been a mess&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFSBjt"&gt;Hyundai &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2019/HYUNDAI/KONA%252520ELECTRIC#recalls"&gt;officially started the recall process&lt;/a&gt; for the Kona EV in the US in March, and the company has been notifying owners since early April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B14TYM"&gt;One reason Hyundai is still exporting Kona EVs to places like the US is that, just before the original recall in February, it announced &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/2022-hyundai-kona-electric-ev-suv-new-look-tech/"&gt;a refreshed version of the electric SUV with a facelift and various tech upgrades&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also still one of the more affordable electric vehicles on the market in North America that has more than 250 miles of range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m547yw"&gt;“There are certainly no plans to discontinue the Kona EV in the U.S. market. It is an extremely important product for Hyundai in the U.S. In fact, we recently heavily invested in a mid-cycle enhancement to Kona EV that makes our small CUV even more appealing,” a spokesperson for Hyundai North America said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We’re also expanding availability into even more states as EV vehicle adoption becomes more widespread. Hyundai has proactively addressed two potential Kona EV safety issues with voluntary recalls.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Call of Duty: Warzone now has 100 million players — as does Apex Legends</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lnZNYq"&gt;In the battle royale of battle royale games, there doesn’t need to be a single winner. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; now has 100 million players, the same number &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;achieved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382560/apex-legends-100-million-players-respawn-ea"&gt;just a week ago&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2KMFl"&gt;They can share a victory royale with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite, &lt;/em&gt;with its 350 million-plus players (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249497/fortnite-350-million-registered-players-hours-played-april"&gt;as of May 2020&lt;/a&gt;), as well as the original &lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds,&lt;/em&gt; which has sold north of &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/pubg-sales"&gt;70 million copies on console and PC&lt;/a&gt;, and its free-to-play &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; variant &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pubg-mobile-five-billion-revenue"&gt;reportedly raked in $5 billion last year&lt;/a&gt; ($7.4 million per day). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hzDBUA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;100 million players and counting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you all for dropping in.

&lt;p id="Jf722F"&gt;If you’re counting, &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; is growing faster than &lt;em&gt;Apex&lt;/em&gt;, though. It took two years for &lt;em&gt;Apex&lt;/em&gt; to hit 100 million, but it’s been just over a year since &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;’s March 2020 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNGHE2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;will kick off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391634/apex-legends-mobile-beta"&gt;a beta for its own mobile game&lt;/a&gt; later this month, as well as jumping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323591/apex-legends-switch-port-cross-progression-purchases-fortnite"&gt;onto the Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple targeted in $50 million ransomware attack resulting in unprecedented schematic leaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LBYgVBc3Ek8Dec1w5qjVOtYcv8g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165959/acastro_170731_1777_0004_v5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ApmGF9"&gt;Apple has been targeted in a $50 million ransomware attack following the theft of a trove of engineering and manufacturing schematics of current and future products from Quanta, a Taiwan-based company that manufactures MacBooks and other products for Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJXze0"&gt;The leak, &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/ransomware-gang-tries-to-extort-apple-hours-ahead-of-spring-loaded-event/"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was carried out by REvil, a Russian hacking group that’s also known by the name Sodinokibi. The group had already begun posting the stolen images on April 20th, timed specifically to coincide with Apple’s latest “Spring Loaded” event, after Quanta refused to pay the $50 million ransom for the data. The group is now hoping to get Apple itself to pay up by May 1st, promising to continue to post new images from the leak daily until it does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsdD19"&gt;Quanta has confirmed that its servers were breached &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-21/apple-targeted-in-50-million-ransomware-hack-of-supplier-quanta"&gt;in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, commenting: “Quanta Computer’s information security team has worked with external IT experts in response to cyber attacks on a small number of Quanta servers.” Quanta also says “there’s no material impact on the company’s business operation” as a result of the hack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1jVkRa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The documents appear to be accurate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="knvHRM"&gt;REvil has a history of similar ransomware attacks, &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt; points out, with the group also carrying out similar hacks on &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/computer-giant-acer-hit-by-50-million-ransomware-attack/"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/leading-cosmetics-group-pierre-fabre-hit-with-25-million-ransomware-attack/"&gt;other companies&lt;/a&gt; in the past several months. But the Quanta attack — by virtue of its connection to Apple and the potential to reveal unannounced Apple hardware — marks the group’s highest-profile target yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7QZvI"&gt;The company hasn’t clarified the extent of the leak yet, but images leaked by REvil so far include schematics for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Apple’s just-revealed iMac redesign&lt;/a&gt; — which, prior to yesterday, hadn’t been seen by anyone outside of Apple’s sphere of influence, lending credence to the fact that the documents are indeed accurate. The schematics also include warnings on nearly every page: “This is the property of Apple and it must be returned,” and they specify that the documents are not to be reproduced, copied, or published. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oA7P5h"&gt;Also contained within the revealed files are manufacturing diagrams for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s already-released 2020 M1 MacBook Air refresh&lt;/a&gt; and an as-yet-unreleased laptop that features additional ports in line with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;existing rumors for the upcoming laptop refresh&lt;/a&gt; from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEGHhr"&gt;These documents were stolen and are being leaked to extort Apple and Quanta. Due to the nature of their origin, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/12/7384871/why-were-reporting-on-sony-leak-hack-ethics-mpaa"&gt;we believe it would be unethical&lt;/a&gt; to extensively report on their contents. We’ve reached out to Apple for comment and will update this post with any new information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brydge’s new keyboard for the M1 iPad makes it more MacBook-like than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KLmXH6d9BXFWlQZZxe4MTGLxlcA=/55x0:1045x660/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165808/BRY_129_MAX_Plus_filler_01.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6W9KkO"&gt;Brydge is announcing a keyboard and trackpad accessory for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/21/brydge-unveils-new-max-keyboard-trackpad-combo-for-12-9-inch-ipad-pro/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"&gt;the company’s previous accessories&lt;/a&gt;, the Brydge 12.9 Max Plus will let you take your iPad from being a tablet to a laptop, just by connecting it to the accessory. With Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;new M1-powered iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, some might already be thinking about using it to make a MacBook replacement, while others may just be excited for the way you can now neatly attach it via magnets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qznUJg"&gt;The answer to whether this will help replace your MacBook with an iPad is more or less &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22391979/apple-ipad-pro-vs-macbook-air-2021-anouncement"&gt;what it’s always been&lt;/a&gt;: it depends on whether you can do all your work with what’s available on iPadOS. The iPad Pro has been more powerful than a lot of MacBooks for years, but hardware is only part of the equation. While the 12.9-inch iPad Pro may now have a processor as fast as a MacBook’s and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;a better screen&lt;/a&gt; to boot, it’s still using an OS that, for some, won’t be able to fully take advantage of those features. If you’re fine with the limitations of iPadOS, then the Brydge 12.9 Max Plus could be a new solution for taking the iPad into laptop mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AddzH"&gt;The iPad will attach to the new Max Plus magnetically, instead of using the clamp system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"&gt;used by previous Brydge keyboards&lt;/a&gt;. That system required you to wedge your expensive tablet between clamps that then held onto that breakable glass — a nerve-wracking and not terribly pleasant experience. This brings Brydge’s offering more in line with the Magic Keyboard, and users will likely appreciate increased ease in switching between laptop and tablet mode. Easy, magnetic attachment is something that’s generally been associated with Apple’s iPad keyboards instead of third-party ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaE9AZ"&gt;While Brydge’s built-in trackpads have generally not compared favorably to Apple’s, the company is hoping to change that by adding native multitouch support. With the Max Plus, Brydge is also playing the size comparison game — its trackpad is the largest on an iPad keyboard, according to the company’s site. That may be a nice bonus if you’re the type of person who likes to use the mouse a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLuQap"&gt;The Brydge 12.9 Max Plus is available for preorder &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-12-9-max-plus%3Fvariant%3D39379780075625&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22396039%2Fbrydge-keyboard-magnetic-tablet-laptop-m1-ipad-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Brydge’s site&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s expected to ship in June. It comes in three color options (space gray, silver, and white) and costs $249.99 — $100 cheaper than &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJQJ3LL%2FA%2Fmagic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-11-inch-3rd-generation-and-ipad-air-4th-generation-us-english&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22396039%2Fbrydge-keyboard-magnetic-tablet-laptop-m1-ipad-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
