    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6N6nMF"&gt;Sony is finally &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/12/13/new-dualsense-wireless-controller-colors-arrive-next-month-followed-by-new-ps5-console-covers/"&gt;announcing its own&lt;/a&gt; custom covers for the PS5. The console covers will be available in black, red, pink, blue, and purple, and will work on both the regular PS5 and PS5 Digital Edition. Sony is releasing the black and red PS5 console covers in January in most markets where the PS5 is sold, with the other colors to follow in the first half of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7M66A"&gt;The new covers are designed to match the colors found on new pink, blue, and purple DualSense controller options. These new colors will be available in January, with the purple version being sold in the UK, US, and Germany through &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/coming-soon"&gt;Sony’s PlayStation direct&lt;/a&gt; early access program. Other retailers will stock the purple DualSense controller on February 11th.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R0SWVt"&gt;Sony is also planning to offer the PS5 black cover on January 21st at its PlayStation direct online store, with availability at other retailers on February 18th. The PS5 covers will be available for $54.99, and the new controller options are priced at $74.99&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okcxNi"&gt;Sony’s announcement of new console covers comes just weeks after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22796166/sony-ps5-faceplates-design-patent-playstation-5"&gt;patented its PS5 faceplates&lt;/a&gt;. Sony has been caught up in legal action against multiple third-party companies that have sold black faceplates. DBrand faced legal action from Sony, forcing the company to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22728936/dbrand-pulls-ps5-darkplates-from-sale-sony-threatens-legal-action"&gt;pull its faceplates&lt;/a&gt; and replace them days later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733642/dbrand-new-ps5-darkplates-sony-legal-threats"&gt;with a new design&lt;/a&gt; and a marketing campaign that mocked Sony’s team of lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton responds to surprise death in And Just Like That... with new commercial </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zQJfPyWEwJnsRDI-h-zsRt-j8Jk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70263745/akrales210108_4344_0103.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QvYd2L"&gt;Peloton has responded to a plot-line in HBO Max’s new &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; reboot, &lt;em&gt;And Just Like That...&lt;/em&gt;, turning around a commercial in less than 48 hours after the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/10/peloton-selloff-continues-as-sex-and-the-city-reboot-adds-to-image-issues.html"&gt;stock continued to plummet&lt;/a&gt; in reaction to events on the TV show over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SrczXK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Spoiler warning: the following discusses a major plot point from the first episode of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Just Like That...)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvMVsV"&gt;The plot point in question involved the sudden death of Mr. Big (Chris Noth), who suffers what appears to be a heart attack after enjoying a 45-minute Peloton workout. That workout happened to be led by a character played by a real-life Peloton instructor (Jess King). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Nwy1B"&gt;Peloton says it approved King’s appearance in the show, but knew nothing about Big’s death. “We were not made aware of the plotline,” Peloton’s SVP of global communications Jessica Kleiman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;over email. “This was a casting opportunity for one of our instructors for an acting role — not an official brand integration or product placement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pdo5fe"&gt;Now the company has responded with a commercial featuring Noth and King, in which Noth suggests the pair “take another ride.” A voiceover from Ryan Reynolds reassures viewers that “regular cycling stimulates and improves your heart, lungs, and circulation, reducing your risk of cardiovascular diseases. Cycling strengthens your heart muscles, lowers resting pulse, and reduces blood fat levels,” before concluding — “he’s alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UtOqF9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And just like that...he's alive. &lt;a href="https://t.co/bVX8uWypFZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bVX8uWypFZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Peloton (@onepeloton) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/onepeloton/status/1470132497170239496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bipWhW"&gt;Kleiman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the commercial was filmed over the weekend “in collaboration with Ryan Reynolds and his marketing company, Maximum Effort, who created the spot,” and that the whole thing “came together in less than 48 hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fS9hgy"&gt;It’s an impressively quick turnaround — so quick that you’d be forgiven for suspecting the whole back and forth is a bit of orchestrated viral marketing — but Peloton and Ryan Reynolds do have prior form here. When Peloton released its infamous “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ijof8uw4OHs"&gt;Peloton Wife&lt;/a&gt;” advert two years ago, Reynolds nabbed the same actress, Monica Ruiz, to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ayD-4nMnB44"&gt;appear in a commercial&lt;/a&gt; for his Aviation Gin, with the spot seemingly following the same storyline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFMm5H"&gt;Peloton’s difficulties go far beyond fictional plot-lines, though. The company’s stock surged during the pandemic as more people were forced to work out at home, but enthusiasm for its products have since cooled. The company also has extremely real and tragic problems involving its equipment. Its &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/peloton-treadmill-recall/"&gt;treadmill was recalled&lt;/a&gt; after it caused numerous injuries and the death of a six-year-old who was pulled into the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota is going to make you pay to start your car with your key fob</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Car Logos" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yuXGUyhZUptnuXQP4a0R71GuL2E=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70262746/1230450659.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pWECf5"&gt;Toyota is charging drivers for the convenience of using their key fobs to remotely start their cars. According to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/43329/toyota-made-its-key-fob-remote-start-into-a-subscription-service"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Toyota models 2018 or newer will need a subscription in order for the key fob to support remote start functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svDI4F"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt; notes, buyers are given the option to choose from an array of &lt;a href="https://www.toyota.com/connected-services/"&gt;Connected Services&lt;/a&gt; when purchasing a new Toyota, and one of those services — called Remote Connect — just so happens to include the ability to remotely start your car with your key fob. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9wkTqc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The key fob’s remote start functionality is tied to the audio package that comes with the car&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yQPoao"&gt;Buyers are offered a free trial of Remote Connect, but the length of that trial depends on the audio package that’s included with the vehicle. Even more confusingly, only some Toyota models support the Audio Plus or Premium Audio packages that the free trial is offered with, which you can check out for yourself in this &lt;a href="https://engage.toyota.com/static/articles/11_25_2020_2021_connected_services_trial_renewal_and_applicability_chart/2021_Connected_Services_Trial_Renewal_and_Applicability_Chart.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrE2qm"&gt;In other words, the key fob’s remote start functionality is tied to the audio package that comes with the car. This was first spotted in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/qyyl94/toyota_will_disable_key_fob_remote_start_unless/"&gt;a post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, where the original poster added a link to Toyota’s Remote Connect marketing materials (&lt;a href="https://www.toyota.com/content/connectedservices/marketing/PDF/Remote_Connect_CFA.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). The post has since been flagged as “potentially misleading,” however, Toyota confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt; that users will, in fact, have to pay for remote start when the free trial ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXw1Wq"&gt;The pamphlet linked to in the post details the key fob’s remote start feature, as well as its relation to the Audio Plus and Premium Audio packages. While a car with Audio Plus gives drivers the luxury of free remote start using a key fob for three years, a car purchased with Premium Audio offers free remote start for 10 years. After that, drivers will have to pay the $8 / month or $80 / year price for the full Remote Connect service, which includes the remote start feature for the key fob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13v4j0"&gt;On Toyota’s &lt;a href="https://www.toyota.com/connected-services/remoteconnect/"&gt;Remote Connect page&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not entirely clear that the key fob’s remote start functionality is included within the plan. It says that the Remote Connect service lets drivers use their smartwatch, smart home devices, or smartphone to start their cars, but there isn’t any mention of using the key fob for remote starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydCP52"&gt;And as &lt;em&gt;The Drive &lt;/em&gt;points out, it looks like some users have been aware of this for years. In a thread dated back to 2019 on the &lt;a href="https://www.toyotanation.com/threads/remote-start-keyfob-works-after-remote-connect-subscription-was-canceled.1656626/"&gt;Toyota Nation forum&lt;/a&gt;, users discuss the key fob’s remote start functionality — some users claim that their key fob is still able to start their car remotely, however most of the users on this thread own a Toyota that’s 2018 or newer, which means they may still be covered by the free trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nW1LfL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Typically, paywalled features like these are limited to luxury car brands&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NHmXWH"&gt;Typically, paywalled features like these are limited to luxury car brands. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/16/16897326/bmw-apple-carplay-subscription-google-alexa-detroit-auto-show-2018"&gt;BMW made drivers pay an annual subscription&lt;/a&gt; for Apple Car Play — in addition to the $300 it charges to install the feature in the first place. The German car manufacturer &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2019/12/4/20995630/bmw-apple-carplay-reverse-decision-annual-fee-vehicle"&gt;later walked back on its decision&lt;/a&gt; nearly two years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWLBQD"&gt;However, BMW still does let you pay to “unlock” new features in your car, in a way that’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21311332/bmw-in-car-purchase-heated-seats-software-over-the-air-updates"&gt;described as in-car microtransactions&lt;/a&gt;. The all-electric Porsche Taycan has a similar system, dubbed &lt;a href="https://www.porsche.com/usa/connect/"&gt;Functions On-Demand&lt;/a&gt;, which lets drivers purchase new, optional features for their Porsche, like Active Lane Keeping or Dynamic Light System Plus. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/36596/cadillac-super-cruise-needs-a-25-monthly-subscription-to-work-after-three-years-no-matter-what"&gt;Cadillac charges users $25 / month&lt;/a&gt; after the end of the free trial for its hands-free driving mode, Super Cruise, which has since been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701086/cadillac-super-cruise-2022-escalade-semiconductor-shortage"&gt;temporarily discontinued in newer Escalades&lt;/a&gt; due to the chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chris Wallace leaves Fox News to host weekday show on CNN’s new streaming service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Donald Trump And Joe Biden Participate In First Presidential Debate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O9pgdussW6JOvzw4fCoJ8JtoxOg=/2x0:4094x2728/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70262208/1228795725.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JUpix3"&gt;Long-time &lt;em&gt;Fox News Sunday&lt;/em&gt; host Chris Wallace is leaving the network to join CNN’s upcoming streaming service, &lt;a href="https://plus.cnn.com/signup"&gt;CNN Plus&lt;/a&gt;, as noted in a &lt;a href="https://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2021/12/12/chris-wallace-cnn-plus/"&gt;press release from CNN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bbuDOV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new show will be available when its streaming platform launches in 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gNVIvw"&gt;The 18-year Fox News veteran &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/chris-wallace-departure-fox-news-channel"&gt;announced his departure&lt;/a&gt; during his final &lt;em&gt;Fox News Sunday&lt;/em&gt;, stating that he “wants to try something new.” Sources close to the situation &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/12/media/chris-wallace-leaving-fox-news/index.html"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt; that Wallace’s long-term contract with Fox was expiring this year, and he wasn’t looking to renew it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIgLZ2"&gt;Shortly after Wallace’s announcement, CNN revealed that Wallace will be hosting a weekday show on CNN Plus that features interviews with figures from the world of politics, sports, business, and culture. The new show will be available when its streaming platform launches in 2022, serving as just one example of the type of original content that CNN plans on debuting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bdz2c"&gt;On top of its original programming, &lt;a href="https://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2021/07/19/cnn-to-debut-in-q1-2022/"&gt;CNN Plus will also include&lt;/a&gt; some of the long-form content it previously aired on its network, including &lt;em&gt;Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;This is Life with Lisa Ling&lt;/em&gt;. In addition, it will also include live, on-demand content that distinguishes itself from CNN’s current programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3U1FGx"&gt;CNN says it plans on releasing more details about Wallace’s show, new hires, and the platform’s full lineup “in the weeks and months to come.” There’s still no information regarding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583424/cnn-plus-launch-streaming-service-first-quarter"&gt;CNN Plus’ subscription costs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony WF-C500 earbuds review: basic ain’t bad</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Sony’s entry-level buds stick to the fundamentals&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="tjnbvg"&gt;Sony’s new WF-C500 true wireless earbuds have an appealing price of $99.99 and come with a sleeker, more traditional design than the WF-XB700 buds that they’re replacing. Aside from the reined-in looks, they improve upon that model by adding support for Sony’s Headphones Connect app, which allows you to customize the EQ to your liking. The WF-XB700s had the company’s “Extra Bass” branding, but Sony has done away with that this time for a sound that’s much more balanced out of the box. Battery life has also improved slightly to an impressive 10 hours of continuous playback, and the C500s offer easy-to-use controls with large buttons on each earbud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvYbpB"&gt;But to hit that penny-shy-of-$100 price, Sony left out some major features like noise cancellation, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and even smaller conveniences like automatic pausing when you pull out one or both earbuds. You can often find these useful tricks in similarly priced buds, which can leave the C500s feeling like Sony omitted a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2fC6ja"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10913452"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vc86aR"&gt;That said, they still sound very good for the price; Sony rarely skimps on audio quality. And while I was worried that switching to a smaller, more discreet physical design would sacrifice the anchored-in-my-ears feeling that the XB700s gave me, thankfully that’s an area where these earbuds continue to be a standout. The question you’ll need to ask yourself is whether those pluses are enough to make up for what’s missing. Where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Sony’s 1000XM4 earbuds are a lavish luxury&lt;/a&gt;, this set is about as basic as they come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AAqoYE"&gt;Before I get to the earbuds themselves, a few words on the charging case: Sony has downsized it significantly into a more pocketable pill shape. The bottom is still flat, so the case sits nicely on a desk or table even when the lid is open. I also really like that Sony carried over the semi-translucent lid from the XB700s, which makes it easy to see the three amber LEDs inside — one for each bud and the case — and be certain that everything is charging properly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7lxJIflEif9aiLFr-R9X5ygbhGU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076298/cwelch_211208_4922_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The WF-C500 earbuds next to Sony’s flagship WF-1000XM4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lp3Cld"&gt;Opening it with one hand can be challenging since the lid uses resistance rather than magnets to stay closed, but it’s not impossible if you push up from the thin indent running along the lip. The case still uses textured matte plastic all around, and while some view this as cheap, I like that it eliminates any potential for scratches or scuffs. There’s a USB-C port around back, and the case has enough juice for one full recharge of the C500s, bringing them from 10 hours of playback to a total of 20. Most earbud charging cases have at least two additional charges’ worth of battery in them, so Sony’s behind the curve there. You can also count out wireless charging, which Sony seems to reserve for its upper-end earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pb8Cy0"&gt;The XB700s had a very distinct design that, even at the time, was on the larger side for true wireless earbuds. They also noticeably protruded from my ears. The reason behind the unconventional shape was that it allowed them to twist deeply into the ear canal for a very stable fit and optimal bass response. I liked the fit, but not everyone found them equally as comfortable. With the C500s, Sony is making the latter a priority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DzZvL-ECBdnsuHUwJgd0By3aO8k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076302/cwelch_211208_4922_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The WF-C500 buds (right) are significantly smaller than the WF-XB700 (left) that preceded them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X5ngo4"&gt;They’re still matte all over but are now more compact — smaller than the flagship noise-canceling WF-1000XM4 earbuds — and don’t demand as much space in your ears when inserted. The overall look is close enough to Sony’s premium models to make them both seem part of the same family, though you lose the flashy copper accents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C80swr"&gt;Instead of a touch-sensitive outer surface for controls, the C500s have a large, physical button on each bud. This is a vast usability improvement over the tiny nub that was located at the bottom of each XB700 earbud. The controls remain unchanged (and can’t be customized). The left earbud controls volume: a tap increases it and holding down will gradually lower it. Track controls are on the right earbud: tap once for pause / play, press twice to skip tracks, and three times to go back. Holding the right bud will summon your phone’s voice assistant. Once you get the functions down, they’re easy to remember, and the buttons are clicky enough that you don’t have to forcefully press them (and jam the buds uncomfortably deep into your ears) just to activate the controls. Unfortunately, Sony omitted the common auto-pause feature when you remove one or both earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FTeCQRtwDJUIQteTkQPcOTE3UHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076297/cwelch_211208_4922_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case lid lets you easily see when the earbuds are charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pONDlJ"&gt;Three sizes of silicone tips are included in the box. The large size worked about as well as I could ask for, providing a good, reassuring seal and decent noise isolation. Even though they don’t screw into my ears in the same way as the XB700s, the C500s never budged or came loose whether I was eating, talking, or running with them in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7G0ll"&gt;As is typical for Sony buds, the sound doesn’t disappoint. While the C500s lack the expansive, rich soundstage (and powerful noise cancellation) of the company’s flagship 1000XM4s, they come with an excellent, fairly balanced tuning out of the box. The 5.8mm drivers have nicely controlled bass — brought down a rung or two from the Extra Bass XB700s — detailed highs, and well-defined mids that bring vocals through on Taylor Swift’s &lt;em&gt;Red&lt;/em&gt; rerecording with clarity and presence. Unlike Sony’s previous entry-level earbuds, you can customize the EQ on these if you do want to crank up the lower frequencies or give the treble a little more room to breathe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y3rpsGOUP0P-zw2rj_18NVbTM2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076299/cwelch_211208_4922_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The C500s lack the noise cancellation, LDAC support, and richer audio experience of the much pricier 1000XM4s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gBu4Vp"&gt;To my ears, the C500s sound better and fuller than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676362/jabra-elite-3-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;Jabra’s slightly cheaper Elite 3 earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, but the Jabras outdo Sony at noise isolation and also have a transparency mode for hearing your surroundings (or your own voice when on calls). Other similarly priced competition like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;the Nothing Ear 1s&lt;/a&gt; have a more lively V-shaped EQ out of the box, but I like how flexible the Sonys are with customizing your preferred sound. You won’t get the ANC that comes with the Nothings or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323748/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-wireless-headphone-price"&gt;slightly pricier buds like Anker’s Liberty Air 2 Pros&lt;/a&gt;, nor is Sony’s higher-quality LDAC codec supported on the C500s. But the company does at least toss in a small helping of extras like 360 Reality Audio support and the freedom to use either earbud alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="LN4CjL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10913459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VoF563"&gt;But voice call quality isn’t a strength for Sony’s entry-level buds, and the experience can be rough in noisy environments. If you’re chatting with someone from a quiet room, they’ll do the job. But my colleagues on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reviews team cringed and laughed — unable to make out a word I said — when I attempted using them on our weekly Zoom meeting at my crowded local coffee shop. AirPods or Galaxy Buds 2, these are not. I don’t expect groundbreaking clarity for $100, but Sony should be aiming higher here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="jhhUki"&gt;Even with poor call quality, as a complete package, the WF-C500s cover the other fundamentals without any glaring tradeoffs or flaws. You can find earbuds that pack in more features for the money, but these Sony’s are dependable, easy to use, last for long listening sessions, and have a sound that punches beyond their price. They’re also more compact and stylish than the oddball WF-XB700s that preceded them while maintaining a great in-ear fit. If all you care about is getting a basic set of earbuds that work consistently and sound good in the process, you can save a heaping of cash and go with Sony’s basic buds. Sometimes less is more — unless you want noise cancellation or other features that demand a higher price. It’s fair to have some pause and consider what you’re giving up, but if you can snag the C500s on sale (at press time they’re as low as $68), they’re far from the worst impulse buy you’ll ever make.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GjXXNX"&gt;An Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, Illinois collapsed following a bout of severe weather and tornados that ripped across the Midwest and South on Friday night. According to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/injuries-reported-after-roof-collapse-amazon-warehouse-illinois-ap-2021-12-11/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, at least six deaths have been confirmed, and a number of workers are still unaccounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lV7Daf"&gt;&lt;a href="http://facebook.com/collinsvilleEMA/posts/269327955226516"&gt;A post&lt;/a&gt; on Illinois’ Collinsville Emergency Management Agency’s Facebook page called the collapse a “mass casualty” incident. It &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=269627795196532&amp;amp;set=a.222212819938030"&gt;later posted&lt;/a&gt; an update with a photo of the event’s aftermath, showing a large portion of the warehouse completely torn away by the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W83334"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b6wNxM"&gt;During a press conference this morning, police chief Mike Fillback told reporters that authorities have had trouble finding out “how many people we actually had at that facility at the time because it’s not a set staff.” Amazon management was at the scene to help create a list of staff members who are accounted for, however, Fillback notes that it’s still difficult to determine how many people remain trapped inside the collapsed building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZ0gxx"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, at least 45 people reportedly made it out of the facility safely. While some were transported by bus to a safe area and reunited with family, others were able to leave the scene on their own (via &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/least-one-person-dead-severe-weather-event-illinois-amazon-warehouse-rcna8464"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). It remains unclear how many people were originally in the building, but as &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; notes, authorities estimate that 110 workers could've been inside at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ue0N76"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The safety and well-being of our employees and partners is our top priority right now” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VcgDJ3"&gt;“The safety and well-being of our employees and partners is our top priority right now,” Amazon spokesperson Richard Rocha said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We’re assessing the situation and will share additional information when it’s available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Qo8WF"&gt;Illinois wasn’t the only state affected by the severe storms. According to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/2-dead-arkansas-possible-tornadoes-heavy-weather-strike-us-rcna8451"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 70 fatalities are expected in Kentucky, while one was killed after a possible tornado hit a nursing home in Arkansas. President Joe Biden sent out a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1469683523447664642"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; Saturday morning, stating that the administration is “working with Governors to ensure they have what they need as the search for survivors and damage assessments continue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GNg4D7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;(2/2) All of Edwardsville should know that the Amazon team is committed to supporting them and will be by their side through this crisis. We extend our fullest gratitude to all the incredible first responders who have worked so tirelessly at the site.&lt;/p&gt;— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1469849247042334721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sDq7hf"&gt;Amazon founder Jeff Bezos responded to the incident on Saturday night via Twitter. “All of Edwardsville should know that the Amazon team is committed to supporting them and will be by their side through this crisis,” he wrote. Bezos had been in Texas that morning for his spaceflight company’s rocket launch that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829232/blue-origin-new-shepard-michael-strahan-six-crew-success"&gt;brought six people to space&lt;/a&gt;, including former NFL star Michael Strahan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GcuCqF"&gt;“Requiring workers to work through such a major tornado warning event as this was inexcusable,” said Stuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union. “This is another outrageous example of the company putting profits over the health and safety of their workers, and we cannot stand for this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvn7yu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 12th 2021, 12:30PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Updated to reflect that there are now six confirmed deaths and that at least 45 workers have made it out of the warehouse safely, as well as added that authorities estimate that 110 workers were in the warehouse at the time. Also inserted a tweet from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and a statement from the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla hit with another lawsuit alleging sexual harassment, and retaliation by management</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BHLSLRnmPcOrBzVWzDWOgHcRptY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70261756/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hzUm8L"&gt;A second Tesla employee within one month has filed a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment at the workplace, according to reports by &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-sued-by-second-female-worker-over-sexual-harassment-retaliation-2021-12-10/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-second-female-worker-fremont-factory-2021-12"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Erica Cloud, an assembly line worker at Tesla, filed a lawsuit in California’s Alameda County Superior Court, claiming that she experienced “continuous and pervasive” sexual harassment in the factory where she worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1JLYAC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cloud’s managers are allegedly retaliating against her&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6on69t"&gt;As noted by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, Cloud’s lawsuit alleges that her manager hugged and massaged her, and claims that she was also subject to her manager’s vulgar and sexual remarks. It also accuses Tesla of not doing enough to address possible sexual harassment in the workplace. Cloud’s managers are allegedly retaliating against her after she brought up the issue to human resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yqI14"&gt;This comes just after Jessica Barraza, a production associate at Tesla, filed a lawsuit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791321/worker-sues-tesla-rampant-sexual-harassment-fremont-elon-musk"&gt;accusing the company of “rampant sexual harassment”&lt;/a&gt; at its Fremont, CA factory. Barraza’s lawsuit claims that she was inappropriately touched, catcalled, and subject to sexual comments at the workplace. She also alleges that her managers knew about the harassment, and partook in the same type of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Bi4sf"&gt;In October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710279/tesla-racism-fremont-plant-137-million-judgement-owen-diaz"&gt;Tesla was ordered to pay $137 million&lt;/a&gt; in connection to another incident at its Fremont factory. Owen Diaz, a Black former elevator operator at the company said he experienced racial harassment and discrimination. Tesla employees later &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/14/tesla-class-action-lawsuit-alleges-racism-unsafe-factory-conditions.html"&gt;proposed a class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; alleging racism at the Fremont factory.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to stop Alexa from ruining holiday surprises  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Np0Pk4DDbpvj8MyeIH1aPTcUbWY=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70261475/jtuohy_20211211_4924_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo smart displays — like this Echo Show 15 — can show you when your Amazon packages are arriving. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LMh1CW"&gt;Echo smart speakers and smart displays have a handy feature that can show and tell you when there’s a package sitting on your doorstep and even what’s in it. While this can be helpful most of the time, around the holidays it could seriously ruin some surprises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFanYE"&gt;Avoid making any Grinch-like moves this holiday and manage your Amazon shopping notifications in the Alexa app to help keep the magic alive. Alongside options for tailoring package announcements, the notifications section of the app also has a number of settings you can toggle on or off to help make the voice assistant a little more helpful when it comes to purchases you make on Amazon. Below are a few of the most useful that you might want to tweak this holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngcWqw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to turn off package notifications on Alexa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZZRnVV"&gt;Open the Alexa app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hiDvS7"&gt;Tap on More in the bottom right hand corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J12seb"&gt;Select Settings &amp;gt; Notifications &amp;gt; Amazon Shopping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BOfjaT"&gt;Under “Say or Show Item Titles” toggle off “including items in your shopping cart marked as gifts, or those that might be gifts during major holidays.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fhRDDkyJbnHjBxhJN9UdJWG2jHM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079984/alexa_notifications_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshots by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One you are in the Amazon Shopping Notifications page of the Alexa app (far right) you can toggle on and off the different notifications you want to receive on your Echo speakers. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sVJVuZ"&gt;Once this is done, you will still get announcements on Echo speakers and on-screen notifications on Echo smart displays for your packages, but those you tagged as gifts in your shopping cart (or that Alexa suspects may be) won’t include a description of what they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOoDCU"&gt;This is handy if you actually do want the household to know there’s toilet paper on your doorstep, but not that the Nintendo Switch arrived. To ensure this works correctly, check “send as a gift” when the item is in your Amazon cart.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpiGNQ"&gt;To be on the safe side, you can toggle off all the items under “Say or Show Item Titles.” Then you will just get word when a package is out for delivery or delivered but never what it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p55shU"&gt;If you don’t want any package notifications from Alexa — anywhere, any way — and want to be surprised when you open the door toggle off all items on this screen. (Note — these settings only affect announcements on Echo speakers, you will still get any push, email or other notifications you’ve signed up for.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F0tuB8"&gt;How to stop Alexa asking you to rate purchases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fmEETRXVZETmcqhLjI3hpFwR6DU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080013/IMG_AB2E3A792741_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Further down that same Amazon Shopping page are more options for asking the voice assistant to stay quiet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5XCip6"&gt;While you’re here, if you’ve been getting annoyed by Alexa’s pestering you to rate that cheese grater you bought two months ago (this happened to me at 9:30PM when I asked Alexa to read my Audible book), there is a quick fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Wf3Xa"&gt;Scroll a bit further down on the same Shopping Notifications page and toggle off “Request to rate products you’ve purchased.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQYMUc"&gt;You can also stop Alexa from announcing the latest deal on the laundry detergent you usually purchase by toggling off “Recommendations and Deals.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtX3qq"&gt;There are other options in here you might want to check out if you often find your Alexa speaker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22747275/amazon-echo-speaker-alexa-flashing-green-red-orange-yellow"&gt;flashing yellow&lt;/a&gt; — like it’s trying to get your attention (which it is). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7Z26i"&gt;If you use Amazon’s Subscribe &amp;amp; Save program Alexa can audibly notify you if an item in your upcoming delivery is out of stock, among other things. You can toggle this option on or off under Order Updates, this will affect announcements about any order updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wjb4Bs"&gt;You can use this screen to stop Alexa from randomly offering up “personalized recommendations and deals” on your speakers, as well as turn off voice-assistant updates about your Audible account (such as if you have a new credit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsVprC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Install the Microsoft Teams update for Android now to fix 911 calling bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration Microsoft Teams logo is seen..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MWoMDtAzeeZMCo_5WGKcJTvffnA=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70261417/1208744069.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hnKDTL"&gt;Microsoft Teams has rolled out a fix for the dangerous bug that could prevent Android users from calling 911 — and you’ll want to install it ASAP (via &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/microsoft-teams-android-911-update/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828234/microsoft-teams-android-bug-blocked-911-call-go-read-this"&gt;his analysis of the issue&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mmrahman123/how-a-bug-in-android-and-microsoft-teams-could-have-caused-this-users-911-call-to-fail-6525f9ba5e63"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Mishaal Rahman, the senior technical editor at &lt;em&gt;Esper&lt;/em&gt;, explains that Microsoft has corrected the issue in an update for the Teams app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yjShAN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you didn’t end up uninstalling Teams, make sure to update it as soon as you can&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PbJrrm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/r4xz1f/pixel_prevented_me_from_calling_911/hnrvsr1/"&gt;A user on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; initially discovered the bug when trying to call 911 from their Pixel 3, prompting an explanation from Google. The company said that the issue is triggered by an “unintended interaction” between the Android operating system and the Teams app. It only affects users with devices running Android 10 or later, and who have the Teams app installed but aren’t signed in. However, Google still advised all users with Android 10 or above to uninstall Teams anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="La9lS6"&gt;But if you didn’t end up uninstalling Teams, make sure to update it as soon as you can. Rahman notes that version 1416/1.0.0.2021194504 resolves the issue, which he found was building duplicate instances of the &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telecom/PhoneAccount"&gt;PhoneAccount class&lt;/a&gt; in the Android operating system, a function that lets apps place and receive phone calls. That said, many Android apps that have a calling feature will create a PhoneAccount instance, but in the case of Teams, it was creating too many when the user accessed the app while not signed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztraYA"&gt;Rahman notes that the updated version doesn’t create duplicate PhoneAccount instances, and will also clear any previously-built PhoneAccount instances when launched. Google also plans on issuing an update to Android on January 4th, so hopefully, that will help fix anything that went wrong on its own end. You can install the updated version of Microsoft Teams from the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.teams"&gt;Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DraftKings signs up real NFL players to use in ‘gamified NFT collections’ next season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New England Patriots Practice" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k3SFudhIhnVVVpBBAMt0RYrHVho=/0x0:2269x1513/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70261310/1229235990.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ue9BF9"&gt;You only have to look &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822410/ubisoft-nfts-quartz-digits-ghost-recon-breakpoint"&gt;at the negative response to Ubisoft’s NFT gaming announcement&lt;/a&gt; and the number of people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829383/matrix-nft-keanu-reeves-interview-carrie-ann-moss"&gt;chortling along with Keanu Reeves&lt;/a&gt; to confirm that reactions to non-fungible tokens range from disbelief to outright dislike. However, that hasn’t stopped DraftKings and the NFL Player’s Association from signing a new deal for a “gamified NFT collaboration.” The sports betting company plans to launch its collections during the 2022 - 2023 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tOiLO2"&gt;As far as how the operation will work, the details are scarce. The press release describes a combination that sounds similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;NBA Top Shot&lt;/a&gt; / NFL All Day model with buying and trading, plus the ability for registered owners of NFTs to use their collectibles like many trading card-based games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="k7Csc4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Valve bans blockchain games and NFTs on Steam, Epic will try to make it work","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728425/valve-steam-blockchain-nft-crypto-ban-games-age-of-rust"},{"title":"Keanu Reeves can’t stop laughing at the idea of NFTs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829383/matrix-nft-keanu-reeves-interview-carrie-ann-moss"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LbyXHn"&gt;Initial anticipated features of DraftKings’ gamified NFL player NFTs include the ability for customers to use these collectibles within games against others on the platform as well as separate buying and selling functionality. It is expected there will be a variety of NFT editions and tiers that incorporate different aspects of utility and digital scarcity, all powered by Polygon. DraftKings previously announced a strategic agreement with Polygon to provide a scalable, eco-friendly blockchain solution that enables added throughput, lower transaction fees and expanded capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="wDqkee"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uQJcC4"&gt;One advantage this has over most of the NFT collaborations is that it will operate in a world where money is already the focus, so it seems unlikely that DraftKings gamblers will find the mere suggestion distasteful. Gauging the risks of wild speculation or gambling on seemingly meaningless items is what people are already there for anyway. There’s a strange parallel to the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/3/9090191/mtgox-mark-karpeles-bitcoin-arrested-cryptocurrency"&gt; rise (and eventual fall) of the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox&lt;/a&gt;, which started as a website for trading &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering Online&lt;/em&gt; cards like stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3SlbS"&gt;NFL teams are already trying to find a future in NFTs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789265/nft-nfl-football-commerative-ticketmaster"&gt;attaching them to tickets for select games&lt;/a&gt; and through its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22801332/nfl-all-day-nft-sports-top-shot-collectible-dapper-labs"&gt;Dapper Labs-built NFL All Day marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. NFL All Day launched its closed beta on Thursday and has already had to warn members about scammers and bots trying to fleece them for its “Moments” highlights, even though features like minting, buying, and trading, aren’t supported yet. As for the union representing players, this deal for name, image, and likeness rights is just another way to get in the mix of “the emerging landscape of digital entertainment that creates excitement among players and fans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3v3hGs"&gt;All three DraftKings founders appear to be sporting Bored Ape Yacht Club avatars (I assume, I have not verified their ownership on the blockchain) on Twitter, so clearly, there is a focus on this as a potential market. Co-founder Jason Robins &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JasonDRobins/status/1466189374350053376"&gt;tweeted on December 1st&lt;/a&gt; that “The money we are making in crypto is peanuts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sEDWnn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The only reason &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mattkalish?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@mattkalish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PaulLiberman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@PaulLiberman&lt;/a&gt;, and me spend any time on this is to learn.  The money we are making in crypto is peanuts (though the return percentages are incredible).  The founders learning blockchain deeply is all in service of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DKNG&amp;amp;src=ctag&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;$DKNG&lt;/a&gt; shareholders (including us!)&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Robins (@JasonDRobins) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JasonDRobins/status/1466189374350053376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ph9UUR"&gt;In a press release announcing this deal, the senior vice president of product operations for DraftKings Marketplace, Beth Beiriger, said, “few organizations beyond DraftKings are as equipped to capitalize on the increasing intersection between sports and NFTs that will be cornerstones of engagement and entertainment within Web3.” In a statement given to &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marieschulte-bockum/2021/12/08/draftkings-signs-deal-with-nfl-players-association-as-old-guard-gaming-companies-jump-aboard-nft-hype-train/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Bieriger continued, saying, “We’re a tech company. This partnership with the NFLPA will allow us to bring incredible IP into this new emerging technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oF3pRq"&gt;The company also has a strong incentive to seek out new markets or new ways to capitalize on its current base. Despite surviving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/4/12373786/draftkings-fanduel-legal-new-york-state"&gt;some attempts to ban its daily fantasy operations&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, some speculators doubt its business model and long-term prospects. One short-seller &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Finvesting%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fwhy-draftkings-stock-plunged-today%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F12%2F22829795%2Fnft-game-gambling-draftkings-nflpa-polygon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;called it “massively overvalued” last week&lt;/a&gt; due to spending big on marketing to fuel its growth. DraftKings’ stock currently trades at around $30, which is less than half of the $74 peak it reached in March as the three founders pledged to take a base salary of $1 for 2021 (&lt;a href="https://draftkings.gcs-web.com/static-files/75297a17-de31-4e0f-ab0c-d3c469d9b844"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5gOb8"&gt;There’s no word yet on when we can expect details on the actual game, although the collections will live on DraftKings’ marketplace. Some NFT gaming projects exist, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725083/axie-infinity-sky-mavis-blockchain-economy-game-pokemon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axie Infinity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; however, a significant proportion of its player base consists of previously unbanked people in the Philippines. Still, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22822590/sports-betting-streaming-wars-disney-dazn-fubo-tv-sling"&gt;when even Disney-owned ESPN is looking for a way into sports betting&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not surprising that online bookmakers are taking a chance on NFTs in an attempt to be the first in a new area.&lt;/p&gt;
