    <title>Nicolas Cage takes on his most challenging role yet: Nicolas Cage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vtzn9Egdvb1tCROeGnp4DJAcXXo=/176x0:859x455/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269963/Screen_Shot_2021_12_14_at_11.56.33_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zg3XLe"&gt;Do you ever watch a Nicolas Cage movie and think, “He just wasn’t Nick Cage enough for me”? Well, that shouldn’t be a problem in &lt;em&gt;The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming movie in which Cage plays himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xHqht"&gt;It’s described as an “action-adventure,” and the premise is something else:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UQwFKB"&gt;Creatively unfulfilled and facing financial ruin, the fictionalized version of Cage must accept a $1 million offer to attend the birthday of a dangerous superfan (Pedro Pascal). Things take a wildly unexpected turn when Cage is recruited by a CIA operative (Tiffany Haddish) and forced to live up to his own legend, channeling his most iconic and beloved on-screen characters in order to save himself and his loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="j2bq2m"&gt;The first teaser looks appropriately ridiculous, with Cage hamming it up in the best way, seemingly very much in on the joke. It kind of makes me want to watch &lt;em&gt;The Croods 2 &lt;/em&gt;— and maybe even revisit&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260020/prisoners-of-the-ghostland-review-sundance-nic-cage-sion-sono"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prisoners of the Ghostland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The movie is coming to theaters on April 22nd, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nomad adds magnets to its Base Station wireless charger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0-NCiB5ih0nq1SmsE7K1Go1l4fw=/0x0:5899x3933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269880/856500018928_Lifestyle_10.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nomad Base Station Hub with magnetic alignment&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nomad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2D1pWM"&gt;Nomad is updating its line of wireless chargers with the latest version of the Base Station Hub. A multi-device charger that can wirelessly charge up to two devices at the same time, plus charge two more devices through its USB ports, the new Base Station Hub now has embedded magnets to help align devices in the right spot on the pad. The new Hub costs $119.95 and is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeNomadBaseStation121421/https://nomadgoods.com/products/base-station-hub-magnetic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for purchase starting today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMjCHA"&gt;Aside from the magnets, the new Hub is very similar to &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeNomadBaseStation121421/https://nomadgoods.com/products/base-station-hub" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nomad’s prior version&lt;/a&gt;. It has three charging coils under a leather pad that are each capable of up to 10W charging (iPhones will be limited to 7.5W). On the back of the charger is an 18W USB-C port and a 7.5W USB-A port for other devices. Nomad also sells an attachment that affixes to the back of the Hub and holds an Apple Watch charger (not included) that you plug into one of the USB ports on the back or a separate brick. It’s less elegant than the multi-device chargers that have Apple Watch chargers built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8BAkh"&gt;The biggest challenge with wireless charging pads is making sure your phone or device is put in the right place to actually charge. That’s where the magnets in the new Hub come in: they make it easy to tell when your compatible iPhone (12 or newer), AirPods, or even a Google Pixel 6 is in the right spot to charge efficiently. The magnets are not as strong as those in Apple’s MagSafe charger or most MagSafe accessories — they aren’t designed to hold your phone in place if an earthquake happens. But they do noticeably attach and align the phone in the right place when you put it down, which is the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zytiU21ytftKWHObC2sfBOyWuQg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085820/856500018928_G.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nomad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under the Base Station Hub’s leather pad are three charging coils surrounded by magnets, which help align compatible devices so they charge efficiently.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="11PnIJ"&gt;The Base Station Hub is not as ambitious as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21399941/nomad-base-station-pro-review-wireless-charger-aira-freepower-price"&gt;Nomad’s old Base Station Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which used a complex array of charging coils and was meant to let you just plop your phone down wherever and have it charge. But that device had significant limitations and compatibility issues with phones that used MagSafe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obtjdT"&gt;Ultimately, when it comes to wireless chargers, the most important thing is knowing that your device will charge when you place it down. The new Base Station Hub makes that just a little bit easier than before.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp can now preview voice messages before sending them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/llb-JE3s_wIFpKmWNVgR8FU6ggo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269844/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjCsng"&gt;WhatsApp has recently released a preview feature for voice messages, letting you check whether your ramblings vaguely make sense before inflicting them on others. The Meta-owned messaging service said that the feature has been slowly rolling out in recent weeks, and that it’s now available across all platforms including iOS, Android, web, and desktop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7n07ZX"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/chats/how-to-preview-a-voice-message/?lang=en"&gt;help page for the feature&lt;/a&gt;, the option to preview a voice message appears after you press the stop button to finish a recording. You can then preview it with the triangular play icon, delete it with the trash can icon, or send it with the send button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AdGHKq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They’re not mistakes, they’re rehearsals. Now you can preview your voice messages before you hit send. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ohnEVrGTvD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ohnEVrGTvD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WhatsApp (@WhatsApp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp/status/1470801332118474758?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="prcahL"&gt;Audio previews are one part of a flurry of new updates that have either been released or are reportedly in development around WhatsApp’s voice message feature. Earlier this year, the service added the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/05/22/whatsapp-beta-gets-playback-speed-options-for-voice-messages/"&gt;adjust the playback speed of voice notes during listening&lt;/a&gt; (perfect for quickly getting through long and rambling messages), and &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-working-on-the-ability-to-pause-voice-recordings/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll also soon be possible to pause and resume recording of a voice message. We’ve been able to verify that the latter feature is available in the beta version of WhatsApp for iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43IJUe"&gt;But more interesting features may be on the horizon. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671185/whatsapp-voice-notes-transcription-ios"&gt;WhatsApp confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it was in the early stages of developing a new voice transcription feature that could one day allow you to read a transcription of a voice message rather than listening to it. Then, in October, &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-working-on-a-global-voice-message-player/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that it had also found signs of a “global voice message player” feature that would let users listen to voice notes while browsing other WhatsApp chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Cq9G1"&gt;There’s no information available as to when (or even if, in some cases) WhatsApp may roll out these new voice message features. But being able to preview a voice note before sending it is a promising start.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former FCC officials are worried about air safety fears delaying 5G rollout</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yy5gINqsvBIFWWrMcbOmPWXC7lk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269778/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PJOxGH"&gt;US mobile carriers are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;delaying their 5G rollout&lt;/a&gt; thanks to an ongoing spat between two government agencies, and it doesn’t look like the situation will be resolving soon. As &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-13/six-former-fcc-chiefs-concerned-over-aviation-agency-5g-stance?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a group of six former FCC chiefs have sent a letter dated this Monday saying they were “concerned about the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) recent efforts to revisit the FCC’s 2020 decision” to open up the C-band to 5G applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIBL4R"&gt;At heart, the argument is between the federal agencies tasked with regulating airplanes and airwaves: the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The agencies disagree about whether it’s safe to allow 5G equipment to operate within a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum known as the C-band. The FAA says that doing so threatens the safety of aircraft, as 5G signals could interfere with the operation of certain altimeters (used to measure height above the ground). The FCC is complying with the FAA’s requests, but some third-party experts say these air safety fears are overblown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="67hVg7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The FAA position threatens to derail the reasoned conclusions reached by the FCC”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sMUkCx"&gt;“The FAA position threatens to derail the reasoned conclusions reached by the FCC after years of technical analysis and study,” said the authors of the recent letter, former FCC chiefs Ajit Pai, Tom Wheeler, Mignon Clyburn, Julius Genachowski, Michael Copps, and Michael Powell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xepu8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports that the letter was sent to current FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel and Evelyn Remaley, acting assistant secretary of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (another agency involved in telecoms regulation). The letter reportedly encourages the FCC and the FAA to work together in finding a solution for this problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYOfDx"&gt;As a result of the FAA’s objections, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have delayed the expansion of their 5G networks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;until at least January 5th&lt;/a&gt;. That expansion was set to use the C-band spectrum, which the FAA says threatens aircraft safety. And just last week, the FAA ruled that certain aircraft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822875/5g-faa-rule-c-band-landing-airport-bad-weather-visibility"&gt;would not be able to land using guided and automatic systems&lt;/a&gt; because of worries these programs could be affected by 5G equipment. The result of this may well be flight delays, thought it’s impossible to say how widespread these problems could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aw2btY"&gt;But for some industry watchers, the delay to the 5G rollout isn’t just frustrating — it’s nonsensical. They argue that a key FAA study supposedly showing 5G interference with altimeters doesn’t really support the agency’s claims, and note that 40 other countries have already approved or operate 5G equipment in the worrisome C-band without any trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14ZEqE"&gt;“Either physics works differently in the US, or the report at the center of this controversy needs to explain why [interference] hasn’t shown up in any other country where deployments are either authorized or have already taken place,” writes Harold Feld, a senior vice president of the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, in an &lt;a href="https://wetmachine.com/tales-of-the-sausage-factory/what-the-eff-faa-my-insanely-long-field-guide-to-the-faa-fcc-5g-c-band-fight/"&gt;excellent explainer on the spat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGcE71"&gt;How, exactly, the two agencies will find a resolution and stop fighting over the airwaves is unclear. In a statement reacting to the FCC letter, the FAA told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;: “[W]e continue to work with federal agencies and the wireless companies.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use the iPhone’s new App Privacy Report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i6oUxAjmsCkK_KjPTdkuTVnGPHU=/0x0:828x552/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269752/IMG_F070E3C6CB84_1.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vk9q6w"&gt;Information is power, and if you’re an iPhone user, you can now get more information about how often your apps access your data (for example, your location or your microphone). The App Privacy Report, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22828226/apple-ios-15-2-iphone-update-digital-legacy-music-macro-app-privacy"&gt;which became available with iOS 15.2&lt;/a&gt;, also lets you know each app’s web activity and what domains they attach to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDSraO"&gt;The feature is off by default, but if your phone has updated to iOS 15.2, it’s very simple to turn on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2r1zTG"&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; App Privacy Report (which will be at the bottom of the screen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1Y0O6T"&gt;Select “Turn On App Privacy Report”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select App Privacy Report at the bottom of the Privacy screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yKPTeO3dThT9NxG1w_fPngDa7b0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087106/IMG_653BB478D14B_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select App Privacy Report at the bottom of the Privacy screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Just turn on the App Privacy Report — and wait." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6utjPixE2dw2VdXXtsROd6Zt7lw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087084/IMG_83D5CB8F00B6_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just turn on the App Privacy Report — and wait.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4GD0oA"&gt;After that, you can follow the same series of selections to see your report. (You can also use &lt;a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/71047d5a577b488397247b7a1081e0fd"&gt;this Shortcut&lt;/a&gt; for quicker access right from your home screen or a Siri voice command.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsjoYu"&gt;You won’t immediately see any data — it takes time for your phone to collect the data and assemble the report, but you can start to see results in just a few minutes. The report will let you know the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="IrZ5Yz"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Which apps accessed your data within the last seven days.&lt;/strong&gt; If you tap on one of the apps listed, you will be able to see exactly when the last accesses were. You will probably have to drill down a couple of pages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Privacy Report will give you data on what your apps are accessing." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4xNc2Vp6I4pxQCM1BlxqR_7fS8U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087108/IMG_F070E3C6CB84_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Privacy Report will give you data on what your apps are accessing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on an app and you can see when it last accessed your data." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ox00JIa17EWKJx5AKgAOa1bOlA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087111/IMG_181DDC094B17_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on an app and you can see when it last accessed your data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Sp65IE"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;App network activity. &lt;/strong&gt;Tap on the app, and you’ll see which domains were contacted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also see each app’s network activity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Tap on the network in turn, and see if other apps have used it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dn5JKrw-M24SXjPt7SB9SVfHd1Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087118/IMG_B05CA8F67FC8_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on the network in turn, and see if other apps have used it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Toyota’s electric vehicle plans are getting bigger and more expensive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ycSCHiwIbdzrftl2sDBTLWoSpxg=/313x0:3688x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269647/20211214_BEV_06.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lpDFL3"&gt;Toyota is ramping up its electric vehicle production schedule, vowing to release 30 electric vehicles by 2030 rather than just 15 EVs by 2025, as was previously promised. The Japanese automaker also vowed to sell 3.5 million battery EVs globally by 2030 and to transform Lexus into an EV-only brand by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKQa9D"&gt;The company said it would invest 2 trillion yen ($17.6 billion) in battery vehicle technology, an increase over its previous commitment of 1.5 trillion yen ($13.6 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q47Zfx"&gt;Toyota was an early pioneer in electrification, helping pave the way for companies like Tesla and others by proving that vehicles with alternative powertrains could be immensely popular. But the company has since fallen far behind its competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WDyBfR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota was an early pioneer in hybrid tech but has since fallen far behind its competitors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EJas62"&gt;Companies like Nissan, General Motors, and Volkswagen have been selling pure battery-electric vehicles for years while also revealing their plans to phase out gas cars completely. Toyota, meanwhile, has yet to release a long-range electric vehicle. And the company’s top executives, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/17/toyota-ceo-lack-of-vision-spreads-ev-misinformation-spells-the-end/"&gt;including billionaire CEO Akio Toyoda&lt;/a&gt;, have been on the record calling the trend toward electric vehicles “overhyped” in part because of emissions associated with power plants — which is a favorite talking point used by the oil and gas industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TmugB4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10919409"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aoYaR6"&gt;But in an event Tuesday, Toyoda changed his tune, touting the need for the company to reduce tailpipe emissions by releasing more EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PCCMJ"&gt;“I believe that achieving carbon neutrality means realizing a world in which all people living on this planet continue to live happily,” Toyoda said. “We want to help realize such a world. This has been and will continue to be Toyota’s wish and our mission as a global company. For that challenge, we need to reduce CO2 emissions as much as possible, as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goZmwu"&gt;As part of the announcement, Toyota showed several dozen concept vehicles, including sedans, sports cars, crossovers, SUVs, pickup trucks, and even a couple of boxy shuttles. The company didn’t release many details about each vehicle but did note that a planned Lexus sports car would have a “cruising range” of 700 km (434 miles) and be able to accelerate from 0 to 60mph in under two seconds. Toyota’s first long-range EV, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22752539/toyota-bz4x-electric-suv-steering-yoke-solar-roof"&gt;the BZ4X compact SUV&lt;/a&gt;, is expected to be released in the US in mid-2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FPio05"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota is planning on spending some of its promised $17.6 billion in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pwpnfe"&gt;Toyota is planning on spending some of its promised $17.6 billion in the US. The company recently announced a $1.29 billion battery factory in North Carolina as part of its plan to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662236/toyota-battery-investment-electric-cars-hybrids-2030"&gt;invest around $13.6 billion in battery tech&lt;/a&gt; over the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QepYs5"&gt;But despite its expanding commitment to EVs, Toyota is still spending a lot of money in Washington, DC, to lobby against President Joe Biden’s efforts to encourage Americans to buy more EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtSoOJ"&gt;Congressional Democrats have proposed increasing the federal EV tax credit from $7,500 to $12,500 for purchases of electric vehicles made in the US by unionized workers, triggering a backlash from non-union companies like Tesla and Toyota. The Japanese automaker has &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qll6xa/toyota_full_page_ad_in_the_wsj_screams_antiunion/"&gt;run full-page newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; accusing Biden and the Democrats of “play[ing] politics with the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first trailer for Everything Everywhere All At Once reveals what we all want: a Michelle Yeoh multiverse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BjfY4UCgHS7s7yGQoodcxRPm_8c=/387x0:2225x1225/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269572/michelle_yeoh_everywhere_all_at_once.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Michelle Yeoh in Everywhere All At Once | Screenshot by Emma Roth / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ePqpAp"&gt;The title &lt;em&gt;Everything Everywhere All At Once&lt;/em&gt; rings true — Michelle Yeoh is, in fact, everywhere all at once in this new film, directed by the Daniels duo, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, the same team behind the absurd &lt;em&gt;Swiss Army Man&lt;/em&gt; featuring yet another Daniel: Daniel Radcliffe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ceggze"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yeoh stars as “an exhausted Chinese American woman who can’t seem to finish her taxes”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PIySej"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://a24films.com/films/everything-everywhere-all-at-once"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything Everywhere All At Once&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Yeoh stars as “an exhausted Chinese American woman who can’t seem to finish her taxes,” but there’s obviously a lot more to the film than just that. The trailer opens with Yeoh, aka Evelyn Wang, discussing her finances with an almost unrecognizable Jamie Lee Curtis. Suddenly, she’s flung into another universe — via a rolling office chair — and the lens that we’re viewing Yeoh through cracks, her face reflected in different multiple shards. She has entered the multiverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7eVve"&gt;Yeoh is then greeted by her alternate universe husband, who tells her she must stop a “great evil” that’s spreading throughout every parallel universe. Lucky for Yeoh, she’s able to access all the different versions of herself, giving her the skills and memories of each variation, whether that includes some kick-ass fighting, sign spinning, or acting as a professional chef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aN5sls"&gt;Maybe it’s just seeing Curtis that gives me &lt;em&gt;Freaky Friday&lt;/em&gt; vibes (yes, the one with Lindsay Lohan), but watching Yeoh slipping between different universes and entering a different role in each one reminds me of the chaos that comes with suddenly inhabiting someone else’s body — except this time, it’s her own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaRa9V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything Everywhere All At Once&lt;/em&gt; is set to debut on March 25th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbCFhz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s Luna laptop concept is all about repairability </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F-M6PS7VGpuJcA2BtMvx-IrQFtw=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269566/Concept_Luna_Front_view_no_disclaimer.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kzj6X4"&gt;On Tuesday, Dell announced a new design concept for a laptop that’s long lived, easy to take apart and fix, and takes a smaller toll on the climate. It’s a collection of ideas that could go a long way toward making the tech giant’s products more sustainable — depending on whether, and how, Dell decides to implement them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2kSpy"&gt;Called “Concept Luna,” the proof-of-concept laptop dreamed up by Dell’s design team has a number of unusual features that are intended to make repair and maintenance easy. No screwdrivers or glue solvents are needed to pry loose a broken keyboard or peel off a cracked screen; both components simply pop free after a pair of keystones holding them in place are removed. The entire system contains far fewer screws than a typical Dell laptop, reducing the time needed to replace components. And you’ll never have to worry about replacing a broken fan, because there isn’t one: a shrunken-down motherboard placed in the top cover allows the laptop to passively cool itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YuS22J"&gt;Dell design strategist Drew Tosh described Luna as a “front end concept” intended to “solve some of the larger problems we’re trying to get ahead of in the future,” namely &lt;a href="https://corporate.delltechnologies.com/en-us/social-impact/advancing-sustainability/sustainable-products-and-services/materials-use/recycled-materials.htm"&gt;e-waste&lt;/a&gt; and climate change. A laptop that is easy to repair and upgrade is less likely to be replaced with a new one that takes yet more energy and resources to produce. When that computer eventually does stop working, parts can be harvested to live on in other machines rather than winding up as toxic trash in landfills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77TvQl"&gt;“We’re really focused on reuse and recycle,” Tosh told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;“And really, it would be more like reuse, reuse, reuse, and recycle only when we really have to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bxKslh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10918234"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EKMmQ4"&gt;So far, only several prototype versions of this laptop exist. But the design Dell is showing off is as sleek and portable as any laptop in the company’s current lineup. If a modern-looking laptop with these sorts of features can be mass produced, it would make it that much harder for other leading consumer tech brands &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/nixing-fix-ftc-report-congress-repair-restrictions/nixing_the_fix_report_final_5521_630pm-508_002.pdf"&gt;to argue&lt;/a&gt; there’s an inherent tradeoff between repairability and design.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1gAJx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FUser%2F2567860%2FTaylor%2BDixon&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F14%2F22832895%2Fdell-luna-sustainable-laptop-concept-repairability-recyclable-environment" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Taylor Dixon&lt;/a&gt;, a teardown engineer at the repair guide site iFixit, says that overall, Dell laptops tend to be “fairly repairable” compared with competitors like MacBooks. Recent models of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FDell%2BXPS%2B13%2BTeardown%2F36157&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F14%2F22832895%2Fdell-luna-sustainable-laptop-concept-repairability-recyclable-environment" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4IUfNevmCU"&gt;and 15&lt;/a&gt; that Dixon has worked on feature common types of screws such as Phillips head, batteries that are fastened in place rather than glued down, and screens that are relatively easy to disassemble. And in stark contrast to Apple, Dell regularly publishes &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/products?app=manuals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;repair manuals&lt;/a&gt; for its laptops on its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ps8bsz"&gt;Still, there’s room for Dell to improve, and reducing the overall number of screws inside its machines — Dell says that Concept Luna features ten times fewer screws than the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=Latitude+7300+AE+LCA+dell&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8"&gt;Latitude 7300 AE&lt;/a&gt; — is “cautiously a great thing,” says Dixon. Replacing screws outright through the use of keystones, as Dell is proposing to do for Concept Luna’s screen and keyboard assembly, could make DIY repair even simpler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDt9jz"&gt;“If you can just use your hand to take something apart, that’s better than screws or adhesives,” Dixon says, adding that Dutch smartphone maker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716194/fairphone-4-review"&gt;Fairphone&lt;/a&gt; and San Francisco-based laptop startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587205/framework-laptop-review"&gt;Framework&lt;/a&gt; have helped pioneer screw-free design alternatives like clips and magnetic bezels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="O33keT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Really, it would be more like reuse, reuse, reuse, and recycle only when we really have to.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3KEeed"&gt;Other ideas in Concept Luna are more focused on the climate impact of electronics. The aluminum in the chassis is smelted using hydropower energy, replacing what is often one of the &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/f-gas-partnership-programs/aluminum-industry"&gt;dirtiest manufacturing steps&lt;/a&gt; with a low-carbon alternative. The motherboard is a quarter the size of the board in the Latitude 7300 AE, and according to Dell, it could have a 50 percent smaller carbon footprint. A &lt;a href="https://corporate.delltechnologies.com/content/dam/digitalassets/active/en/unauth/data-sheets/products/laptops/lca-latitude_7300_25th_anniv_notebook.pdf"&gt;life cycle analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the Latitude 7300 AE found that manufacturing accounted for 65 percent of the device’s climate impact and printed wire boards were the most energy-intensive components to make. Considering Dell’s &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-pc-shipments-q3-2021/"&gt;leading position&lt;/a&gt; in the global laptop market, this level of carbon cutting on an individual parts basis could translate to significant reductions across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lmX13"&gt;But while shrinking the motherboard may have climate benefits, it also raises a repairability red flag for Dixon: smaller boards, he says, tend to have less room for individual components and sockets to hold them in place. Integrated parts like Apple’s M1 chip, which includes CPU, GPU, and RAM all in one place, are well-suited to small boards, and while this technology is great for efficiency and performance, repair advocates have &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F46884%2Fm1-macbook-teardowns-something-old-something-new&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F14%2F22832895%2Fdell-luna-sustainable-laptop-concept-repairability-recyclable-environment" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;described it&lt;/a&gt; as “devastating” that the memory and storage on M1 devices &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/06/theoretically-you-can-upgrade-ram-ssd-on-your-m1-mac-mini-but-you-shouldnt"&gt;can’t be upgraded&lt;/a&gt;. Dell told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Concept Luna’s board “doesn’t have any more soldered on or integrated components than a typical laptop we sell today,” but if that changes as this idea moves from renderings to reality, it could impact the longevity of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jMNHhlwGTe-ZGL04gMOeqC7iHOc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085537/Concept_Luna_Materials_Exploration_no_disclaimer.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solutions shown are concept designs and not available for purchase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IzqLvH"&gt;Another key factor determining how long lived any laptop will be is the availability of spare parts for repair — most importantly, screens and batteries, which are “the key components that govern the life of the product,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.essie.ufl.edu/people/name/sara-behdad/"&gt;Sara Behdad&lt;/a&gt;, a sustainable electronics design researcher at the University of Florida. Page Motes, who heads global sustainability at Dell, says that individuals can already order “tens of thousands” of spare parts from Dell, including replacement screens and batteries, however, these components are &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/pfydresults/270432?categoryId=7566" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;often&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/pfydresults/268466?categoryId=7566" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;unavailable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-ie/work/shop/pfydresults/6243294?categoryId=7566" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for purchase&lt;/a&gt; online. Motes says that increasing the number of spare parts customers can buy online is “something we are working on right now.” While she wouldn’t comment on future spare parts plans related to Concept Luna, one would hope that would include parts for any future laptops designed to be long lived and easily fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PcRvSf"&gt;Finally, if the idea behind Concept Luna is a laptop that can be upgraded indefinitely, all of the components not only need to be available but future-proofed. Otherwise, new innovations risk making earlier models obsolete &lt;em&gt;a la&lt;/em&gt; Dell’s own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;Alienware Area-51m&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktenLK"&gt;All of these considerations hinge, of course, on the ideas in Concept Luna eventually trickling into consumer products. That won’t happen next year, Tosh said, considering that Dell still needs to take time to validate that the concepts are reliable enough for mass production. But by 2030, he would “certainly expect” many of these design concepts to be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8evfn"&gt;“I think the great excitement with this alpha [design] is that we’ve got an example that it’s possible,” says Motes. “And we’re not doing this because it’s fun. We are doing this because we want this to be the future of our work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oM5l0u"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10SsDP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matter’s plan to save the smart home </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HH3xc4NgYaMz_QI9ezoQSF9g1nQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268903/acastro_211117_4887_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Matter is a new standard that promises to fix smart home interoperability — but can it deliver?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="t5qLmO"&gt;The smart home should be a natural evolution of our homes, bringing better appliances, better systems, better experiences. But to date, it’s been complicated, confusing, and expensive. Walled gardens have stifled innovation as developers focus on getting their devices to work with three or four or more different platforms rather than spending their time creating better products and new features. Consumers spend too much energy figuring out which product works with which and then troubleshooting those connections, before often giving up on the whole thing. This has led to a slower smart home adoption than many expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCtd7u"&gt;What the smart home needs, and has needed for a long time, is a universal connectivity standard — a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21028256/smart-home-standard-google-apple-amazon-alexa-siri-zigbee-choip"&gt;basic level of common plumbing in our homes&lt;/a&gt; for everything to flow through. Just as we chose VHS over Betamax in the ’80s (and Blu-ray over HD-DVD in the early 2000s) for a better home theater experience,  so we need to choose a smart home standard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EsEraa"&gt;The problem is there aren’t two or three standards to choose from. There are many, and none of them work very well on their own. Zigbee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth have all tried and failed to become the primary radio protocol of the smart home. But none have gained enough traction or offered enough flexibility to fit into all corners of the smart home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xn2P9z"&gt;That’s where Matter comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-M-Z-nOK7Q7nT95Yzp7aVixVZfU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079856/acastro_4887_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vtaYcE"&gt;Buy a gadget, plug it in, and it will work with the rest of your smart home. Set up that new device with your favorite smart home app, and control it with your voice assistant of choice, no matter who made it. This may sound like some distant smart home nirvana, but this is the promise of Matter. The simple smart home could be just around the corner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ow3RE"&gt;An open-sourced connectivity standard created by over 200 companies, Matter is a communication protocol that leverages existing technologies — Thread, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ethernet — to allow all of your devices to communicate with each other locally, without the need for a cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="M2Fle3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Buy a gadget, plug it in, and it will work with the rest of your smart home&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qUilte"&gt;What makes Matter more than just another smart home standard is momentum; most of the industry is on board. Organized by the Connectivity Standards Alliance (or CSA, formerly the Zigbee Alliance), Matter is being developed by Amazon, Apple, Google / Nest, and Samsung, alongside many other smart home and smart home-adjacent companies, including Wyze, iRobot, Signify (Philips Hue), Ecobee, &lt;a href="https://buildwithmatter.com/"&gt;and more&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVbU8O"&gt;Driven by a shared need to fix the problems of the smart home, these companies are working together to figure out how to make this standard be the one that sticks. Can Matter finally bring an end to the confusion perfectly encapsulated by Randall Munroe’s classic xkcd “&lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/927/"&gt;Standards&lt;/a&gt;” comic?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rNB9Yx"&gt;“This is a Renaissance [for the smart home]” says Tobin Richardson, president and CEO of the CSA. “Most of the industry, if not all the industry have agreed that [Matter] is going to be the way this will happen.” They are seemingly all on board with the fact that Matter is the solution to the smart home’s biggest problems — simplicity, interoperability, reliability, and security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhf5Ct"&gt;The final Matter specification, SDK, and certification program should be ready by mid-2022, and the goal is to have the first Matter-certified devices available by the end of 2022, says Richardson. That’s over a year later than promised when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21027890/apple-google-amazon-smart-home-standard-zigbee-connected-ip-project"&gt;Matter first launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but better late than never.&lt;/p&gt;

Otherwise, read on to learn about how Matter is going to fix the smart home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="up26W0"&gt;What is Matter, and why is it different?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="zL4HCM"&gt;Matter is a unified connectivity technology for the smart home. It is not a smart home platform like Apple HomeKit, Google Home, and Amazon’s Alexa. Matter doesn’t automate or control your home; it simply provides the pipes and language for devices to communicate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ow3IDq"&gt;Its unique feature is it’s an IP-based technology, meaning it uses the same mechanisms to communicate as the internet. So, there is no dependency on bridges or hubs, and yes, you will (eventually) be able to get rid of all those white boxes hooked up to your modem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGjgMI"&gt;To simplify adoption, Matter will start as an application layer on top of existing IP technologies, including ethernet, Wi-Fi, Thread, and Bluetooth (for device provisioning). This means Matter is not reinventing the wheel; it’s adding better technology to the highways our smart homes are driving on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sr_XaQQMw4yPG4CCnnPWSA7QnDk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084404/start_developing_with_matter_graphic.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Silicon Labs&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Matter network map from Silicon Labs shows how devices will connect to each other, to the internet, and to other protocols using Wi-Fi, Thread, and Matter controllers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x5QDBu"&gt;Once in your home, Matter devices can operate entirely locally, talking to each other over Thread and Wi-Fi and not going through the cloud. That means if your internet goes down, your smart home will still work. Devices will still need to communicate with the internet for out-of-home control and firmware and security upgrades, which will happen directly or through a Matter controller device (i.e., a smart speaker, smartphone, or bridge). Local control is a significant step in maintaining privacy in the smart home, a big concern for people when considering installing smart home devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wACI89"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Smart home company Eve plans to use Matter to move beyond Apple’s HomeKit ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"},{"title":"Google commits to Matter, promises future interoperability between smart home platforms ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738584/google-smart-home-developer-summit-2021-matter-thread"},{"title":"Samsung promises Matter support for SmartThings hubs, Galaxy devices, TVs, and fridges ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22745664/samsung-smartthings-matter-support-products-galaxy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eQBxti"&gt;Smart home company Eve built its entire business model on local control. “Our privacy platform is ‘what’s at home stays at home,’” Jerome Gackel, Eve Systems CEO, tells me. “With Matter, you do not need a cloud — you can have one, but it’s not a requirement.” Its commitment to avoiding cloud control is why Eve devices have been iPhone- and HomeKit-only thus far. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"&gt;But with Matter, Eve can move to the other platforms while remaining entirely local&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Z8145w"&gt;What is Thread, and why is it better?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="xzuPtx"&gt;Thread is one of the key technologies of Matter. It promises to make the smart home more robust. Like Z-Wave and Zigbee, Thread is a low-power mesh networking protocol. “Networking is one of the biggest problems of the smart home; sensors and devices dropping offline,” says Tony Fadell, founder of Nest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RYWAK"&gt;Nest first developed Thread and the precursor to Matter, Weave, in 2014. Thread’s big selling points are speed and reliability. A motion sensor will turn your lights on in a millisecond compared to a second, and your network won’t go down because you accidentally unplugged the hub, as — with enough devices deployed — a Thread network can self-heal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1DXX7rddXUr9CI8ZEM-AOaIqdQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079855/acastro_4887_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UidoTm"&gt;Unlike Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, Thread was specifically developed as a smart home protocol. Other protocols used in the smart home to date have been co-opted into that role, meaning they have practical and usability issues. Wi-Fi is too power-hungry for battery-powered devices. Bluetooth has range limitations. Zigbee and Z-Wave require dedicated hubs, which are cumbersome to set up and maintain and can be a single point of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="rgpygN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Matter is not reinventing the wheel; it’s adding better technology to the highways our smart homes are driving on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xOt5EO"&gt;Thread began in Nest’s earliest days. “Every single Nest thermostat since the beginning has shipped with a Zigbee radio inside, a connection for a long-distance, low-power protocol,” says Fadell. The idea was to future-proof a device likely to stay in the home for 10 to 20 years. “We wanted it to be able to talk to the future smart home,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="5W7LAL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10917556"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jGPb0G"&gt;But Zigbee wasn’t progressing fast enough for the Nest team, so they worked with Silicon Labs to develop Thread, which, in technical terms, is a Zigbee hardware stack with a software layer on top. “We knew what needed to happen — we needed a home IP-based mesh network with low-power range,” says Fadell. “The key is it’s IP native.” Low-power radios in the smart home have needed a hub or bridge to talk to the internet, but that problem went away by making Thread IP native. “That is what is so powerful about it,” says Fadell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbCEvG"&gt;Eve was one of the first smart home companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22310378/eve-smart-home-thread-plug-home-kit-weather-station-price-specs-features"&gt;to adopt Thread&lt;/a&gt;, and today, it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"&gt;working toward&lt;/a&gt; running all of its relevant products on the protocol, having shifted over from Bluetooth. “Thread has really changed the reliability of our product, especially in terms of automation,” says Eve’s Gackel. “The difference between our Bluetooth product and Thread product experience has really increased customer satisfaction.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzG3vv"&gt;Thread devices can be battery-powered or wall-powered, and the latter can be a Thread border router, a bridge between a Wi-Fi and Thread network. But a border router isn’t a typical white plastic box type of bridge that plugs into your router. The tech will be built into any device with an always-on power source and can be placed anywhere in your home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HhyyS"&gt;A smart plug, smart speaker, fridge, TV, thermostat, and Wi-Fi access point can all be Thread border routers. “As you add more border routers in the home, you get better range and reliability,” explains Kevin Po, senior product manager at Google and a member of the CSA board. Case in point, the aesthetically pleasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466594/nanoleaf-elements-light-panel-smart-home-price-release"&gt;Nanoleaf Shapes and Elements light panels are also Thread border routers&lt;/a&gt;, with a smidge more pizazz than a white plastic box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPRjYl"&gt;A border router is like a mailman: it routes the different packets of information. Unlike a smart home hub, it doesn’t know what’s in those packets or control them. If a smart speaker wants to know the state of a lock, the border router can tell it without ever knowing the state itself. “From an end-to-end security perspective, that routing aspect provides a lot of benefits,” says Po.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7H15wWa4XdQiKA-u_uMYDtxrcm4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084334/Thread_home_network.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Thread Group&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This image illustrates how Thread border routers connect a thread network to the internet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H2UoA3"&gt;While Z-Wave and Zigbee will continue to be part of the smart home — existing hubs can be upgraded to Thread or bridged to Matter — it seems possible these technologies will be phased out in the residential setting. “It would certainly seem, if everything is executed as promised, that it will make sense to move towards Matter products,” says Mitch Klein, executive director of the Z-Wave Alliance. “That’s a big ‘if,’ however, and there are other questions in terms of security still.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FH0cQK"&gt;Because Matter devices can speak straight to the internet, that potentially exposes them to hacking or malware, says Klein. &lt;a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matter-Security-Privacy_one-pager.pdf"&gt;Matter’s security approach&lt;/a&gt; is “strong, agile (to address the evolution of things like encryption types over time), and proactive, with a community of members who do threat modeling and mitigation,” says Richardson of the CSA. IP control is central to the function of Matter, and Richardson argues that the approach is one of resilient security while still getting the benefits of an IP-connected world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="NAK1hc"&gt;How will devices work in a Matter smart home?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="AOEu7g"&gt;The Matter home will need a Wi-Fi access point and a Matter controller. This can be a smartphone or tablet, but it can also be a Thread border router that works with your preferred smart home ecosystem — such as an Amazon Echo speaker, an Apple HomePod Mini, a Google Nest Hub, or a Samsung SmartThings hub. While devices will work across platforms, automations and routines will not. “If you are using HomeKit, you will need a HomeKit hub,” explains Gackel. “A Google hub will not run HomeKit automations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18wsbx"&gt;A Matter home will be able to incorporate any smart home device that is Matter certified. (The Matter logo on a product will indicate that it’s compatible.) You will also be able to set up any Matter device with your controller app, similar to how Apple’s HomeKit works today. All this means that when you buy a new product — such as a lightbulb or door lock — if it has a Matter logo, you won’t need to worry about what it works with; it will just work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EzZFQeRI68rbbFLbOOvkuQFJUvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079854/acastro_4887_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="omRzdU"&gt;It will also be simpler to set up. Amazon’s Frustration-Free setup is the basis for Matter’s standard setup process, explains Chris DeCenzo, principal software development engineer at Amazon Lab126. It’s designed to enable a “zero-touch” experience, where you take the device out of the box, plug it in, and it connects to your home automatically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvYr8J"&gt;This doesn’t mean there won’t be manufacturer apps, just that you won’t have to use them for setup. Still, in some cases, you will need them to access device-specific features that aren’t available in Matter, and probably to update firmware, although this may happen through Matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="07kogK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies are committing to Matter, but some are still holding a few cards close to their chest.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ye0GAi"&gt;Despite the coming together of the big four smart home companies and the general excitement of the early Matter push, the reality is the smart home will still be a divided one. Matter may provide a basic standard of interoperability and portability, but companies will still seek competitive advantages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hf077"&gt;For example, nothing in the Matter spec requires a Matter controller to support all device categories. If video doorbells become part of Matter in the future, Amazon could choose not to support doorbells in its controller. Amazon’s Ring doorbells already work in the Ring app and with its Echo devices, meaning the company may see no need to develop another doorbell camera controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14a8Uc"&gt;There’s also nothing compelling companies to upgrade products that they don’t want to. Google has said it will update its newest Nest Smart Thermostat to Matter but has not said if any of the three generations of the Nest Learning Thermostat or the Thermostat E will follow suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9K51y"&gt;Amazon has released a slew of new smart home products in 2021, including a thermostat, air quality monitor, and smart switches, with not a mention of Matter compatibility. DeCenzo tells me this doesn’t mean it won’t come, but that’s not exactly a guarantee that it will. “It’s hard for a device maker to make any absolute statements about something they’re going to support that isn’t here today,” he says. “Matter was just an idea when these devices were being developed.”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSoSVS"&gt;Apple has committed to Matter but hasn’t commented on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22824559/matter-tv-streaming-devices-smart-home-casting-protocol-support"&gt;whether it will adopt the Matter TV and Streaming Video player specification&lt;/a&gt; to allow Matter controllers to cast content from smartphones to televisions, similar to how AirPlay works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvRGFc"&gt;On the one hand, companies are committing to Matter, but with the other hand they’re still holding some cards close to their chest. While it’s legitimately tricky to say how you will develop your products for a specification that hasn’t been finalized yet, these companies are all deeply involved in the process, so they are hardly flying blind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="9GBupl"&gt;How will companies differentiate themselves in Matter?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="1PALNF"&gt;Before Matter, compatibility was a huge selling point for devices. You bought a smart lock largely because it worked with your ecosystem of choice. With Matter, that reason should go away. Now, companies will need to innovate on top of the standard to create reasons for you to choose their devices over the competition. “What Matter does is change the game, so companies aren’t competing on connectivity and interoperability, and it’s just there,” says Michelle Mindala-Freeman, head of marketing at Connectivity Standards Alliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbAJeQ"&gt;This would appear to put the big four smart home platforms on an even playing field. If all devices talk to each other, you’re no longer locked into Google’s ecosystem because your preferred door lock only works with Google. While this would seem counter to Google, Amazon etc. selling more devices, what it does is make it easier for each company to innovate and move forward with their respective visions of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22719945/amazon-alexa-dave-limp-interview-ambient-computing-ring-eero-decoder"&gt;smart home&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuEoO9"&gt;Ultimately, if the hardware is commoditized, the value becomes in the service layer your ecosystem of choice adds to your experience. Matter’s specifications are designed to be simple: that door lock will lock and unlock. “Above that, it’s up to the device makers, the platform companies and such to understand how to best innovate,” says Po.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZNHPu2ISjAQ9HIH0veWWCi2RLGo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079853/acastro_4887_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HQGuK0"&gt;If you want more advanced features — such as adaptive lighting or touch-to-unlock — you will go to a platform or manufacturer that supports those. “It will make for a more competitive environment,” says Kevin Kraus, of Yale Residential, part of Assa Abloy. “If you want a fully-featured door lock, you’re likely to buy a Yale lock. But let’s say you’ve got a shed, and you just need something that locks and unlocks, then you might go for something less sophisticated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQDR3K"&gt;Matter should push manufacturers to innovate, too. “We need to focus more on the added value of our products,” said Florian Deleuil of Netatmo in &lt;a href="https://matter-smarthome.de/en/interview-en/matter-is-pretty-changing-the-game/"&gt;a recent interview&lt;/a&gt;. “Otherwise, it could end up being difficult to distinguish our product from that of cheaper and less innovative suppliers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzVx9B"&gt;While it will be more competitive, the thinking is that the market will be much larger. Matter will help the smart home go from niche to mass. “If this is successful, everyone sells more,” says Z-Wave’s Klein. “Market penetration increases, the stagnation of the smart home in terms of growth is going to increase, and new product categories will open up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNKvkw"&gt;Today, you might choose a washing machine because it has an excellent design, a special cycle for athletic wear, and offers good energy and water efficiency. You don’t choose it because it works with Alexa or syncs with your fridge. Going forward, that’s probably how you’ll choose your next smart device. “Both industrial design, the overall physical user experience, and the feature sets that they virtually interact with will drive purchase decisions, not just who it works with,” says Klein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bs8hP"&gt;Matter will also provide wider choice. Today, you may be limited to devices that work with the platform you have set up. With Matter, that restriction should go away. The smart home future — where all devices communicate with each other to help your home run more efficiently, intelligently, and seamlessly — will finally emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rj5xICvNyLceaIMRUUBHTfPr1fE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084331/matter_lkup_rgb_night.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="bNpJsc"&gt;But will it Matter?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="IdBNMP"&gt;In all of the interviews I did for this article, no one had anything negative to say about Matter (on the record). Right now, the industry is aligned on drinking the same Kool-Aid. But Matter is still an idea — albeit one with an unprecedented industry coalition behind it that makes it the most promising development in the smart home since Alexa arrived on the scene. It’s easy to love an idea; it can be harder to implement and stick to one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBsr0h"&gt;Matter’s biggest roadblock is that it’s not here yet, and whether it will arrive as promised is still a large question mark. This is holding some companies back from committing to it or developing products for it today. “We totally believe in the vision and in all the benefits that will come from having a single protocol,” says Amazon’s DeCenzo. “But at the end of the day, we’ve got to get there. And that’s going to be a journey.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="Rns5ld"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is Apple going to go out of its way to make sure Amazon’s products work well with its platform? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nt3pay"&gt;Fadell, who is as excited about the validation of his Thread gamble as a kid at Christmas, is also slightly skeptical. He worries that proprietary moves by companies looking to differentiate products could harm Matter’s overall promise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niOU16"&gt;“Everything can talk to everything in Matter, but that doesn’t mean the experiences will be the same. I can speak French, but am I really French? No,” says Fadell. “It’s the same thing here. If you’re in the Apple ecosystem, sure you may work with other systems in certain ways — but inside Apple, with all the Apple tools, it will be a better experience, and it’s going to stay that way.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6x0NJ9"&gt;Yes, you will be able to use an Apple speaker to control an Amazon device, but is Apple going to go out of its way to make sure Amazon’s products work &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; with its platform? “Unlikely,” says Fadell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZP75wL"&gt;Ultimately, Matter isn’t the solution we — as consumers — have been waiting for. On day one, it’s not going to produce the ambient, self-aware smart home that can respond to your every need without a lick of set-up on our part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQcQSu"&gt;What it is is the solution smart home developers need so that they can start building products and services for that smart home we’re waiting for. “If Matter only changes a couple of things, we will still have a fundamental new technology that works,” says Fadell. “And if it’s adopted — well, let’s see what happens then.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xR0aPU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCXfRy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated Tuesday, December 14, 10:55AM: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clarified what Matter-ready devices are -- those products manufacturers have said will be updated to Matter as soon as the specification is released.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt; A big, satisfying, and occasionally messy conclusion&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="G6J8Jb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; is a film meant to do a lot of things. It’s the third film in the Jon Watts-directed MCU trilogy of Spider-Man films, concluding a storyline for Tom Holland’s incarnation of Peter Parker. It’s a direct sequel to Spider-Man: &lt;em&gt;Far From Home&lt;/em&gt;, picking up where the cliffhanger credit scene of the 2019 film left off. It’s the continuation of the overarching Marvel Cinematic Universe and its “Phase Four” story arc. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; it’s a tribute to the past 20 years of &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTL8lE"&gt;That’s a lot of balls to juggle. And the fact that &lt;em&gt;No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; succeeds in pulling off as many of them as it does is impressive, especially when it comes to the fan service — but much like Peter Parker, this movie can’t have everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzbe8C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoiler warning: this review will reference basic plot details of the movie as revealed in the existing Spider-Man: No Way Home trailers, in addition to spoilers for Spider-Man: Far From Home. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gndWa8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to go in fully unaware, skip this review for now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R6fuRC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; picks up right where its predecessor, &lt;em&gt;Far From Home&lt;/em&gt;, left off. Peter Parker’s secret identity as Spider-Man has been revealed to the world through one last trick of Mysterio, and now everyone blames the webslinger for the villain’s rampage through London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVzeTu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t let Peter get off easy here, at least for the first third of the film, which eschews heroics for grinding down the costumed hero. Half the world hates Peter and thinks he murdered Mysterio. He’s got no idea how to pay for college. (As an aside, given that it’s the third time this plot point has come up in an MCU project this year: did &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of the Avengers get paid? Come on, Tony.) Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is forced to move after her apartment is besieged by reporters and protestors. And his best friend, Ned (Jacob Batalon) and his girlfriend, MJ (Zendaya), get soundly rejected from every college they apply to just for being associated with Peter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="e6HxpF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t let Peter get off easy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PMmdWr"&gt;So in an effort to protect his loved ones, Peter goes to his fellow Avenger Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and asks him to magic away the problem. Naturally, things go awry. The spell cracks open the multiverse and spills out villains from Sony’s previous five Spider-Man movies spanning almost two decades: Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe, reprising his role from &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;), Doc Ock (Alfred Molina, &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man 2&lt;/em&gt;), Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church, &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man 3&lt;/em&gt;), Lizard (Rhys Ifan, &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;), and Electro (Jamie Foxx, &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&lt;/em&gt;). Each bad guy has been snatched up from their moment right before their web-slinging comeuppance and given a fresh chance for revenge on (another) Spider-Man, who has to find them and send them back from whence they came. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtUXsO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; revels in bringing back these characters. Each villain gets his moment in the sun (some briefer than others), and long-time Spider-Man fans will get a thrill of getting to see Doc Ock smash his way through a highway of cars, a devilishly grinning Green Goblin cackling his way from scene to scene, or Jamie Foxx’s Electro not having to be a blue CGI Doctor Manhattan knock off. Dafoe leads the charge, bouncing between his feral and friendly personalities without missing a beat in the intervening 19 years, while Molina’s tortured scientist struggles to control his out-of-control creation. The core cast of Watts’ trilogy is also back. Holland’s take on Peter is his best yet: still fresh-faced and quipping his way through fights while dealing with the increasing weight of actually having to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; Spider-Man. MJ and Ned are more divorced from the action, although Aunt May gets the spotlight in some of the film’s quieter moments to great effect. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eBITuiTVI9PW6yXysThjBWHE_B4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086901/HBX5020_comp_v344.1416.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Columbia Pictures&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q2gQfj"&gt;It’s all extremely fun but harkens back to the same issue all of Holland’s films have had: the smorgasbord of bad guys are once again other character’s foes that Peter just happens to be dealing with, much in the same way that &lt;em&gt;Homecoming&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Far From Home&lt;/em&gt; had him cleaning up Tony Stark’s messes. Peter’s &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt;-esque mirror dimension duel with Doctor Strange almost has more weight than some of the villain fights — at least there, Peter knows his opponent’s name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tyj3ec"&gt;In fact, nearly all of the film’s biggest emotional beats rely on viewer’s knowledge of the previous five Spider-movies, attempting to tie a bow on each villain’s story in addition to offering closure for the characters in the Tom Holland trilogy that &lt;em&gt;No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; ostensibly is intended to wrap up. There’s a lot going on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hJUNWX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pure payoff for two decades of Spider-Man films&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qxxl0l"&gt;Still, once &lt;em&gt;No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; hits its stride, it’s hard to care too much about any of that. Characters and cameos abound in scenes that feel engineered to have fans cheering in theaters. There are big reveals, catchphrases are dutifully recited, and the last hour is basically just pure payoff for two decades of Spider-Man films, handled with a surprising amount of humor and heart despite some darker swings halfway through. Whether you’re a fan of the Sam Raimi, the Marc Webb, or the Jon Watts movies, &lt;em&gt;No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; does its best to please. (Although you’ll definitely get the most mileage if you’ve seen all seven preceding Spider-Man flicks, of course.) It’s all very satisfying for fans, though at times it can feel like the movie is as much about the competing studio interests of Sony and Disney as it is about Spidey himself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZHGVuAk0tDb-4z6z4A49Jldzxqg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086910/domestic_1_stills_for_print_39.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Columbia Pictures&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QlE9j9"&gt;And, as is practically Marvel tradition, &lt;em&gt;No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t let its characters rest, slamming the reset button and sowing the seeds for future sequels, with the now-traditional post-credit scenes setting up more adventures for Spider-Man and Doctor Strange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="NXPARR"&gt;Still, Holland’s incarnation of the character &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; said to be sticking around for another few movies, and &lt;em&gt;No Way Home&lt;/em&gt;’s ending hints at shedding some of Peter’s accrued MCU baggage for a friendlier, more neighborly Spider-Man. So it’s at least possible that future entries will finally let the character soar through the city on his own strengths, instead of just standing on specters of movies past.&lt;/p&gt;
