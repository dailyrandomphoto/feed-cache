    <title>VW is reviving its iconic microbus as an electric robotaxi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JX3w6UcrEKVLHUqkXhosGA6e7-k=/0x0:5041x3361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69821692/IBA_7846.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AvJ2Da"&gt;Five years after Volkswagen first unveiled its concept for an electric version of its iconic microbus, we’re finally getting our first glimpse of the vehicle on the road. But rather than some throwback to an era of hippies and flower power, the ID Buzz is outfitted with a high-tech suite of sensors and computing smarts for its new role as an autonomous test vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bddFee"&gt;VW says the autonomous ID Buzz will serve as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22430813/vw-argo-autonomous-delivery-ride-pooling-germany"&gt;platform for the automaker’s full-scale commercial ride-hailing and delivery operation&lt;/a&gt; that it plans on launching in Germany in 2025. For now, VW plans to deploy the ID Buzz on public roads for testing in Munich, as well as at a private track near the city’s airport. The van made its public debut at the 2021 IAA Mobility Event in Munich, which also saw new concepts from Mercedes-Benz and BMW. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B3yNvd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;VW plans to deploy the ID Buzz on public roads for testing in Munich&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ycqRN"&gt;The vans are using hardware and software developed by Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based startup that is backed by Ford and VW. The automakers formed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20690722/ford-vw-alliance-self-driving-argo-investment-valuation"&gt;“global alliance” back in 2019&lt;/a&gt; to co-develop electric and autonomous vehicles as a way of spread out the costs of what is expected to be an expensive and grueling process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GdyVqC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10737393"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nV0xuQ"&gt;As part of that deal, VW invested a staggering $2.6 billion in Argo, which at the time saw its valuation rise to $7 billion. (That valuation has since increased to $12.4 billion as the company explores a public offering.) Argo opened an office in Munich and absorbed VW’s autonomous driving team that was based there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXa4gQ"&gt;Argo currently uses modified Ford vehicles for its testing in the US and has yet to reveal its own purpose-built AV like some of its competitors. The self-driving ID Buzz will be a more fully realized version of Argo’s AV hardware and software, including the company’s 400-meter range lidar sensors developed in-house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cdq0j7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;VW said that it plans to put the vans in service as a ride-sharing fleet under its subsidiar&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;y Moia&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bz28Dq"&gt;VW said that it plans to put the vans in service as a ride-sharing fleet under its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/6/16733944/moia-vw-minivan-shuttle-ridesharing-autonomous"&gt;subsidiary Moia&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2017, Moia has been operating a fleet of electric vehicles as part of its “ride-pooling” service in Hamburg, where it has served 3 million customers to date. Those customers have provided a treasure trove of feedback that will come in use as the company shifts to a completely autonomous fleet by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDeiFM"&gt;Despite initial high hopes, AVs are still far away from being able to drive anywhere under any conditions. The industry has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22423489/autonomous-vehicle-consolidation-acquisition-lyft-uber"&gt;consolidating rapidly over the past year&lt;/a&gt;, with many companies being acquired or merging with other companies. It’s a mad dash to keep businesses afloat in the face of lengthening timelines and steep operational costs with little expectation for revenue generation in the near term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4wKX7"&gt;Robotaxis, in particular, are seen as being further out than most companies are predicting. VW and Argo say they remain bullish about their ability to hit the target date. Argo CEO Bryan Salesky has been more realistic about the timeline than most executives, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627847/argo-ai-bryan-salesky-decoder-interview-lyft-self-driving"&gt;telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in a recent podcast interview&lt;/a&gt; that the technology will be “ready when it’s ready.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvDUCH"&gt;Argo has been testing its fourth-generation vehicles in Miami, Austin, and Washington, DC, for the last few years as well as Pittsburgh, Detroit, and California. The company is also planning on launching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22585764/ford-argo-lyft-autonomous-vehicles-robotaxi-miami-austin"&gt;a ride-hail service in the US with Lyft&lt;/a&gt; by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtirJ9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Flight Simulator’s Top Gun expansion also delayed to 2022 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1pfaYslvAlUYR7R9hJi-8bJ2LQQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69821437/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_Top_Gun_01_Header.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TPDKaj"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;/em&gt; expansion for &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is being delayed to match the movie’s shifted release date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652704/top-gun-maverick-mission-impossible-7-delayed-covid-19-delta-concerns-theaters-paramount"&gt;Paramount announced&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month that it’s delaying the rest of its 2021 films, pushing &lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/em&gt; from its Thanksgiving weekend release date to May 27th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31201Z"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;/em&gt; expansion for &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator &lt;/em&gt;had been planned for later this year, and will now be “released alongside the movie,” according to Microsoft and Asobo Studio. We still don’t have a whole lot of information on what Asobo Studio is planning to add with the &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;/em&gt; expansion, apart from some jets and locations from &lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick. “&lt;/em&gt;We look forward to sharing more information in the future,” &lt;a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/top-gun-maverick-expansion-update/"&gt;says a blog post&lt;/a&gt; from Microsoft’s Flight Simulator team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BbSwBE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/inGVITjCcXQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c0QhlP"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22527483/microsoft-flight-simulator-xbox-series-x-s-launch"&gt;originally announced&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Top Gun &lt;/em&gt;expansion at E3 earlier this year, alongside the launch of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; for the Xbox Series X / S. The teaser trailer for the expansion includes a look at some of the jets coming to &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, and even an aircraft carrier that players may be able to land on next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwewmS"&gt;Paramount moved &lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick &lt;/em&gt;to 2022 due to concerns around the delta variant and a spike in COVID-19 cases. &lt;em&gt;Jackass Forever &lt;/em&gt;is also being delayed to next year, and &lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible 7 &lt;/em&gt;will now be released on September 30th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Automated hiring software is mistakenly rejecting millions of viable job candidates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aYdMQDgh5hzA24z2HP_df3brtSM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69821232/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MwtxDa"&gt;Automated resume-scanning software is contributing to a “broken” hiring system in the US, says a &lt;a href="https://www.hbs.edu/managing-the-future-of-work/Documents/research/hiddenworkers09032021.pdf"&gt;new report from Harvard Business School&lt;/a&gt;. Such software is used by employers to filter job applicants, but is mistakenly rejecting millions of viable candidates, say the study’s authors. It’s contributing to the problem of “hidden workers” — individuals who are able and willing to work, but remain locked out of jobs by structural problems in the labor market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1K6hgK"&gt;The study’s authors identify a number of factors blocking people from employment, but say automated hiring software is one of the biggest. These programs are used by 75 percent of US employers (rising to 99 percent of Fortune 500 companies), and were adopted in response to a rise in digital job applications from the ‘90s onwards. Technology has made it easier for people to apply for jobs, but also easier for companies to reject them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="onmM97"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Automated software relies on overly-simplistic criteria&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ogjal"&gt;The exact mechanics of how automated software mistakenly reject candidates are varied, but generally stem from the use of overly-simplistic criteria to divide “good” and “bad” applicants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZTtQV"&gt;For example, some systems automatically reject candidates with gaps of longer than six months in their employment history, without ever asking the cause of this absence. It might be due to a pregnancy, because they were caring for an ill family member, or simply because of difficulty finding a job in a recession. More specific examples cited by one of the study’s author, Joseph Miller, in an &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-need-more-workers-why-do-they-reject-millions-of-resumes-11630728008"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; include hospitals who only accepted candidates with experience in “computer programming” on their CV, when all they needed were workers to enter patient data into a computer. Or, a company that rejected applicants for a retail clerk position if they didn’t list “floor-buffing” as one of their skills, even when candidates’ resumes matched every other desired criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbZ7OV"&gt;Over-reliance on software in the hiring world seems to have created a vicious cycle. Digital technology was supposed to make it easier for companies to find suitable job candidates, but instead it’s contributed to a surfeit of applicants. In the early 2010s, the average corporate job posting attracted 120 applicants, says the study, but by the end of the decade this figure had risen to 250 applicants per job. Companies have responded to this deluge by deploying brutally rigid filters in their automated filtering software. This has had the effect of rejecting viable candidates, contributing to the large pool of job-seekers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvRvac"&gt;The use of this software has become a huge business in itself. As the report notes: “Over the intervening years, automation has come to pervade almost every step in the recruiting process: applicant tracking systems, candidate relationship management, scheduling, background checks, sourcing candidates, and assessments. The global recruitment technology market had grown to $1.75 billion by 2017 and is expected to nearly double, to $3.1 billion, by 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwcmIf"&gt;Despite this, companies seem well aware of these problems. Nearly nine out of 10 executives surveyed for the report said they knew automated software was mistakenly filtering out viable candidates, with some saying they were exploring alternate ways to hire candidates. But, as the study’s authors note, fixing these problems will require “overhauling many aspects of the hiring system,” from where companies look for candidates in the first place to how they deploy software in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sims 4 Spa Day update adds high maintenance Sims and ways to pamper them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-vZ84WTojoy0cJUMEtg23-o86CU=/0x1:1280x854/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69821131/ts4_hero_md_gp_02_reheat_features_04_7x2_xl.png.adapt.crop16x9.767w.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Maxis&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ayoVnv"&gt;The Sims 4’s Spa Day Game Pack, which was first released over six years ago in 2015, is receiving a free update this week that adds nail designs created by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EbonixSims/status/1433845861231038464"&gt;modder Ebonix&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/packs/game-packs/the-sims-4-spa-day?utm_campaign=sims4_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_ts4-spa-day-tw&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cid=69886&amp;amp;ts=1630707803274#initialFeatures"&gt;The update&lt;/a&gt;, which will be available on September 7th, adds a host of other features including a new “High Maintenance” trait and the ability for child Sims to do yoga and meditation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wr2yL5"&gt;There are also new options to get manicures, pedicures, and facial masks, and Sims can earn money by teaching mindfulness, developer Maxis says. Sims can now aspire to be a “Zen Guru,” “Self-Care Specialist,” or simply seek out “Inner Peace.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cBQb16"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So not only do I have a Simself in an OFFICIAL &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheSims?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TheSims&lt;/a&gt; Trailer, but I also worked with them to create these beautiful nails for the Spa Day Refresh!      &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Y'all... I HAVE CONTENT IN THE SIMS. FOREVER!!! YOU AIN'T NEVER GETTING RID OF ME NOW!!!     &lt;a href="https://t.co/7kTR78piKN"&gt;https://t.co/7kTR78piKN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/qcQvi1qcGi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qcQvi1qcGi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ° •ebonix• ° (@EbonixSims) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EbonixSims/status/1433845861231038464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dDgOyp"&gt;Danielle “EbonixSims” Udo is a veteran modder of The Sims who has made significant contributions to the game’s ability to create diverse Sims. Ebonix, as well as other modders like Amira “Xmiramira” Virgil &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sims-mods-black-creators-customization/"&gt;have been credited&lt;/a&gt; with adding new skin tones and hairstyles for Black sims, creating diversity options that were sorely lacking from the original game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2J1ZV"&gt;The update comes a little over a year after executive producer and general manager of The Sims, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SimGuruLyndsay/status/1293339102981402624"&gt;Lyndsay Pearson&lt;/a&gt;, pledged that Maxis would be doing more to improve the game’s options for &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/12/21364810/the-sims-4-black-skin-tones-representation-ea"&gt;creating diverse Sims&lt;/a&gt;, and that it would be working with community members “&lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/october-skin-tones-update"&gt;to make sure we get this right.&lt;/a&gt;” These included the addition of “&lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/october-skin-tones-update"&gt;at least a hundred&lt;/a&gt;” new skin tone swatches, new makeup options, and updates to the game’s hairstyles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKnJhm"&gt;“Inclusivity is at the core of The Sims franchise,” Pearson said at the time. “From the beginning, we set out to let you build Sims that look like you, or people you know. And we understand it doesn’t feel like we’re truly living up to that promise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hSIyc"&gt;The Spa Day refresh is coming to PC, Mac, Xbox One, and PS4, and will be available free to anyone who already owns the game pack. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GoDaddy cut off Texas Right to Life’s abortion ‘whistleblowing’ website, and it might be gone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-MEXICO-BORDER" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mzsrsS8Dh7ma-8JqW0CDO3pJ3xQ=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69814931/1233640838.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PUy8f0"&gt;In case you haven’t heard, Texas now has a law that makes it illegal for anyone to help women get an abortion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22656392/lyft-uber-legal-fees-drivers-lawsuit-texas-sb8-abortion-law"&gt;after six weeks of pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; with no exceptions for rape or incest — and to take advantage of that, the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life encouraged citizens to report those people at a dedicated “whistleblower” website, promising to “ensure that these lawbreakers are held accountable for their actions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1Bpif"&gt;As of Sunday, that dedicated website now appears to be no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLQOwQ"&gt;On Friday, Texas Right to Life had to find a new home on the web for the site, because hosting provider GoDaddy gave the group 24 hours to find an alternative. “We have informed prolifewhistleblower.com they have 24 hours to move to another provider for violating our terms of service,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/03/technology/texas-abortion-law-website-tiktok.html"&gt;a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3VEtx"&gt;By late Friday, it appeared it found that home: Epik, the provider that also helped save &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18049132/gab-social-network-online-synagogue-shooting-deplatforming-return-godaddy-paypal-stripe-ban"&gt;controversial sites Gab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22236178/parler-resurfaces-sunday-app-banned"&gt;social media platform Parler&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754943/8chan-epik-offline-voxility-service-cutoff-hate-speech-ban"&gt;internet hate forum 8chan&lt;/a&gt; when other web service providers wouldn’t take them, is now listed as the registrar and name server provider for prolifewhistleblower.com as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssajkq"&gt;But the site may have gone too far for any web provider to touch, even Epik. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOoXhR"&gt;Initially, GoDaddy told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the whistleblower site violated “multiple provisions” of its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.godaddy.com%2Flegal%2Fagreements%2Funiversal-terms-of-service-agreement&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F3%2F22656196%2Fgodaddy-texas-right-for-life-abortion-whistleblowing-site" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt; including Section 5.2, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="VdDqlT"&gt;After Epik stepped in, the website still had plenty of trouble staying online. As of 4AM ET Saturday, we saw HTTP 503 error codes when trying to access it. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/09/texas-abortion-snitch-website-kicked-off-godaddy-for-invading-peoples-privacy/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Texas anti-abortion group tried to use Digital Ocean as a hosting provider first, but may have fallen afoul of that provider’s rules as well, and it’s not hosted there anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQuANi"&gt;On Saturday, the site appeared to have migrated to BitMitigate, a webhost owned by Epik itself, and one that specifically advertises &lt;a href="https://bitmitigate.com/sovereign-hosting.html"&gt;its “sovereign hosting” services&lt;/a&gt; for platforms under attack. Yet by Saturday evening, the site was not loading for us at all, throwing an “accessed a banned URL” error. Epik says it informed Texas Right to Life that hosting the anonymous tip form was against its terms of service, general counsel Daniel Prince told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUniis"&gt;By Sunday, the battle appeared to be over: prolifewhistleblower.com now redirects to Texas Right to Life’s primary website, instead of a form that allows citizens to inform on their neighbors. Epik takes credit for this, saying it “persuaded them to stop collecting anonymous tips and to take it off the internet entirely.” We’re checking that with Texas Right to Life now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zw3kD"&gt;The anti-abortion group’s website had been under siege for days even before the web provider scuffle, with angry protesters flooding it with fake tips — including at least one fake claim that Texas governor Greg Abbott himself had violated the law, according to the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;. One activist on TikTok even created a script that can automatically feed fake reports into the website’s tipbox, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3x9ba/tiktok-texas-abortion-law-bot-site-ios-shortcut"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;reported Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. He told&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; that the automated tools he’d created had received over 15,000 clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Qc5bIa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@black_madness21/video/7000057713975725318" data-video-id="7000057713975725318" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@black_madness21" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@black_madness21"&gt;@black_madness21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reply to @black_madness21 &lt;a title="texas" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/texas"&gt;#texas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="abortion" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/abortion"&gt;#abortion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="gregabbott" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gregabbott"&gt;#gregabbott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Sean Black" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7000057554395007750"&gt;♬ original sound - Sean Black&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zQ1vqM"&gt;But on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/here-s-how-you-can-help-shut-down-the-vile-website-for-1847557293"&gt;Gizmodo’s Shoshana Wodinsky suggested another way for activists to protest&lt;/a&gt;: blowing the whistle on Texas Right to Life itself, by complaining to GoDaddy about what it was doing. That’s what appears to have happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bxPLM"&gt;It’s not the first time web hosting providers or even GoDaddy specifically have played this role: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/28/18036520/gab-down-godaddy-domain-blocked"&gt;Gab.com had to find a new home in October 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and GoDaddy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/4/17320086/godaddy-domain-registrar-richard-spencer-altright-com-offline"&gt;took down white nationalist Richard Spencer’s Altright.com&lt;/a&gt; that May. Neo-nazi news site the Daily Stormer was similarly given 24 hours by GoDaddy to find a new home &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/14/16142384/daily-stormer-site-go-daddy-hosting-providers-hackers-anonymous"&gt;in August 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and wound up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16150668/daily-stormer-alt-right-dark-web-site-godaddy-google-ban"&gt;moving to the dark web&lt;/a&gt; instead. Gab was able to return, though, and Texas Right to Life at least briefly did as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mUtk1j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why the alt-right can’t build an alt-internet","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/21/16180614/charlottesville-daily-stormer-alt-right-internet-domain"},{"title":"Why banning hate sites is so hard","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20757267/8chan-offline-hate-sites-internet-problems-el-paso-texas-dayton-ohio-cloudflare"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tkF776"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 4:36PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional context from GoDaddy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oFf3gR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 4th, 4AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Epik appears to be Texas Right to Life’s new home for its site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L28LVF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 5th, 12:18AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that the site now appears to be down, following a report that even Epik wasn’t willing to host the whistleblower form.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXqcnf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 5th, 10:29PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that the website no longer exists, redirecting to the anti-abortion group’s main site instead, and additional Epik context.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <updated>2021-09-05T17:51:27-04:00</updated>
    <title>New Trailers: Moonfall, The Wheel of Time, Belfast, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LC4yVkwcD86M7AtJKSQtLyHcmpw=/148x0:1317x779/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69820233/halle_berry_moondall.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Halle Berry stars in Moonfall | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRbsmbr4HFM&amp;amp;ab_channel=LionsgateMovies" target="_blank"&gt;Lionsgate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IP0fda"&gt;I have to say I’m really appreciating what&lt;em&gt; Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; is doing in season 2, and this week’s episode had some really great work from Jason Sudeikis and Sarah Niles. I won’t spoil it, but it was remarkable how the couch scene, which would have been just another “Ted being loopy” scene played for comic effect in season one hit completely different now that Ted’s realized he needs help with his mental health. Also, I recommend this &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/arts/television/ted-lasso-sarah-niles.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;profile of Niles&lt;/a&gt; — it’s a few weeks old but nicely captures how she sees Dr. Sharon fitting in with the rest of the Lasso team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFz9hZ"&gt;Now on to this week’s teasers and trailers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8xzRi3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRbsmbr4HFM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fjlSpX"&gt;Moonfall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="h4yOZR"&gt;“What if the moon fell to earth” is the premise of this Roland Emmerich flick, which looks like about what you’d expect from the director of &lt;em&gt;Independence Day &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Day After Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;— loud, lots of action, and a desperate band of heroes who nobody takes seriously but who have to save the world. Oh and guess what: according to the official description “our Moon is not what we think it is.” Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson, Michael Pena, John Bradley, and Donald Sutherland star in &lt;em&gt;Moonfall&lt;/em&gt;, which is due in theaters February 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rgwIw1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Fus4Xb_TLg?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=1&amp;amp;start=1" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="08kMYz"&gt;The Wheel of Time &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FLTmwq"&gt;This series is yet another long-awaited production that was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, but is finally coming to Amazon Prime Video. Based on the series of books started by the late Robert Jordan (which was finished by Brandon Sanderson), &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; focuses on Rosamund Pike’s Moraine, a member of the powerful all-female Aes Sedai organization, as she leads a group of five young people on a journey around the world, one of whom will fulfill the prophecy of the Dragon Reborn. The first three episodes of&lt;em&gt; The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; arrive on Amazon Prime Video November 19th, with new episodes dropping weekly on Fridays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NzoVHG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N_gD9-Oa0fg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NxSbUO"&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="eIu5cX"&gt;I’ve lost track of how many trailers and teasers have come out for the latest James Bond movie, whose US theatrical release date as of this moment is October 8th. It very likely could get pushed back again. In &lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt;, 007 is recruited back into active service to help find a missing scientist, and runs into a terrorist leader bent on revenge. Daniel Craig (in what he’s said will be his last outing as Bond), Rami Malek, Lea Seydoux, Jeffrey Wright, Naomie Harris, Christoph Waltz, and Ralph Fiennes star in &lt;em&gt;No Time to Die. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wz2SFv"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ja3PPOnJQ2k?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AoIiBX"&gt;Belfast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Fo371J"&gt;Kenneth Branagh wrote and directed this coming-of-age story set in the Irish city during the late 1960s, when &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles"&gt;The Troubles&lt;/a&gt; began. It’s already getting &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/awards/awards/belfast-telluride-kenneth-branagh-jamie-dornan-caitronia-balfe-1235055790/"&gt;Oscar buzz&lt;/a&gt;, which seems warranted given its all-star cast. Caitriona Balfe, Judi Dench, Jamie Dornan, Ciaran Hinds, and Jude Hill star in &lt;em&gt;Belfast&lt;/em&gt;, due in theaters November 12th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Firefly releases video and more details about its Alpha rocket that exploded mid-flight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nYk-zYSpbfW55DPFVxIaKzkcBs8=/164x0:1601x958/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69820093/firefly_rocket.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Firefly’s Alpha rocket takes off from Vandenberg Space Force base  on September 3rd | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFjoPw0CfAU&amp;amp;ab_channel=FireflyAerospace" target="_blank"&gt;Firefly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ysIVmH"&gt;Firefly’s Alpha rocket &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655687/firefly-alpha-rocket-explodes-space-force-first-launch"&gt;exploded mid-flight&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, but the company posted a new video on Sunday and provided more detail on what happened.  “Although the vehicle didn’t make orbit, the day marked a major advancement for our team,” the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Firefly_Space/status/1434596618485911554"&gt;company tweeted.&lt;/a&gt; “We demonstrated we ‘arrived’ as a company capable of building and launching rockets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWoqdW"&gt;Alpha, a two-stage rocket, lifted off from the Vandenberg Space Force base in California at 9:59PM ET on Thursday, carrying a payload of private satellites. It was the company’s first-ever mission, and two minutes after liftoff the rocket began tipping horizontally, falling short of reaching its maximum aerodynamic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7HGGW"&gt;According to Firefly, the rocket cleared the launch pad successfully, but about 15 seconds into flight, engine 2 shut down. The vehicle continued its climb and was able to maintain control for about 145 seconds, Firefly said, but the climb rate was slow because it was lacking the thrust of one of its four engines (the one that shut down). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zBTsNE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFjoPw0CfAU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="id__q88hhly6pk8"&gt;“The vehicle was challenged to maintain control without the thrust vectoring of engine 2. Alpha was able to compensate at subsonic speeds, but as it moved through transonic and into supersonic flight, where control is most challenging, the three engine thrust vector control was insufficient and the vehicle tumbled out of control,” according to Firefly. “The range terminated the flight using the explosive Flight Termination System (FTS). The rocket did not explode on its own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__pprp9i9g7yn"&gt;It’s investigating why engine 2 shut down early, and says it will report the root cause once it’s completed the investigation. “In collaboration with the FAA and our partners at Space Launch Delta 30, we’ll return to conduct Alpha Flight 2 as soon as possible,” the company tweeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__txen3y4m9ib"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Segway’s Navimow robot will mow your lawn using GPS </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PLNPHwtgl_mVL_XKgsgx9SmFOw8=/0x0:672x448/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69819658/Navimow_3_web.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Segway Navimow robot uses GPS to navigate your lawn as it mows | Segway&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EpVjp3"&gt;Segway has introduced its first robot mower, the Navimow, that uses GPS to stay on your lawn and keep it neatly trimmed. So unlike other robot mowers, you won’t have to install a boundary wire to keep the robot on the right patch of grass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QyDAAn"&gt;Segway says its Exact Fusion Locating System keeps the Navimow to “precise positions and systematic mowing patterns,” keeping its position accurate to within two centimeters. If its GPS signal is temporarily weak, the Navimow has sensors that will keep it mowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnE2i2"&gt;Users define the boundaries of the area to be mowed for the Navimow using its smartphone app, including giving it directions for which areas to avoid. Segway says the Navimow’s algorithm “determines a systemic mowing path,” and doesn’t have to criss-cross already-mowed areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IFkllO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8etNM_BXY0A?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J845LJ"&gt;The Navimow has offset blades that let it cut as close as possible on a lawn’s edges. Its Blade Halt technology can detect things in the grass like pets, toys, or kids, and stop the mower’s blades from spinning. While Segway says the Navimow can “withstand rainfall, heavy splashing and high-pressure water jets,” its rain sensor guides it back to its charging station if it detects rain starting. Segway hasn’t said yet when the Navimow will be available in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X16ngj"&gt;The Navimow can handle inclines in lawns of up to 45 degrees, and runs at a relatively quiet 54 dB. Segway has four models of the Navimow starting with the H500E, which can be used on a lawn up to 500 square meters, or about 5400 square feet in area, and is priced at €1199, or about $1,425. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QK8pDD"&gt;The Navimow H800, priced at €1499 ( about $1,781), is designed for lawns of up to 800 square meters (about 8,600 square feet); the H1500E can tackle lawns of 1,500 square meters (roughly 16,145 feet) and costs €1999 ($2,375); and the H3000E can mow lawns up to 3000 square meters (about 33,000 square feet) with a price tag of €2499 (or $2,969).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbUZE7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz AMG EQS is a dual-motor electric sedan with over 750 horsepower</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1-LkgkXqHzQnRWUjpj62tQePWw=/0x3:4961x3310/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69819543/2021_04_17_Image_D638565.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Daimler AG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pwOfP8"&gt;Mercedes-Benz said recently that it was going &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588587/mercedes-benz-electric-ev-2030-caveat"&gt;all-electric by 2030&lt;/a&gt;, which naturally got race fans excited about the possibilities of an electric high-performance car from the automaker’s AMG sub-brand. Today, we’re getting our first look at the upcoming AMG EQS, a wickedly fast sport sedan with a 0-60 mph time of 3.4 seconds and a top speed of 155 mph. It made its public debut at the 2021 IAA Mobility show in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uehOE"&gt;The AMG EQS is the first battery-electric production car from the automaker’s in-house performance subsidiary. As such, there’s a lot riding on Mercedes getting everything exactly right if it wants to satisfy its loyal customers while also luring new ones away from Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MsxGgO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;first battery-electric production car from the automaker’s in-house performance subsidiary&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zC70EP"&gt;This is a driving machine made for “car enthusiasts,” Mercedes said — and at first glance it’s easy to see why, with its smooth lines and aerodynamic profile. The question is how car enthusiasts will react to the completely silent electric motors, or Mercedes’ attempt to fill the void left by the lack of a V8 with something called “emotive vehicle sound.” (More on that in a bit.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0n3jQUpsMxPbk1emCdIOfy1FyPk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22827132/2021_04_17_Image_D638564.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Daimler AG&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DHVVbK"&gt;The EQS, the all-electric version of the automaker’s storied S-class sedan, came out this year to rave reviews. When we tested it, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375877/mercedes-benz-eqs-ev-s-class-specs-hands-on"&gt;we came away impressed&lt;/a&gt; by the powerful battery, wide range of driving modes, and the over-the-top in-car technology. Mercedes needs the AMG version of the EQS to be equally impressive if it wants to compete with Tesla, Audi, BMW and others in the luxury segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wA2cLp"&gt;A quick look at the spec sheet reveals a lot to be impressed by. The sedan’s dual motors will put out 649 horsepower, with a maximum torque of 700 ft-lbs. If somehow that’s not enough acceleration, you can kick the horsepower up to 751 while using Race Start mode with boost function, which also increases the torque to 752 ft-lbs.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/piCwNDhI4zWcOmz0rCJCnlbmwC0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22827133/2021_04_17_Image_D638575.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Daimler AG&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JAfwLl"&gt;The 400-volt battery has a usable energy content of 107.8kWh, which is more capacity than every Tesla vehicle. Mercedes says it has reduced the cobalt content of the battery’s chemistry to 10 percent. Cobalt is the most expensive material used in batteries, so eliminating it from the mix is expected to help EVs become as affordable as those that run on gas. It has also been called the “blood diamond of batteries” because it’s been mined in a way that’s endangered child workers and wrecked the environment in the Democratic Republic of Congo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYtz0V"&gt;Mercedes says the battery management system is also configured specifically for AMG. In the Sport and Sport+ driving modes the focus is on performance, while Comfort mode focuses on operating range. Given what we know about the EQS’ driving modes and the use of regenerative braking, that is sure to be a welcome feature when you’re in the driver seat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv5iwl"&gt;And you know Mercedes is really excited to explain the AMG’s unique sound profile because it’s really high up in the press release under the subhed “AMG SOUND EXPERIENCE: emotional sound spectrum for a unique driving experience.” The whole idea is because EVs are silent, the automakers are creating their own fake sounds that match the vehicle’s acceleration, so you aren’t flying around the race track in a completely silent sports car. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h2CIYeG67AHXEWnnsCzIiZZktuE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22827134/2021_04_19_Image_D638569.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Daimler AG&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fU9Y2e"&gt;Mercedes says it used “special loudspeakers, subwoofers and a sound generator to create a special sound experience in two versions: ‘Authentic’ or ‘Performance.’” The fake sounds are generated inside and outside the vehicle to match the driving status. There’s a video that includes the sound, and honestly, I’m fine with it. It’s not an engine growl, but it also doesn’t sound overly manufactured. I wasn’t a huge fan of the Volkswagen ID 4’s fake sound, but this one seems like it won’t offend too many people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ts8azv"&gt;The AMG EQS is built on one of three bespoke EV architectures built by Mercedes for its new lineup of electric vehicles. This car and future electric AMG models will be built on the AMG.EA architecture, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BjAWuR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10735489"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ewcZjL"&gt;Inside, you’ll find the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217267/mercedes-benz-hyperscreen-size-specs-eqs-ces-2021"&gt;Mercedes Hyperscreen&lt;/a&gt;, three screens embedded in a single piece of glass that extends from pillar-to-pillar. It runs on the automaker’s MBUX system, but also includes something unique to AMG:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="D7IsiG"&gt;AMG TRACK PACE, the virtual race engineer, is also available as an option: the software is part of the MBUX infotainment system and permanently records more than 80 vehicle-specific data (i.e. speed, acceleration), for example while driving on a racetrack. On top of this, lap and sector times are displayed, as well as the respective difference from a reference time. Because specific display elements are shown in green or red, the driver is able to see at a glance, without reading numbers, whether they are currently faster or slower than the best time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Hbzkwl"&gt;Think of it like a fitness app that tracks your workout performance, but for your car. Race enthusiasts are going to find a lot to like here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SuQOzq"&gt;We still don’t have a production date or a suggested retail price. The 2021 EQS costs well over $100,000, so don’t expect this one to retail for anything less than $120,000. The question is whether Mercedes can get this car to customers before the release of the next-gen Tesla Roadster, which was just delayed to 2023. If they can than the AMG EQS has a real chance to steal the show. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz takes another shot at launching an electric SUV in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c1sh-2oLNOblBSiuiu17fEJ2NJ4=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69819525/2020_09_26_Image_D638345.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Mercedes-Benz&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oF8Gk5"&gt;Just months after Mercedes-Benz launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22239135/mercedes-benz-eqa-electric-crossover-range-price-specs"&gt;its first true compact electric SUV&lt;/a&gt;, the EQA, the German automaker now has a slightly larger and more capable companion: the EQB. Revealed in full today at the 2021 IAA Mobility show in Germany, the company will start building the EQA in Hungary and China this month, and it will start selling the SUV in the US in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCtGU0"&gt;Mercedes-Benz trotted out the EQB alongside a few other new electric vehicles that it’s adding to its stable. There’s the EQE sedan, which is a more attainable version of its flagship executive electric, the EQS. Mercedes-Benz also rolled out AMG and Maybach versions of the EQS. There’s even now going to be an electric version of the G-Wagen — though that’s not coming for a while, as Mercedes-Benz only debuted a concept version of the so-called EQG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0u0Y7d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mercedes’ second compact electric SUV, after the EQA&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UGD5Fm"&gt;Mercedes-Benz first showed off the EQB at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22392215/mercedes-benz-eqb-electric-suv-us-specs-auto-shanghai-2021"&gt;Auto Shanghai show April&lt;/a&gt;, but the company used Sunday’s reveal to dive deeper into the details, and its plans for the compact SUV. Crucially, the EQB will represent Mercedes-Benz’s second attempt at launching an electric SUV in the United States, after it canceled plans to bring the EQC stateside earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="br3lhq"&gt;The broad strokes of the EQB are the same as we heard in April. The all-wheel drive EQB will seat five, with an optional third row that can turn it into a seven-seater. Those third-row seats won’t be massively accommodating, though, as Mercedes-Benz says they’ll only be good for kids or people up to 5 feet, 4 inches tall. The EQB is also expected to get around 419 kilometers (roughly 260 miles) of range, at least based on the European WLTP standard — meaning the EPA estimated range will likely be lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jHgrcO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10736393"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2r9ImB"&gt;It’s not hard to imagine that interior space and range were among the reasons Mercedes-Benz backed off bringing the EQC to the US. The EQB has a little more of both, but it could yet be a tough sell in a market that’s still a bit wary of electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qu4UMy"&gt;Still, the EQB is set for far more markets in the US, and it could find success in those other parts of the world. Mercedes-Benz said Sunday that it will sell two versions of the SUV, too — one with 225 horsepower and one with 288 horsepower, dubbed the EQB 300 4MATIC and EQB 350 4MATIC, respectively. A front-wheel drive version will come at a later date, as will a “particularly long-range version,” Mercedes-Benz says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fOJ3Q"&gt;Small- to mid-size electric SUVs can &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g36278968/best-selling-evs-of-2021/"&gt;find success in the US&lt;/a&gt; — just look at the Tesla Model Y, which has already eclipsed its sedan counterpart, the Model 3. Ford has had early luck with its Mustang Mach-E, and the new Chevy Bolts were doing okay before the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22648922/gm-chevy-bolt-ev-production-halt-recall-fire-risk"&gt;massive recall&lt;/a&gt;. But higher-end imports that require some compromise on range, like Audi’s E-Tron, have not found such solid footing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0y4cA"&gt;Mercedes-Benz will eventually build electric SUVs on the platform it developed for the EQS (like it’s doing with the EQE), and those ground-up EVs naturally require less compromise. The EQB will test whether Mercedes-Benz can carve out some of the market until that happens — that is, &lt;em&gt;if &lt;/em&gt;it follows through on the launch this time.&lt;/p&gt;
