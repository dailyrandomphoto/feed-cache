    <title>Apple may be looking to make a less expensive big phone in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-5IOh_hyZLO3rP-d4_rJF-ixICw=/498x0:2802x1536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69496618/Screen_Shot_2021_06_23_at_3.53.24_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aVq5eH"&gt;According to noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple will sell an iPhone with a 6.7-inch screen for less than $900 in 2022 (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/23/kuo-2022-iphones-could-feature-under-display-touch-id-lowest-price-ever-for-6-7-inch-iphone/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If this turns out to be the case, iPhone 14 buyers will have a less expensive way to get a screen size that Apple currently only sells on the 12 Pro Max, which starts at $1,099. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKs7gA"&gt;Kuo predicts that Apple’s 2022 non-pro iPhone lineup includes phones with 6.1 and 6.7-inch screens (the same sizes as the current iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, respectively). Absent is the iPhone Mini with its 5.7-inch screen. Analysts, including Kuo, have said that the Mini will be going away in 2022 due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;reportedly low sales&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOFORJ"&gt;While some may mourn the loss of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222642/iphone-se-2-size-comparison-small-phone-trend-galaxy-oneplus"&gt;an actually small phone option&lt;/a&gt;, from Apple’s perspective, going big with its line of mainstream phones makes sense. We know from documents unearthed in the Epic v. Apple trial that Apple commissioned a report on the smartphone purchasing habits of consumers late last year. The report showed both that many customers were buying phones that had screens larger than six inches and that more people were turning to Samsung than Apple for their big phone needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cp_Grsgbx--DQMHTv8awM5dW7L4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22678069/apple_charts.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charts from the report showing the screen size breakdown for phones sold and average price points.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cb9O4E"&gt;Both companies face &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166399/iphone-android-apple-samsung-smartphone-sales-peak"&gt;a market that is slowing down&lt;/a&gt;, and one that is having to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/18/18263584/why-phones-are-so-expensive-price-apple-samsung-google"&gt;grapple with rising costs&lt;/a&gt;. If Apple has made the decision to make a lower-end big phone, it’s done so after seeing the research that many consumers want phones that are both bigger, and cheaper. While Apple has somewhat been working toward that goal (the iPhone 12, 11, and XR have all had 6.1-inch screens), it’s generally kept the really big phones at the high-end — next year could be its time to court users who want something bigger than 6.1-inches, but don’t want to spend over $1,000 to get it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fxKBtV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s generally kept the really big phones at the high-end&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ncmGUf"&gt;In addition to his prediction about the lower-end 6.7-inch iPhone, &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Kuo said the 2022 iPhones will have under-display fingerprint readers, and that there will be a new &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/23/kuo-new-iphone-se-with-5g-and-new-processor-still-on-track-for-first-half-of-2022/"&gt;iPhone SE with 5G&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA confirms Battlefield 2042 will use bots to help fill its 128-player servers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1jw40PUjVs-1Xw_nm6w3wIc2ufI=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69496488/RevealScreenshot_15_VistaBorderline_3840x2160_NoLogo.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: EA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kE0Czy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;, coming this fall, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22524753/battlefield-2042-release-date-trailer-ps4-ps5-xbox-pc"&gt;will offer the series’ largest skirmishes yet&lt;/a&gt;; its “All-Out Warfare” modes can fit 128 simultaneous players in a single match on PS5, Xbox Series X and PC. But you won’t &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; have 128 humans in each match — EA will be backfilling those servers with bots to keep games populated, the company confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and there’s currently no plan to let you turn that off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AcOSY"&gt;Humans will take priority, so you might never encounter an AI soldier at peak playtimes — and if you truly hate bots, you’ll be able to play other modes. But the main event allows up to 64 “AI soldiers” to help fill a game, depending on your region, platform, and how many real-life humans are available to join up. That applies to both the Conquest and Breakthrough modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TnZMl0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In defense of bots (assuming the bots are any good)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xbShwT"&gt;It’s sure to be a polarizing decision, but I think it might be a smart one, considering the alternatives. It’s risky to build a game around 128 simultaneous players (64 players on PS4 and Xbox One), when you never know how long your multiplayer game might be able to keep users around. I wish EA had competent bots in 2014 when it released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/12/5402862/titanfall-preview"&gt;the original &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a 6v6 game that died far too soon because of all the ways it divided its playerbase (across Xbox and PC, across game modes, and with iffy matchmaking), and it wasn’t long before my buddies and I couldn’t find a decent match on PC at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mo1aP9"&gt;MAG, a PS3 game that supported 256-player battles way back in 2010, actually &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/sony-add-bot-support-to-mag-2"&gt;inspired a petition to &lt;em&gt;add&lt;/em&gt; bots to the game&lt;/a&gt;. And EA’s &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Battlefront &lt;/em&gt;reboots &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/battlefront/star-wars-battlefront-2/news/ai-article-deep-dive"&gt;used bots alongside players&lt;/a&gt; to enhance &lt;a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/07/its-not-a-campaign-but-at-least-battlefront-has-bots-now/"&gt;particular modes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgiDZX"&gt;(I also wonder whether &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; in particular might be a better game with particularly smart and loyal bots? Played properly as a team, it’s one of my favorite gaming experiences, but I’ve seen so many matches derailed by players who seem to enjoy repeatedly crashing jets into the ground.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="U5vA3I"&gt;We don’t yet know whether &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042’&lt;/em&gt;s bots will be any &lt;em&gt;good, &lt;/em&gt;of course, and everything will hinge on that. I certainly couldn’t tolerate &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/pubg-is-dying-how-bots-threaten-to-destroy-playerunknowns-battlegrounds"&gt;the ones that appeared in PUBG&lt;/a&gt;, which have reportedly since been toned down. EA’s bots might be a work in progress too: “The game is still in development and the use of AI will be tuned as player data comes in,” the company notes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="CEJHwB"&gt;EA says it should have more info soon on how the new bots will work. If you like them, you’ll be able to see more of them if you want: while &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042 &lt;/em&gt;won’t have a single-player campaign, you’ll be able to play &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/06/13/battlefield-2042-preview-a-true-turning-point-for-the-fps-franchise"&gt;any map and any game mode&lt;/a&gt; solo against a team of bots, or bring along your friends to battle in a co-op mode. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s improved Combo Touch keyboard will be available for the fourth-gen iPad Air in July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fxqS1UL0ZIZ3XuVGNFE20_03YFo=/0x201:1080x921/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69496407/Combo_Touch_for_iPad_Air_Oxford_Grey_Beautiful_Design_Enviro_1080x1080.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Combo Touch case.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iE98Y1"&gt;Logitech is releasing a version of its Combo Touch keyboard case, which has a Microsoft Surface-style kickstand and a detachable keyboard with an integrated trackpad, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.logitech.com%2F2021%2F06%2F23%2Flogitech-announces-combo-touch-for-ipad-air-and-new-color%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F23%2F22547938%2Flogitech-combo-touch-ipad-air-fourth-generation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for the fourth-generation iPad Air&lt;/a&gt;. The case will cost $199.99, making it $100 cheaper than Apple’s Magic Keyboard that fits the iPad Air, and it will be available in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y92CD4"&gt;The Combo Touch’s keyboard is powered by the iPad’s Smart Connector, meaning that you won’t need to charge up the keyboard on its own, and it offers backlit keys and iPadOS shortcut keys. The case also a handy open spot at the top where you can store a second-gen Apple Pencil, which attaches magnetically to the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpBqDE"&gt;This case’s design might feel familiar — it looks nearly identical to the Combo Touch cases that were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395219/logitech-combo-touch-keyboard-new-ipad-pro"&gt;recently released for the 2021 iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt;. It also seems like it will be an upgrade from the version of the Combo Touch that fits the third-generation iPad Air — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231088/logitech-combo-touch-ipad-keyboard-trackpad-case-review-price-specs-features"&gt;and my colleague Phil Esposito already liked that case a lot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7DC8y"&gt;Speaking of the Combo Touch for the iPad Pros, Logitech is also introducing a new “sand” color (I’d describe it as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fipad-keyboards%2Fcombo-touch-ipad.html%3Fcrid%3D1762%23buy-combo-touch-ipad&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F23%2F22547938%2Flogitech-combo-touch-ipad-air-fourth-generation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a light gray&lt;/a&gt;) that will also be available in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gpRtC7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Logitech announces cheaper Magic Keyboard alternative for new iPad Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395219/logitech-combo-touch-keyboard-new-ipad-pro"},{"title":"Logitech’s Combo Touch is the Magic Keyboard for everyone else","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231088/logitech-combo-touch-ipad-keyboard-trackpad-case-review-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>The chip shortage will likely get worse before it gets better </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JESJIAZbpsRlslH85lLB92oWP7Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69496210/acastro_210430_1777_semiCon_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fi4TH7"&gt;One of tech’s biggest problems in the past few months has been due to one of its smallest components: chips. Months into the shortage, the effects have spread far beyond the difficulty of buying an Xbox Series X or PS5. Car companies are being hit the worst, and even &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9a497f21-e3e4-4c74-8737-07cd13209475"&gt;home appliances&lt;/a&gt; might start to see issues with supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oliYeU"&gt;Earlier this year, companies expected to have supply chains sorted and products more consistently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260564/microsoft-xbox-series-x-stock-june-supply-constraints"&gt;back on shelves by summer&lt;/a&gt; — but June is nearly over and there’s seemingly no end in sight. And with the upcoming slate of big tech releases and the holiday shopping season coming up, expect things to get worse before they get better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8jotJ"&gt;“We had thought probably six or seven months ago, like everybody else, that it would be relatively short-term.” Jahmy Hindman, chief technology officer at John Deere, commented &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22533735/john-deere-cto-hindman-decoder-interview-right-to-repair-tractors"&gt;on The Verge’s &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; podcast&lt;/a&gt;. “But I think we’re into this for the next 12 to 18 months.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bmSk8R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chips could be in short supply for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QSWfIj"&gt;It’s not just tractors and trucks, though. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger voiced similar sentiment, commenting in a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-earnings-first-quarter-2021-11619043954"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt; back in April that it could be two years before production is able to ramp up. “This will take a while until people can put more capacity in the ground.” And AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/chip-shortage-causes-amd-to-pivot-away-from-lower-end-pc-processors"&gt;noted at a May investor event&lt;/a&gt; that the company was being forced to prioritize its higher end chips over lower-powered parts due to shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpT1Lt"&gt;There’s two different forces at work here. For some products, there’s too much demand, which impacts the higher-end chips like the GPUs in a PlayStation 5 or an RTX 3080 graphics card. While chip shortages have undoubtedly played a part, there’s also simply more people who want to buy these products than there are enough to go around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4Jm2S"&gt;Take the PS5, for instance, which is the &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-17-ps5-the-fastest-selling-console-in-us-history"&gt;fastest selling console in US history&lt;/a&gt; despite the continued difficulty in purchasing one months after its launch. “Even if we secure a lot more devices and produce many more units of the PlayStation 5 next year, our supply wouldn’t be able to catch up with demand,” Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki said in a private analyst briefing, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-10/sony-warns-tight-playstation-5-supply-to-extend-into-next-year"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JoP3av"&gt;Or take GPUs, which have &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3138130/bitcoin-crackdown-sends-graphics-cards-prices-plummeting-china-after"&gt;finally started to drop in price&lt;/a&gt; over the past few weeks — not because Nvidia has magically figured out how to churn out more parts, but because demand is finally slowing down following plummeting Bitcoin prices and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22544367/china-crypto-crackdown-bitcoin-mining-sichuan-ban-hydro-cryptocurrency-trading"&gt;China’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aSuly"&gt;It’s in chipmakers’ interests to keep trying to churn out those parts: newer chips are more lucrative. If you’re TSMC or Samsung, it’s in your best interest to focus on making (and expanding) those production efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZ0U0H"&gt;On the flip side, though, are supply issues, particularly for older chip designs. Unlike a new iPhone or Xbox, a Ford truck or a John Deere tractor doesn’t need bleeding-edge chips using TSMC or Samsung’s 5nm process. They use older chips, which are less powerful (and less pricey) than ones using brand new technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="LDuK9M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Older chips — like the ones used in cars — are being hit particularly hard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qUeMSE"&gt;The impact here is already being felt. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-06/chip-shortage-forces-carmakers-to-strip-out-high-tech-features?srnd=premium-europe&amp;amp;amp;sref=ctSjKj2N"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; from last month notes that carmakers are starting to skip out on offering premium features like navigation systems or extra screens in order to stretch their supply of chips further. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/18/22290362/nvidia-will-not-reduce-3060-ti-3070-3080-3090-eth-mining"&gt;Nvidia repurposed old GPUs&lt;/a&gt; into special cryptocurrency mining boards to free up more supply of newer ones for gamers. Even Apple noted that it was running into trouble getting ahold of those older chips, due to the extra competition. “Most of our issue is on licensing those legacy nodes, there are many different people not only in the same industry, but across other industries that are using legacy nodes,” Cook said in Apple’s Q2 earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLy76S"&gt;Revathi Advaithi, CEO of Flex — the world’s third largest electronics manufacturing company — noted a similar issue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451309/flex-revathi-advaithi-interview-decoder-manufacturing-covid-19"&gt;on &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;. “Automotive semiconductors have been pretty outdated,” she explains, noting that automakers either have to invest in upgrading to newer technologies more on par with consumer devices, or foundries need to build out more capacity for those specific legacy chips — parts which aren’t really useful for phones or laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWVuHy"&gt;Exacerbating the issue is that on a broader scale, the semiconductor industry has become increasingly consolidated. Despite the increasing importance of computer chips in virtually every hardware product across multiple industries, the number of companies that make those chips — especially specialized chips at the high end of the market — have grown increasingly fewer in number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsR2Az"&gt;TSMC alone accounts for 92 percent of the supply of cutting-edge chips, with Samsung providing the rest, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-world-relies-on-one-chip-maker-in-taiwan-leaving-everyone-vulnerable-11624075400?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;according to a&lt;em&gt; Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. The company also reportedly makes about 60 percent of the chips for car manufacturers around the world. Which means that when those companies run out of capacity, there’s not a lot of other places to go to get those processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yyl6s4"&gt;That’s also why chip shortages likely won’t hit some of the biggest devices, like Apple’s next iPhone or whatever Samsung’s fall flagship ends up being, at least not as hard as they hit Ford trucks or GPUs. &lt;a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210621PD212.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digitimes&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that TSMC is already &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/22/tsmc-to-prioritize-apple-and-automaker-silicon-orders-as-global-semiconductor-shortage-continues/"&gt;prioritizing Apple’s orders&lt;/a&gt; (along with those of car manufacturers) heading into the fall. Because of the size and scale of Apple’s orders — think of how many iPhones it sells every year, all using cutting-edge chips from TSMC — it has the pull to stay at the front of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04dBvl"&gt;The bad news is that the crunch will probably get worse before it gets better. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung are all heavily investing in expanding and building new fabs. The Biden administration is also trying to help, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22457293/semiconductor-chip-shortage-funding-frontier-china-competition-act"&gt;pushing to pump billions into US semiconductor manufacturing&lt;/a&gt;. But as Intel’s CEO noted, it’ll take months, if not a few years, for those investments to mature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JkcgD"&gt;And with the holiday season fast approaching and a new wave of products from across market segments all fighting for chips, there’s almost certainly bound to be more product delays, cut corners, price jumps, and part shortages to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpfiyO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCUXRt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>John McAfee found dead in Barcelona prison, authorities say</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zlm5ym"&gt;John McAfee, founder of the company behind McAfee Antivirus, has been found dead according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/john-mcafee-found-dead-prison-after-spanish-court-allows-extradition-2021-06-23/"&gt;reports from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.elmundo.es/tecnologia/2021/06/23/60d38594e4d4d8c47b8b4699.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;El Mundo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://elpais.com/economia/2021-06-23/el-fundador-del-antivirus-mcafee-john-mcafee-se-suicida-en-una-prision-de-barcelona.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;El País&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and others. He was being held in a Barcelona prison, and the Catalan Department of Justice has stated that his death was likely caused by suicide. Lawyers for McAfee confirmed his death to &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/business/john-mcafee-dead.html"&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with one saying&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;it was “the result of a cruel system that had no reason to keep this man in jail for so long.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="XcpY7u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:831613"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CXvvlL"&gt;McAfee was being held in prison, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/john-mcafee-indicted-tax-evasion"&gt;pending extradition to the US&lt;/a&gt;, since his arrest in October 2020. He faced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21503324/john-mcafee-indicted-tax-evasion-sued-doj-sec"&gt;charges of tax evasion&lt;/a&gt; and had also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315494/john-mcafee-fraud-securities-scheme-charges-cryptocurrency"&gt;been charged with securities fraud&lt;/a&gt; relating to an alleged cryptocurrency pump and dump scheme. Spanish courts had approved his extradition this morning with opportunity for appeal, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/spain-high-court-allows-john-mcafees-extradition-us-2021-06-23/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.elmundo.es/tecnologia/2021/06/23/60d34ebce4d4d8ca7b8b4664.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;El Mundo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5xhC1"&gt;McAfee’s story over the past decade has been headline-grabbing. He’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/19/4444266/john-mcafee-youtube-how-to-uninstall-mcafee-antivirus"&gt;released a drug-fueled video&lt;/a&gt; in which he un-installs McAfee Antivirus, claimed to have made a device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/30/4786008/john-mcafee-d-central-device-avoid-nsa-private-network"&gt;that blocked NSA surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2018/06/04/john-mcafee-president-2020/"&gt;run for president&lt;/a&gt; — twice, in 2016 and 2020. He’s also a noted cryptocurrency promoter, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17189880/john-mcafee-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-twitter-ico"&gt;once claimed to charge $105,000&lt;/a&gt; for each promotional tweet, if you wanted McAfee to boost your cryptocurrency or initial coin offering on Twitter’s platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAP7Jn"&gt;In 2014, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5282618/intel-phases-out-mcafee-brand-name-distancing-itself-from"&gt;Intel rebranded the antivirus software&lt;/a&gt; that bore McAfee’s name, changing it to “Intel Security.” In response, McAfee told the BBC that he was grateful that “the worst software on the planet” was no longer associated with his name. McAfee later sued Intel after it warned him that naming a new cybersecurity company after himself would be trademark infringement. McAfee &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-mcafee-settlement/intel-john-mcafee-settle-lawsuits-over-antivirus-pioneers-name-idUSKBN19Q31Y"&gt;later agreed to a settlement with Intel&lt;/a&gt;, saying that he wouldn’t use his name in connection to any cybersecurity products or services he worked on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O7Pm0Z"&gt;McAfee has a history of run-ins with law enforcement. He, his family, and members of his security forces &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/4/2998762/john-mcafee-belize-police-wrongful-arrest"&gt;were arrested by the Belize police&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, after drug and firearm charges. He &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/5/3734178/mcafee-arrest-murder-investigation"&gt;went on the run later that year&lt;/a&gt;, after the Belize police declared that he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/12/3636412/john-mcafee-questioning-murder-investigation-belize"&gt;was wanted for questioning&lt;/a&gt; in relation to the murder of his neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y54PJN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;McAfee has a history of run-ins with law enforcement&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hwv3KH"&gt;The story became one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/14/12904402/john-mcafee-rape-murder-accusations-gringo-documentary-tiff-interview"&gt;focuses of a 2016 Showtime documentary&lt;/a&gt;, which sought to prove that McAfee was involved not only in that murder, but other crimes as well. &lt;a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/john-mcafee-wont-pay-25m-judgment-in-wrongful-death-case-has-ignored-all-lawsuits-for-11-years/"&gt;As recently as 2019&lt;/a&gt;, McAfee called the case against him “frivolous,” and refused to pay a $25 million judgement against him in a wrongful death suit. He &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1108191328515571713"&gt;also claimed&lt;/a&gt; that he had over $200 million in judgements against him in other legal cases, but that he could not pay any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6uU5bZ"&gt;In recent years, McAfee claimed to be on the run from the CIA, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1152240931015462914"&gt;tweeting a picture of himself&lt;/a&gt; on a boat holding a gun. McAfee has also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1200864283766251521"&gt;tweeted multiple times&lt;/a&gt;, once &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1316801215083225096"&gt;after his October arrest&lt;/a&gt;, that he wouldn’t kill himself, and those tweets are already leading to conspiracy theories about his death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oj4Ntd"&gt;The US Department of Justice tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it has no comment on the matter, referring us to Spanish authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3d5OT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peacock is finally coming to Fire TV on June 24th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y8JWDJqnUIqQEaZ327qew25XusU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69495410/peacock_channels.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Peacock app displayed on a TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kFl6Vy"&gt;Nearly a year after Peacock’s launch, NBCUniversal’s marquee streaming app is finally coming to Fire TV and Fire tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06dPGl"&gt;The streaming service will officially arrive on Amazon devices on June 24th, allowing users to access the app without having to sideload it. The companies announced Wednesday that the app would be supported across Fire TV products, including Fire TV Stick Lite, Fire TV Stick 4K, and Fire TV smart TVs. A Peacock spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that second-generation Fire TVs and above will have support for the app, as will all Fire Tablets with Fire OS 5 and above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Anzodc"&gt;In addition to Peacock, the distribution agreement will see 15 NBCUniversal apps arrive on Amazon devices as well, including various NBC apps and Telemundo. Much of Peacock’s content is available to stream for free, but users can unlock more content and originals with either of the service’s paid tiers. Peacock’s premium ad-supported tier costs $5 per month, while its ad-free experience costs $10 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37X3cT"&gt;Support for the app will give streamers access not only to NBCUniversal’s catalog of network programming — including popular series like &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;30 Rock&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Law &amp;amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&lt;/em&gt; — but also to coverage of various sporting events. These include Sunday Night Football, the Tokyo Olympics, and, because Peacock has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319438/wwe-network-peacock-features-price-faq-deal"&gt;exclusive rights&lt;/a&gt; to the WWE Network, SummerSlam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EdaCbT"&gt;Previously, Fire TV users who’d hoped to access event coverage exclusive to the service would either have to find another way to stream it or sideload it themselves — something Peacock itself &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeacockTVCare/status/1374376982759108608"&gt;previously encouraged&lt;/a&gt; its frustrated users to try as a workaround. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mYUXaZ"&gt;When support arrives tomorrow, Fire TV users will be able to open and search the service’s catalog using voice commands. The companies said that later this year, users will get further Alexa support and the ability to surf Peacock using an Alexa Voice Remote, a Fire TV Cube, or by pairing an Echo device to a Fire TV smart TV or streaming stick.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jerry Seinfeld’s Pop-Tarts obsession is turning into a Netflix movie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Comedians In Cars w. Jerry Seinfeld &amp;amp;amp; Eddie Murphy ‑ LA Tastemaker" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8FBCO64F48gR0CWxTDHR_qGxWFw=/0x0:2944x1963/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69495243/1162827726.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fzQ9wD"&gt;Jerry Seinfeld is perhaps best known for co-writing and starring in &lt;em&gt;Bee Movie &lt;/em&gt;(fine, also for co-creating one of the most beloved televised sitcoms). But since that daring project, he hasn’t really returned to feature-length films. That’s about to change — &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/06/jerry-seinfeld-netflix-movie-deal-unfrosted-creation-of-pop-tart-directing-starring-cowriter-1234780032/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/jerry-seinfeld-pop-tart-movie-netflix-unfrosted-1235003638/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;report that Seinfeld is co-writing, directing, producing, and starring in &lt;em&gt;Unfrosted&lt;/em&gt;, a new film about the origins of Pop-Tarts, for Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6t0WvK"&gt;Seinfeld’s fascination with the toaster pastry is well-documented, featuring the breakfast food &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmCTUBEluSE"&gt;in his stand-up&lt;/a&gt; and in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itWxXyCfW5s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;video interview&lt;/a&gt; on joke writing. Seinfeld is penning this film exploration alongside Spike Feresten and Barry Marder — two of &lt;em&gt;Bee Movie&lt;/em&gt;’s co-writers — using the classic stand-up bit as a jumping off point. Will it be a humorous spin on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/19/14322100/founder-review-michael-keaton-mcdonalds-ray-kroc-movie"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Founder&lt;/em&gt;-style origin story&lt;/a&gt;? Hard to say, but clearly Seinfeld has thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zFSOZD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YmCTUBEluSE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iP0CsB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfrosted&lt;/em&gt; has been shopped around for the last few days according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;, but Seinfeld’s existing relationship with Netflix is what helped seal the deal. Besides featuring the comedian’s modern stand-up specials, Netflix also secured the rights to Seinfeld’s popular interview show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/17/14304790/jerry-seinfeld-comedians-in-cars-getting-coffee-netflix-crackle-sony"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&lt;/em&gt; in 2017&lt;/a&gt; and will be the go-to location for anyone looking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/16/20868736/seinfeld-netflix-2021-hulu-friends-streaming-wars"&gt;to binge old &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; episodes later this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nRYjO3"&gt;This is definitely another example of Netflix reinvesting in the relationships with comedy talent it’s been cultivating for the last several years (see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21116858/adam-sandler-netflix-deal-four-movies-murder-mystery-most-viewed-2019"&gt;Adam Sandler’s Netflix-based streaming empire&lt;/a&gt;), but it also just seems like the kind of goofy film idea that could only get greenlit in the heady excesses of our current streaming era. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why 2021’s heat waves are so brutal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Heat Wave Continues in Southwest United States" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4UgyDnE9uEU1lptXt32Edd4U7oE=/0x8:5448x3640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69495165/1324130949.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - JUNE 17: A digital sign displays a temperature of 115 degrees Fahrenheit as a heat wave continues to bake the Southwest United States on June 17, 2021 in Las Vegas, Nevada. | Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dt9r8m"&gt;The US is only a few days into summer and another heat wave is already coming for the West. “Record shattering” would be an understatement to describe the last heat wave, which lingered over the Southwest last week and has since shifted eastward. Roughly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/climateguyw/status/1407411398204919809"&gt;4,000 new temperature records&lt;/a&gt; have already&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;been set this year. More are going to make the books over the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bg70El"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A heat dome is a trap&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pooO64"&gt;Both heat waves are caused by atmospheric conditions called heat domes. In short, a heat dome is a trap. It forms when high pressure in the upper atmosphere creates a sort of lid or cap that stops hot air from escaping, according to &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/heat-dome.html"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt;. As the air sinks back down to Earth, it compresses and heats up even more. The heat dome also blocks out clouds and storms, which might otherwise provide some relief from the sun’s hot rays. A heat dome also leads to longer and more intense heat waves because it creates a feedback cycle, according to Texas Tech University climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe. The hotter temperatures become, the stronger the heat dome gets, and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaLxI3"&gt;The heat dome that’s forecast to settle over the Pacific Northwest in the next three to seven days can also be called a “warm-core high,” according to National Weather Service forecaster David Roth. That’s a high pressure system that strengthens with height. The June record high for the state of Washington is 113 degrees Fahrenheit, which Roth says will probably be “threatened.” It’s unusual&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that this heat dome is forming so far north, where temperatures don’t normally get nearly as high as they are forecast to reach in the coming days. The average high temperature in Seattle around this time of year is 74 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPqBBx"&gt;That makes this heat dome particularly dangerous for communities that aren’t built for the heat. “You get acclimated to warm in the summer, but that’s only if you’re used to experiencing those conditions. This could be very unlike any other heatwave they’ve experienced,” Roth says. “So yeah, you would worry more about heat exhaustion, heat stroke, that sort of thing. Everyone’s going to need to stay in air-conditioned places and keep hydrated.” Unfortunately&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;only a third of homes in the Seattle area have air conditioning, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/seattle-is-least-air-conditioned-metro-area-in-the-u-s-census-data-show-so-how-do-locals-keep-cool/"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gZktOo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This could be very unlike any other heatwave they’ve experienced”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UHYTYk"&gt;The conditions driving this heat wave could persist until the end of next week, Roth says. It’s also expected to expand eastward toward Idaho and Montana, and southward into California &lt;a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php"&gt;next week&lt;/a&gt;. Lewiston, Idaho is forecast to reach 112 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday, four degrees above its daily record set in 1881. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVhnYZ"&gt;Heat domes are also bad news when it comes to drought and wildfires. They’re often related to drought because they direct storm systems away from the region, according Hayhoe. The West is already in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545107/satellite-images-california-drought-water-esa"&gt;epically bad drought&lt;/a&gt; that is drying up reservoirs and forcing farmers to abandon crops. Hot, dry conditions across the Western US are already turning forests and other ecosystems into tinder boxes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538603/2021-fire-season-us-west-forecast-drought-heat-wave"&gt;early in the fire season&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="cRKpoQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10620891"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qMsHGF"&gt;While the fever the US is running might feel unusual now, it could be part of a new normal driven by climate change. Higher global average temperatures are making heat waves and droughts more frequent and intense, while the fire season is growing longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="riD4Ip"&gt;“It’s as if we always have a chance of rolling a double six — so that’s an exceptional heatwave. But as climate changes, it’s sneaking more sixes onto our dice,” Hayhoe tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Climate change is also sneaking some sevens onto our dice. So not only are we getting more of these, but we’re also seeing that they’re getting stronger.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We regret to inform you that T-Mobile is selling a 5G-branded gin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LCOhGBVo2e8RQPnT2cd8PGEkZNk=/0x160:3833x2715/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69494965/5gin_crop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile’s 5G-branded gin and ginger beer go on sale tomorrow.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: T-Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FCFBBq"&gt;Whatever the reason, 5G-themed gin is now something that exists in the world, courtesy of T-Mobile. Ostensibly, “Ultra Capacity 5Gin” exists to celebrate a T-Mobile milestone: covering 300 million people with its low-band extended range 5G network and 150 million covered by its better midrange ultra capacity 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJtDl0"&gt;But maybe it just came down to the company seeing Ryan Reynolds having a good time, selling gin*, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/25/20982199/ryan-reynolds-mint-mnvo-t-mobile-ownership-deadpool-detective-pikachu"&gt;enjoying ownership of a wireless company&lt;/a&gt; and it thinking, “Let’s get in on that.” Or perhaps as the Mariners were &lt;a href="https://www.lookoutlanding.com/2021/5/18/22443250/tigers-make-justin-dunn-look-good-mariners-make-spencer-turnbull-historic"&gt;on the receiving end of yet another no-hitter&lt;/a&gt;, some marketing execs out for a night at ol’ T-Mobile Park drowned their sorrows in one too many $20 G&amp;amp;Ts and got to thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Yo9VQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With notes of pine, citrus, and unfulfilled Sprint acquisition promises&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Giq2mj"&gt;The corporate-branded gin nobody asked for is &lt;a href="https://heritagedistilling.com/"&gt;produced by Heritage Distilling&lt;/a&gt;, the Northwest’s preferred purveyor of flavored vodkas and Seahawks-themed whiskey. There’s a non-alcoholic option, too: Extended Range 5Ginger Beer, made by Jones Soda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPyy9h"&gt;If this sounds appealing and your home bar would benefit from a gin with “approachable piney notes” and a label with loud magenta branding, then you can &lt;a href="https://t-mobile5gin.com/"&gt;order a bottle for $30 starting tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;. The ginger beer also goes on sale tomorrow at $10 for a six-pack. Just do us a favor if you order some: maybe pour one out for that fourth wireless carrier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;T-Mobile was supposed to help set up&lt;/a&gt; after the Sprint merger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfunIO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Technically, Ryan Reynolds &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.diageo.com/en/news-and-media/features/diageo-to-acquire-aviation-gin-and-davos-brands/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;sold his gin company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for $610 million last August. Spiritually, he’s still kicking around as part-owner, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA continues to spend big on mobile games with $1.4 billion Playdemic acquisition </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Irn2xXyAD4JZUlFd1SuiM4zWFPI=/0x0:1520x1013/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69494935/970613582.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MJtKBV"&gt;EA is adding to its roster of mobile game developers &lt;a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Electronic-Arts-Acquires-Playdemic-Makers-of-the-Highly-Successful-Golf-Clash-Mobile-Game-From-Warner-Bros.-Games-and-ATT/default.aspx"&gt;by purchasing Playdemic&lt;/a&gt;, known for &lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt;, from WarnerMedia for $1.4 billion. The company says it plans on using Playdemic’s experience to help make future mobile games and that it’s interested in using &lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt;’s mechanics with other franchises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJ25s3"&gt;It’s possible that EA could be purchasing Playdemic not only to gain ownership of a successful mobile game (&lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt; has over 10 million installs &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playdemic.golf.android&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;on the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;), but because there’s opportunity for EA to incorporate some of its other series — &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22440408/ea-sports-pga-tour-release-date-course-list-majors"&gt;it makes the PGA golf games&lt;/a&gt; after all, which could tie in well with a mobile golf game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGbdXX"&gt;EA seems to be focusing on mobile gaming recently — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273187/ea-glu-mobile-acquisition-kim-kardashian-hollywood"&gt;also purchased mobile developer Glu&lt;/a&gt; in February for $2.1 billion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Tz28y"&gt;WarnerMedia, Playdemic’s former owner, is currently going through a transition, as it’s being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444031/warnermedia-discovery-merger-hbo-max-streaming-giant"&gt;spun out from under AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; to join with Discovery. &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/electronic_arts.html"&gt;The company says&lt;/a&gt; that it’s divesting from Playdemic as “part of [its] overall strategy to build games based on Warner Bros. storied franchises.” Indeed, if you go to &lt;a href="https://www.warnerbrosgames.com/games"&gt;Warner Bros. Games’ website&lt;/a&gt;, it’s dominated by franchises like Lego, Harry Potter, and Mortal Kombat (with &lt;em&gt;Scribblenauts&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt; being the only real exceptions). It also has upcoming games like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340247/gotham-knights-delay-release-date-2022"&gt;DC universe-based &lt;em&gt;Gotham Knights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. WarnerMedia says the rest of its games will become part of the combined Warner-Discovery company after the deal is settled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nHEWk"&gt;Mobile gaming has become a big focus for companies as the market has exploded. EA competitor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/2/9662214/actvision-blizzard-buys-candy-crush-king-5-9-billion"&gt;Activision purchased &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt;-maker King&lt;/a&gt; for $5.9 billion in 2015, and its &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/static-files/af35383a-0db9-44de-b0b2-180eac785930"&gt;recent earnings&lt;/a&gt; show that the division is now bringing in more money than Blizzard. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22458279/valorant-mobile-spinoff-riot-games"&gt;Many popular PC and console games&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, and EA’s own &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; have also gotten mobile ports.&lt;/p&gt;
