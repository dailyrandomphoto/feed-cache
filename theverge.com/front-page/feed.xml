    <title>Ghost of Tsushima is getting an enhanced director’s cut on the PS4 and PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_l-NArfs588lxVoks9T5B40PiR8=/0x0:1350x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69529908/51282495139_763df069a8_h.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8hDhb4"&gt;Sony and Sucker Punch’s hit game &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; is getting an enhanced director’s cut edition for both the PS4 and PS5 that will include a new island to explore and all of the content that has been released so far for the original game. The upgraded game will be available on August 20th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M89Zgl"&gt;The new content takes place on the island of Iki, and Sucker Punch says there will be new story content, characters, environments, armor, enemies, and more. “There are even new animals to pet!” &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/07/01/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-arrives-on-ps5-and-ps4-consoles-on-august-20/"&gt;Sucker Punch’s Andrew Goldfarb said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NJyfK3NNBaHiEKqrMDCFoRidnh8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693702/51281763051_48114bdd53_h.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NsxI21"&gt;Alongside the additional content, &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; will also have some PS5-exclusive features, such as using the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers on the DualSense controller. In addition, the PS5 version of the game will feature lip-synced voices for the Japanese voiceover option, addressing a major criticism from the original release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXM4EZ"&gt;“There will also be enhancements to 3D audio on PS5, as well as drastically improved load times, 4K resolution options and framerates targeting 60 FPS” for the PS5 version of the game, Goldfarb said. It’s unclear how these updates may improve upon the PS5 optimization patch Sucker Punch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1314641549406265346"&gt;released last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VH9Wzx"&gt;If you already own &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima,&lt;/em&gt; a patch will be available with “some” of the new updates when the director’s cut is available, according to Goldfarb. Current owners will also be able to bring their save over to the PS5 version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJdeNA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; will launch on its own for $69.99 on the PS5 and $59.99 on the PS4. But if you have the PS4 version of the original game, the path to upgrading to the director’s cut is a little complex. Here’s how Sony lays it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hTjFjX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you already own Ghost of Tsushima on PS4:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvyExW"&gt;You can pre-order an upgrade to &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; on PS4 for $19.99 USD. This upgrade will become available starting on August 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0a3639"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting on August 20:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8EPN0i"&gt;If you bought &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; PS4, you’ll be able to upgrade to &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; PS5 at any time for $9.99 USD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xk7Yhl"&gt;You can also upgrade directly (from original &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; PS4) to &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; on PS5 for $29.99 USD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UtLRu9"&gt;This all means that for people who want to upgrade to the PS5 version, it’s going to cost $30 whether you take the option to pay $20 now and $10 on August 20th or you choose to just pay $30 at launch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter, TikTok, Google, and Facebook promise to boost protections for women online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tik Tok Application: Illustration" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xXUHYCjOFyMEHm36EC_CdU00yzs=/0x0:4895x3263/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69529871/1058608390.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3h5nvg"&gt;At the UN Generation Equality Forum in Paris on Thursday Twitter, TikTok, Google, and Facebook committed to tackling online abuse and improving safety for women on their platforms. The pledge came following &lt;a href="https://ogbv.webfoundation.org/"&gt;consultations with the World Wide Web Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (WWWF) over the past year, aimed at examining online gender-based violence and abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BTuNyK"&gt;The WWWF said the consultations showed women want more control over who could reply or comment on their social media posts and more choice around what they see online, where, and when. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM0y76"&gt;According to the WWWF, the companies have pledged to “build better ways for women to curate their safety online” by offering more granular settings, such as who can see, share, or comment on posts; more simple and accessible language; easier navigation and access to safety tools, and by “reducing the burden on women by proactively reducing the amount of abuse they see.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BOuKIt"&gt;The way that last part is worded is a bit frustrating; it addresses the aftermath or the location of abuse, but not the person / people &lt;em&gt;committing&lt;/em&gt; the abuse. And just because the women aren’t &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; the abuse on social media, doesn’t mean the abuse has gone away. The platforms certainly bear some responsibility to make their online spaces safer, but until they get more proactive and less reactive, and go after the abusers, the onus will continue to fall on women and marginalized groups to report abuse and convince a social media platform that it’s worthwhile for them to address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="24r1YY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The pledge includes the platforms improving their systems to report abuse&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ctmDnI"&gt;In addition to the “better curation” checklist, as part of the pledge, the companies will put in place improvements to their reporting systems by offering users the ability to track and manage their reports, and establish additional ways for women to get help and support when they report abuse. They’ll also enable “greater capacity to address context and/or language,” which may allow for more subtle forms of verbal abuse or threats to be incorporated into enforcement measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9zly1"&gt;These all sound like excellent goals, but the release from the WWWF didn’t include any specifics about how each platform plans to achieve them. Nor did the companies themselves offer any comment as part of the news release, so we’ve reached out to all four for comment. Vijaya Gadde, head of legal, public policy, and trust &amp;amp; safety at Twitter said in an emailed statement that keeping everyone who uses Twitter safe and free from abuse is its top priority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2aoPT"&gt;“While we have made recent strides in giving people greater control to manage their safety, we know there is still much work to be done,” Gadde wrote, noting that women and underrepresented communities are disproportionately affected by abuse (which is pretty well known at this point). Gadde said abusive behavior “has no place on our service. It hurts those who are targeted and is detrimental to the health of the conversation and the role Twitter plays in the expression and exchange of ideas where people — no matter their views or perspectives — can be heard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SWSeWR"&gt;Facebook’s global head of safety Antigone Davis said in an email that the company was looking forward to working with other tech companies to make the internet safer for women. “To keep women safe from abuse, exploitation, and harassment online and offline, we regularly update our policies, tools, and technology in consultation with experts around the world—including with over 200 women’s safety organizations,” Davis said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JcmTsl"&gt;Tara Wadhwa, director of policy for TikTok US, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/promoting-online-safety-for-women"&gt;wrote a blog post &lt;/a&gt;outlining the company’s plans. “Over the coming months, we’ll begin to develop and test a number of potential product changes to our platform that address these priorities and help make TikTok an ever safer place for women,” Wadhwa wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRMY1B"&gt;Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIWmgG"&gt;At this point, there doesn’t appear to be anything binding the companies to these “commitments” other than the prospect of public shaming if they fail to deliver. And unfortunately, that tends to be the best way to get social media platforms to respond to users’ problems.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9o9ks"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google investigates why a carrier linked VPN ads to an SMS two-factor code</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of a letter envelope with a target over it with pixels floating around both." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qHXTx8FoTTBZ4IwZTQGqHQ7X_z8=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69529651/VRG_4614_3_EmailTracking.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Maria Chimishkyan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6LHgvf"&gt;Earlier this week, Australian developer Chris Lacy tweeted about a curious experience while logging into a rarely used Google account. When Google texted his two-factor authentication code, the message popped up along with an ad including a link for VPN services. Considering the downsides of phishing or malware distribution attached to a code that’s specifically intended to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465512/cybersecurity-online-security-privacy-breaches"&gt;keep your account secure&lt;/a&gt;, this didn’t go over well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yLns0c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to set up two-factor authentication on your online accounts","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22215571/factor-authentication-2fa-apple-microsoft-google-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="UrZprx"&gt;While Lacy did not name the carrier who delivered the text, Google Identity and Security senior director Mark Risher &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mrisher/status/1410017611018952704?s=21"&gt;clarified&lt;/a&gt; that the ad didn’t come from his company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OfEioX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These are not our ads and we are currently working with the wireless carrier to understand why this happened.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5iXZAJ"&gt;Google’s official statement on the matter is that “These are not our ads and we are currently working with the wireless carrier to understand why this happened.” The Messages app on Android didn’t display a preview, flagging it as possible spam, but it’s a less than ideal implementation of two-factor authentication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwTA9j"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/06/29/google-verification-code-sms-ad/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out that at least in some countries, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21012601/google-messages-spam-detection-verified-sms-features"&gt;uses Verified SMS&lt;/a&gt; to authenticate and secure messages, but it’s not clear if that would be possible here. I’ve never seen any spam attached to verification on texts, but until RCS and end-to-end encryption are widespread, it’s just one more reason to opt for code generators, hardware keys, or push notifications for login security instead of a text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pj2BXT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use a two-factor security key","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22458935/two-factor-security-key-how-to-yubico"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Google TV rolls out new Watch With Me series for celeb-curated streaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nYZOJbT0gFUKB0idwykUSRprMxA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69529501/Laverne_Cox_Google_TV_UI.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g1QBAY"&gt;Evidently acknowledging our collective content fatigue, Google TV has announced a new celebrity-curated Watch With Me series that should make finding something to binge a little less painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z6gOXg"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/google-tv/watchwithme-lavernecox"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href="https://goo.gle/3gRFjFe"&gt;Watch With Me&lt;/a&gt; series will spotlight series and movies loved by entertainers and artists. In addition to Watch With Me showcasing celebrities’ favorite flicks, the series will feature interviews with those curators about why they hand-selected a specific title to be featured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KA3PlW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Celebrities and artists will handpick their favorite titles to help you find something to watch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p3Vutr"&gt;Google TV’s algorithm is fairly good at surfacing relevant titles, but the idea is to allow these hosts to guide users specifically through a collection of movies that inspired them. The hub is yet another place to find something good to watch, and the added contextualization of each film may help introduce users to a title they may have missed on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vp3EkH"&gt;Google TV isn’t the first to spotlight titles with celebrity-curated hubs. HBO Max uses the format to spotlight favorites from featured personalities like Gal Gadot and Zack Snyder, and YouTube has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jimmyfallon/status/995059982893797376"&gt;similarly experimented&lt;/a&gt; with the format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mDaKM"&gt;Google TV’s new series will kick off with a collection selected by actress Laverne Cox, who chose titles like &lt;em&gt;Moonlight&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pretty in Pink&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, among other groundbreaking films. Google says users will be seeing the watchlist “over the next few days,” and when you have it, it can be found in the For You section of the platform. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch a police officer admit to playing Taylor Swift to keep a video off YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7FiXKtWmKafKf16GxoylEUWPEGk=/241x0:1294x702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69529496/Screen_Shot_2021_07_01_at_6.17.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image from the Anti-Police Terror Project&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WP4JV2"&gt;A confrontation Tuesday between a police sergeant and member of the public didn’t start out unusually. James Burch, policy director of the Anti Police-Terror Project (APTP), was standing outside the Alameda Courthouse in Oakland, California when an officer approached him and asked him to move a banner. As the two argued, the sergeant noticed he was being filmed. Then, he pulled out his phone and started playing “Blank Space” by Taylor Swift — in an apparent play to exploit copyright takedowns and keep the video off social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kDirp"&gt;“You can record all you want,” he said, according to a video obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I just know it can’t be posted to YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dblwjc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cmZmo81Cdcc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mAQscq"&gt;Bystanders have a First Amendment right to record police, but police officers &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/are-cops-playing-copyrighted-music-while-being-recorded-to-trigger-takedowns"&gt;have allegedly tried to exploit&lt;/a&gt; copyright law to prevent people from sharing those videos, playing music that could trigger a takedown notice. While playing music in the background of a video isn’t necessarily against YouTube’s rules, it can set off the company’s automatic takedown system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGVbOJ"&gt;In February, activist Sennett Devermont documented a Beverly Hills officer blasting Sublime’s “Santeria” on his phone after being asked questions, apparently to make the video more difficult to post online. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxb94/is-this-beverly-hills-cop-playing-sublimes-santeria-to-avoid-being-livestreamed"&gt;Devermont told &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that this wasn’t an isolated incident, sharing an earlier video where a different officer used the same tactic with a Beatles song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bvcvvr"&gt;In both cases, though, the officer didn’t directly admit to the practice. The Beverly Hills Police Department said playing music while answering questions is “not a procedure that has been recommended by Beverly Hills Police command staff” and that the videos were “currently under review.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTaa09"&gt;Now, there is explicit evidence of a police officer admitting to playing a popular song in order to keep a video off of YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHEiDc"&gt;Burch was at the courthouse on June 29th to support the family of Steven Taylor, who was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/20/san-leandro-shooting-walmart-police-steven-taylor"&gt;killed by San Leandro police officer Jason Fletcher&lt;/a&gt; while having a mental health crisis at Walmart. (Fletcher was later &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/us/California-Walmart-shooting-Jason-Fletcher-Steven-Taylor.html"&gt;charged with felony manslaughter&lt;/a&gt;.) He was listening to the pre-trial hearing with members of the Justice 4 Steven Taylor campaign when an officer approached him and asked him to move a banner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIomY8"&gt;“You’re saying there’s a genuine concern we have that someone’s going to trip on this banner?“ Burch asked, according to the video. “You can’t keep twisting this...” the sergeant responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fC9DHE"&gt;“This is as triggering as a situation can be for the family,” Burch tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “In our opinion a cop murdered their brother. Now we have cops marching out here telling us what to do? That is infuriating.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VegYV"&gt;When the sergeant whipped out his phone and started playing Taylor Swift, Burch was taken aback. “Are we having a dance party now?” he asked. “No, sir,” the sergeant said. “Are you playing pop music to drown out the conversation?” another APTP member asked. “No,” the sergeant responded. “He doesn’t want you recording so he’s playing music in the back,” Burch said. On camera, the officer said recording was fine — but posting it online wouldn’t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqF1FH"&gt;“The fact that these members of the Alameda County Sheriff’s Department would go to such lengths to deny us the ability to publicize their actions speaks volumes to how they perceive their relationship with the People of Oakland,” Burch said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pC6I02"&gt;Police aren’t the only ones interested in exploiting online copyright systems. In 2019, one Twitter user posted a “tip” for deplatforming fascists by playing music at rallies, then reporting videos of it when they were posted online. Copyright reform advocate &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/07/23/double-edged-swords-r-us.html"&gt;Cory Doctorow called the idea&lt;/a&gt; a “clever hack,” but he called out its potential for abuse by other groups, specifically including police looking to avoid scrutiny online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ns0Fxg"&gt;Social networks and copyright holders employ sometimes byzantine and often automated processes for detecting and removing copyrighted content. Users can appeal takedowns, but if they fail, receiving multiple strikes can limit an account’s monetization options or even get the user suspended. Meanwhile, automated systems can be overzealous at spotting supposed piracy, flagging even &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42580523"&gt;videos of white noise&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/copyright-bots-and-classical-musicians-are-fighting-online-the-bots-are-winning/2020/05/20/a11e349c-98ae-11ea-89fd-28fb313d1886_story.html"&gt;public domain classical music&lt;/a&gt;. They can also fail to identify videos that do include copyrighted material but would likely be protected as legal fair use. That’s made the system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/11/18220032/youtube-copystrike-blackmail-three-strikes-copyright-violation"&gt;ripe for abuse&lt;/a&gt; by scammers and other bad actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCv6kP"&gt;Videos like APTP’s don’t necessarily violate social media rules, but those rules aren’t very clear. A Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the company’s restrictions take into consideration how much of the total video contains recorded music, the total number of songs in the video, and the length of individual songs in the video. In 2019, YouTube introduced a policy that discouraged copyright holders from claiming revenue on videos including brief or “unintentional” music clips, although it said that could temporarily &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20806189/youtube-manual-music-copyright-claim-update-more-blocked-videos"&gt;lead to more blocked videos&lt;/a&gt;. Google declined to comment on how its policies would cover the Oakland video, instead pointing&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/our-commitments/safeguarding-copyright/"&gt;a page on how it protects copyrighted content&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzpg38"&gt;To Burch, the officer’s attempt to trigger a copyright takedown underlines why it’s important to film police interactions in the first place. “We know these agencies seek to avoid accountably,” he says. “It’s our job to be prepared in any situation to do the best we can to make sure the people in our community stay safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzLdKx"&gt;The Alameda County Sheriff’s Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Student gets Windows 11 running on a Windows Phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h9ZIsjpXHIFhT5T2k5_uahCiMQU=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69529203/HBkcxKy.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 running on a Windows Phone.&lt;/em&gt; | Gustave Monce (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSaJfudt8S4" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DKcXLk"&gt;The Windows 11 preview only got released earlier this week, but a student has already managed to get Microsoft’s latest operating system running on a Windows Phone. Engineering student &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gus33000"&gt;Gustave Monce has created&lt;/a&gt; a brief video demonstrating Windows 11 running on a Lumia 950 XL, one of the first devices to ship with Windows 10 Mobile. It was also one of Microsoft’s last Windows-powered phones before the company ended support for its mobile OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RjMMd"&gt;Windows 11 adapts surprisingly well for the 5.7-inch display, but the same can’t be said for the speed of animations. While Windows 11 is usable on the Lumia 950 XL, it doesn’t look like something you’d want to pull out of your pocket every day. But that’s not really the point. This is the latest achievement in a five-year hobby of tinkering with getting full versions of Windows running on Windows Phone devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXS2I8"&gt;“It all started really 5 years ago, when Windows 10 Mobile was near obsolescence,” says Monce, speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Monce teamed up with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/imbushuo"&gt;Bingxing Wang&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow engineer, to bring the idea of running full Windows on these phones to life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgFXxr"&gt;“As time went on and we started talking about it, discussion groups formed and in turn we had a community of people interested in running full Windows 10 on Lumia 950s,” explains Monce. “We’re now basically a team of about 15 people, and we’ve made a lot of progress.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sh9xm85B_jjBxfNHsDUAYBufdT0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693469/ezgif.com_gif_maker.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://woa-project.github.io/LumiaWOA/" target="_blank"&gt;Lumia WOA Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 can still run on a Windows Phone from five years ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Zi3Jbh"&gt;The team has ported and reverse-engineered drivers to get Windows 11 running on a Windows Phone and even written their own ones, too. “I wouldn’t say we were quite fast to do it, we took four years to get to the current state, but it’s actually impressive we got here with not much documentation on hand,” says Monce. “Because of all that work for Windows 10 and the work we previously did to support Windows 10X, Windows 11 was a natural path forward, and really didn’t take much to get going.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0ILT9"&gt;Monce and the team have &lt;a href="https://woa-project.github.io/LumiaWOA/status/"&gt;built a dedicated site for their project&lt;/a&gt;, and it includes tools, guides, and documentation on bringing Windows 10 and Windows 11 to these old Windows Phones. Not everything works perfectly, with the cameras failing to function, a hit to battery life, and calls / SMS occasionally breaking due to Microsoft’s OS changes. It’s more of a fun project to see just how far engineers and developers can push the devices that Microsoft has abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ae2d8l"&gt;It’s also a project that reminds me of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/19/12968306/htc-hd2-android-7-immortal"&gt;age-defying HTC HD2 smartphone&lt;/a&gt;. Developers and engineers kept HTC’s legendary Windows Mobile device going for a solid decade, with custom Android ROMs, mods, and even a port of Windows Phone 8 for the device. The Lumia 950 series is nearly five years old, and the fact that a team of people has ported Windows 11 to it is proof that there’s life in the old phone yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pinterest bans weight loss ads due to eating disorder concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DGpbHleRB0O5uFxQZWBwkTA-czA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69529105/akrales_170802_1743_0198.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5yxcQr"&gt;Pinterest &lt;a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterest-embraces-body-acceptance-with-new-ad-policy"&gt;said Thursday&lt;/a&gt; it is updating its ad policies to “prohibit all ads with weight loss language and imagery.” The company said in a blog post that it developed its new policy with guidance from the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), whose research shows there has been a &lt;a href="https://uncexchanges.org/2020/06/01/the-early-impact-of-covid-19-on-people-with-eating-disorders/"&gt;rise in eating disorders&lt;/a&gt; and unhealthy eating habits in young people during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEom8r"&gt;“Pinterest is the place people come for inspiration to create life they love,” the blog post reads. “It’s where everyone belongs—regardless of body shape or size. We’re empowering Pinners to plan for a summer and beyond without weight loss ads, so they can focus on what matters most.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJIbPU"&gt;The company claims it is the “only major platform to prohibit all weight loss ads,” and that the new rules build on the company’s existing ad policies against body shaming and weight loss scams. In 2019, Instagram restricted weight loss content and certain types of cosmetic surgery from being seen by users under age 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlXUhv"&gt;Beginning Thursday, Pinterest’s policy will prohibit: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2T78L6"&gt;Any weight loss language or imagery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dphh7P"&gt;Any testimonials regarding weight loss or weight loss products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="x5SmQq"&gt;Any language or imagery that idealizes or denigrates certain body types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4kijb6"&gt;Referencing body mass index or similar indices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ogl6ao"&gt;Any products that claim weight loss through something worn or applied to the skin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="iHpNa5"&gt;Ads for weight loss or appetite suppressant pills, before-and-after weight loss imagery, weight loss procedures like liposuction or fat burning, body shaming, and “unrealistic” claims about cosmetic results were already banned under the policy, the company added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJk9Bg"&gt;Elizabeth Thompson, interim CEO for NEDA, applauded the move. “NEDA is encouraged by this necessary step in prioritizing the mental health and well-being of Pinners, especially those impacted by diet culture, body shaming, and eating disorders,” she said in a statement. “We are hopeful this global policy will encourage other organizations and companies to reflect on potentially harmful ad messages and to establish their own working policies that will create meaningful change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9bDYN"&gt;Pinterest has been one of the more forward-thinking social media platforms when it comes to reining in harmful or misleading content in its ads. In 2016, it prohibited ads for “sensitive content including cultural appropriated and inappropriate costumes.” It stopped running political ads in 2018, and in 2019, Pinterest was one of the first social media companies to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/2/21/18234052/pinterest-bans-anti-vaccination-search-results-youtube"&gt;block anti-vaccination&lt;/a&gt; content, to prevent misinformation from spreading on its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJFK3q"&gt;Earlier this year the company said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382148/pinterest-silenced-no-more-act-sb331-discrimination-harassment"&gt;end the use of nondisclosure agreements&lt;/a&gt; (NDAs) when employees leave the company, following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175043/pinterest-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement-coo-francoise-brougher"&gt;settlement with its former COO&lt;/a&gt; who had alleged gender discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEfEeo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3Xtet"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s iOS app has a secret pinball Easter egg now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7chmpE3ByTsLXOEbWNIQBeMFLkg=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69528947/Google_pinball.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G8Qd91"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942"&gt;Google app on iOS&lt;/a&gt; appears to have gotten a new Easter egg: a rather entertaining little pinball app hidden away in the “Tabs” menu. The game appears to have been added a few weeks ago, as spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN5FFdPL7X8"&gt;several YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/o2ak9i/the_google_app_on_ios_has_this_neat_easter_egg/"&gt;a Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEYRIm"&gt;Opening the pinball game is simple: switch over to the Tabs, uh, tab in Google’s iOS app, clear out any open tabs, and then wait for the colorful shapes to start creeping up from the bottom of the screen. Swipe up on those shapes, and you’ll launch a surprisingly full-featured pinball game directly in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KFXkk6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A surprisingly good pinball game&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TVeeVS"&gt;Gameplay actually works like a mix of pinball and &lt;em&gt;Brick Breaker&lt;/em&gt;, with each level spawning a variety of colorful shapes that shrink and eventually vanish with each hit. Each level adds new bumper variations and more shapes to the mix, and there are even power-ups: a heart adds an extra life, a blue star splits the pinball into two, and a yellow star makes the ball larger and easier to hit. It also works offline, in the event that you’re stuck on a plane or subway and somehow manage to only have the Google app on your phone for internet-less entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjqgNm"&gt;Is there a real purpose to the pinball Easter egg? Not really. (The same could be said of regular pinball, I suppose.) But the existential nature of pinball is beyond the scope of this blog post — besides, I need to go back and try to beat my high score. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install the watchOS 8 public beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 6, in Product Red" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1f0JZyAt5kcMb6KUSfZfeeVP1B4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69528940/vpavic_200929_4216_0128.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 6, in Product Red color.&lt;/em&gt; | Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6d4Phv"&gt;Apple has now released public betas for iOS 15, iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, tvOS 15, and soon macOS Monterey. We’ve covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;how to get the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 betas here&lt;/a&gt; — follow along below if you’re interested in testing out the latest Apple Watch software, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdurFM"&gt;WatchOS 8 is expected to get a full, stable release this fall. It brings a handful of new features, including more workout types in the Fitness app, a new Mindfulness app, a watchface that works with Portrait Mode photos taken on an iPhone, as well as improved weather and smart home apps, among other things. It’s compatible with the Series 3, Series 4, Series 5, Series 6, and SE Apple Watch models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ukj6DG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to install the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 public betas","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Eo25aP"&gt;Before we go through how to install the beta, there are some important things you should know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="DlhMVb"&gt;Beta software is often buggy and you might have issues with third-party apps. Some bugs might include poor performance and bad battery life, an area the Apple Watch isn’t great at even with stable software. It’s best to try it out on a secondary watch if you have one (which, admittedly, most people don’t).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t4AYKj"&gt;Unlike the iOS and iPadOS betas, there’s no way to revert to the stable version of watchOS 7 if you install the watchOS 8 beta. If it’s buggy and not functioning well for you, you’re stuck with it until Apple releases the stable version in the fall. That’s probably enough of a reason to stay away from this one, particularly if you rely on your Apple Watch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="EInlh9"&gt;If those don’t scare you away, here’s how to install the watchOS 8 beta on an Apple Watch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Lslpir"&gt;Before you can install the watchOS 8 beta, you must have the iOS 15 beta installed on your iPhone. Go &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;follow these directions&lt;/a&gt; and come back here when you’re done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TU9jFz"&gt;Go to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software page&lt;/a&gt; in Safari on your iPhone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4sTCZE"&gt;Log in with your Apple ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8rmJ65"&gt;Scroll down and tap the “Get Started” link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xb8SJ8"&gt;Tap the watchOS 8 tab at the top of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3iy1P2"&gt;Select “enroll your Apple Watch” in the Get Started section of the watchOS 8 tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Z0J81u"&gt;Scroll down and tap the “Download Profile” button and then select “allow” on the pop-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vNrgIX"&gt;Install the beta profile in the Watch app on your iPhone, which should automatically open once the profile is downloaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qYnM9B"&gt;You will be prompted to reboot your Apple Watch. Tap the button to allow this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8lumGX"&gt;Once the Apple Watch is rebooted, go to the Watch app, tap “General,” tap “Software Update.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6n7DA9"&gt;You should see the watchOS 8 beta ready to be installed on your watch. Tap “Install” to proceed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="i0EOG4"&gt;The software update will download to your phone and then transfer to the watch. To complete installation, the watch needs to be on its charger, within range of your iPhone, connected to Wi-Fi, and with 50 percent or more charge. If all of those criteria are not met, it will pause the installation until the watch is ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="MZ9wJX"&gt;Once the beta software is installed, the watch will reboot itself and you’ll be all set to use it. In our experience, some complications and third-party apps did not function until they were opened manually on the watch or the watch was rebooted a second time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU officially launches digital vaccine passport</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vcfzi0eEX0fH3tHVzKPw4MO4NtY=/8x0:716x472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69528891/Screen_Shot_2021_07_01_at_9.49.57_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9TkaY1"&gt;The European Union’s &lt;a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/coronavirus/eu-digital-covid-certificate/"&gt;digital COVID-19 certificate&lt;/a&gt; officially launched today. The certificate allows people to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination, a recent negative test result, or a past COVID-19 infection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCP8fb"&gt;The certificate, which includes a QR code and digital signature, can either be displayed on a digital device or printed out. People who have the certificate &lt;a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/coronavirus/eu-digital-covid-certificate/"&gt;should not&lt;/a&gt; have to get an additional COVID-19 test or quarantine when traveling in the EU. The certificate only recognizes COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the EU — that includes the AstraZeneca, Pfizer / BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="duZQRD"&gt;Some countries in the EU have already been issuing and recognizing the certificate. Germany, for example, said in mid-June that it had already issued 5 million certificates. There will be a six-week phase-in period to get the rest of the EU member countries online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2eBgb"&gt;Countries not in the EU, like the UK, have started rolling out their own systems.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;England has its own COVID-19 pass through the National Health Service (NHS), which can also show proof of vaccination, recent test result, or past infection. People in Scotland and Wales can get a paper version. The EU &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-57665765"&gt;does not&lt;/a&gt; currently recognize the NHS pass, although some individual countries within the EU do, and that could change as countries work to make the systems compatible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjHzXC"&gt;Some states in the United States (like &lt;a href="https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/excelsior-pass"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;) have their own COVID-19 vaccine certificates. &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/03/17/walmart-empowering-individuals-with-access-to-digital-health-records-in-partnership-with-the-commons-project-foundation-and-clear"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; rolled out a digital record for people who were vaccinated at its stores. But there isn’t a nationwide system in the US.
