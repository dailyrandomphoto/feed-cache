    <title>Google is making it easier to find Wear OS apps on the Play Store</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="evXHCP"&gt;As we approach the release of Google and Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;joint smartwatch operating system&lt;/a&gt; later this year, Google today outlined some new Play Store improvements that will make it easier for customers to find and download apps to their Wear OS devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CG1JJT"&gt;The company is making it faster to search for smartwatch apps on your Android phone and instantly install them. There are new filters that are activated when you include “watch” or “watch face” in your Play Store search query. &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/wearos/thread/117791004/new-features-from-google-play-for-wear-os?hl=en"&gt;Based on this post&lt;/a&gt;, it sounds like Google will also be making an effort to better highlight the best and most useful wrist apps with more curated collections in the designated Wear OS and watchfaces sections of the Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hzgCp8EXoQQiLN9pofyTIj-Dy3k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726679/playandroid.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google is making it easier to discover and install Wear OS apps from your Android phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X5VbdP"&gt;The Play Store experience on smartwatches is also being refined and simplified; Google says it’s now “based on the principles of &lt;a href="https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you"&gt;Material You&lt;/a&gt;” and better suited for the “small surface area of a watch face.” Easy-to-tap cards are becoming more prominent on this version of the Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ig3t2RNuq5njf7IXaIRxNZImR-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726620/Screen_Shot_2021_07_19_at_2.09.40_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The revamped Play Store on Wear OS is better optimized for smartwatch screens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WgrUVp"&gt;In cases where you want to make an in-app purchase, “the Play Store now reliably prompts the purchase page to open on your Android phone or for a URL to open in a web browser, to easily complete your payment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvHA9F"&gt;Google says these tweaks will be coming to the Play Store both on Wear OS and Android in the standard, vague “coming weeks” time frame that tech companies love so much. Though they’re arriving first on Wear OS, the improvements to discoverability and browsing apps should also ultimately benefit the new OS that Google and Samsung are creating together. Samsung has said it will announce the first consumer product running that software, known only as “Wear” right now, later this year. The company recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;previewed what the interface will look like&lt;/a&gt; on its next generation of Galaxy smartwatches. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first real photos of Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack are here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KXB1fBBqnI5rJTAojt7_vjaFnF4=/0x1:1024x684/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69602166/E6rIKrBXoAEwUu5__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tbh0ec"&gt;Apple’s first official MagSafe Battery Pack is beginning to arrive on shelves, and one iPhone owner has now snapped what appear to be the first actual photos of the gadget. And yes, it’s a chonk. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cAaJDO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18206642/apple-smart-battery-case-iphone-xs-xr-max-reveiw-test-specs-price-features"&gt;Apple’s been going the big-bulge route for years&lt;/a&gt;, possibly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9872238/is-apples-smart-battery-case-mophie-patents"&gt;for legal reasons&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s not &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;much of a surprise — but boy was Apple strategic about which angles it revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575678/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-iphone-12-pro-mini-max"&gt;when it first announced&lt;/a&gt; this new accessory! Compare to Apple’s original render:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7mf1eOE8bo6R4Ze6QeWWs-pzf4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726603/MJWY3_AV4__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c01SM7"&gt;Now, here’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevenrussell"&gt;Steven Russell&lt;/a&gt;, the owner of the new pack, with a slightly different angle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WIRTtM0JoW3A389s2LLWTeamhfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726604/E6ntea7WQAAVxgu__1_.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A9Cbzx"&gt;Thickness isn’t necessarily a bad thing: wireless charging is notoriously inefficient, so Apple &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/07/14/apples-magsafe-battery-pack-has-more-capacity-than-it-seems---heres-why"&gt;needed to put a decent-size battery inside&lt;/a&gt; to make it worth your while, and it’s probably still thinner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297307/anker-magsafe-compatible-battery-pack-apple-iphone"&gt;than Anker’s option&lt;/a&gt; (which admittedly costs less than half the price). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqEpvF"&gt;Unlike Apple’s previously Smart Battery Cases, you may be getting more than just extended life for your phone — the snap-on, snap-off MagSafe pack appears to double as a Qi wireless charger for other devices. Russell says &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevenrussell/status/1417161249238945800"&gt;it seems to be charging his AirPods Pro wireless charging case&lt;/a&gt;, and you could theoretically even use it for an Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XCRdtD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;One more thing to add. I have been asked if it wirelessly charges AirPods. Answer appears to be yes. &lt;a href="https://t.co/2WCcKSOlbI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2WCcKSOlbI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steven Russell (@stevenrussell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevenrussell/status/1417161249238945800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pLkGzs"&gt;I’m buying one for my iPhone 12 mini. Here’s looking forward to seeing how Apple’s image (below) translates into the real world. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gigabyte Aero 15 OLED XD review: powerful, pricey, and flawed</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Plenty of power, with plenty of tradeoffs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PqNvrQ"&gt;Gigabyte has released a minor refresh to the Aero 15 OLED, its flagship laptop targeting gamers and creative professionals. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21255234/gigabyte-aero-15-review-creator-laptop-specs-price"&gt;last year’s model&lt;/a&gt;, this Aero 15 has a 4K OLED display and a decent port selection with Thunderbolt 4 and HDMI 2.1. Also like last year’s model, it has a somewhat clunky aluminum design, a flashy RGB keyboard, a fingerprint sensor in the trackpad, and a webcam inconveniently located underneath the screen. The big change is that the Aero 15 now includes Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and Nvidia’s RTX 3070 graphics card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeJb0f"&gt;The performance I saw here wasn’t a massive upgrade from the previous Aero 15, but it’s still some of the best gaming and productivity performance that you’ll find among laptops of this size. The 60Hz screen means you won’t be able to see the impressive frame rates the new hardware is capable of, so many gamers may get a better experience out of a device with a higher refresh rate screen. But if you’ve got your eye on an OLED screen, either because you’re doing color work on the side or you just want your games and movies to look great, this device should get the job done (albeit in a loud and hot manner). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdWV6T"&gt;The Aero model I have is $2,099 and includes Intel’s Core i7-11800H, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage, in addition to the RTX 3070 and the 15.6-inch 4K OLED screen. You can upgrade the RAM afterward up to 64GB, and there are two M.2 storage slots. Gigabyte isn’t actually selling this model yet, but it is selling an &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=Verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2FN82E16834233445" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;identical model&lt;/a&gt; with 16GB of RAM for $1,999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zeek9Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10633585"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IOmTBk"&gt;Getting straight to the gaming: &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;averaged 80fps on the ultra preset in 1080p, dropping to 37fps in 4K. With all sliders manually maxed, I had to drop to the medium preset in order to get a playable 4K frame rate of 46fps. &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; ran at 104fps in 1080p with ray tracing off and 81fps with ray tracing on, dropping to 48fps and 29fps, respectively, in 4K. (With DLSS on, 52fps and 38fps). So you could actually play both of these titles in 4K if you wanted to, but you’d need to drop the settings to hit the 60fps sweet spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="Aa5L9p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10633556"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xooOTz"&gt;A more recent release, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, ran at 71fps with ray tracing off and 30fps with ray tracing maxed, dropping to 42fps and 19fps, respectively, in 4K (with DLSS on the Quality setting). Note that because the Aero only has a 60Hz display, you won’t be able to see the advantage of frame rates above 60fps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNIu9a"&gt;The cooling system, which includes two 71-blade fans and five heat pipes, did keep the Core i7 at reasonable temperatures. During gaming, the CPU generally hovered below the mid-80s (Celsius) with occasional spikes to the high 80s or low 90s. The chassis itself, though, was often fairly toasty on the keyboard and too hot on the bottom to comfortably put on my lap, even when I was just working in Chrome. The fans are also very, very loud on Gigabyte’s Turbo Mode — someone walking by while I was running a video export asked if the laptop was going to take off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Aero logo and webcam on the Gigabyte Aero 15." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AIyVqPg5ahkK8CqT6VYRM-r9GGo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691909/mchin_190923_4657_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yep, that’s the webcam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GiHxOs"&gt;Nvidia’s mobile GPUs can be a bit confusing because the same chip can deliver widely varying frame rates depending on its wattage. The Aero’s RTX 3070 tops out at a 105W power draw, as does the 3070 in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299226/gigabyte-aorus-15g-review-gaming-laptop-price-specs-features"&gt;Aorus 15G&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus’ Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt; caps out at 100W with dynamic boost, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315386/razer-blade-15-base-2021-review-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-3070-qhd-screen-performance"&gt;Razer’s Blade 15 Base&lt;/a&gt; includes a 3070 with a maximum power draw of 95W. Gaming performance will vary by title, but on the whole, the Aero is pulling comparable frame rates to what we’ve seen both the Blade and the Zephyrus produce in 1440p. They’re even a bit better than the gaming-focused Aorus (which still has a 10th Gen Intel processor). On the other hand, the RTX 3070-equipped Aorus with a 240Hz 1080p display is just $1,799, which emphasizes the premium you’re paying for the Aero’s OLED screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Gigabyte Aero 15 OLED keyboard seen from above, lit up light blue." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wWQLUE5v79wixO-jU-WuNr_e3_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691904/mchin_190923_4657_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can customize the keyboard colors and effects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iDeQXC"&gt;Outside the world of gaming, the Aero was more of a mixed bag. The laptop comes preloaded with a new proprietary Control Center application, which is powered by Microsoft’s Azure AI. In theory, this function allows the computer to automatically swap between color, power, and performance profiles (Creator Mode, Gaming Mode, Meeting Mode, etc.) based on the application you’re using. This was a cool idea, but having my screen brightness change and a notification pop up every time I jumped in and out of Chrome or Steam was more of a nuisance than a help, so I ended up turning it off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="008ry3"&gt;On the productivity side, the Aero breezed through my usual workload, which includes around a dozen Chrome tabs, Slack, Spotify, and some occasional photo work. It strangely didn’t do as well as its predecessor on our Premiere Pro test, which involves exporting a five-minute, 33-second 4K video; this year’s Aero took four minutes and five seconds to complete the task, where its predecessor (the Aero 15 OLED XB) took just over two and a half — Gigabyte says this may have to do with Nvidia’s drivers. It’s still one of the fastest times we’ve ever seen from a laptop; the Aorus 15G and the Blade 15 Base, with this same GPU, both took over six minutes, while the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; with a GTX 1650 Ti took 4:23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Gigabyte Aero 15 open on a piano. The screen dispalys a shot of Night City from Cyberpunk 2077 from inside a high office window." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IPi-376jC3MauS0ecqrKNsqnNYA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691908/mchin_190923_4657_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The display covers 100 percent of the sRGB gamut, 100 percent of AdobeRGB, and 100 percent of P3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZcbvY"&gt;Premiere Pro exports aren’t an apples-to-apples comparison, of course, as different versions can produce different results. On the &lt;a href="http://www.pugetsystems.com/"&gt;Puget Systems&lt;/a&gt; benchmark for Premiere Pro, which tests both live playback and export performance with media at 4K and 8K resolutions, the Aero scored an 824. That’s one of the highest scores I’ve ever seen from a test unit, and it blows away the competition, soundly beating the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=44852"&gt;Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=32198"&gt;Blade 15&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=31376"&gt;Aorus 15G&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=8619"&gt;Aero XB&lt;/a&gt; with an RTX 2070 Super Max-Q. It’s more than twice the score we’ve seen from the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=34962"&gt;Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="SUHfUR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10633616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="65IPlj"&gt;That’s quite an impressive result, but you will need to make a few tradeoffs for that power. First, the battery life is a serious disappointment. Gigabyte claimed up to eight hours, but even on the Power Saver profile, the first Aero 15 unit I was sent only gave me around two. On a second unit, I was averaging three hours and four minutes of continuous work. That’s fine if you plan on never taking this thing anywhere (the 230W power brick is also quite hefty) but for someone like me who often works on the go, that life span isn’t great— &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; around the $2,000 mark. We got five hours and 45 minutes from the XPS 15, and over six hours from the Aorus 15G, so that’s worth considering if you’re a mobile user who likes the Aero’s look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gFUD87"&gt;There are a few other things. The webcam does have a convenient physical shutter, but it’s also located right above the keyboard, directly under the Aero logo on the bottom bezel; it gives anyone you’re video chatting with a great view of your nostrils. There’s a fingerprint sensor in the top left corner of the touchpad, which is handy, but my finger also ran into it a number of times while I was navigating. Finally, the keyboard is comfortable (it’s got a NumPad and a bit of a soft click), but the flashy RGB lights are quite, well, visible, and won’t necessarily be what everyone wants to have in an office or coffee shop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Gigabyte Aero 15 OLED open on a piano seen from above, angled to the left. The keyboard is lit up light blue. The screen displays a desktop with a gray and white background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C2v2Rl7O5-7oP7pxOc6O2iptxyo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691903/mchin_190923_4657_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I just wish it lasted longer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tX9jI4"&gt;All in all, the Aero is a decent option for you if you’re looking for a powerful OLED laptop with lots of pizzazz. But its downsides — particularly the battery life and the nosecam — are significant, and it’s worth considering whether you’ll be taking full advantage of the chips and the 4K OLED in return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoMpQY"&gt;For example, none of the popular titles tested here are ideal to run in 4K at their maximum settings. And while the Aero 15 is getting better frame rates than the Aorus in 1080p, you’ll still only be seeing 60fps on the Aero, while the higher refresh rate screen on the Aorus will show you more. And there’s also a litany of QHD laptops out there, the Zephyrus G15 and the Blade 15 included, that can run games very well at that resolution — and they can certainly break 60 on some of the titles here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sHWKrA"&gt;That leaves content creators and other professionals who plan to use the Aero as a work driver, as the real audience for this device, and while this is certainly one of the most powerful laptops for that sort of workload, I do wonder how many of these folks are okay with the short battery life and the nosecam. Those may be sacrifices worth making for some people, but they’re certainly a lot to ask. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia RTX 30-series graphics cards will be available in-store at Best Buy on July 20th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ya9hUIYJG6JptKUA1UqwotzlMrM=/15x0:4637x3081/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69601826/twarren_rtx3080_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZuvtwJ"&gt;Nvidia’s elusive RTX 30-series graphics cards are almost never in stock (for their MSRP cost, at least), but they’ll be available to purchase fair-and-square tomorrow, Tuesday, July 20th, at some Best Buy locations around the US (per &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/2021/7/19/22583595/nvidia-geforce-rtx-30-series-graphics-card-best-buy-in-stock-order"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746669152502278466" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Employees at these locations&lt;/a&gt; will begin giving out tickets to a select amount of people waiting in line at 7:30AM local time Tuesday morning, and getting one of these tickets will guarantee you the opportunity to purchase a GPU when each store opens up at 8:00AM local time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gv0hsx"&gt;Best Buy hasn’t shared which Nvidia RTX models will be available during this drop. Given that &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746669152502278466" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it shows the RTX 3080 Ti in its blog post&lt;/a&gt;, that could be an indication that you may have the opportunity to drop $1,199 on one of Nvidia’s most capable and pricey GPUs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqNvcS"&gt;It’s also possible that the retailer will have a wider variety to suit more budgets in stock, perhaps with either the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21726429/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RTX 3060 Ti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22524897/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-ti-review-test-benchmarks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RTX 3070 Ti&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt; mixed in. Regardless of what’s available for grabs, the stock is likely to dry up quickly at each location, so be early if you want to ensure that you get a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VStn1J"&gt;Check out the links just above for reviews of each of Nvidia’s latest graphics cards. It might be that you don’t need to spend as much as you thought if you’re gaming on a 1080p monitor. Conversely, if you’re playing on a 1440p or 4K gaming monitor, the reviews should give you a good idea of which card might be best suited to handle some of your favorite games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden says Facebook isn’t ‘killing people,’ but misinformation causes harm</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Speaks On The American Rescue Plan At White House" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WxdCIDkf7QnGftWQcuPuiuh5Cyc=/0x0:7836x5224/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69601745/1234059694.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r3GI4s"&gt;On Monday, President Joe Biden said that vaccine misinformation on Facebook harms people, while partially walking back a statement he made last week in which he told reporters that platforms like Facebook were “killing people” by allowing misinformation to spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0R6ZkU"&gt;“Facebook isn’t killing people, these 12 people are out there giving misinformation,” the president said, citing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578431/white-house-surgeon-general-facebook-youtube-twitter-covid-19-misinformation-vaccines"&gt;an administration report&lt;/a&gt; last week on online coronavirus vaccine misinformation. “That’s what I meant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8Ms4BU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook isn’t killing people, these 12 people are out there giving misinformation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5SVQzu"&gt;“My hope is that Facebook, instead of taking it personally … that they would do something about the misinformation, the outrageous misinformation about the vaccine,” Biden continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Z2s38"&gt;Last week, the White House ramped up its fight against vaccine information in statements and reports directly tying social media platforms like Facebook to rising coronavirus case numbers. Asked a question about social media on Friday, Biden told reporters, “They’re killing people … the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated, and they’re killing people.” This statement was broadly received as a criticism of Facebook, a company White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki criticized last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIrySI"&gt;Reached for comment, a Facebook spokesperson defended the company’s actions against vaccine misinformation. “We will not be distracted by accusations which aren’t supported by facts,” the spokesperson said. “The facts show that Facebook is helping save lives. Period.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="274K67"&gt;Tensions between the White House and Facebook have been escalating for months, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/us/politics/biden-facebook-social-media-covid.html?smid=tw-share"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;last week. Administration officials presented Facebook with CrowdTangle data that suggested vaccine misinformation was increasing on the platform, but Facebook has refused to share any of its own data with the administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CjqrMN"&gt;It remains to be seen if the White House will take more direct action to influence Facebook moderation. Asked if he would hold Facebook directly accountable, Biden said on Monday, “I’m not trying to hold people accountable. I’m trying to make people look at themselves in the mirror.” He continued, “Think about that misinformation going to your son, your daughter, your relative, someone you love. That’s all I’m asking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Axyn1v"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRA9Zs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jip7ax"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite champ Bugha is getting his own in-game skin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fortnite World Cup Finals - Final Round" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bzfmumednkHI9RzrwL9SLuZ1NV4=/0x1:3225x2151/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69601457/1164790657.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dkwnNK"&gt;Two years ago, Kyle “Bugha” Giersdorf became the first — and so far, only — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/29/8934329/fortnite-world-cup-finals-epic-games-esports-ninja-tfue-bugha-marshmello"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; World Cup champion&lt;/a&gt;. Now he’s being immortalized in the game itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="BeRwgX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:8714210"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kkiulz"&gt;As part of its “icon series,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22570612/lebron-james-fortnite-skin-release-date"&gt;which most recently included LeBron James&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/world-champion-bugha-is-next-to-join-the-fortnite-icon-series"&gt;Epic is adding a Bugha skin to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on July 20th&lt;/a&gt;. The skin comes with a handful of different outfits, including what Bugha was wearing when he lifted the World Cup trophy. Most importantly, that trophy — modeled after the iconic &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; battle bus — is available as back bling, complete with Bugha’s adorable pug poking its head out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUR47A"&gt;Bugha joins a growing list of real-world humans to be featured in the virtual battle royale, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399880/fortnite-neymar-skin"&gt;Neymar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21065235/ninja-fortnite-skin-announced-stream-tyler-blevins-available-date"&gt;Tyler “Ninja” Blevins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrOLSy"&gt;Due to the pandemic, that 2019 edition of the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;World Cup remains the only one that has taken place. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21243190/fortnite-world-cup-2020-canceled"&gt;The tournament was canceled in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22152744/epic-fortnite-world-cup-2021-canceled-fncs"&gt;developer Epic promised more tournaments this year&lt;/a&gt;, it also said that would not include a world championship.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Web Services bans accounts linked with Pegasus spyware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mPplbmgNggevx1QtVobhQQeUksY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69601333/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="amzAvh"&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS) has banned NSO Group, the company behind the Pegasus spyware program. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgx5bw/amazon-aws-shuts-down-nso-group-infrastructure"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reported the ban&lt;/a&gt; this morning, the day after &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/?itid=hp_alert"&gt;a sweeping report alleged&lt;/a&gt; Pegasus was used to target the phones of human rights activists and journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CYVFc"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/"&gt;Amnesty International investigation into Pegasus&lt;/a&gt; says the tool compromised targets’ phones and routed data through commercial services like AWS and Amazon CloudFront, a move that it said “protects NSO Group from some internet scanning techniques.”  (&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; notes that &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj4p3w/nso-group-hack-fake-facebook-domain"&gt;a 2020 report&lt;/a&gt; previously described NSO using Amazon services.) Amnesty International wrote that it had contacted Amazon about NSO and Amazon had responded by banning NSO-related accounts. “When we learned of this activity, we acted quickly to shut down the relevant infrastructure and accounts,” an Amazon Web Services spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDRtDC"&gt;AWS wasn’t the only service NSO apparently used. The Amnesty International report links it with several other companies, including DigitalOcean and Linode. NSO allegedly favored servers in Europe and the United States, particularly “the European data centers run by American hosting companies.” As the report describes it, NSO would deploy Pegasus malware through a series of malicious subdomains, exploiting security weaknesses on services like iMessage. Once Pegasus compromised a phone, it could collect data from the phone or activate its camera and microphone for surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mvu4NL"&gt;NSO describes Pegasus as a tool for surveilling terrorists and cybercriminals. But yesterday’s reporting — comprising work from Amnesty International, Forbidden Stories, and 17 news outlets — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22582532/pegasus-nso-spyware-target-phones-journalists-activists-investigation"&gt;says governments deployed it indiscriminately&lt;/a&gt; against political figures, dissidents, and journalists. That included attempting or completing attacks on 37 phones belonging to targets like &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; journalists, as well as two women close to murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The NSO has objected to the reporting, calling it “full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android TV is swiping some of Google TV’s best features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ggj7dJKrYRBSdelq2onkOVEHvtw=/74x0:865x527/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69601117/image003.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android TV is finally getting a watchlist.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iq02td"&gt;Android TV is swiping some of the best content discovery tools from the Google TV platform, including a watchlist and more finely tuned recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FN0vfU"&gt;Beginning this week, Android TV users will be able to add titles to a watchlist that will populate as a row in the Discover tab. To add movies and series to this section, users can either select “watchlist” from a title’s details page or long-press on a title from the Discover tab and select “add to watchlist.” Additionally, users will be able to add shows to this section from their other gadgets with Google search or by using the Google TV mobile app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXJ1Ib"&gt;Google TV also features the ability to refine the kinds of titles that a user is recommended with a card-swiping tool. This feature is now making its way to Android TV, allowing users to decide whether they’d like to see titles more or less like the one being recommended. This tool can also be found in the Discover tab or in settings by selecting Device Preferences, Home Screen, and then Content Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1aIBjCUwXpUT63tMW1zvVnFrTSM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722646/image004__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android TV users can now swipe on content they want to see more or less of.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8P2nUI"&gt;Lastly, trailers will play automatically on detail pages if they’re available. If that’s not your thing, the feature can be turned off in settings by navigating to Device Preferences and then Home Screen under “Enable video previews.” The changes follow a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22263131/android-tv-software-update-ui-interface-menus-google-chromecast-refresh"&gt;previous update&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year to Android TV’s interface. Like these latest features, that one similarly made the Android TV experience feel more like the one you get with Google TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJZ5Yo"&gt;A spokesperson said users will begin to see these features appear on their Android TV interfaces starting this week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp will let you join group calls after they start</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UN40B3fSEjucZOIMmZ9Kvi6_U0c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69601120/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rwnvyT"&gt;WhatsApp is rolling out a new joinable calls feature which will let you hop onto group calls after they’ve started, the Facebook-owned company &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/whatsapp-joinable-group-calls/"&gt;announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The new feature means you’ll be able to join a call with your friends and family when you’re ready, kind of like what you can do with a group Zoom or Google Meet call right now. Given the massive popularity of WhatsApp, this could be a useful feature for many people who communicate over the messaging service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ery3rN"&gt;You can get an idea of how the interface for hopping onto calls works in the image below — it looks like you’ll just need to tap a join button.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;WhatsApp’s interface for joinable calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HOFHtK"&gt;There’s also a new call info screen so that you can see who is currently on the call and who is invited but hasn’t joined yet. Joinable calls will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/5/11370106/whatsapp-messenger-end-to-end-encryption-open-whisper"&gt;still be end-to-end encrypted&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArBtTF"&gt;The new joinable calls feature starts rolling out on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lidar maker Velodyne loses its CEO amid internal chaos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Yandex NV Trials Driverless Taxis" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-ieisByKbyX78a2tvfUOcz-Q2Qw=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69600900/1164317768.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sbOLO4"&gt;Velodyne, a leading manufacturer of lidar laser sensors, announced that CEO Anand Gopalan would be stepping down. The news comes as the sensor company has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453138/velodyne-david-hall-spac-letter-board-removal"&gt;embroiled in a bitter war&lt;/a&gt; between its founder, David Hall, and the company’s board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnUWhs"&gt;Gopalan, who previously served as Velodyne’s chief technology officer before taking the reins from Hall in January 2020, is stepping down as both CEO and a member of the board effective July 30th, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uVYij"&gt;But rather than name a replacement, Velodyne is setting up something called “Office of the Chief Executive” comprised of several members of the company’s leadership team, including chief operating officer Jim Barnhart, chief financial officer Drew Hamer, head of human resources Kathy McBeath, and chief commercial officer Sinclair Vass. The move may be temporary, though, as the board is also retaining an executive search firm to find a replacement for Gopalan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t3PgWp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;But rather than name a replacement, Velodyne is setting up something called “Office of the Chief Executive”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5saFcU"&gt;For the last several months, Velodyne has been a company at war with itself. In April, the board ousted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295550/velodyne-founder-lidar-david-hall-marta-investigation-board"&gt;Hall as chair of the company’s board, and his wife, Marta Thoma Hall, as its chief marketing officer&lt;/a&gt;, citing “inappropriate behavior” by the couple. Marta Hall remains a member of Velodyne’s board of directors, while David Hall resigned his position on March 2nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nU3G8w"&gt;The following month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453138/velodyne-david-hall-spac-letter-board-removal"&gt;David Hall called for the resignation&lt;/a&gt; of two of the company’s SPAC-appointed board directors, whom he blames for Velodyne’s “poor financial performance.” He accused the board of financial misdeeds, including padding Gopalan’s compensation “despite knowing the company would miss its 2020 projections.” And he claimed that he and his wife were ousted from their positions over “frivolous claims.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEo8oX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16491052/velodyne-lidar-mapping-self-driving-car-david-hall-interview"&gt;Hall has long been revered in the world of autonomous vehicle technology&lt;/a&gt; as a pioneer in the use of laser sensors to enable AVs to “see” the world around them. Lidar, which stands for “light detection and ranging,” uses thousands of laser beams to sense objects and measure their distance. The cone- or cylindrical-shaped sensor perched on the roof of a vehicle has become synonymous with self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LppUC4"&gt;In June 2020, Velodyne struck a deal with special acquisition company (SPAC) Graf Industrial Corp., with a market value of $1.8 billion. It was part of a wave of companies in the transportation technology space choosing to go public via SPAC and thus avoiding a lot of the scrutiny that comes with a more traditional IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOjO2p"&gt;But Velodyne contends that its financial outlook remains “unchanged” despite Gopalan’s resignation. The company, which expects its 2021 revenue to be between $77 million and $94 million, will report its second quarter earnings on August 5th. &lt;/p&gt;
