    <title>Elon Musk slams Biden as ‘not the friendliest’ after White House EV summit snub</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="biden (flickr)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D6Fgh09AQkJKm04XS-C6V1026uM=/1x0:1024x682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923202/biden.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E7YdLQ"&gt;Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk criticized President Joe Biden as “not the friendliest administration” after the White House snubbed his company last month. Musk’s comments came &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698563/elon-musk-code-conference-liveblog"&gt;during a Code Conference interview&lt;/a&gt; and followed a tweet in which the Tesla CEO mocked Biden using similar insults as former President Donald Trump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plBtCg"&gt;The Biden administration invited auto executives to the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/05/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-steps-to-drive-american-leadership-forward-on-clean-cars-and-trucks/"&gt;White House last month&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the shared goal of increasing the production of electric vehicles. Top officials from Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis were invited. But Tesla, which is the largest EV maker in the world, was not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="P0nG0N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Controlled by the unions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bDxax7"&gt;One potential reason that Tesla wasn’t invited is that its factory workforce is not unionized, while Biden is a big supporter of unions. During the Code interview, Musk went a step further, claiming that Biden’s administration was “controlled by the unions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifUYr2"&gt;Tesla has been actively fighting against an attempt to organize Tesla workers at the company’s Fremont, Calif. plant. Musk himself was found to have &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/9/30/20891314/elon-musk-tesla-labor-violation-nlrb"&gt;violated labor law&lt;/a&gt; when he tweeted anti-union comments in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leVCqV"&gt;Musk has been tweaking Biden on Twitter for weeks. Last week, when asked why Biden didn’t issue a statement about SpaceX’s recent rocket launch, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1439665626914635783?s=20"&gt;Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “He’s still sleeping,” echoing a Trump nickname for Biden, “Sleepy Joe.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk: ‘we probably don’t need’ NDAs for Tesla’s ‘Full Self-Driving’ beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_Z6z5d9DFZt6KLos-ohsHk1hFQ=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923196/REC_ASA3_CODE21_20210928_143813_0138.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Asa Mathat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yhPZrE"&gt;Tesla has been making participants in the “Full Self-Driving” beta test &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ezxq/how-teslas-self-driving-beta-testers-protect-the-company-from-critics"&gt;sign non-disclosure agreements&lt;/a&gt;, but CEO Elon Musk said Tuesday “we probably don’t need” them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84zWsv"&gt;The reason? “There’s a lot of videos” being shared of the beta software in action, Musk said on Tuesday during the 2021 Code Conference. “People don’t seem to listen to me” and are “just ignoring it anyway.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGLfO4"&gt;“I don’t know why there’s an NDA,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o82iUX"&gt;Tesla has had a small group of owners testing out the beta version of its “Full Self-Driving” software — which, despite the name, does not make the company’s cars fully autonomous — on public roads for about a year now. But this week, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ezxq/how-teslas-self-driving-beta-testers-protect-the-company-from-critics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the company makes participants in the program sign NDAs. These agreements even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22696463/tesla-fsd-beta-nda-video-clips-controversy-full-self-driving"&gt;discourage people from sharing footage&lt;/a&gt; of the beta software performing poorly because “there are a lot of people that want Tesla to fail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="a8cuDD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tesla asks owners to share fewer clips of ‘Full Self-Driving’ beta mistakes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22696463/tesla-fsd-beta-nda-video-clips-controversy-full-self-driving"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="B6eRsp"&gt;The details about the NDA — and Musk’s apparent reversal on using them — come as Tesla is set to rapidly expand the number of people who have access to the software, despite a recent warning for caution from the head of the National Transportation Safety Board. Musk and his company say that they are using the sensors in Tesla’s cars to make sure only safe drivers enter the program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqdcae"&gt;“The transition period to new technology is always a little bumpy,” he said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqtq22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Astro is ‘terrible’ and will ‘throw itself down’ stairs, developers reportedly claim</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZsjNiQvHf2kpkkqJrR1eXOb2pKU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923157/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you see a flight of stairs.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xaEiqf"&gt;Some of the people building Amazon’s Astro home robot are not impressed with it, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ypp8/leaked-documents-amazon-astro-surveillance-robot-tracking"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. One person who worked on the robot, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;was announced today&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly called it a “disaster that’s not ready for release,” while another said it was “terrible,” and the idea that it’d be a useful accessibility device (part of Amazon’s pitch is that Astro can help with elder care) was “absurdist nonsense.” The sources also mentioned that the bot doesn’t handle stairs well, with one even saying that it would “throw itself down” them “if presented the opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0wMrR"&gt;To make matters worse, &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; also reports that the robot is fragile and that several devices had broken. That’s not great news for a $1,000 (or $1,449) robot that lives on the floor, where it’s prone to being stepped on by children, kicked by inattentive adults, or attacked by pets displeased with its presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7Mz2z9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Astro is always watching&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sJBBVd"&gt;Leaked documents and videos of developer meetings obtained by &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; also show that Astro is doing a lot of surveillance with its facial recognition systems, and the feature where it follows people around if it doesn’t recognize them. &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;’s sources say that it’s not great at actually figuring out who people are, which could lead to Astro annoyingly nipping at the heels of people it should know. One of the people who worked on it called its data collection “a privacy nightmare.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxlzjV"&gt;It’s not necessarily surprising that Astro is always watching, though — it comes with a Ring Protect Pro subscription, and Amazon’s own marketing for the robot shows off that it can be used as a security device (but in the context of wild animals entering your home rather than people). The most surprising thing is that we’re seeing leaked documents, videos, and hearing from grudging developers on the&lt;em&gt; same day &lt;/em&gt;the device was announced. Someone, or multiple someones, inside Amazon must not be swayed by the robot’s charms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gib41L"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sj1t3msy8dc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yizb2o"&gt;The leak also somewhat recontextualizes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698401/amazon-astro-invite-preorder-how-to-info-early-access-price"&gt;Amazon’s invite-based rollout&lt;/a&gt;. You currently can’t just buy the robot, you have to request an invite, a process which requires filling out a survey to indicate whether your house would be a good fit for Astro (which includes a question about what style stairs you have). It’s possible Amazon is trying to put these bots into the best case scenario, to see if they can even survive that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s research on kids even considered turning playdates into growth drivers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XkF-lCaeg_52AmHx1o5Yy5Yzv1I=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923121/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W1p7gL"&gt;Facebook’s interest in understanding and eventually acquiring younger users extends well beyond &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230822/facebook-messenger-kids-international-expansion-group-settings-friend-requests-supervised-friending"&gt;Messenger Kids&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;currently paused plans for a child-friendly Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. A new report in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s series on Facebook’s internal research &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-instagram-kids-tweens-attract-11632849667"&gt;shows the company’s focus on kids goes much deeper&lt;/a&gt;, including studying children younger than four years old in the hopes of better designing future products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6n5cm"&gt;The company’s child research is primarily motivated by the success of apps like TikTok and Snapchat in attracting younger users. “With the ubiquity of tablets and phones, kids are getting on the internet as young as six years old. We can’t ignore this and we have a responsibility to figure it out,” a confidential Facebook document viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reads. Another possible cause for concern: the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;writes that the number of teenagers using Facebook daily has fallen 19 percent in the last two years and could drop an additional 45 percent by 2023, according to a document the publication saw. Suddenly, the directive to “imagine a Facebook experience designed for youth” makes more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aENaAv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Children could be converted to Instagram and Facebook users down the road&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CpzZ5c"&gt;Facebook’s child research has led it down several paths. The company reportedly explored encouraging children to use Messenger Kids in person, according to a presentation the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; viewed called “Exploring playdates as a growth lever.” Facebook researchers have also tried to introduce a more holistic understanding of childhood by breaking things down into six age brackets: “adults, late teens ages 16 to maturity, teens ages 13 to 15, tweens ages 10 to 12, children ages 5 to 9 and young kids ages zero to four,” a slide mentioned in the report reads. One presentation set a goal of transitioning younger users from Instagram to the original Facebook, or the “Life Coach for Adulting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmONm5"&gt;The idea that Facebook might consider newborns in its product decisions is an admittedly odd one. That the company has children in mind at all isn’t, though. As Instagram head Adam Mosseri notes in a statement included in &lt;em&gt;The Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Vw4Vbf"&gt;It’s not new and it’s not a secret that social-media companies try to understand how teens and preteens use technology. Like all technology companies, of course, we want to appeal to the next generation, but that’s entirely different from the false assertion that we knowingly attempt to recruit people who aren’t old enough to use our apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2g40JO"&gt;The possible effects Facebook’s products could have on younger users are now coming to light. Earlier reporting on Facebook’s research shows that Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;can have negative impacts on younger users’ body image&lt;/a&gt;. Concern over how the app could potentially harm children is great enough that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675802/facebook-instagram-teens-harm-blumenthal-blackburn-markey-kids"&gt;Congress is getting involved&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696698/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-markey-blumenthal-blackburn-pause"&gt;Facebook representatives are slated to testify&lt;/a&gt; at a hearing this Thursday. Clearly, the social network will have plenty to answer for soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk to Jeff Bezos: ‘you cannot sue your way to the Moon’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ThZhFqH38qPCftOp0eIwHCLtL2c=/36x0:2016x1320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923005/FAZxtkCVgAEXlov.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LtVatt"&gt;Elon Musk isn’t happy that fellow mega-billionaire Jeff Bezos keeps suing to stop SpaceX’s projects, and he shared a message for the Amazon founder during the 2021 Code Conference on Tuesday: “you cannot sue your way to the Moon, no matter how good your lawyers are.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNScTE"&gt;Musk was responding to a question from journalist Kara Swisher about how Bezos’ space company, Blue Origin, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22623022/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-sue-nasa-lawsuit-hls-lunar-lander"&gt;recently sued to block a contract NASA gave SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; to develop a lunar lander. Amazon has also protested SpaceX’s Starlink internet satellites with the Federal Communications Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3r11gL"&gt;Swisher asked Musk Tuesday if he has spoken to Bezos about the legal fights. “Not verbally, just... subtweets,” Musk said. (In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644158/elon-musk-jeff-bezos-spacex-blue-origin-lawsuits-complaints-starlink-tweet"&gt;Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: “Turns out Besos [sic] retired in order to pursue a full-time job filing lawsuits against SpaceX …”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUPdVe"&gt;Musk wasn’t all vinegar with regards to his billionaire space race cohort. When Swisher asked him about the suborbital flights that Bezos and Richard Branson recently took with their own companies, Musk said he “thought it was cool that they’re spending money on the advancement of space.” But, he was sure to point out, “suborbital is [just] a step in the direction of orbit.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now queue to purchase a PS5 at Sony (update: sold out) </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q-JYJyp8wYnf3Sc7-RaUtK4ZzrQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922999/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a6g9tj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 28th, 6:52PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Sony has sold out of the PS5 and PS5 Digital Edition for the day. We’ll make sure to let you know when the next opportunity comes up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqiKZ8"&gt;Nearly a year after making its debut, the PlayStation 5 remains &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/23/22434905/ps5-restock-best-buy-walmart-sony-playstation-5"&gt;notoriously difficult to get your hands on&lt;/a&gt;. Sony has been one of the most reliable retailers when it comes to console restocks, however, and the company often opens its online queue for customers who don’t mind waiting for a chance to secure Sony’s next-gen console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7mhzE"&gt;If you want to have another go at it, Sony has reopened the queue for ordering the &lt;a href="https://direct-queue.playstation.com/?c=sonyied&amp;amp;e=aat3wy9opm&amp;amp;t=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%3Fqueueittoken%3De_e1i2kfmr0b~q_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000~ts_1632868237~ce_true~rt_afterevent~h_ad66b65148bec73c74619b4bf995e2b334a2ff4656222de0a44aa932936d2210&amp;amp;cv=1051601735&amp;amp;cid=en-US"&gt;disc-based PS5&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://direct-queue.playstation.com/?c=sonyied&amp;amp;e=aat3wy9opm&amp;amp;t=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%3Fqueueittoken%3De_e1i2kfmr0b~q_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000~ts_1632868247~ce_true~rt_afterevent~h_587606887c82228abc91e48cf2864541531c1c1ec4b17c9871fb1c15535d6a85&amp;amp;cv=1051601735&amp;amp;cid=en-US"&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt; via its direct store. You don’t have to refresh the landing page once you’ve arrived — just wait it out — but we do recommend that you keep your PlayStation Network account info at the ready, just in case you’re allocated a spot to buy one when the countdown finishes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix scoops up Oxenfree developer Night School</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oxenfree" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CyK6kc7RcE31HHwg8XSrXQt0YVE=/106x0:1186x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922839/Sreens_CYMK_House.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oxenfree.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WX5kXR"&gt;Netflix is continuing its push into video games with the acquisition of Night School Studio, the team best-known for 2016’s &lt;em&gt;Oxenfree &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20932270/afterparty-review-xbox-ps4-pc"&gt;2019’s &lt;em&gt;Afterparty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Oxenfree&lt;/em&gt;, it should be noted, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/27/12297852/oxenfree-game-stranger-things-pc-ps4-xbox-one"&gt;had strong &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; vibes&lt;/a&gt; — and Night School also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18510849/stranger-things-secret-games-telltale-studio-closed"&gt;previously worked on a canceled &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; title&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HiRsCW"&gt;“Night School wants to stretch our narrative and design aspirations across distinctive, original games with heart,” &lt;a href="https://nightschoolstudio.com/joining-netflix/"&gt;Night School’s Sean Krankel said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Netflix gives film, TV, and now game makers an unprecedented canvas to create and deliver excellent entertainment to millions of people. Our explorations in narrative gameplay and Netflix’s track record of supporting diverse storytellers was such a natural pairing. It felt like both teams came to this conclusion instinctively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YC64xK"&gt;The studio says it will continue to work on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382536/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-fez-oxenfree-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oxenfree II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as well as “cooking up new game worlds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nq5PUb"&gt;The acquisition is just the latest part of Netflix’s ongoing push into games. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577868/netflix-video-games-confirmed-mike-verdu-ea-oculus-facebook"&gt;the company hired Mike Verdu&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of EA and Oculus, to head up its gaming efforts, and it’s currently testing having games in its mobile app — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22689922/netflix-games-italy-spain-android-beta-mobile"&gt;just today, that test expanded to include Spain and Italy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SifBpe"&gt;“We’ll continue working with developers around the world and hiring the best talent in the industry to deliver a great collection of exclusive games designed for every kind of gamer and any level of play,” Verdu said as part of today’s announcement. “Like our shows and films, these games will all be included as part of your Netflix membership — all with no ads and no in-app purchases. Stay tuned for more.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk, live at the Code Conference</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9PXv2JIbYypjTkMELOSVwwSUqNM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922752/acastro_191211_elon_decade_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Thus Sprach Technoking&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="BuwXrr"&gt;We’re at the &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/code2021"&gt;2021 Code Conference&lt;/a&gt; here in Beverly Hills, California — and very soon, Elon Musk will take the stage in an interview with Kara Swisher. As always with Musk, there will be more than enough to talk about. There’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688377/tesla-steering-wheel-yoke-model-s-x-redesign"&gt;latest from Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;self-driving&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;where Cybertruck development is&lt;/a&gt;. Just today, we learned that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698388/tesla-texas-lawsuit-cops-autopilot-crash-injury"&gt;Tesla is being sued by Texas cops&lt;/a&gt; after a Model X on autopilot slammed into five officers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0F5ly"&gt;Then we’ve got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675793/spacex-inspiration4-launch-first-all-civilian-private-crew"&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680152/spacex-inspiration4-first-private-crew-update-in-orbit"&gt;space tourism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/18/22681185/spacex-ceo-elon-musk-starlink-internet-service-leaving-beta-october"&gt;satellite internet&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, we could talk about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22427006/dogecoin-crashing-elon-musk-snl-host"&gt;Dogecoin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/25/21338456/tesla-elon-musk-twitter-memes-spacex"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and whether Musk is thinking much about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463920/elon-musk-stock-price-tweets-sec"&gt;the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; these days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBrIP1"&gt;Oh, and of course, we could revisit the topic of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837874/elon-musk-says-odds-living-in-simulation"&gt;whether we are still living in a simulation&lt;/a&gt; or if we can escape. (Hey, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22640826/matrix-4-trailer-resurrections-release-date"&gt;fourth &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; movie is coming&lt;/a&gt;, so why not?) So yeah, there’s a lot that could happen. We’ll be live-blogging his interview with Swisher right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IjKutR"&gt;&lt;div class="live-center-embed" data-src="https://livecenter.norkon.net/frame/voxmedia/17058/vox"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;(function(n){function c(t,i){n[e](h,function(n){var r,u;if(n&amp;&amp;(r=n[n.message?"message":"data"]+"",r&amp;&amp;r.substr&amp;&amp;r.substr(0,3)==="nc:")&amp;&amp;(u=r.split(":"),u[1]===i))switch(u[2]){case"h":t.style.height=u[3]+"px";return;case"scrolltotop":t.scrollIntoView();return}},!1)}for(var t,u,f,i,s,e=n.addEventListener?"addEventListener":"attachEvent",h=e==="attachEvent"?"onmessage":"message",o=n.document.querySelectorAll(".live-center-embed"),r=0;r&lt;o.length;r++)(t=o[r],t.getAttribute("data-rendered"))||(u=t.getAttribute("data-src"),u&amp;&amp;(t.setAttribute("data-rendered","true"),f=n.ncVizCounter||1e3,n.ncVizCounter=f+1,i=f+"",s="nc-frame-c-"+i,t.innerHTML='&lt;div style="position: relative; height: 300px; border: none;" id="'+s+'"&gt;&lt;iframe src="'+u+"?"+i+'" style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;',c(t.firstChild,i)))})(window);&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple says the iPad Mini’s jelly scrolling isn’t a problem that needs to be fixed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1WEGUNYfPxzjse8L3u8t9hvwNPw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922596/vpavic_210924_4766_0047.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NhqQno"&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/2021-ipad-mini-suffers-from-uneven-jelly-scrolling-in-portrait-mode/"&gt;Apple tells &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it thinks the “jelly scroll” effect some users have noticed on the new iPad Mini is normal LCD behavior that the company won’t have to fix. The effect, also known as skewing, can make it seem like one half of the display is slightly behind the other while you're scrolling, and it’s most apparent while using the iPad Mini in portrait mode. &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; executive editor Dieter Bohn noted the issue in a tweet and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;in his review&lt;/a&gt; of the device published this morning. Despite our requests before and after publishing the review, the company did not respond or comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cFw9a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars&lt;/em&gt; explains that the issue happens because the iPad starts drawing the lines on one side of the screen, and it takes time to go from one side to the other. A tiny amount of time, yes, but it can be noticeable depending on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3bKrD"&gt;You can see what it looks like below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="91zdci"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here is is slow-mo video of scrolling on the iPad Min i slowed down EVEN MORE in a frame-by-frame step through. Notice how the right moves up faster than the left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In normal usage you barely see it, but every now and then it become noticeable. In landscape it goes away entirely &lt;a href="https://t.co/iq9LGJzsDI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iq9LGJzsDI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1440678843589689346?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lmPztH"&gt;If you want to see how LCD screens refresh in shocking detail, The Slow Mo Guys on YouTube &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3BJU2drrtCM?t=250"&gt;have done a video&lt;/a&gt; showing how it works with TVs and iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CW2ggO"&gt;Apple is correct in stating this effect is common in LCD displays. It’s very possible that the screen you’re reading this on right now would display the same effect if you &lt;a href="https://www.testufo.com/scanskew"&gt;loaded up a webpage that tests for it&lt;/a&gt; — my laptop shows it quite strongly. The reason it sticks out on the iPad Mini, though, is that it’s frequently used in alignments where the problem is most apparent — it’s not likely to be an issue on a landscape display where you’re scrolling vertically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCjgTe"&gt;This effect also happens with many video cameras, for largely the same reasons: if you pan fast enough, straight items like poles and trees will slant to one side, as the data is read from the top of the camera’s sensor to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lRD3l"&gt;While the effect is common (and subtle on the iPad Mini, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;we don’t think it’s a deal-breaker&lt;/a&gt; given how good the screen is otherwise and the inclusion of USB-C), it seems noticeably worse on this particular model than other recent iPads. It also feels unusual that Apple isn’t concerned about it while managing to avoid jelly scrolling on both higher-end iPad models and even my previous-generation iPad Mini (which retailed for significantly less than the new model). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="v2My9M"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IxCvHn"&gt;Related:&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s upcoming global music series will have an interactive experience for each artist</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FzSoLc2LxCzV5y-bwG0ahTzZ_jA=/0x0:1106x737/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922515/SoundwaveHamaki_notext.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mohamed Hamaki will be featured in &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4SbxOL"&gt;Epic Games has announced the next set of musical performances coming to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, called &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-presents-the-soundwave-series-musical-shows-kicking-off-with-mohamed-hamaki?sessionInvalidated=true"&gt;the Soundwave Series&lt;/a&gt;. The new series will feature artists from around the world, and players will be able to experience music from each artist in an interactive experience in-game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YjOCTq"&gt;Epic is well known for bringing musical performances to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;including spectacular shows for huge artists like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt; and concerts hosted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21423004/fortnite-party-royale-concert-series-dominic-fike"&gt;on the non-violent party royale island&lt;/a&gt;. But Epic is increasingly working with its community to create signature experiences for the game in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s Creative mode, such as with this summer’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550240/fortnite-easy-life-concert-o2-arena"&gt;Easy Life virtual concert&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22679754/fortnite-balenciaga-collaboration-epic-games-unreal-engine"&gt;Balenciaga-themed “Strange Times” hub&lt;/a&gt;. The first show in the Soundwave Series, featuring Egyptian artist Mohamed Hamaki, will continue that trend, as will the future shows in the Soundwave Series, Epic tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vVPFGm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hamaki’s show kicks off on October 1st&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s1Toti"&gt;Hamaki’s show kicks off on October 1st at 2PM ET and will be available until October 3rd at 2PM ET. Interestingly, there will be multiple ways to see the event: you can attend by jumping into a dedicated playlist or watch it during a typical battle royale match via a picture-in-picture mode, which has been used in the past &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20706969/fortnite-world-cup-picture-in-picture-pip-live-event-viewing-in-game"&gt;to show competitive &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;in game&lt;/a&gt;. (This picture-in-picture feature will only be available for certain times during the 48-hour Hamaki event.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6IXt8"&gt;The new series seemingly marks Epic’s next initiative to make &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; something more than just a game. The concerts not only offer something else for players to do, but the picture-in-picture feature could keep players locked into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s universe for music instead of turning to something like Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0xyyi"&gt;In the coming months, the Soundwave Series will also feature Australian singer-songwriter Tones And I, Brazilian rapper Emicida, Japanese pop artist and music producer Gen Hoshino, and French-Malian singer Aya Nakamura, Epic says.&lt;/p&gt;
