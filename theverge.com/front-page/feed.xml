    <title>Qualcomm is updating its Snapdragon branding to try and simplify its chip names</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tRRIycVMvXNE5EBFFqLOL92m2h0=/44x0:644x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70178166/eye_688.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Qualcomm’s teaser for its new branding scheme | Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dwFiJC"&gt;Qualcomm has &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2021/11/22/welcome-new-era-snapdragon"&gt;announced some key changes&lt;/a&gt; to how it brands its Snapdragon chips, including a shift away from the three-digit numbering system it’s been using to differentiate between its products for years. The news comes ahead of the company’s expected next-gen flagship chip debut at the Snapdragon Tech Summit on November 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pWRjX"&gt;To start, Snapdragon will now exist as a standalone brand, separate from the “Qualcomm” brand (which won’t be showing up as much on its chips). It’s a direction the company has started moving in earlier this year (the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550723/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-cpu-ai-performance-mwc-2021"&gt;Snapdragon 888 Plus badge&lt;/a&gt;, for example, notably lacked the word “Qualcomm”), but today’s news solidifies that plan going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-4_slc_dklqiNlCeBUSKf8UNpVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23034691/Screen_Shot_2021_11_22_at_11.46.46_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The already “Qualcomm”-less Snapdragon 888 Plus icon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HDVufZ"&gt;But the biggest change might be in how the company handles actually naming its semiconductor products. For years, Qualcomm has labeled its chips with three-digit names, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;Snapdragon 480&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/4/20995714/qualcomm-snapdragon-765-chip-affordable-5g-phones-processor-low-price"&gt;Snapdragon 765&lt;/a&gt;, or Snapdragon 888. The first number broadly informed customers how powerful the chip was (with the 8-series chips serving as flagships, while 4-series models were for entry-level products). The second number typically indicated annual generational releases (going from a Snapdragon 865 to an 875), while changes in the third number generally showed more minor updates (like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/4/20995714/qualcomm-snapdragon-765-chip-affordable-5g-phones-processor-low-price"&gt;Snapdragon 765G&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/11/21252114/qualcomm-snapdragon-768g-5g-processor-765g-improvements-cpu-gpu-update"&gt;Snapdragon 768G&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0SHGj2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Qualcomm was running out of numbers to use&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="idLfJk"&gt;The problem, though, is that in addition to being slightly jargony and confusing to keep track of, Qualcomm is also simply running out of numbers in its naming scheme. The 8-series lineup hit Snapdragon 888 last year, the 7-series is already at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350079/qualcomm-snapdragon-780g-888-5g-mobile-chipset-phone-android"&gt;Snapdragon 780&lt;/a&gt;, and the 6-series is already on the brink with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22740748/qualcomm-snapdragon-695-778-plus-480-680-5g-4g-smartphone-chips"&gt;Snapdragon 695&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LyucHw"&gt;Going forward, though, Qualcomm says that it’ll be shifting to “a single-digit series and generation number, aligning with other product categories,” starting with the upcoming announcement of its next 8-series flagship (which had previously been expected to be called the Snapdragon 898, based on Qualcomm’s old pattern). Qualcomm already uses a generational naming scheme for its Snapdragon PC processors, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020"&gt;Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451392/qualcomm-snapdragon-7c-gen-2-arm-processor"&gt;Snapdragon 7c Gen 2&lt;/a&gt;, too, so the change isn’t coming out of nowhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QPaqkX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lx6qXW9FP18?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YumLEV"&gt;Unfortunately, Qualcomm isn’t actually &lt;em&gt;saying&lt;/em&gt; what that new branding scheme will be, although that announcement is expected to come at the Snapdragon Tech Summit next week. Instead, the company has published a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx6qXW9FP18"&gt;vague hype reel&lt;/a&gt; that features the number eight a lot to tease out the new, top-secret naming scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nP3NLL"&gt;In addition to the as-yet-unrevealed naming scheme, Qualcomm also announced a few other details about its Snapdragon branding plan. Going forward, the company plans to emphasize the use of gold to indicate top-tier flagship products. It’s going to stop explicitly calling out 5G on chips, noting that “5G has become ubiquitous” across its product lineup and will be “a given.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart’s hosting a PS5 and Xbox Series X restock for subscribers at 4PM ET</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mKdeJ0t8u60hUjSNqb0Apa86cyo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177981/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dEMy8h"&gt;Walmart is kicking off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; with a bang today, offering its Walmart Plus subscribers early access to a big console restock that begins at 4PM ET / 1PM PT. At that time, paid members will have a go at snagging a PlayStation 5 (both the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420%3Fathbdg%3DL2000&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeRestock11222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 disc-based version&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383%3Fathbdg%3DL2000&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeRestock11222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99 digital version&lt;/a&gt;) or the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X-Video-Game-Console-Black%2F443574645%3Fathbdg%3DL2000&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeRestock11222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 Xbox Series X console&lt;/a&gt;. To get this early access to boost your chances of getting a console (though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"&gt;it’s no guarantee&lt;/a&gt;), you’ll &lt;strong&gt;need &lt;/strong&gt;to be a paying member to Walmart Plus, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeRestock11222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $12.99 per month&lt;/a&gt;. To reiterate, members sampling the free trial will &lt;strong&gt;not &lt;/strong&gt;get early access to this restock or Walmart’s myriad Black Friday deals that launch an hour earlier at 3PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsbI8F"&gt;Here are the links, with more details about this restock beneath them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RmbPiW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="iySGYk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="wSPUIp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0HaYm3"&gt;Hey, if you miss out on a chance to get the Series X, it might save your case during the holidays that the smaller, less-powerful Series S is more readily available and costs less at $299.99. It lacks a disc drive and has half the storage of the Series X (512GB), but it has many of the same features as the high-end console. It targets 1440p resolution for some content, and it can boost certain games up to 120 frames per second, but it could be a great fit for someone who still uses a 1080p TV or monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KCGmrH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D0S9oG"&gt;If you say nay to Walmart Plus, the restock will open up to everyone else three hours later at 7PM ET / 4PM PT, though it’s tough to determine how much stock Walmart will have left. Personally, I can’t see the retailer leaving non-subscribers totally high and dry. And with the restock being printed in its Black Friday ad, I expect Walmart to have a surplus of inventory. That said, what’s available will still sell out very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rnSVO"&gt;As for what to expect when the time comes, a Walmart spokesperson shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it will “roll out consoles and other hot items in separate windows to help unlock a smooth online shopping experience.” Hopefully, that means the site will be stable during the restock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="matiwg"&gt;In case you don’t know the drill at this point, make sure you’re logged in to your Walmart Plus account, with the correct payment method and shipping address entered in ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2Wbaw3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="f58M3f"&gt;Add these to your cart before the restock&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zbYawB"&gt;What’s a console without extra games, controllers, or accessories? One that isn’t nearly as fun to use as it should be. Load these items into your Walmart cart ahead of time, so you can get it all at once when the consoles drop. Though, in some cases, you can find better deals at other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s6X9RR"&gt;For PS5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="QgIEC5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="HoSimS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10759091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ncUxi6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10876171"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3WHzie"&gt;For Xbox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="3jLbi8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420028"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="VAjUg5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10654449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="RHIYJR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833343"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="iWxc5T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="yyYBjD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ZdCsLC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Britain launches review of bias in medical devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sajid Javid Appointed As Health Secretary After Hancock Resignation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CWqXD68S4tddRH1VIAmUlkgaKSQ=/0x1:5000x3334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177857/1325883638.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Health secretary Sajid Javid | Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NLxELX"&gt;Britain’s health secretary announced Sunday that he’s launched a review of racial and gender biases in medical devices, triggered by reports that blood oxygen monitoring devices work less well on people with darker skin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DY5NDO"&gt;Secretary Sajid Javid told the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1462393472665673733?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; that he thinks it’s possible that some people died during the COVID-19 pandemic because of those discrepancies and that they may have contributed to the overall higher death rates in Black and South Asian people in the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CZO4M"&gt;“The possibility that a bias — even an inadvertent one — could lead to a poorer health outcome is totally unacceptable,” Javid wrote &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/7Gzyq#selection-895.243-895.361"&gt;in the &lt;em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNYtLl"&gt;Research published in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine &lt;/em&gt;in &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2029240"&gt;late 2020&lt;/a&gt; found that pulse oximeters, which usually calculate the amount of oxygen in the bloodstream by sending light through the fingertip, are more likely to miss low levels of oxygen in Black patients than white patients. The finding also caught the attention of United States lawmakers, who &lt;a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/senators-warren-booker-and-wyden-urge-fda-to-address-concerns-about-dangerous-pulse-oximeter-inaccuracies-for-patients-of-color"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; the Food and Drug Administration to review the devices. The agency put out a warning about its limitations &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/19/fda-issues-alert-on-limitations-of-pulse-oximeters-without-explicit-mention-of-racial-bi/"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKJrgQ"&gt;The review will look at bias in all medical devices, not just pulse oximeters, and will evaluate them for gender bias, as well as racial bias. Javid didn’t specifically call out medical algorithms, but those could potentially be included as they’re often regulated as medical devices in the US and UK. Over the past few years, expert analysis of algorithms showed that they’re often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22770852/data-dermatology-algorithms-skin-tone-ethnicity"&gt;built&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455946/medical-algorithm-ai-geography-research-accuracy"&gt;in ways&lt;/a&gt; that reproduce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20995178/racial-bias-health-care-algorithms-cory-booker-senator-wyden"&gt;racial bias.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jhn12V"&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.ph/7Gzyq#selection-809.89-809.111"&gt;Javid said&lt;/a&gt; he’d been discussing the issue with US Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra and hopes to work with the US and other nations on international standards for medical devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTS7Ud"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK-based EV retrofitter company looks to grow in the US market</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Black Ford GT40 in profile-rear view on a concrete track" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nZGhO-jiQ7xb8XQgUVxrwk7uXUs=/0x0:6283x4189/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177853/02_Everrati.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Everrati’s Ford GT40 build in collaboration with US partner Superformance | Image: Everrati&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0INxmz"&gt;Justin Lunny, CEO of the UK-based electric vehicle conversion company Everrati, sees his work as more than just taking on iconic vehicles, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/16/11006458/zelectric-vw-beetle-electric-1959-volkswagen-microbus-video"&gt;VW Microbus&lt;/a&gt;, and giving them an electric powertrain. “Our ethos is about redefining the cars,” Lunny said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We redefine them as an EV.” After two years in operation, Lunny is finally bringing that ethos to the US in the hopes of tapping into a growing EV conversion market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4Mw0X"&gt;No structure is damaged during the process of converting the cars: “To the untrained eye, they look like a beautiful, original Porsche or GT40 or Land Rover... true to the essence of the original, but without any emissions anymore,” Lunny shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6QGGw"&gt;All conversions are also reversible to retain value. For example, a converted 1991 Porsche can be unbolted and retuned back to its original state. Still, Lunny doesn’t anticipate any customers ever reversing their vehicles back to running gas, but the fact that they can do it was important. “No one will ever do it, but it’s a good thing to show,” Lunny said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Red Porsche and black Ford GT40 sports car arranged behind two men posing cross-armed in jeans and button ups looking at the camera" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8hJFGMEUqfAXJkXIogxnMDm39g0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23027635/01_Everrati.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBX6lq"&gt;Lunny has a background in building financial-technology companies, selling one of them in 2017. “My passions, however, are cars alongside tech,” he said. To that end, Everrati is mostly a self-funded operation, but it does include some investors. According to Lunny, Everrati is seeing 45 percent of customer interest coming from the US, a place where the company was not initially promoting itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVaJr0"&gt;The first US orders are coming from high-income areas in California and Florida, in addition to New York and Long Island. All of Everrati’s customers are wealthy tech and auto enthusiasts, with the first customer in the US being a “tech billionaire,” according to Lunny, who won’t share the customer’s identity. He describes Everrati’s main customers more eloquently: “High net-worth, sort of thought leaders, really; they believe in sustainability, but they got style,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u7401F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Whilst I am not going to be the next Elon Musk, I have an idea&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e60T1G"&gt;“If you look at the Prius generation and the early Tesla generation... I generally see it [like] this kind of feel for what we are doing now,” Lunny explained. Tesla started off with selling the original Roadster to wealthy individuals first and then used that to make more affordable cars. Lunny sees a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/20/12242162/tesla-elon-musk-master-plan-solarcity-autonomous"&gt;similar path&lt;/a&gt; for Everrati as it looks to its next round of funding the US: “Whilst I am not going to be the next Elon Musk, I have an idea that... these beautiful cars should be allowed to continue being driven.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEc8zd"&gt;Everrati is a small firm but growing. The company currently stands at 19 employees, two of which were hired in recent weeks. To achieve “OEM high-quality standards” of engineering, Everrati hired several engineers from top manufacturers, including Lotus, McClaren, and a business partner from Mercedes-Benz. It also recently poached Amit Chandarana, vice president and head of commercial for Gettacar, an online used car retailer, to serve as a senior advisor for the US-based operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOM8K5"&gt;Everrati chooses specific cars and starts with the conversion work. When all the engineering and tooling are complete, the newly electric cars become available to order in the online configurator as a “customizable project.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Green boxy Land Rover vehicle with a cloth top on a battered concrete slab surrounded by trees" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sU-b7vrwG72ixjDztZwX0choRjY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23027607/04_Everrati.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Everrati electric converted classic Land Rover.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PKI5Qm"&gt;If a customer wanted a Porsche 964, they can either bring their own, or Everrati will go find one and then convert it using the process it already built. But it can take time to complete a single project. For example, the process of converting a Land Rover, from development to final product, took 18 months. Everything works as expected, including the speedometer and shifters, which all behave exactly as they would if it were still a gas car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ehf96w"&gt;“If 15 people want a Land Rover, for example, we know that we can build them to the same standard each time, as opposed to 20 different cars coming at different points,” Lunny said. “We kind of production-ize the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7l643g"&gt;Lunny defended the deliberative approach taken by Everrati as what makes the company distinct from the competition. “Dare I say, we are unique in that,” he said. “A lot of other companies will take your car in one day; three months later, you have it back. There’s no — dare I say — testing, security standards... a very different market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5fI6q"&gt;Electric vehicle conversions of old gas cars seems to be a small but fast-growing market. Companies like &lt;a href="https://www.zelectricmotors.com"&gt;Zelectric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://evwest.com/catalog/"&gt;EV West&lt;/a&gt; are already established in the US and have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20747528/electric-porsche-912-vintage-restoration-tesla-car-vehicle-ev"&gt;converting vehicles for years&lt;/a&gt;. Zelectric, in particular, originally started by stuffing Tesla donor parts into classic cars. Even big manufacturers like Ford are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759825/ford-electric-crate-motors-mustang-mach-e-gt-performance"&gt;getting into the game&lt;/a&gt; by reselling Mustang Mach-E motors as drop-in crate motors. Lunny mentions that Ford’s motors are probably good for large American muscle-sized vehicles but does not see Everrati ever using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7AFK22"&gt;Lunny said the cars that they work on are very iconic and beautiful but acknowledges that they are bad for the environment. “These cars emit their own body weight in CO2 every couple thousand miles,” he said. “As we are moving to clean energy and clean air... lot of people won’t be comfortable with it, I think.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNin4m"&gt;The starting price of an Everrati converted vehicle is around $200,000, but most cars go for about $500,000. It’s going to go even higher because some customers are bringing in their own classic cars, some of which retail for over $1 million. The long-term goal is to be a real business; Lunny wants Everrati to become an iconic EV brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RT217l"&gt;“We start with the high end. The key thing is going to be about quality — it’s about luxury, it’s about beautifully finished almost Concord-standard cars,” he said, “and that’s the first period of time, and of course, then as when we grow that market share we can look to do, possibly, a wider addressable market as the technology and the cost allows us to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Red classic Porsche 911 964 driving on street" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wl02Jtvv4sI-mXuqECBn6x7ldG0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028128/03_Everrati.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everrati’s electric Porsche 911 (964) Coupe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="t3Dn2b"&gt;The highest expense for the company is the batteries. Lunny shared that they have a partner company that builds packs based on Everrati’s design and specifications, with cells coming mostly from Chinese battery company Envision and some from LG. Everrati’s building 700-volt, 60kWh battery packs with liquid cooling, which can DC fast charge at up to 80kW via CCS Combo. Charging can take 45 minutes to go from 20 percent to 85 percent, Lunny said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Hk116"&gt;The GT40 is Everrati’s “home-grown EV supercar” with partner Superformance and the key next step into the US market. “Our next funding round is to solidify our leadership in the UK, we’ve got some real interest in the UK... and have a production base in California” and will be available to order early next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ss0yMc"&gt;But there are cars that even Everrati won’t touch. Like a Porsche 959 with only 700 miles on the speedometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QvqKW"&gt;“We politely declined,” Lunny said of the customer who requested the conversion, “because we don’t believe that’s the right thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is now available on Samsung and LG TVs, Android TV devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2cdnggPXPkBFmJt0ExIG844V3XU=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177663/tikTV.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Si8UIw"&gt;TikTok is expanding its presence on TV screens in a major way. After initially launching in North America &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757449/tiktok-fire-tv-app-available-us"&gt;on Amazon’s Fire TV platform&lt;/a&gt;, the TikTok TV app is today available on Samsung and LG smart TVs — plus Android TV devices, including the Chromecast with Google TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CA3ItA"&gt;Whereas the massively popular mobile app is intended for “little bursts of joy,” &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-tv?utm_source=COMMSTWITTER&amp;amp;utm_medium=SOCIAL&amp;amp;utm_campaign=221121"&gt;TikTok says&lt;/a&gt; its big-screen software is optimized for “a TV home-viewing experience, making it easy to watch content from our For You and Following feeds on the big screen. This includes the most liked and viewed videos across a huge range of categories, from gaming and comedy to food and animals.” There’s a Discover section in the TV app, as well. TikTok videos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558856/tiktok-videos-three-minutes-length"&gt;can be up to three minutes&lt;/a&gt; in length. &lt;/p&gt;

The app surpassed &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/1-billion-people-on-tiktok"&gt;1 billion active monthly users&lt;/a&gt; in September, and on Android, it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660516/tiktok-average-watch-time-youtube-us-android-app-annie"&gt;reportedly overtaken YouTube&lt;/a&gt; for average watch time in the US. Now you can immerse yourself in the ByteDance-owned company’s much-celebrated algorithm on the largest, nicest screen in your home.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber Eats will let you order weed in Ontario but won’t deliver</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Uber Company" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5l6L9Bcp-4yVcRBZQ2QXBTYHLuU=/0x0:2362x1575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177648/1232204951.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;You can now order cannabis via the Uber Eats app, but only in Ontario and there’s no delivery option.  | Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fGxAcj"&gt;Uber is &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cannabis-retailer-tokyo-smoke-and-uber-eats-form-innovative-partnership-to-offer-cannabis-online-order-and-pickup-in-canada-301429818.html"&gt;partnering&lt;/a&gt; with a cannabis retailer in Canada to allow cannabis purchases via its Uber Eats food delivery platform. The arrangement does not include delivery of weed orders, however, but makes it possible for users in Ontario to order products from Tokyo Smoke in a dedicated section on the Uber Eats app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLFrBt"&gt;For customers in Ontario, in the Uber Eats app, select either the “cannabis” category or search for “Tokyo Smoke.” After confirming their age, the customer is directed to the menu of a Tokyo Smoke store in the area to place their order, which Uber says will be filled within an hour. The consumer then picks up their order at the Tokyo Smoke store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z09ymZ"&gt;Uber CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380003/uber-weed-deliveries-cannabis-ceo"&gt;Dara Khosrowshahi said in April&lt;/a&gt; that the company would take a look at cannabis delivery “when the road is clear.” In February, the ride-hailing giant acquired Boston-based alcohol delivery service Drizly for $1.1 billion. But Lantern, a cannabis delivery service Drizly launched in May 2020, was not part of that deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnMUdb"&gt;The companies did not mention plans to expand into other Canadian provinces, but Uber Eats head of communications for delivery Meghan Casserly&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;confirmed that the new arrangement with Tokyo Smoke is “pickup only.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFWkgi"&gt;Canada &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cannabis-changed-canada-1.6219493"&gt;legalized recreational cannabis in October 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and 2021 cannabis sales there are &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cannabis-sales-projected-to-reach-28-billion-for-us-in-2022-headset-launches-market-forecasts-for-us-and-canada-301268415.html"&gt;predicted to reach $4 billion&lt;/a&gt;. In the US, recreational cannabis is legal in 18 states, and medical marijuana use is legal in some three dozen states. However, marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, despite repeated attempts to decriminalize it. In July, Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Ron Wyden (D-OR) released a discussion draft of legislation that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576119/democrats-new-plan-legalize-marijuana-schumer-wyden-booker-senate"&gt;proposed sweeping reform to marijuana policy&lt;/a&gt; in the US. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Analogue Pocket preorders will ship December 13th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Analogue Pocket" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KbkcLpQWhyuwvO8XLomva2GPiRk=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177595/9_Pocket_3_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fqHPdx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/16/20906665/analogue-pocket-game-boy-handheld-release-date-price"&gt;Analogue Pocket&lt;/a&gt; preorders will start shipping on December 13th. &lt;a href="https://support.analogue.co/hc/en-us/articles/4414333048333"&gt;In a brief blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Analogue, manufacturers of the retro handheld Pocket, wrote, “Due to unprecedented shipping congestion, your order will ship and be delivered between December 14th - December 30th.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sz6hC7"&gt;If you’re unable to accept delivery during that window, the company also outlined steps you can take to defer shipping until after January 3rd, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T38K7i"&gt;Customers who preordered the Pocket will receive an email with more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SR8kpv"&gt;The Analogue Pocket, which has the ability to play cartridges from the Game Boy family and the Sega Game Gear, was delayed numerous times due to global electronics component shortages brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Other handhelds like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"&gt;Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776649/panic-playdate-delay-2022-handheld-battery-chip-shortage"&gt;Playdate&lt;/a&gt; faced similar delays, with neither having a firm release date in sight. The handheld was originally slated for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21337403/analogue-pocket-release-date-delay-pre-order"&gt;a 2020 release&lt;/a&gt; before being pushed to May 2021, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22361017/analogue-pocket-handheld-delayed-electronic-component-shortage"&gt;October 2021&lt;/a&gt;. In September, the company stated the Pocket would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667465/analogue-pocket-preorders-delay-december-2021"&gt;finally start shipping in December&lt;/a&gt;, but no firm date was announced. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku lines up more than 50 new shows for its free channel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Roku Products Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2oNQjxHDj4ZBkcFMgP8gTCsTci0=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177519/1232708607.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y42fxx"&gt;Roku serves as a gateway to access various streaming services, but now, a report from &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/roku-plans-to-develop-more-than-50-original-shows-in-next-two-years-11637326800"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reveals that the service wants to develop over 50 original series in the next two years, expanding the original content that it already has on its free Roku Channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxZXPw"&gt;As noted by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, 155 million people have access to Roku devices, and about half tune into the Roku Channel, a hub for ad-supported TV shows, movies, and live news. The service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395533/roku-originals-quibi-content-tv"&gt;added Roku Originals&lt;/a&gt; to the Roku Channel earlier this year, a large portion of which actually come from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527197/quibi-streaming-service-mobile-shutting-down-end-katzenberg"&gt;Quibi, the short-lived streaming service&lt;/a&gt; that shut down last year. Apparently, the set of 50 new shows also include some that the service acquired from Quibi that never premiered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VYJKun"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Roku could spend $500,000 to $5 million for scripted episodes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LmVmPd"&gt;Roku’s push to produce its own original content likely has something to do with boosting ad sales on the Roku Channel, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22308141/roku-nielsen-video-advertising-business-acquisition-linear-streaming-tv"&gt;ads are one of Roku’s main sources of revenue&lt;/a&gt;. According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, Roku sells 100 percent of its ads on the Roku Channel, as opposed to selling just 30 percent within other apps. Aside from ads, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22773073/vizio-acr-advertising-inscape-data-privacy-q3-2021"&gt;Roku rakes in an average of $40.10 / month per user&lt;/a&gt; and recorded 56.4 million active accounts in its most recent earnings report (&lt;a href="https://image.roku.com/c3VwcG9ydC1B/3Q21-Shareholder-Letter-Final.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). The service also makes money through the sale of its Roku TVs and streaming devices, earning a total of $97.4 million last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctryCo"&gt;Roku remains tightlipped on its planned budget for its new shows, vaguely telling the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; that it will be close to what typical cable shows spend. However, sources close to the matter informed the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; that the amount could be anywhere from $250,000 to $750,000 for one unscripted episode or $500,000 to $5 million for scripted episodes. This is significantly lower when compared to original content from other platforms — for reference, &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1249573/most-expensive-netflix-original-series-production-cost-per-episode/"&gt;Netflix spends&lt;/a&gt; around $12 million per episode of &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; and $13 million per episode of &lt;em&gt;The Crown&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LLWYU"&gt;In February of this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285819/roku-original-content-job-listing-plan-original-shows-movies"&gt;Roku posted a job listing for a production attorney&lt;/a&gt; that helps out with Roku’s “original episodic and feature length productions,” suggesting that Roku has been planning a dive into the entertainment industry for a while. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664322/roku-originals-first-film-zoeys-extraordinary-christmas-release-date"&gt;Roku’s first original movie&lt;/a&gt; is set to debut on December 1st, titled &lt;em&gt;Zoey’s Extraordinary Christmas&lt;/em&gt; — a spinoff of the NBC show &lt;em&gt;Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist&lt;/em&gt;. As the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/roku-children-ruin-everything-streaming-schitts-creeks-1235090626/"&gt;Roku also acquired the rights to &lt;em&gt;Children Ruin Everything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a comedy series produced by &lt;em&gt;Schitt’s Creek&lt;/em&gt; producer Kurt Smeaton, and is planning to add it to the platform in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Great gifts to outfit the home office of a working professional&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8r44SV"&gt;Many of us have been working from home for more than a year and a half, and some of us will continue to do so — maybe forever. That said, buying a gift for a friend or loved one who works from home can be tricky. One person might prioritize tech, while another might care more about plant life and energizing lighting. If you need some help, however, you’ve come to the right place. Here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;we have some expertise in working from home, and we have some great ideas for you to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3edj4"&gt;What makes the ideal home office? Well, the right tech, like the Satechi USB-C Multi-Port Adapter ($80), is essential to getting work done. But comfort is also important, which is why we’ve included a standing desk and an ergonomic chair that can last for years. And if your gift recipient is still stuck working in their dining room or on their couch, a modest gift like a LapGear lap desk ($30) or Nulaxy laptop stand ($25) may be all they need to finally relieve some neck or hand strain. We’ve got ideas big and small, both for physical comfort and a sound state of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Clever gift ideas to satisfy the pickiest of dads&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SIITPe"&gt;It’s not an easy task to do holiday shopping for the people who you’re closest to, especially for the dad in your life. Not all dads are the same, mind you, but they can be tough to please in the gift department because they might already buy themselves everything they want, thus keeping a clean slate of a wishlist at all times. Or, maybe they’re tough because what they find enjoyment in is really niche, and you fear that you won’t get them something they’ll actually enjoy. No one wants that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aG7bGi"&gt;We at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; can certainly relate to those feelings, but we think we can assuage most of those concerns with the list of gift ideas below. Most of our staff chipped ideas into this gift guide, which encompasses a range of tastes, hobbies, and aesthetic preferences. No matter the kind of dad you’re buying for, there should be something in here that’ll remind them, at the very least, that you’re trying to make sure they stay cool.&lt;/p&gt;
