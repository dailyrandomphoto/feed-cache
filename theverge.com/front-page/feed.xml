    <title>Nvidia’s new beta driver unlocks RTX 3060 Ethereum cryptocurrency mining</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LhdJQL"&gt;Nvidia implemented a special system to reduce the hash rate of Ethereum mining on its new RTX 3060 graphics card last month. It was supposed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289154/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;limit mining performance by around 50 percent&lt;/a&gt;, but multiple reports now claim cryptominers have bypassed the protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6c9rT"&gt;Japanese site &lt;a href="https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/yajiuma/1312/085/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Watch &lt;/em&gt;first revealed&lt;/a&gt; that Nvidia’s protections can be bypassed without needing to modify a driver or BIOS. &lt;a href="https://www.computerbase.de/2021-03/mining-bremse-geforce-rtx-3060-umgehbar-eth-hashrate/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ComputerBase&lt;/em&gt; has since confirmed&lt;/a&gt; PC Watch’s report and revealed that Nvidia’s latest &lt;a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl/download"&gt;470.05 beta driver&lt;/a&gt; is automatically unlocking performance for most RTX 3060 owners. Andreas Schilling, an editor at Hardwareluxx, has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aschilling/status/1371455804419751939"&gt;backed up these findings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Lce21i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A variety of RTX 3060 cards seem to be working with this beta driver&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Qxu8T"&gt;The beta driver appears to unlock Ethereum mining performance across a variety of RTX 3060 cards, which was likely not what Nvidia had planned for its test drivers. The 470.05 driver is designed for developers to test the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) performance and new features like OpenCL 3.0 support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIY2kC"&gt;Nvidia originally restricted RTX 3060 mining performance in an attempt to steer cryptominers away from purchasing the cards. Nvidia is offering a new Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) for Ethereum miners instead. The beta driver bypass of Ethereum mining performance will certainly make the cards more attractive to cryptominers now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GypUvN"&gt;Nvidia seemed confident in its software restrictions to nerf RTX 3060 mining performance. “It’s not just a driver thing,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bdelrizzo/status/1362619264423747590"&gt;said Bryan Del Rizzo&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia’s head of communications, last month. “There is a secure handshake between the driver, the RTX 3060 silicon, and the BIOS (firmware) that prevents removal of the hash rate limiter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qp60x"&gt;We’ve reached out to Nvidia to comment on this new beta driver, and we’ll update you accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon expands gamification program that encourages warehouse employees to work harder</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/30jhdeL4gdh1lEtMatbAxZZeE5s=/0x0:5789x3859/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68967565/1177531269.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Philippe Lopez/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vl5TGk"&gt;Amazon is expanding an existing program that gamifies warehouse work to encourage its fulfillment center employees to improve their efficiency and compete against others for digital rewards like virtual pets, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-expands-effort-to-gamify-warehouse-work"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The program is called FC Games, and it includes as many as six arcade-style mini-games that can be played only by completing warehouse tasks in the workplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Smbu2R"&gt;It’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/22/18635272/amazon-warehouse-working-conditions-gamification-video-games"&gt;known since at least 2019&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon uses gamification in the form of workstation games to try to incentivize employees to improve productivity, but &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reports that Amazon is now expanding those methods to warehouses in at least 20 states throughout the country. Many of the games tend to be simple virtual representations of how fast the worker is completing a task. One, called MissionRacer, moves a car around a track while a picking employee sorts products into appropriate boxes, as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/21/missionracer-how-amazon-turned-tedium-warehouse-work-into-game/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neFAoq"&gt;“Employees have told us they enjoy having the option to join in these workstation games, and we’re excited to be taking their feedback and expanding the program to even more buildings throughout our network,” Kent Hollenbeck, an Amazon spokesperson, tells &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. “Even with this expansion, the program remains completely optional for employees; they can switch in or out of different games depending on their preference, can play anonymously, or not play at all—the choice is theirs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uA1zhk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon uses mini-games at its warehouse workstations to improve productivity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xdVjFo"&gt;Some employees quoted in the report say the games are popular because they can help cut down on the tediousness and repetition of a nearly half-day warehouse shift. Others fear it’s one step toward an even more sinister and dystopian metrics system designed to track employees and encourage them to work as hard and fast as possible. (The image of humans measured through gamification metrics conjures the infamous season 1 episode, “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqTyZoupc1w"&gt;Fifteen Million Merits&lt;/a&gt;,” of the British science fiction show &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUjdun"&gt;The rewards earned by playing the workstation games can be turned in for virtual pets, including penguins and dinosaurs, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information, &lt;/em&gt;although it’s not clear these pets have any value or whether they can be changed for anything. Another of Amazon’s mini-games is called Tamazilla, a play on the popular Bandai digital pet product Tamagotchi, while others are more competitive and pit employees’ scores against workers at other warehouses around the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dCRI2q"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;reported in 2019, some employees have used FC Games performance to ask for more so-called swag bucks, a proprietary Amazon currency that can be exchanged for company merchandise like T-shirts and water bottles. &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;report also says that during busy holiday rushes, warehouse employees can win pricey consumer electronics, like game consoles or an Apple Watch, by performing well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJ7x3d"&gt;But the games themselves are not designed to reward employees with tangible, real-world benefits, the report says, and are instead ways for Amazon to help measure and encourage productivity as warehouse work becomes increasingly more tedious. The company is in the years-long process of automating many elements of warehouse work using robotics. The ultimate goal is ostensibly to eliminate the most repetitive and dangerous jobs. Yet, the result of this hybrid workplace in the interim is that humans are being forced into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155254/automation-robots-unemployment-jobs-vs-human-google-amazon"&gt;more specialized, often rote roles that involve less movement and more repetition&lt;/a&gt; with an increasing focus on metrics that gauge work performance like one measures the effectiveness of a robot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mx2AV2"&gt;In many cases, robots fetch items and bring them to humans to sort, and Amazon has not shied away from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18526092/amazon-warehouse-robotics-automation-ai-10-years-away"&gt;ambitions to automate large swaths of its warehouse work&lt;/a&gt; in the future. Yet, Amazon warehouses with automation have been shown to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493752/amazon-warehouses-robots-higher-injury-rates-report-reveal"&gt;actually have higher injury rates than those that rely entirely on humans&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless Headset is a mic-drop moment</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The best budget-friendly headset for Xbox cuts very few corners&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="18Tu1w"&gt;Microsoft’s new $99 Xbox Wireless headset isn’t perfect, but it’s the best attempt at being an Xbox gaming headset and an everyday set of wireless headphones I’ve tried yet. It’s compatible with the Xbox Wireless protocol, making it easy to pair with any Xbox One or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"&gt;S&lt;/a&gt; console. It’s also compatible with Bluetooth (version 4.2, SBC codec), and better yet, it can connect through both protocols simultaneously. So you can take a call or have audio from any app come through from a phone, tablet, or a PC mixed in with the sound coming from your Xbox console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pym0p3"&gt;This is far from the first gaming headset to do this, or even do it well. Microsoft’s latest headset just stands out as being particularly impressive for the number of things it gets right for $99. Its design is stellar, a logical fit in the company’s headphone lineup. Next to the Series X, it looks the part with a touch of glossy green detailing around the ear cup dials, covered in matte black plastic. The little holes in the recessed areas between the faux leather ear pads and the dials seem to be there just for cosmetic reasons, but it looks fantastic nevertheless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="roexZK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10387161"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DS9nuI"&gt;Crucially, these are comfortable, even though my head size nearly pushes them to their size limits. The sidearms require two hands to make adjustments, which I like. There’s no worry that they’ll resize just from being moved around. And while I wish this model had a bungee-style headband and swiveling ear cups like most SteelSeries headsets, not having these features didn’t equate to comfort issues here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S24wqX"&gt;In addition to how the headset looks, its functionality is similar to the Surface Headphones, with twistable dials on the outside of each ear cup for adjusting elements of the audio. Unlike the company’s more premium headphones, there’s no active noise cancellation here (I’d complain, but they’re $99), though the passive noise isolation is better than average for this price. The left dial acts as a chat and game audio mixer, so you can tune your playmates down a bit during a dialogue-heavy cutscene or vice versa. I appreciate that Microsoft put it front and center. On the other dial is the volume control. Twist to increase or decrease, nice and simple — no buttons necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Xbox Wireless headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EROyPAjGtRSmBN7ajrHrigTdHDM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363677/cfaulkner_210311_4469_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The green button pulls double duty, serving as the pairing and power button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Xbox Wireless headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rR2bCiXK85_7eHXSsFkqe3vX1XM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363685/cfaulkner_210311_4469_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s an LED on the mic facing your, well, face, indicating when the mic is active.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JOKh5H"&gt;Over on the right ear cup, there’s a USB-C port for charging. Microsoft includes a USB-C to USB Type-A cable to charge it, but you’ll get all of the same headset features if you plug into a Windows 10 machine with your own USB-C to USB-C cable. That’s not the case when plugged into a MacBook Pro, which won’t work over a wired connection with the headset. You can still connect to a macOS device and use the headset over Bluetooth, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x8eeqr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wired or wireless gaming headsets to buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ZDpKTn"&gt;There are only two buttons on the headset: one to manually mute the bendable microphone (an LED on the inner section of the boom microphone angled toward your face is illuminated when the mic is hot), and another that serves as the all-in-one pairing and power button, both of which reside on the left ear cup. Most gaming headsets require days of continued use to fully learn their respective button layouts, but this one’s dead simple. I would have taken one more button if it served as a multifunction button to control my device over Bluetooth, but Microsoft has limited the headset to just two buttons. There’s no way to independently control, say, a phone outside of just adjusting the volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5DQuG3"&gt;The sound performance from this headset is better than I expected. During my tests, I listened to Spotify, and the music sounded good enough to stick with this headset instead of automatically reaching for my Sony 1000XM3s. People with a knack for stellar audio quality will find quibbles, like that the sound can come off as muddled at times, and the soundstage isn’t as expansive as you’d find in a more expensive set of headphones. But again, these are $99 and meant for gaming first. And for that price, I’m pleased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Xbox Wireless headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sBzN4vGCvi7BGhEN7LcMNTAb2BA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363680/cfaulkner_210311_4469_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both rotating ear cups have instructions that are simple to digest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Xbox Wireless headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GY3ej0-CJ8y6kU-hFgduDuUtJE8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363679/cfaulkner_210311_4469_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These charge via USB-C, and they also work wired via USB-C to a Windows 10 PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0H4eYZ"&gt;Hopping over to gaming, I instantly booted up &lt;em&gt;Doom (2016)&lt;/em&gt; on the Series X. The soundtrack and all of the various hellish sound effects have an adequate amount of crunch and punch, and I was head-banging to the music while I played. It sounded as it was intended to sound, though, again, the same nitpicks apply here as they do for music. When there’s a lot happening in the mid and high frequencies, the sound can lack clarity if you’re listening closely. I didn’t notice that as much in &lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, for instance. This headset works with the Dolby Atmos (Microsoft is giving buyers a trial of Dolby Atmos with purchase that will last until the end of September) and DTS: X paid apps available for Xbox and PC, which might enhance the sound. But for the purposes of this review, I tested just the out-of-the-box experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPZibO"&gt;The battery life and range are competitive with other gaming headsets I’ve tested in this price range. Microsoft claims 15 hours per charge, and both times I ran the non-replaceable battery down during testing, it lasted for about that long. I was able to roam about my studio apartment, straying about 25 feet or so from the Xbox without experiencing any drop-outs. It started cutting out when the signal had to go through multiple walls, but that’s to be expected. As for charge speeds, Microsoft says it can gain three hours of use out of a 15-minute charge. In case you were wondering, you can use the Xbox Wireless headset while it’s being charged, but obviously, it’ll then take longer to recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Xbox Wireless headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/63xjlEdwqD8mjoxazoDqKAxAb9s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363684/cfaulkner_210311_4469_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The polyurethane leather-covered pads are comfortable and deliver good noise isolation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Xbox Wireless headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bcvxJXSwhCMLDRLEHUuKJNtdXCw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363678/cfaulkner_210311_4469_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A closer look at the left ear cup shows the instructions for the chat / game audio mixer and the pairing button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j7JrXM"&gt;To give you a sense of how this headset handles connections, I first paired the Xbox Wireless headset to my PC with Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?prodsku=6253924&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-wireless-adapter-for-windows-10-black%2F6253924.p%3FskuId%3D6253924&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;USB Wireless Adapter&lt;/a&gt; (not included with this headset, but it operates on the same Xbox Wireless protocol as the consoles) for music and to take some video calls. Pairing the headset required pressing and holding the pair button for four seconds and doing the same to the Wireless Adapter. To use them on the Xbox Series X, I had to run through the same process. Frustratingly, the headset can’t handle juggling between two previously paired devices that use the Xbox Wireless protocol, so I had to manually re-pair it when I wanted to hop between my PC and the Xbox. I don’t want to overblow this issue, though. Microsoft’s pairing process for Xbox accessories is very simple. This won’t be a problem at all if you connect to your PC via Bluetooth (as I imagine most people will) since the headset can connect to both concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GelArV"&gt;If you’re someone who’s likely to lean heavily on the concurrent wireless connection feature, I like that this headset automatically lowers the audio streaming from the Xbox Wireless protocol device when a call is incoming so you can hear it. You can adjust the volume of just your Bluetooth device with its own controls, but not from the headset itself. Cranking the volume with the dial makes it louder for both devices you’re connected to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O-v7S22yTaHIXYd7Bvr3MNtHJ6k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363752/xboxconfigureheadset.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xbox Accessories app on PC and Xbox lets you fine-tune adjustments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8dvEqO"&gt;The level of customization this headset allows is also impressive for the price. Through the Xbox Accessories app for Windows 10 or Xbox, you can adjust the equalizer (movie, music, game, heavy bass, and speech are the presets, or make your own) and boost the bass. Additionally, there’s an auto-mute feature that can mute noises happening in your surroundings. There are three levels (low, medium, and high), and Microsoft says each step up will increase how aggressively the mic mutes things that aren’t your voice. During a video call, it seemed to work as intended, if not better than I expected. The person on the other end said that my speech wasn’t getting cut off, which is something that can happen with these kinds of features, and that happenings in the background weren’t noticeable. Of course, the effectiveness of this auto-mute feature can vary depending on your household situation. If you’re skeptical, it’s easy enough to just tap the mute button to avoid potential embarrassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvmKPc"&gt;Two other small but cool features in the Xbox Accessories app let you tweak how bright the mute light is, making it easier to see in your peripheral vision. You can also customize the level of mic monitoring or how much outside sound is fed through the mics and then funneled into your ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uf3qSh"&gt;Up until now, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21545683/razer-kaira-pro-xbox-wireless-gaming-headset-series-x-s-one-pc-microsoft-usb-c"&gt;$150 Razer Kaira Pro&lt;/a&gt; was the Xbox-specific headset I told people to get because it’s comfortable, and it supports Bluetooth in addition to the Xbox Wireless protocol. Microsoft’s new Xbox Wireless headset is well ahead of that model in terms of design, ease of use, and functionality — all in a more affordable package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Ns40bYUPWPFJ4BkU9iA5JBW-x0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363686/cfaulkner_210311_4469_00010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If it fits my head and can also fit around the Series X, it should fit you fine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="WgEl04"&gt;If Microsoft is to be judged compared to Sony on how well it designed a headset to accompany its latest consoles — as it inevitably will be — this one handily edges out the Pulse 3D even though they’re the same price. Sony’s model is comfortable and looks equally dashing next to the console it was made for, and it has a 3.5mm headphone jack and 3D Audio support in its court. But it’s tough to compete with the Bluetooth support and button-lite design built into Microsoft’s model. I would have loved it if a USB dongle was included for more support with devices, like the Nintendo Switch. But by design, it can’t connect to other gaming consoles. Microsoft is keeping this one in the family. If you’re in the family, though, you’re in for a treat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The climate controversy swirling around NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;There’s a case for more sustainable crypto art, but it’s hotly contested&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="R78yQv"&gt;Famed auction house &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;Christie’s just sold its first &lt;/a&gt;“purely digital piece of art” for a whopping $69 million. For that price, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327594/metakovan-beeple-highest-auction-price-69-million-nft"&gt;buyer&lt;/a&gt; got a digital file of a collage of 5,000 images and a complex legacy of greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="M9HWTH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An “ecological nightmare pyramid scheme” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iUiXvi"&gt;Individual pieces of crypto art, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), are at least partially responsible for the millions of tons of planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions generated by the cryptocurrencies used to buy and sell them. Some artists — including those who have already benefited from the craze — think it’s a problem that can be easily solved. Others think the proposed solutions are a pipe dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y2sKhv"&gt;ArtStation, an online marketplace for digital artists, &lt;a href="https://magazine.artstation.com/2021/03/a-statement-from-artstation/"&gt;canceled&lt;/a&gt; its plans to launch a platform for NFTs within hours after getting a lot of backlash from people who think dealing in crypto art is environmentally unethical. Artists called NFTs an “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/willowsquest/status/1369403180266700801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1369403180266700801%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fecological-nightmare-backlash-forces-artstation-to-drop-nft-plans"&gt;ecological nightmare pyramid scheme&lt;/a&gt;” and ArtStation’s plans to offset emissions a “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pcsegal/status/1369080757789024265"&gt;scam&lt;/a&gt;” on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="exWOQ1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;ArtStation going into NFT and saying “but don’t worry! We’ll pay for carbon offsets” is the equivalent of setting a house on fire then placing a single potted plant on the burned property as “compensation”&lt;/p&gt;— BleachedRainbows (@Bleeeach) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Bleeeach/status/1369089764700217349?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e4yHDa"&gt;Digital artist Mike Winkelmann, who goes by the name Beeple, is a believer in a more sustainable future for NFTs. His work “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” was the one that got the eye-popping $69 million bid at Christie’s. Moving forward, he says his artwork will be carbon “neutral” or “negative,” meaning he’ll be able to completely offset emissions from his NFTs by investing in renewable energy, conservation projects, or technology that sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere. “I think you’re gonna see a lot of other artists do the same,” Beeple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. But for now, there are still greenhouse gas emissions associated with his NFTs. It costs about $5,000 to offset the emissions from one of his collections, he says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vdGvh6"&gt;The dirty world of NFTs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ihd2iZ"&gt;An NFT is a unique cryptocurrency token that can take the form of pretty much anything digital — art, a GIF, or even Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316320/jack-dorsey-original-tweet-nft-cent-valuables"&gt;first tweet&lt;/a&gt;. (For a more detailed look at what an NFT actually is, check out this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;breakdown&lt;/a&gt;.) There have been some initial estimates of how much power an NFT uses up and, consequently, how much planet-heating pollution that generates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwuSJD"&gt;Take “Space Cat,” an NFT that’s basically a GIF of a cat in a rocket heading to the Moon. Space Cat’s carbon footprint is equivalent to an EU resident’s electricity usage for two months, according to the website &lt;a href="http://cryptoart.wtf/"&gt;cryptoart.wtf&lt;/a&gt;. That website used to let people click through the estimated greenhouse gas emissions associated with individual NFTs until creator Memo Akten took it down on March 12th. Akten, a digital artist, had analyzed 18,000 NFTs and found that the average NFT has a carbon footprint somewhat lower than Space Cat’s but still equivalent to more than a month’s worth of electricity for a person living in the EU. Those numbers were shocking to some people. But then Akten saw that the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/memotv/status/1369594107488829441"&gt;website had been used to wrongly attribute an NFT marketplace’s emissions&lt;/a&gt; to a single NFT. He took the site offline after he discovered that it “has been used as a tool for abuse and harassment,” according to a note posted on the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="OG9O4z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G4pnTh"&gt;Since the crypto art craze is pretty new, none of the data that’s out there so far has been reviewed by outside experts. And Akten admits in a blog about his methodology that the analysis was intentionally “&lt;a href="https://memoakten.medium.com/the-unreasonable-ecological-cost-of-cryptoart-2221d3eb2053"&gt;one-sided&lt;/a&gt;.” But here’s why there’s probably a hell of a lot of greenhouse gas emissions tied to NFTs: they’re largely bought and sold in marketplaces like Nifty Gateway and SuperRare that use the cryptocurrency Ethereum. Ethereum, like most major cryptocurrencies, is built on a system called “proof of work” that is incredibly energy hungry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPtEPD"&gt;Proof of work acts as a sort of security system for cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and bitcoin since there’s no third party, like a bank, that oversees transactions. To keep financial records secure, the system forces people to solve complex puzzles using energy-guzzling machines. Solving the puzzles lets users, or “miners,” add a new “block” of verified transactions to a decentralized ledger called the blockchain. The miner then gets new tokens or transaction fees as a reward. The process is incredibly energy inefficient &lt;em&gt;on purpose&lt;/em&gt;. The idea is that using up inordinate amounts of electricity — and probably paying a lot for it — makes it less profitable for someone to muck up the ledger. As a result, Ethereum uses about as much electricity as the entire country of &lt;a href="https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hSKumz"&gt;Airlines and Ethereum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EGWKvN"&gt;When someone makes, buys, or sells an NFT using Ethereum, they’re responsible for some of the emissions generated by those miners. What’s still up for debate is whether NFTs are significantly increasing emissions from Ethereum or if they’re just taking on responsibility for emissions that would have been generated by miners anyway. Without NFTs, miners would still be plugging away at puzzles and polluting. And NFTs are still a relatively small portion of all Ethereum transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WamsVi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Figuring out the culpability of NFTs is a little like calculating your share of emissions from a commercial plane flight&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0FpZSO"&gt;Figuring out the culpability of NFTs is a little like calculating your share of emissions from a commercial plane flight, according to Joseph Pallant, founder of the nonprofit Blockchain for Climate Foundation. If you’re on the plane, you’re obviously responsible for a portion of its emissions. But if you hadn’t bought the ticket, the plane probably would have taken off with other passengers and polluted the same amount anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEVASW"&gt;Individual behavior becomes a bigger problem, though, when it drives trends. If enough people decide to start flying who weren’t planning to before, an airline might decide to operate more flights — which means more emissions overall. “Many NFT transactions send a stronger economic signal to the miners which may lead to increased emissions,” Susanne Köhler, a PhD fellow who researches sustainable blockchain technologies at Denmark’s Aalborg University, said in an email. If NFTs significantly push up the value of Ethereum, miners might try to cash in by upping how many machines they use. More machines generally mean more pollution. (And even if new machines are better at solving puzzles, making them more energy-efficient, proof-of-work puzzles are designed to get progressively more difficult. Again, the system was designed to keep things inefficient.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AbodRc"&gt;Alternatives to Ethereum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PCtPDH"&gt;There are other strategies for keeping a blockchain secure that might not be as hard on the planet. The most popular alternative to proof of work is a system called “proof of stake.” NBA’s Top Shot, the marketplace where basketball fans can buy NBA highlights as NFTs, operates on the Flow blockchain, which is an example of an arguably more centralized blockchain running on the proof-of-stake model. This system still requires users to have some kind of skin in the game to dissuade bad behavior. But instead of having to pay for huge amounts of electricity to enter the game, they instead have to lock up some of their own cryptocurrency tokens in the network to “prove” they’ve got a “stake” in keeping the ledger accurate. If they get caught doing anything fishy, they’ll be penalized by losing those tokens. That gets rid of the need for computers to solve complex puzzles, which, in turn, gets rid of emissions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q39r3n"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Electricity consumption will literally over a day or overnight drop to almost zero”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r5SOFU"&gt;Ethereum has said for years that it will eventually switch to proof of stake. That’s what crypto art optimists are hoping for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZYhpw"&gt;“That would essentially mean that Ethereum’s electricity consumption will literally over a day or overnight drop to almost zero,” says Michel Rauchs, a research affiliate at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnIVak"&gt;The problem is that people have been waiting for years for Ethereum to make the change, and some are skeptical that it ever will. First, Ethereum will have to convince everyone that proof of stake is the way to go. Otherwise, the whole system could collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeNfO4"&gt;“If not everyone agrees to that change, you’re going to be in a situation where the network just falls apart,” says economist Alex de Vries. “It can literally break into multiple chains if not everyone runs the same software. That’s the downside of trying to upgrade public blockchains like Ethereum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSB0px"&gt;Private blockchains do exist, and some, like Flow, are completely devoted to NFT transactions, allowing them to sidestep some of the issues with cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. But those kinds of blockchains move away from what cryptocurrencies were supposed to do in the first place, which is create a decentralized network where anyone can make transactions without the oversight of a single institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVCQf6"&gt;There are other ways to bring down emissions from NFTs and keep a more decentralized proof-of-work network. One potential solution is to build out another “layer” on top of the existing blockchain. Working on this second layer can save energy because transactions happen “off-chain” — away from the energy-intensive proof-of-work process. For example, two people who want to trade NFTs might open up their own “channel” on the second layer where they can make a virtually unlimited number of transactions. Once they’re done doing business, they can settle up the net result of their transactions back on the blockchain, where it can be added to the verified ledger via the proof-of-work process. You’re essentially bundling or netting a whole bunch of transactions into just a few that need to take place on the inefficient blockchain, which ultimately saves energy. The bitcoin Lightning Network, launched in 2018, is an early example of a “second layer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8Vyd88"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Renewable energy isn’t a perfect solution&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jaIiuz"&gt;Then there’s the most straightforward solution to the emissions problem of NFTs: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/21/16806772/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-energy-consumption-renewables-climate-change"&gt;clean energy&lt;/a&gt;. If more cryptocurrency machines run on clean energy, emissions go down. This is starting to happen, but there’s still not a clear picture of how much cryptocurrencies are mined using renewables. For bitcoin, in particular, for which there’s the most research, the estimates vary wildly — from 35 to 80 percent. Some experts, like de Vries, have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S254243511930087X"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that relying on renewable energy isn’t a perfect solution for proof-of-work cryptocurrencies either. If mining for tokens continues to be extremely energy intensive, it will continue to put pressure on electricity grids and eat up renewable energy that could otherwise go toward something arguably more urgent — like heating or lighting homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EqHxZa"&gt;Leaner, Greener NFTs? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hHPuII"&gt;While people try to hash out the kinks in all of these proposed solutions, the climate crisis grows more dire every day. Against the very real backdrop of climate-related disasters, there will still be people who &lt;a href="https://everestpipkin.medium.com/but-the-environmental-issues-with-cryptoart-1128ef72e6a3"&gt;refuse to participate&lt;/a&gt; at all in a system that they think is inherently harmful and environmentally destructive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIiizj"&gt;On the &lt;a href="http://cryptoart.wtf/"&gt;now-defunct page of cryptoart.wtf&lt;/a&gt;, a note points readers to GitHub pages and essays that guide people through carbon footprint calculations and current thinking on the topic. “CryptoArt is a tiny part of global emissions,” the note reads. “Our actions in this space is a reflection of the mindset that we need in our efforts for larger-scale systemic change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="I1k76v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Potential fixes to the NFT climate pollution problem are in the works&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Svi17x"&gt;All of the potential fixes to the climate pollution problem of NFTs are in the works to varying degrees, but they haven’t been widely adopted yet. Still, a lot of artists — and even some environmentalists — are optimistic about crypto art. “I think in the next year, year and a half, the emissions will be a non-issue,” says Blockchain for Climate Foundation’s Pallant.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xt23Qd"&gt;Ultimately, artists are the ones pushing the most for change. If marketplaces for NFTs don’t start to meet their demands, artists could start minting their NFTs on &lt;a href="https://github.com/memo/eco-nft"&gt;marketplaces using cleaner cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt;. There’s already an &lt;a href="https://www.artnome.com/greennfts"&gt;artist-led effort&lt;/a&gt; to raise money to reward people who can figure out new ways to make crypto art more sustainable. Anyone who wants to support those artists by buying their work can migrate along with them to less polluting platforms — or maybe just buy a physical copy of their work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="C01LHi"&gt;If you have high standards for sound quality, comfort, and features, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; noise-canceling headphones are probably already high up on your wishlist — if you don’t already own them. They’re featured today because you can get $72 off their normal $350 cost, bringing them down to $278. For context, they haven’t been cheaper than this (though, around Black Friday, retailers were throwing in a $25 gift card with purchase). Visually, they’re very similar to their predecessor, the XM3, but these have a sensor that can automatically pause or resume music when you put them on, and they can handle two Bluetooth connections simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tinder will soon let you run a background check on a potential date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w3LxRYT3sscSJkivSQMJoA03Bq4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68967123/acastro_180822_1777_tinder_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U3ifBV"&gt;Tinder and other Match Group-owned apps are going to let their users run background checks on possible dates. The company announced an investment in Garbo, a nonprofit that looks to allow people to run background checks with only their first name and phone number or full name. The investment, of which Match didn’t disclose the amount, will help make the group’s tech available to Match’s users, starting with the company’s most popular app: Tinder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4Ai7Q"&gt;This means Tinder users will be able to vet their dates with details like their arrest record or history of violence. That could dramatically affect who finds success on the app and who doesn’t. Garbo says it collects “public records and reports of violence or abuse, including arrests, convictions, restraining orders, harassment, and other violent crimes,” and its website says it accepts manually submitted “police report(s), order(s) of protection / restraining orders, and other legal documents that report abuse, harassment, or other crimes.” (That manual function isn’t currently live, however.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Twgl3B"&gt;Notably, in a blog post &lt;a href="https://medium.com/garbo/update-to-garbos-database-policy-to-create-a-more-equitable-background-check-da94028ad715"&gt;published last month&lt;/a&gt;, Garbo said it won’t publicize drug possession charges in order to take an “active stance toward equity.” It cites research about the disproportionate percentage of Black people who are arrested for drug charges compared to white people. The company also says drug-related offenses don’t meaningfully predict “gender-based violence,” which is what the brand is primarily concerned with preventing. Garbo also doesn’t disclose traffic violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j76F4q"&gt;The background checks on Tinder won’t be free, but Match is working with Garbo to figure out how to price them so they’re accessible to most users. It’s unclear whether this will be an a la carte feature or one tied to the brand’s subscription tiers. The team will begin testing and building out capabilities for Garbo on Tinder in the coming months, and once Garbo is integrated into Tinder, other Match Group US brands, which include OkCupid, Hinge, and Match, could follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mtmvoq"&gt;Garbo’s tool isn’t live yet, so we can’t test its accuracy, but this could upend how anonymous people feel on a dating app, particularly on Tinder, which has consistently deemphasized personal details like a last name and full bio on profiles. Match won’t share its users’ data with Garbo, but users can run a background check so long as they get their date’s last name or phone number, which they likely would want to share anyway if they plan on moving forward with dating.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ first year: a timeline</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1AiaomoVbldvDuxLvPaT1uhnCng=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68966885/Switch_ACNH_ND0220_screen_14_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It’s been quite a year&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QiSgQd"&gt;It might be hard to believe, but &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; celebrates its first anniversary this week. Ahead of the game’s launch last March, producer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185608/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-coronavirus-escape-interview"&gt;Hisashi Nogami told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he hoped players would be able to “use this as an escape.” And in a year filled with challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;em&gt;New Horizons’&lt;/em&gt; colorful island and charming animal friends proved to be exactly that, offering a much-needed respite from the difficulties of the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwaNnG"&gt;The game wasn’t only fun on day one, though. Nintendo has continually added new content and events to the game, and the community gave birth to a number of fun, hilarious, and even political moments throughout the year. For many players, &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; became more of a place than a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezx9Bh"&gt;The updates and the game’s popularity have made it a huge success, selling &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html"&gt;more than 30 million copies&lt;/a&gt; since launch. Those unprecedented numbers make it the second highest-selling game on the Switch, trailing only &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, &lt;/em&gt;and dwarf the most recent main entry, &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Leaf&lt;/em&gt;, which sold &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/3ds.html"&gt;just over 12 million copies on the 3DS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyXKS3"&gt;We’ve chronicled some of the highlights from &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;’ first year in this timeline. (If you missed any of the in-game events, you might want to &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/11/19/21575163/animal-crossing-new-horizons-acnh-time-travel-event-turkey-day-toy-day-winter-update-nintendo-switch"&gt;time travel&lt;/a&gt; back to experience them so that you don’t have to wait for the calendar to roll over again.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VHmIHx"&gt;March 20th, 2020: Launch day&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B083svfXlg-2oaHHjuMRoIUfUrs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22365869/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_11.05.10_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oWrlAB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; launches worldwide. It immediately proved to be a huge hit, selling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195022/animal-crossing-switch-sales-japan-famitsu"&gt;1.88 million copies in Japan&lt;/a&gt; in its first three days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="darUvd"&gt;April 1st through 12th, 2020: Bunny Day&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Hv82pTFHNOAvQRBPQQ-xm3oJ6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22365874/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_11.03.31_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bKCoHo"&gt;For more than a week in early April, players could find special Bunny Day eggs they could use to craft egg-themed items. (Though Nintendo had to adjust the spawn rates for eggs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21209392/animal-crossing-new-horizons-egg-drop-rates-nerfed"&gt;with a patch&lt;/a&gt; due to player complaints.) A terrifying bunny, Zipper, also appeared on the first and last days of the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LOsP3Z"&gt;Soon after launch: Hong Kong activists protest in &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SEr3LXgO-Angyj3KisH7rNH6sTs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22365880/Screen_Shot_2021_03_12_at_10.05.57_AM.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QSWNKy"&gt;Activists protesting the Hong Kong government didn’t just gather in person — they also protested in &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, as chronicled &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/animal-crossing-hong-kong-protests-coronavirus"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Wired UK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In one demonstration, for example, a group of players hit their nets on a picture of Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WpxdyB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is how &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/hongkong?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#hongkong&lt;/a&gt; ppl spend our time during coronavirus lockdown - villain hitting in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/animalcrossing?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#animalcrossing&lt;/a&gt;, the villain is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CarrieLam?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CarrieLam&lt;/a&gt;, the worst governor in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/hongkong?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#hongkong&lt;/a&gt; history.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AnimalCrossingNewHorizons?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AnimalCrossingNewHorizons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StandWithHK?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StandWithHK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/K5AbOTl9tD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/K5AbOTl9tD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Studio Incendo (@studioincendo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/studioincendo/status/1245414753058426881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 1, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OAiIO4"&gt;Throughout April: players design in-game streetwear, while esports teams make jerseys&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/17ExhVdkkpxFUR7NigoQpnAEWVM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22365887/EWovCjmUMAEjoEp.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uQB5Zl"&gt;Soon after the game’s launch, players started to use &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons’&lt;/em&gt; design tools to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21238703/animal-crossing-new-horizons-streetwear-fashion-outfits-nintendo-switch"&gt;recreate their favorite streetwear brands&lt;/a&gt; in the game, like Supreme and Louis Vuitton. And esports teams, like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GenG_KR/status/1241314184366710784"&gt;Gen.g&lt;/a&gt;, shared designs of their jerseys for players to use, while 100 Thieves &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21211236/100-thieves-apparel-collection-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch"&gt;added its entire apparel collection to the game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="D2yX9J"&gt;Also throughout April (and beyond): New Horizons’ turnips bring the internet together&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iTiNYcm9aOGiSOBGMDjZB6LftQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19887188/acastro_200409_3965_animalCrossing_0001.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M3kvqg"&gt;Like past &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; games, &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; has a stalk market, allowing you to buy turnips at one price Sunday morning to try and sell them at a higher price during the week. People across the internet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21213923/animal-crossing-new-horizons-turnip-prices-sell-exchange-profit"&gt;banded together&lt;/a&gt; in the hunt for an elusive island with a high selling price, with dedicated Slack channels (I was part of &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; at Vox Media), Reddit forums, and Discord servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kHNoG3"&gt;April 13th, 2020: The Monterey Bay Aquarium hosts a fossil tour in the New Horizons museum &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3F8Gx-CuaquHvh5Znaa5ckJgvQs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22365897/Screen_Shot_2021_03_11_at_10.38.05_PM.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dWCxjf"&gt;With museums and other educational institutions closed due to the pandemic, the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s social media team came up with a clever way to keep teaching people about the natural world: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MontereyAq/status/1249764159190790144"&gt;they invited&lt;/a&gt; educator Emily Graslie from the &lt;a href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/"&gt;Fields Museum&lt;/a&gt; to talk about the fossils on display in Blathers’ museum &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/591381757?collection=B2eYd5CdAxZ8DA"&gt;live on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. Monterey Bay Aquarium explored the natural world through &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/stories/aquarium-animal-crossing"&gt;many times&lt;/a&gt; throughout the year.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FZIzSA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=591381757&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wfP1pR"&gt;April 23rd, 2020: Leif, Jolly Redd, and more are added to the game&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hHh1e9040MnACbzB6CI_mi1YBF4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22365900/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_11.06.20_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O3sWBE"&gt;The game’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229311/animal-crossing-new-horizons-update-leif-redd-nintendo-switch-date"&gt;first big update&lt;/a&gt; brought back two popular Animal Crossing characters: Leif, who sells gardening items like shrubs and flowers, and Jolly Redd, the art dealer. The update also added a number of seasonal events, including Nature Day, the May Day Tour, International Museum Day, and Wedding Season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MOmisH"&gt;April 23rd, 2020: Nintendo slashes Bank of Nook interest rates &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7a8Apz8FqMQ7N4LhGpNJV8zz4ig=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22365935/2021031611152600_02CB906EA538A35643C1E1484C4B947D.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JUcoLM"&gt;Players logging into &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; after downloading the first big update also got an unwelcome surprise: there was a letter from the Bank of Nook, which can hold onto extra bells for you, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-slashes-interest-rates-in-animal-crossing-new-1843019628"&gt;informing them&lt;/a&gt; that interest rates had been reduced on savings accounts. While a lot of publications wrote about the new fiscal policy, the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;’ &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/68f96d24-02f0-42fd-b132-aba0acba777f"&gt;completely deadpan writeup&lt;/a&gt;, with the fantastic headline “Virtual rate cut forces Nintendo gamers into riskier assets,” remains one of the best-ever articles about the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UjY7rG"&gt;April 23rd, 2020: Elijah Wood visits Twitter user to sell turnips&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z3fuzKUGVT6OH_2E7vqE3tIzNrY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22365936/EWTZuDDWAAA5uct.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fXW0b3"&gt;In happier Animal Crossing financial news, on April 23rd a Twitter user named Jessa posted that turnips on her island were selling for an incredible 599 bells each. Soon after actor Elijah Wood messaged her so he could stop by, sell some turnips, and hang out for a bit. “[I]t was so much fun,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/4/23/21233424/elijah-wood-animal-crossing-turnip-prices-stalk-market"&gt;Jessa told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; of Elijah Wood’s visit&lt;/a&gt;. “[H]e was so nice and wholesome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Trd6Zc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bH92hs"&gt;April 26th, 2020: Gary Whitta releases the first episode of talk show &lt;em&gt;Animal Talking&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p id="uwD4bs"&gt;Gary Whitta, known as a writer on &lt;em&gt;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story&lt;/em&gt; and at one point the editor-in-chief of &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;, launched the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1avhBZoS48I"&gt;first episode&lt;/a&gt; of his virtual late-night-style talk show hosted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21257183/animal-talking-new-horizons-elijah-wood-danny-trejo-gary-whitta-late-night-show"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; called &lt;em&gt;Animal Talking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, featuring actor and former IGN host Naomi Kyle&lt;em&gt;. Animal Talking&lt;/em&gt; would go on to become a huge success, with episodes featuring &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/uWIEspNyygw"&gt;Felicia Day&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ATCQvS3Bk8"&gt;T-Pain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abvPHv1j8hA"&gt;Elijah Wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-DdCjlH99U"&gt;Xbox boss Phil Spencer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmbMYMzHRvQ"&gt;Sting&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd9h7PgGFlA"&gt;Selena Gomez&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

She &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1258517774499889154"&gt;briefly opened up her DMs&lt;/a&gt; to solicit Dodo codes, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1258521649650913280"&gt;visited&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1258556420343070725"&gt;some islands&lt;/a&gt;. On one island, she shared fruit, took pictures, and signed the bulletin board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Update 2: first ever House call (get it? ) in the books! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was so sweet. Island belonged to a family of three. We exchanged fruit, took pictures, and I signed a bulletin note using my touch screen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was floored by how fast they typed and they taught me about the app.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/KJsI6Gjh9p"&gt;pic.twitter.com/KJsI6Gjh9p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1258541175775981568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

In one vignette, the main character buried a stuffed bear, for example, while the one for bye week featured the player turning off the lights and flopping into bed. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Lions/status/1258562259913187328"&gt;You should just watch the whole thing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The update also added weekly fireworks shows that took place in August and an island backup service for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGnQDU"&gt;The update also &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/29/21347586/animal-crossing-camera-hud-removal-feature-new-horizons"&gt;added an official&lt;/a&gt; way to remove the game’s HUD while using the camera app, which allows people to make cleaner photos and even &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/5/8/21251948/animal-crossing-new-horizons-horror-movie-trailer-evil-imp"&gt;viral videos&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h2 id="L8U6eY"&gt;October 16th, 2020: Joe Biden’s presidential campaign launches a Biden-themed island ahead of the election&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="56bGjk"&gt;A little over a month after introducing virtual lawn signs, the Joe Biden campaign created an entire &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519505/joe-biden-animal-crossing-new-horizons-biden-hq-campaign-election"&gt;Biden- and Kamala Harris-themed island&lt;/a&gt;, called Biden HQ, that you could visit in a dream. One part was a virtual field office, with separate offices for Biden and Harris, while another part of the island was transformed into a polling location, complete with voting booths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="35iF6S"&gt;October 31st, 2020: Halloween event&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SKSStt"&gt;The game’s Halloween event on October 31st featured Jack, an island guest with a pumpkin for a head. You could give him and your fellow island residents candy to help celebrate the sugar-filled holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QTUw2m"&gt;Nintendo published &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575052/nintendo-switch-animal-crossing-new-horizons-no-politics-allowed"&gt;“usage guidelines” specifying how brands and businesses&lt;/a&gt; can use &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; as a marketing tool, which included &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/animalcrossing_announcement/en/index.html"&gt;asking organizations&lt;/a&gt; to “please also refrain from bringing politics into the Game.” Nintendo also asked people to “not leverage the Game as a marketing platform that directs people to activities or campaigns outside the game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qpReED"&gt;November 26th, 2020: Turkey Day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id="Xlkg6S"&gt;Jingle the black-nosed reindeer showed up on Toy Day, &lt;em&gt;New Horizons’&lt;/em&gt; version of Christmas, and he gave out special Toy Day-themed items if you &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-acnh-guide/22195698/toy-day-walkthrough-rewards-diy-jingle"&gt;talked to him and helped him deliver gifts&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Elon Musk crowns himself ‘Technoking’ of Tesla</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bfLrBNk4JM1e7BcDxj7vKvEZXV4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68966686/elon_musk_tesla_3225.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CwyjrZ"&gt;Elon Musk has a new title at Tesla: “Technoking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oprMxe"&gt;The electric automaker announced the head-scratching sobriquet in &lt;a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-012981/"&gt;a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, along with chief financial officer Zach Kirkhorn’s new position as “Master of Coin.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqAZHt"&gt;“Elon and Zach will also maintain their respective positions as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,” the filing concludes — just in case you were worried that Tesla was officially becoming one of the &lt;a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Seven_Kingdoms"&gt;Seven Kingdoms of Westeros&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tbV92E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;bend the knee&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0MDZgP"&gt;Musk, who recently lost his status as richest person on the planet after Tesla’s stock price dropped in February, could be looking for a confidence boost as his company’s once high-flying valuation falters slightly. The company had one of the most impressive stock rallies of 2020, surging over 600 percent as the market responded favorably to Musk’s vision of zero-emission vehicles dominating the globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYLL7Z"&gt;But those numbers began to dip in 2021, with Tesla’s shares down nearly 14 percent in the first two months. A fire at the company’s Fremont factory last week also sent share prices down. And reports surfaced of over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/13/22329041/tesla-450-cases-coronavirus-fremont-california-coronavirus-elon-musk"&gt;450 cases of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; among Tesla workers through December 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gd2UY"&gt;Musk has a reputation as a corporate prankster who chafes at the traditional image of a chief executive and often pushes the boundaries of propriety. He has used Twitter to taunt &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/5/24/17389388/elon-musk-twitter-pravda"&gt;reporters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-investor-lawsuit-elon-musk-board-for-erratic-tweets-2021-3"&gt;government regulators&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/tesla-is-using-customers-to-test-av-tech-on-public-roads-ntsb.html"&gt;brazenly beta tests&lt;/a&gt; new driver assistance software on his customers that he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528508/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-first-reaction-video"&gt;misrepresents&lt;/a&gt; as fully autonomous technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TKCCA"&gt;“Technoking” isn’t the only portmanteau to emerge from Tesla. The company’s boxy, polarizing Cybertruck is also expected to go into production later this year — though his majesty, Elon the First, has said Tesla will be &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/01/28/tesla-cybertruck-elon-musk-warns-lucky-electric-pickup-delay/"&gt;“lucky” if it isn’t delayed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Taiwanese horror game Devotion now back on sale after Steam and GOG controversies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Devotion" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QsyBJ9WGPtKDbuh8-OWZ_IU1q8c=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68966407/Screenshot__756_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fWMfAD"&gt;Red Candle Games, the Taiwanese studio whose first-person horror game &lt;em&gt;Devotion&lt;/em&gt; has been unavailable to buy following controversy over a reference to Chinese premier Xi Jinping, has put its games up for sale on its own online store. &lt;em&gt;Devotion&lt;/em&gt; and the studio’s first game &lt;em&gt;Detention&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;a href="https://shop.redcandlegames.com"&gt;available to buy now&lt;/a&gt; without DRM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlCNgA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devotion&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18239937/taiwanese-horror-game-devotion-gone-steam-removed-winnie-the-pooh-meme-china"&gt;pulled from Steam&lt;/a&gt; shortly after its launch in February 2019. The game was critically lauded for its atmosphere and originality, but drew controversy and negative user reviews after users noticed an in-game poster that read, roughly, “Xi Jinping Winnie-the-Pooh moron.” Xi is commonly compared to Winnie the Pooh in online memes, which often meet the ire of China’s online censors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XpW9lL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Devotion, Twitch’s hottest horror game, builds on the genre’s legacy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236099/devotion-horror-game-steam-twitch-red-candle"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wgnUij"&gt;At the time, Red Candle Games said it was removing &lt;em&gt;Devotion&lt;/em&gt; for technical and QA-related reasons, and would also “review our game material once again making sure no other unintended materials was inserted in.” The game never returned to Steam, and Red Candle Games later apologized for its “severe art material mistake.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="attwo8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devotion&lt;/em&gt; attracted new controversy in December 2020 when CD Projekt Red’s storefront GOG backed out from an agreement to sell the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178453/gog-devotion-cancels-release-cd-projekt-red"&gt;hours after its announcement&lt;/a&gt;. “After receiving many messages from gamers, we have decided not to list the game in our store,” a statement from the store read. “This is a difficult predicament to overcome, but we won’t stop striving,” Red Candle Games said in response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2Js3n"&gt;With the developer now selling &lt;em&gt;Devotion&lt;/em&gt; for PC and Mac on its own terms, the game’s availability should be assured for the time being. “We hope to provide a direct and simple purchasing channel for players who’re interested in our games,” the studio says in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/redcandlegames/status/1371335941542060032"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not immediately clear whether the Xi reference has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kia shows off first full images of new EV6 electric car</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XxOwdNclyWA9_3dlsEa6_R7fCDU=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68966167/580833.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vZ6aRl"&gt;Kia has given a first real look at its new EV6 electric car, following some shadowy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323438/kia-ev6-electric-car-hyundai-apple-platform"&gt;teaser images&lt;/a&gt; that were released last week. Full details of the EV6 won’t be announced until an online event later this month, but the new images do at least reveal what it actually looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxAmrV"&gt;The EV6 has a sporty crossover-inspired design and is the first vehicle to make use of a new design philosophy from Kia that the company calls “Opposites United,” which is comprised of no less than five pillars: “Bold for Nature,” “Joy for Reason,” “Power to Progress,” “Technology for Life,” and “Tension for Serenity.” Kia design chief Karim Habib explains what that means in this video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gMYdwo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gqrfx2GzOYE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5vk6lM"&gt;“EV6, as the first dedicated Kia EV, is a showcase of human-centered, progressive design and electrified power. We strongly believe EV6 is a compelling and relevant model for the new EV market,” Habib says in a &lt;a href="https://www.kianewscenter.com/news/kia-reveals-new-design-philosophy-and-full-images-of-ev6/s/ab39d812-3605-4288-99eb-cd3307ad7291"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “With EV6 we aimed to create a distinctive, impactful design by using a combination of sophisticated, high-tech features on pure and rich volumes, while providing a unique space as a futuristic EV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tz81BU"&gt;Here’s a shot from another angle:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zdeEW4UxkcyM6_vb16gJy2K8ofM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22371164/580834.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DKk8g9"&gt;And here’s the interior:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s_mfwbJ_OJTfFMRMF8ycjSNOHW8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22371165/580837.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8LahwT"&gt;Kia describes the EV6 as its first “dedicated battery electric vehicle,” since its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/4/17320598/kia-niro-ev-production-form-reveal-ambitious-range-electric-crossover"&gt;Niro&lt;/a&gt; has gas/hybrid models as well as the newer version with an electric drivetrain. The EV6 is built around parent company Hyundai’s new E-GMP platform and is the second E-GMP vehicle to have been announced; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"&gt;Hyundai unveiled its own Ioniq 5 last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fa3s9t"&gt;For more technical details, you’ll have to wait for the EV6 to be revealed in full. Kia hasn’t announced a date for the event just yet but says it’ll happen in March, so it won’t be too far off.&lt;/p&gt;
