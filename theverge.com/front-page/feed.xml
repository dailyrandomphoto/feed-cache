    <title>That Fyre Fest tweet with the sad sandwich will be auctioned as an NFT for medical expenses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YCYxDXendLEL1z-0HRJ4bwA7wM4=/0x114:680x567/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69096040/fyrefest.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/trev4president/status/857776562615308288" target="_blank"&gt;Trevor DeHaas/Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N6gI5C"&gt;Trevor DeHaas is auctioning his 2017 tweet of the “dinner” he received at Fyre Fest as an NFT. But unlike the Fest itself, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trev4president/status/857776562615308288"&gt;tweeted photo of the limp cheese slice&lt;/a&gt; on wheat bread with some greens and a sad tomato in a styrofoam container isn’t a grift; as first &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/nft-fyre-fest-blockchain-dinner-tweet-66eea211-4284-4e8e-821a-899cc60b6d74.html"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, DeHaas is hoping to raise $80,000 which he plans to put toward his medical bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5qMjt"&gt;The organizers of Fyre Fest billed it as an exclusive, luxury music festival in the Bahamas, which would include top-notch catering, big-name performers, and transportation via Jet Ski and yacht. Kendall Jenner was among the celebrities paid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/4/15547734/fyre-fest-kendall-jenner-instagram-sponsored-paid"&gt;$250,000 to promote the event&lt;/a&gt;, which guests paid up to $12,000 to attend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sfd6t"&gt;That is not what happened, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnzjTw"&gt;Social posts from attendees like DeHaas showed images of a poorly organized, subpar event that wasn’t close to what was advertised, and soon &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2017/music/news/mcfarland-fyre-class-action-criminal-grand-jury-subpoena-1202446126/"&gt;the lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; began. In 2018, Fyre Fest organizer &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/arts/music/fyre-festival-organizer-sentenced-fraud.html?smtyp=cur&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimes"&gt;Billy McFarland was sentenced to six years in prison&lt;/a&gt; after pleading guilty to wire fraud charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="k0R4E2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="onIXO5"&gt;DeHaas told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; that he was inspired by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s auction of his first-ever tweet, which &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/22/jack-dorsey-sells-his-first-tweet-ever-as-an-nft-for-over-2point9-million.html"&gt;sold for $2.9 million&lt;/a&gt; on March 22nd. “Now, a few weeks before the 4 year anniversary of the festival (4/28) I’m selling the most iconic cheese sandwich on the blockchain along with the ownership of copyright,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHubjc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trev4president/status/1379832081845485569?s=20"&gt;DeHaas clarified on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that he was selling the tweet on &lt;a href="http://flipkick.io"&gt;flipkick.io&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based company for artists and musicians to “monetize their work with Physical NFTs,” according to &lt;a href="https://flipkick.io/about"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;. Ironic twist: Fyre Fest co-organizer Ja Rule is a partner in Flipkick, but DeHaas says the musician is not directly involved in the auction of his cheese sandwich tweet. However, Ja Rule, who was &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ja-rule-cleared-of-wrongdoing-in-major-fyre-fest-lawsuit-2576105"&gt;cleared of wrongdoing&lt;/a&gt; in connection with Fyre Fest, recently &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/mar/25/ja-rule-nft-fyre-festival-artwork"&gt;sold an NFT of a painting of the Fyre Fest logo&lt;/a&gt; for $122,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3CPOR"&gt;DeHaas says he plans to transfer copyright and ownership rights for the NFT to the auction winner. His aim is to raise money for his medical expenses; according to his &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/trevors-kidney-fund"&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt;, DeHaas is in end-stage renal disease and needs a kidney transplant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFO1kT"&gt;Which raises a troubling question: are NFT auctions going to become another tool — like GoFundMe pages — to raise money for costs not covered in America’s abysmal health care system? If something good comes out of the debacle that was Fyre Fest (other than the &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-or-hulu-which-fyre-festival-documentary-you-should-watch/"&gt;dueling documentaries on Hulu and Netflix&lt;/a&gt;), that’s certainly a win. But using NFTs to pay for surgery and treatment introduces an even bleaker scenario for people desperate to pay their medical bills who aren’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/30/4787602/breaking-bad-series-finale-breaks-records-for-ratings-and-piracy"&gt;Walter White&lt;/a&gt; or independently wealthy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvErPq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The wisdom of the crowd&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6YZmXK"&gt;During the aughts, there was a vague notion among techno-optimists that crowdsourcing knowledge was the answer to just about every problem. Using the wisdom of crowds, the thought went, people would have unprecedented access to expertise. “With enough eyes, all bugs are shallow,” said the open-source software community. The success of Wikipedia meant that mass collaboration, open systems of production, and talented amateurs would win the day, this line of thinking went. Books such as &lt;em&gt;The Wisdom of Crowds&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crowdsourcing: Why the Power of the Crowd Is Driving the Future of Business, Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing without Organizations&lt;/em&gt; pushed the idea that the future was the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GQaqR"&gt;It was in this environment, in 2005, that Yahoo! started Yahoo! Answers. In theory, it should have been the biggest, most important site on the internet. In practice, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368488/yahoo-answers-shutdown-may-4-internet-era-over-rip"&gt;Yahoo! Answers will be shut down on May 4th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcb6oz"&gt;So I thought I would preserve, for future generations, the intellectual inquiry that went on there. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Realme 8 Pro review: a peek at what’s next in midrange smartphone imaging</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The 8 Pro uses a new 108-megapixel image sensor that could bring better photo capabilities to the midrange class&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OubfId"&gt;The Realme 8 Pro is a good, inexpensive Android phone that you probably shouldn’t buy right now — at least if you’re in the US. But it’s also a preview of positive things to come to the midrange class, especially in terms of camera hardware. I have seen the future of smartphone imaging around the $400 price point, and it is good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcAQ4u"&gt;If you’re not familiar, Realme is a Chinese company that started off as a sub-brand of Oppo; like OnePlus, it was founded by a former Oppo vice president. Its phones are sold in China, India, and Europe. Although, you can technically &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aliexpress.com%2Fitem%2F1005002356767813.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22372644%2Frealme-8-pro-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy a global version of the phone&lt;/a&gt; and use it in the US, but we wouldn’t recommend it. It’s not compatible with many of the 4G bands we use in the states, so coverage won’t be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rlknuc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10434729"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OpH1Ga"&gt;The 8 Pro uses a relatively new 108-megapixel Samsung sensor. It’s the same pixel count as the main camera in the Galaxy S21 Ultra, but a different, smaller chip designed for budget-friendlier phones. As in the S21 Ultra, the point of this technology isn’t to take 108-megapixel images (though you can do that if you want). It’s to combine information from groups of pixels to create a better optimized 12-megapixel final image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9rJ6T"&gt;There are other reasons to like the Realme 8 Pro. Considering its £279 (about $380) price, performance is very good, owing to a strong combination in its Snapdragon 720G processor and 6GB of RAM. Battery life is healthy and the phone supports 50W fast wired charging. Depending on how you feel about inspirational corporate branding, I guess the “DARE TO LEAP” printed on the back of the phone could be a plus (not my thing, personally).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZOVxs"&gt;But the camera impressed me the most, and it’s a component that will likely make its way into many more midrange phones sold around the globe. Let’s take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Realme 8 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zYL68vwQZ04q6a7Q9V0H5pE8grQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422677/ajohnson_20210330_4501_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 8 Pro offers standard wide and ultrawide cameras, plus macro and depth-sensing modules.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9Deyjj"&gt;Realme 8 Pro camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KseLY8"&gt;In case you need a reminder at any point of how many pixels the main camera offers, you can simply look at the back of the phone where you’ll find “108 MP QUAD CAMERA”  etched on the camera bump. Specifically, it’s Samsung’s 1/1.52-inch Isocell HM2 sensor coupled with an f/1.9 lens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpIrz3"&gt;Unfortunately, there’s no optical image stabilization here, but maybe owing to the image processing tricks this high-res sensor can pull off, I didn’t notice a significant number of blurry shots that OIS might have corrected. Other rear cameras include an 8-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth-sensing camera. There’s a 16-megapixel selfie camera on the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PqSNY9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In low light, the camera uses binning to combine pixels into groups of nine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2WslDc"&gt;The main camera is able to do a couple of interesting things. In bright daylight, it can use all 108 million pixels individually, using different pixels to capture your scene at multiple exposure levels at once, and combining the information into a 12-megapixel final image. In low light, the camera switches things up and uses binning to combine pixels into groups of nine, effectively turning relatively small individual pixels — 0.7μm to be precise — into much larger 2.1μm sized pixels, which helps produce less noisy images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hm4ceZ"&gt;Photos in bright light look good as expected. There’s an impressive amount of detail captured, though some overzealous sharpening is evident if you zoom in to 100 percent. Colors are a bit too saturated for my liking; there’s no amount of lawn fertilizer in the world that would make my yard look as green as the 8 Pro thinks it is. It seems more prone to this oversaturation with landscapes and is thankfully less aggressive with portrait mode photos. Portrait mode photos look good, and I appreciate that the camera doesn’t crop in when switching to this mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rs3ppK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10434785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="chzFwG"&gt;Dim indoor lighting and low light are where phone cameras typically struggle, but the 8 Pro turns in an impressive performance in these conditions. In moderate lighting, images are surprisingly detailed and show little noise. The camera’s night mode will bring out even more detail, though it does apply a distracting amount of sharpening and contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="smeJnG"&gt;I had, frankly, low expectations for the 8 Pro’s digital 3x zoom, but I’m pleased to report that it’s much better than I feared. In good light and even moderate indoor lighting, images show a lot of detail and I’m hard-pressed to find the unpleasant artifacts that usually appear in digitally zoomed images. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nOR1WW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10434810"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3JoPTF"&gt;The camera isn’t just cropping in on a 108-megapixel image, either. Comparing them side by side at 100 percent, a photo taken with 3x digital zoom shows more detail and looks less noisy than a crop of a 108-megapixel image. The Samsung HM2’s pixel binning powers are being put to work here, too, and the result is digital zoom that is actually worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNLxwM"&gt;There’s not as much exciting news to report about the 8 Pro’s other cameras; they do just fine. The ultrawide is prone to some subtle but unpleasant color shifts: white balance can skew too warm and blue skies sometimes look a little gray. The macro camera is a low-resolution sensor that is little more than a gimmick, and the selfie camera thankfully avoids over-smoothing faces at its default setting. All fair for a phone at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ggsQ0wf8_f25IqWpW3y0u9KmD00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422682/ajohnson_20210330_4501_0005.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 8 Pro’s processor and RAM combination are more than sufficient for everyday tasks and scrolling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QIXP6V"&gt;Realme 8 Pro performance and screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KwndvP"&gt;Outside of cameras, the Realme 8 Pro is a thoroughly capable midrange phone. Battery life is sufficient to get through a day of moderate to heavy use and the aforementioned processor / RAM combo handles day-to-day app scrolling and tasks with ease. The 6.4-inch 1080p OLED with standard 60Hz refresh rate is fine but nothing special, and I had to fight with auto brightness insisting on making the screen too dim on a couple of occasions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RkSqzm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;this processor / RAM combo handles day-to-day app scrolling and tasks with ease&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wg2ih4"&gt;There’s the flashy branding on the rear of the device, which is either your kind of thing or not. The Realme 8 Pro doesn’t support 5G at all, which is something to consider if you’re in the UK and thinking of buying the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYsb1B"&gt;My biggest gripe, though, is with the optical in-display fingerprint sensor. I’d say at least a third of the time when I unlocked the phone it required more than one try to read my finger. A couple of times — both outside in bright daylight — it gave up and had me enter my PIN instead. If this was going to be my forever phone, I’d probably skip the fingerprint sensor and just stick with a PIN, personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YChxijF9TJL3frDe23zO-C6xCgE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422679/ajohnson_20210330_4501_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Te32ls"&gt;The Realme 8 Pro is the kind of midrange phone that we don’t see very often in the US: great performance and decent all-around specs combined with an excellent camera, all for what would equate to a sub-$400 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zm37iP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the 8 Pro is (hopefully) a sign of good camera hardware coming our way soon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o4Z3xk"&gt;Phones that meet this description are surprisingly scarce stateside; in fact, its closest equivalent is probably the Pixel 4A, which we’ve recommended as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;best low-cost Android phone&lt;/a&gt; essentially since it became available last summer. The 8 Pro goes a step beyond the 4A in some respects by offering an ultrawide rear camera and fast charging. If it came down to it, though, we’d probably still favor the Pixel for its very good device support and excellent lone rear camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3ZY0XQ"&gt;If you live in the UK and you don’t care much about class-leading display specs and the lack of 5G doesn’t bother you, the 8 Pro has a camera and a processor that will keep up for many years to come. For the rest of us, the 8 Pro is (hopefully) a sign of good camera hardware coming our way soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Expedia launches a new tool to check coronavirus travel restrictions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Travelers wait in security lines at Mexico airport" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/py8jw_txBboL0i9Krgdq_Xp4AaI=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69095275/1231957204.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Gerardo Vieyra/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v6uRgE"&gt;As more people get vaccinated against the coronavirus and spring weather coaxes people outside, we’re all thinking about those travel plans we shelved last summer. But with COVID-19 travel restrictions varying by country and by state in the US, it’s difficult to figure out what’s safe and what the latest rules are.  Expedia Group — whose online travel agent (OTA) websites include Expedia, Vrbo, Travelocity, Hotels.com, and others — has created a tool to help travelers plan trips while adhering to COVID-19 restrictions at their destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PaVW4X"&gt;“Right now, many people are considering booking trips as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, but at the same time, they’re inundated with conflicting information about where and how they can safely travel,” Stacey Symonds, Expedia’s senior director of experience insights, said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The company says 1.6 million travelers participated in a pilot of its COVID-19 Travel Advisor back in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuwmwS"&gt;To use the Travel Advisor tool, enter your departure and arrival airports and your travel dates, and it will tell you whether restrictions are in place, what the quarantine policy is, whether you need to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test, and the mask policy at your destination and upon your return. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w4_97Fk0TjebSMK21Q5AWfoK-lA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429439/bos_to_tor.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Travel Advisor shows the COVID-19 restrictions for a May 8th trip from Boston to Toronto.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C95ktB"&gt;In its latest &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html"&gt;guidance dated April 2nd&lt;/a&gt;, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends US travelers delay travel until they’re fully vaccinated. Once you’re vaccinated, the CDC says you can travel safely within the US and don’t need to self-quarantine before or after your trip. Fully vaccinated travelers don’t need to get tested before or after their trips unless required at their destination. The CDC notes that any passengers entering the US, including returning US citizens, are required to have proof of recovery from COVID-19 infection or a negative COVID-19 test result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4ZFtH"&gt;As of this writing, Americans are still banned from travel to many destinations, particularly in Europe. &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-travel-restrictions.html"&gt;compiled a list&lt;/a&gt; of countries that allowed American visitors as of April 1st, and the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/map-and-travel-notices.html"&gt;CDC has a map&lt;/a&gt; showing where travel may be especially risky due to the coronavirus. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PS5 exclusive Deathloop has been delayed again until September 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tF7x94C8WtUuCWWKXz7kJqqbnUk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69095225/Deathloop_Rival_Showdown.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BakdTh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; has been delayed again, with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1271189286553923584?s=20"&gt;Arkane’s timed PS5 console exclusive&lt;/a&gt; moving from its previous May 21st release date to a fall release on September 14th. The news marks the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21374127/deathloop-the-stanley-parable-ultra-deluxe-delayed-2021-coronavirus"&gt;second big delay for &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally supposed to be out in the 2020 holiday season alongside the then-newly released PS5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UbSJ0W"&gt;As with the earlier delay, Arkane’s Lyon studio is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/deathloop/status/1295722189203832843"&gt;once again citing COVID-19-related delays&lt;/a&gt;, with an increased difficulty in development as it works to ensure “the health and safety of everyone at Arkane.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FgOiof"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/f0OWWxdUkt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/f0OWWxdUkt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DEATHLOOP (@deathloop) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/deathloop/status/1380160357872861185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wUTCWm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; is the latest title from Arkane’s Lyon studio, best known for the &lt;em&gt;Dishonored &lt;/em&gt;franchise and the rebooted &lt;em&gt;Prey &lt;/em&gt;from 2017. Players assume the role of Colt, an assassin stuck in a time loop who must fight his way out by assassinating his eight targets using a variety of weapons and mystical powers — all while being hunted by a rival assassin, Julianna (who can be controlled by other players over the internet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwRp5D"&gt;As a next-gen exclusive title, &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; is only set to be released on the PlayStation 5 (for a one-year exclusivity period) and PC — despite the fact that publisher Bethesda is now owned by Microsoft. Xbox studio head Phil Spencer &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-21/microsoft-to-buy-bethesda-studios-for-7-5-billion-to-boost-xbox"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; back in September that it’ll still be holding to that timed exclusivity for both &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;GhostWire: Tokyo. &lt;/em&gt;That&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;means, with the current delay, Xbox owners will be waiting even longer before they’re able to head to Blackreef. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s latest Galaxy Chromebook is $100 off for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 on a desk in front of a window, open with a mug and small plant on its left and some books on its right.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F0ZPFo"&gt;Samsung’s latest Chrome OS laptop, the Galaxy Chromebook 2, came out a couple of months ago. If you are looking to buy this laptop at a more affordable price, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737191485644991413#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737196912936872712#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; have multiple configurations on sale for $100 off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7VdNv"&gt;My colleague, Monica Chin, thinks this laptop is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the best midrange Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now and notes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in her review&lt;/a&gt; that this Chromebook has much better battery life than its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MyIhdu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10435503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KrDsUI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima &lt;/em&gt;was released last year, and it quickly became one of the more popular games in 2020, so much so that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350484/sony-ghost-of-tsushima-movie-film-director-john-wick-sucker-punch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the game is getting a film adaption&lt;/a&gt;. If you have yet to experience this open-world action title, it is back down to its lowest price yet of $40 at several retailers, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Tsushima-PlayStation-4/dp/B08BSKT43L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724325625436134758#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fghost-of-tsushima%2F11100913.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3Kw9G4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591232"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JOTrEj"&gt;At a sale price of $297, LG’s UltraGear, a 27-inch gaming monitor, is a great deal.

    <title>HMD revamps its midrange Nokia lineup with six phones under €350</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TfUuWYki-4j9QODKpaIA2ZsTins=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69095144/Group_shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right, HMD’s Nokia G10, X20, C10, X10, G20, and C20.&lt;/em&gt; | Image; HMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="03e2Sm"&gt;HMD is announcing six new midrange Nokia phones today, ranging in price from €75 (around $90) up to €349 (around $415). At the top, there’s the X-series, consisting of the X10 and X20, followed by the G-series G10 and G20, and then finally, there’s the entry-level C10 and C20 from the C-series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7T55e"&gt;HMD’s pitch for these phones is the length of time it’s offering support, with even the cheapest C-series phones due to receive two years of quarterly security updates. Meanwhile, G-series phones will receive two years of Android OS updates and three years of monthly security updates. Finally, the X-series gets three years of OS updates, three years of monthly security updates, and an extended warranty that HMD says should mean it’s covered for three years in many of its release markets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i4QG5b2wdm-BpCt6Bk-ICtsEKAM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429117/Nokia_X20___Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia X20.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="921Yx8"&gt;At the top of the six-phone lineup is the X20, which HMD says will be priced at the equivalent of €349 (£299.99, around $415) around the world. It’s got a 6.67-inch 1080p display, with a hole-punch cutout in the top-center for its 32-megapixel selfie camera, while on the back, you’ll find a circular camera bump containing four cameras: a 64-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel depth camera, and a 2-megapixel macro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xI8iFq"&gt;Internally, the X20 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 and 4,470mAh battery, with either 6 or 8GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable storage. It runs Android 11 out of the box and includes three years of OS updates that HMD says will take it through to Android 14. Security is handled by a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, and there’s also a dedicated Google Assistant button on the left. I’ve been using the Nokia X20 for the past week, and you can read my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22136485"&gt;first-hand impressions here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZN_FrgzIUmyI-ULFs3gjo_Vwnn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429118/Nokia_X10_Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia X10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="25RTi5"&gt;A step down from the X20 is the Nokia X10 at €309 (£249.99, around $367). It shares a lot of the DNA of its older sibling. It’s also running on a Snapdragon 480, with a 4,470mAh battery and has a 6.67-inch 1080p display. But it’s available with slightly lower specs: a minimum of 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, and its main camera and selfie camera at  lower resolutions of 48-megapixels and 8-megapixels, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mg0pVe"&gt;Next is the G-series, which is led by the Nokia G20 at €159 (£129.99, around $189). Its screen is a little smaller at 6.5 inches and has a lower resolution of 720p. Internally, it’s using a MediaTek G35 processor with a 5,050mAh battery, upwards of 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of expandable storage. You still get four rear cameras, though: a 48-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. Around front, there’s a notch containing an 8-megapixel camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UlZShG1gTCbSJiedbuM23DHBuk8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429123/Nokia_G10_Emotional.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia G10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/57_ftm-V7sKRfvQKo668yjNFGhs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429124/Nokia_G20_Emotional.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia G20.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gUeNod"&gt;The G20 is joined by the Nokia G10 at €139 (£109.99, around $165). Its display and battery have the same specs as the G20, but it’s got a less powerful MediaTek G25 processor, with 3 or 4GB of RAM and 32 or 64GB of expandable storage. Around back, you only get three cameras: a 13-megapixel main camera, a 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. The Nokia G10 has an 8-megapixel selfie camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKf1qp"&gt;Right at the bottom of the newly revamped lineup is the C-series, which HMD says is designed for people who would previously have bought non-smart feature phones. Both the Nokia C20 at €89 (£79, around $105) and the Nokia C10 at €75 (around $90) have 6.5-inch 720p displays, a single rear 5-megapixel camera, a 5-megapixel selfie camera, and are running Google’s lightweight Go edition of Android 11. The C20 has a Unisoc SC9863a processor, while the C10 has a Unisoc SC7331e processor. Both are available with 1 or 2GB of RAM, 16 or 32GB of expandable storage, and removable 3,000mAh batteries that charge over Micro USB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OT0jah"&gt;The naming schemes may be different than previous Nokia lines, but with its six new devices, HMD is focusing on its traditional strengths: affordable phones with lengthy support periods. We’re still waiting for HMD to confirm exact US pricing and availability for the handsets, but the G10 and C20 will be available in “select markets” starting later this month, the X20 and G20 will launch in May, and the X10 and C10 will launch in June.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HMD’s Nokia X20 is designed to actually last you three years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L8TIyLZPb0k1gEDAcsdC0s1pg-c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69095135/jporter_20210407_4514_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HMD’s Nokia X20.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tnVjBV"&gt;HMD is announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22135978"&gt;six new midrange devices&lt;/a&gt; today led by the Nokia X20, a midrange handset priced starting at €349 / £299.99 (around $415). It will release in “select markets globally” such as the UK starting next month, but we’re still waiting on HMD to confirm exact US pricing and availability. I’ve been using the phone running near-final software over the past week, which has been enough to get some rough first impressions about the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpF5tO"&gt;To be frank, the Nokia X20 isn’t the most exciting device. But HMD’s promises about ongoing software and hardware support for the phone make it compelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5dVoD"&gt;The Nokia X20 is specced like a device at this price point is expected to be. It’s powered by a modest Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 processor paired with either 6 or 8GB of RAM (my device has 6GB), 128GB of expandable storage, and a 4,470mAh battery. It’s got a 6.67-inch, 1080p 60Hz display with a small hole-punch notch and four rear cameras including an ultrawide, macro, and depth sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WO-rk1GA-8LMPrS7IfPH5DchXFs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427482/jporter_20210407_4514_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a side-mounted fingerprint sensor on the right of the device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gUXX35"&gt;The company says it’ll provide three years of monthly security updates for the X20 after launch, three years of OS updates, and to ensure the hardware doesn’t give up the ghost before software support ends, it’s also extending its normal manufacturer’s warranty by an extra year. “In the majority of places,” a company spokesperson says, “that extends it to three years.” If all goes to plan, the Nokia X20 should still be under warranty when it receives its Android 14 update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdIGRz"&gt;In the past, HMD has generally been good at updating its phones over time, though &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3606708/android-11-upgrade-report-card.html?page=2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ComputerWorld&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Android 11 upgrade tracker&lt;/a&gt; reports that it’s been more sluggish lately. Recently, HMD updated its &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/hmd-global-rolls-out-android-11-nokia-8-1-nokia-2-3/"&gt;Nokia 8.1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/24/android-11-is-now-rolling-out-to-the-nokia-3-2/"&gt;Nokia 3.2&lt;/a&gt;, which released in 2018 and 2019, to Android 11 as part of an upgrade roadmap that includes &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nokia-android-11-update-roadmap-hmd-global-1162501/"&gt;over a dozen of its devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZFzgb4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It should eventually be updated to Android 14&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="amXhOz"&gt;Three years of security updates is a little less than the four years Samsung recently said it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;would offer for its Galaxy devices&lt;/a&gt;, but Samsung’s warranty varies between one and two years depending on whether you’re in the &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/warranty/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/warranty/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. Apple recently updated its 2015 iPhone 6S to iOS 14 (five years after its release), but its standard limited warranty also typically only covers new phones for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Flegal%2Fwarranty%2Fstatutoryrights.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F8%2F22372444%2Fhmd-nokia-x20-specs-release-date-price-news-quad-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;between one and two years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHU6nh"&gt;Along with aiming for three years of use, HMD has also made a couple of other decisions with the Nokia X20 in the name of being eco-friendly. First, in the EU it’s joining Apple and others by not including a power brick in the box, just a USB-C cable. What you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; get in the box is a 100 percent compostable phone case. It’s a neat idea producing a case that won’t end up in a landfill, but the accessory itself is frustrating to use. The portion of the case that covers the phone’s volume rocker just isn’t flexible enough, making it hard to press the side of the button that I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aPWMwnSFG9cUNm5sXY4mkVFu444=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427481/jporter_20210407_4514_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four cameras can be found on the rear of the phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2jiC5QQ2yPQebKxAj8Ouwryx7sw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429447/jporter_20210407_4514_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X20’s compostable case can get in the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ocu1RH"&gt;The speed and performance of the phone was generally fine, but I saw the occasional hitch while switching quickly between apps, which made me question how this phone will perform after three years of OS updates. Otherwise, I didn’t have any problems with performance in everyday usage. The X20 supports Sub-6GHz 5G, which won’t matter much to you now but could in three years’ time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEqPvf"&gt;You can find a selection of photo samples below, but in my time with the phone I was underwhelmed by the Nokia X20’s camera performance. The phone has a total of four rear cameras: a 64-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel depth sensor, and a 2-megapixel macro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iNN54U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10434509"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KPiu28"&gt;Performance in daylight is broadly fine, but when things are more dimly lit you quickly start to lose detail and definition. Neither the ultrawide camera nor the macro camera have the resolution to take decent photographs, and the 2-megapixel macro camera in particular is a pointless and puzzling inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1BPaJ"&gt;HMD’s Nokia X20 can’t make any big claims about being a flagship hit, but its modest price tag and HMD’s promises about continued support could make it a safe, dependable smartphone if that’s what you’re after.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Could a ‘Crypto Climate Accord’ erase cryptocurrencies’ carbon footprint?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bitcoin Mining at Russian CryptoUniverse Farm" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t0Q8Qh4pgSVW7VZwDrC2WYzUTVg=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69095094/1231874962.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Bitcoin Mining at Russian CryptoUniverse Farm | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=editorial&amp;amp;photographer=Bloomberg" target="_blank"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;Contributor via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v1dyyy"&gt;A newly announced “&lt;a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/"&gt;Crypto Climate Accord&lt;/a&gt;” aims to erase cryptocurrencies’ legacy of climate pollution. That’s a tall order considering the enormous amounts of energy that the most popular cryptocurrencies — bitcoin and Ethereum — consume. The loose goals laid out in the plan so far face potentially insurmountable challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UYwtQR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A 2040 target for the crypto industry to reach “net zero” emissions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bYqRNd"&gt;The “accord” is led by the private sector — not governments — and outlines a few preliminary objectives. It seeks to transition all blockchains to renewable energy by 2030 or sooner. It sets a 2040 target for the crypto industry to reach “net zero” emissions, which would involve reducing pollution and turning to strategies that might be able to suck the industry’s historical carbon dioxide emissions out of the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pA3rq4"&gt;Lastly and perhaps most realistically, it aims to develop an open-source accounting standard that can be used to consistently measure emissions generated by the crypto industry. They also want to develop software that can verify how much renewable energy a blockchain uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHSVD6"&gt;If achieved, those goals would solve a very real problem. Bitcoin alone has roughly the same &lt;a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption"&gt;carbon footprint&lt;/a&gt; annually as Hong Kong, while &lt;a href="https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption"&gt;Ethereum’s annual carbon emissions&lt;/a&gt; rival Lithuania’s. Their climate pollution is growing even as scientists’ research warns that global emissions need to be cut almost in half this decade to avoid the worst effects of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NINzFu"&gt;The accord has support from some influential names in climate action and the crypto industry — including cryptocurrency company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196064/ripple-sec-cryptocurrency-security-currency-xrp"&gt;Ripple&lt;/a&gt;, blockchain technology conglomerate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/20/18150036/consensys-layoffs-employees-pending-startup-ethereum"&gt;Consensys&lt;/a&gt;, billionaire climate crusader &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21030422/tom-steyer-fossil-fuels-2020-democratic-debate-candidate-billionaire"&gt;Tom Steyer&lt;/a&gt;, and the United Nations-appointed “&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/climate-action/marrakech-partnership/actors/meet-the-champions"&gt;climate champions&lt;/a&gt;.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwkCED"&gt;While tackling the environmental damage done by the crypto industry might be a worthy challenge, critics say the broad goals are unlikely to result in meaningful change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxHSGD"&gt;“Some things just can’t be fixed,” says economist Alex de Vries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="u8GCVz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Some things just can’t be fixed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ghkaIx"&gt;Unfortunately for the Crypto Climate Accord, bitcoin is the biggest player in the game, and it’s likely to cause the accord the most trouble because of how much energy it uses. Bitcoin is purposely inefficient — which is a problem renewables can’t fix. It uses a model called “proof of work” to keep its ledgers secure. “Miners” who verify transactions to get new coins do so by using energy-guzzling machines to solve increasingly difficult puzzles. (Ethereum also uses proof of work but has said for years that it will eventually transition to another model.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="syPL3R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The climate controversy swirling around NFTs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0NOgGG"&gt;Those machines will continue to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S254243511930087X"&gt;compete for renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; with arguably more essential needs, like keeping the power on in people’s homes. And if cryptocurrencies increase electricity demand beyond available renewable resources, utilities might turn to fossil fuels. That’s why cleaning up energy sources &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; increasing energy efficiency are two sides of the same coin when it comes to tackling climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwX6e2"&gt;Regardless, the accord’s founders are optimistic about a greener future for bitcoin. “I’ve been in conversation with folks from the bitcoin ecosystem, it’s a pretty simple pitch,” says Jesse Morris, chief commercial officer of the nonprofit Energy Web Foundation, which is spearheading the initiative. “If we can make bitcoin green, it will be much easier and lower risk for other organizations to come in and buy more Bitcoin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="m1s6Pu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If we can make bitcoin green, it will be much easier and lower risk for other organizations to come in and buy more bitcoin.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yj0BVI"&gt;Bitcoin still accounts for &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/06/cryptocurrency-market-cap-tops-2-trillion-for-the-first-time.html"&gt;more than half&lt;/a&gt; of the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization. But it is facing competition from newer cryptocurrencies that have found ways to be greener. Other cryptocurrencies use different blockchain technology than bitcoin and consume very little energy in comparison as a result. For those cryptocurrencies, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22203761/coinbase-halts-trading-xrp-ripple-sec-suit"&gt;Ripple’s XRP&lt;/a&gt;, running on renewables could be more feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3mRUF"&gt;And while renewable energy costs have fallen dramatically, luring bitcoin miners to places with abundant renewable energy would likely require heavy subsidies to keep them from turning to cheaper, dirtier fuel sources, de Vries says. “Just the sound of that — It sounds really wrong,” he says. “Why would you want to subsidize an industry that uses energy just because it is set up to waste resources?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zCtLU"&gt;The new crypto accord, however, is “not about coming together and asking for subsidy by any means,” says Morris. “We just want to get everybody together and start nailing the action here.” Many blockchains, like bitcoin, were designed to be a decentralized system with no top-down oversight. So getting everyone on board, even within a single blockchain, will be a huge task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2Km7G"&gt;The accord’s objectives are supposed to be fleshed out and finalized by the time a big United Nations climate conference rolls around in November. But Morris admits that the initial plans chase big aspirations rather than fine details. “So many of these other decarbonization efforts are very much thinking their way into acting,” Morris says. “Whereas in Crypto, because it’s kind of the Wild West, it’s about acting our way into new thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eE1JfA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Stack is a clever, if incomplete, way to digitize and organize documents</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ywVR9crm5VpQlegQK898DzCFL5o=/107x0:1292x790/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69094834/Screen_Shot_2021_03_30_at_9.01.49_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFlbaC"&gt;Having to deal with paperwork is a real pain, whether it’s hardcopy or digital. Tax documents, explanations of benefits from insurance companies, purchase receipts, prescriptions, bills, vaccination cards — the list of daily paperwork goes on and on. And of course, when you suddenly need to find that receipt for your two-year-old laptop, it’s nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkbTTF"&gt;Google’s latest experimental app, &lt;a href="https://stack.area120.com/"&gt;Stack&lt;/a&gt;, is meant to help make that part of your life easier. A product of Google’s Area 120 incubator, Stack is designed to be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; place where you can keep PDF copies of all those documents. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358088/google-stack-ai-document-scanner-app-android-release-announce"&gt;mentioned in our initial article&lt;/a&gt;, Stack borrows the technology underlying Google’s &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/document-ai"&gt;powerful DocAI enterprise tool&lt;/a&gt; for document analysis so it can organize them into categories — or, in Google-speak, stacks — and allow you to search for words within the text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNiCZD"&gt;I have a lot of papers to keep organized. To keep their digital copies stored and accessible, I use a combination of Google Drive, Evernote, and a &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appxy.tinyscanner&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;PDF-creating app called Tiny Scanner&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not an ideal solution, so when Google came out with a document scanning / organizing app, I thought I’d see what this Stack was all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MVoP4M"&gt;Bring in the Stacks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IidSYa"&gt;First, a note: currently, Stack is only available on Android devices and can only be installed using a personal Gmail account, not a Google Workplace (formerly called G Suite) account. However, once you install the app, you can access documents saved on any of your Google Drive accounts, including Workspace accounts. This kind of confusion won’t be new to anyone who has to deal with juggling multiple Google accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfcoZc"&gt;When you first open Stack, you are presented with a series of icons representing a variety of stacks, including Bills, Banking, House, IDs, Medical, Receipts, and Starred. If none of those suit your needs, you can click on an Edit link at the top right, and you are shown other stacks having to do with taxes, immigration, vehicles, and other categories, which you can add to your top-level stacks. You can also create your own stack by tapping on a plus button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You organize your documents into stacks." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TQKeg93Wy7Osym9oOemY8OVxp2U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427840/stacka.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You organize your documents into stacks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can select different stacks, or create your own." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pioco_nNhUPgEfiVOZbBkWoTtXU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427839/stacke.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can select different stacks or create your own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7BYiRp"&gt;At the bottom of the main screen are two tabs: “Home” (the initial screen where you can see your stacks) and “All documents” (where you can see and search on all your saved documents without the “stack” organization).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xV9k8"&gt;To start adding documents, you press the plus symbol on the home screen. You are presented with three ways to populate Stack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2zrtXH"&gt;PDF: pull in an existing PDF from any Google Drive account or from your device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8LcuWV"&gt;Gallery: find a recently photographed image on your device &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hAidLo"&gt;Camera: use your device’s camera to scan a document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="PXFoYu"&gt;I’ve got a lot of documents sitting in Google Drive, so I thought I’d start by using the PDF method to import documents. I was disappointed to find that I could only import one document at a time — which means it would take me a very long time to bring in my entire history of PDFs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTvPy3"&gt;The Gallery method was also not especially useful since it only gave me access to about a month and a half of the photos on my device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can add an existing PDF or scan one using your phone’s camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vsz5_saiwmNuHU_YImHkjfA22IA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427843/stackf__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can add an existing PDF or scan one using your phone’s camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are basic edit features for the PDF." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m1tZ5hfm4GQi5gcZfhGN77FgYpk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427857/stack_preview_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are basic edit features for the PDF.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KE6V6E"&gt;On the other hand, using my phone’s camera to scan a document from within Stack worked nicely. The document is previewed before saving and you can adjust the color, crop it, and rotate it, if necessary. You can also add additional pages, so that you can have a document of more than one page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6lZaM"&gt;Whichever way I imported a document, I was impressed with how well Stack incorporated it. The app creates the name of the document from its content, isolates important details such as date and amount of purchase, and uses the content to decide which stack it should go in. For example, it correctly identified a document that had information about the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html"&gt;CDC’s v-safe app&lt;/a&gt; as being from the CDC and placed it in the Medical stack. And when I photographed a very crumpled store receipt, it picked out the retailer’s name and the amount of the purchase without any perceivable difficulty and put the document in my Receipts stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84v6Sm"&gt;You don’t have to depend on the app to decide which stack the document goes in. You can assign a document to a stack by going to the “All documents” tab and then selecting the document in question; its stacks are listed below the image, and you can add or remove them there. And yes, you can assign a single document to more than one stack, if you want — for example, I put the CDC document in both my Medical and Starred stacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltb8cn"&gt;What you can’t do is create sub-stacks (or sub-folders) within a stack. You can’t tag a document, either. So, for example, if you’re collecting a lot of medical documents from different doctors, you have to put them all in the Medical stack and do a search for the document you need or create a separate stack for each doctor. Hopefully, as this experimental app is worked on, some additional organizational tools will be added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rt38Fi"&gt;On the other hand, doing a search (by going to “All documents”) will usually find what you need. As could be expected from a Google app, the search works very well; most of my searches were successful in finding text within the PDF documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Stack’s AI pulled out data even from a crumpled receipt." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kllF5xUnYw0biW6nFvpScyGvFbs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427968/stack_harde.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stack’s AI pulled out data even from a crumpled receipt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can search for content from within the PDF." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7aI4kUun2cHwdbvnOokFAPtFYyM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427859/stack_search.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can search for content from within the PDF.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K14UHE"&gt;If you go to the Settings page (which is accessible from your personal icon), you can have the app automatically import any photos of documents that you take with your device. You can also automatically save all your PDFs to your Google Drive (which is an excellent idea since Stack is experimental and could very easily end up in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning"&gt;Google Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;). And if you decide Stack isn’t for you, then you can export all existing documents to your Drive and delete all your data from Stack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IbdMnK"&gt;Privacy and security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="N4SZul"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/area-120/stack/"&gt;Google’s description of the app&lt;/a&gt;, “Stack uses Google’s advanced security and sign-in technology to protect your documents.” You can also require a face or fingerprint lock to access the app — a good idea if you’re planning to include any sensitive documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugSOr1"&gt;How much that protects your documents from Google itself is, as always, up for question. In order to use Stack, you are agreeing to Google’s Terms of Service (which you’ve probably agreed to before anyway, if you have a Gmail account) and Privacy Policy (same). You are also asked to allow the app to access photos and media on your device and to take pictures and record video (while using the app, only this time, or deny). Both of these permissions are optional, but if Stack can’t access media or take photos, it probably won’t be very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKTdc1"&gt;So is Stack a viable option for those of us who are trying to track life’s paperwork? As far as I’m concerned, it’s not quite there yet — because it’s so early in its development and because I’ve become a little cynical about Google’s tendency to abandon its experiments, I’m not ready to trust all my important papers to Stack. But it has a lot of potential, and I’m going to keep an eye on it. &lt;/p&gt;
