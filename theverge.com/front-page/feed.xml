    <title>Twitter is making live video quality better by removing one feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ul7y1O4h_m2BgMRyiWblv12J5kQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69956896/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AWfFIW"&gt;Twitter announced Tuesday that it’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1445415924564176901"&gt;dropping a feature&lt;/a&gt; from its live broadcasts tool, but the company is removing it in service of making your video broadcast quality better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jt3cM7"&gt;What’s gone? Now, you aren’t able to invite guests to join you in a broadcast via audio ahead of going live. That feature was added in March 2020. Now, when you go live, your broadcast will just feature you and whoever else happens to be in the frame, though people can still post in the chat or tap to add a heart to interact with you while you’re broadcasting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HDkQTE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As of today we’re removing the option to invite guests when you go live, so we can improve your video broadcast quality.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your viewers can still interact with you through chat and hearts. &lt;a href="https://t.co/bymoq55VIy"&gt;https://t.co/bymoq55VIy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1445415924564176901?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3hTSVx"&gt;Although Twitter says the change is intended to improve video quality, it’s also worth noting that Twitter has another feature for shared live audio: its Clubhouse-like Spaces offering. Spaces seem to have caught on more than what Twitter live video used to let you do, so perhaps the company thought it would be redundant to offer both and is focusing on the feature that seems to have more traction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4G1bD"&gt;The change also follows another to improve video quality on the platform: in September, it announced that new videos posted to the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692348/twitter-video-quality-less-pixelated"&gt;would be less pixelated&lt;/a&gt;. I haven’t noticed a drastic difference yet, but I’ll take any improvement Twitter can make.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It just got much easier to find your lost AirPods Pro or AirPods Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wiEaheHIUyePl5myAyfcl8nUEuA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69956595/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ynre3Q"&gt;Apple today released a firmware update for its AirPods Pro and AirPods Max that introduces new options for finding the pricey products if you happen to misplace them. These capabilities were first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"&gt;promised for iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; but didn’t quite make the launch; thankfully, it didn’t take Apple much longer after that to roll them out. Both &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/05/apple-rolling-out-new-find-my-features-for-airpods-pro-and-airpods-max/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/05/airpods-firmware-find-my-updates/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported on today’s release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CF4dO"&gt;Using Apple’s Find My app, it was already possible to view the location where your AirPods were last paired with your iPhone or play a sound to make them easier to dig out of the couch cushions. But this new update greatly expands that functionality. Now you can activate Lost Mode and have millions of other iPhones, iPads, and Macs aid in the search should your AirPods Pro or AirPods Max go missing. If they come within Bluetooth range of another Apple device, you’ll be alerted to their location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hoGMMd"&gt;Apple has also added an AirTags-like “Find Nearby” user interface for tracking down a set of AirPods Pro or AirPods Max if you know they’re somewhere close. Since there’s no U1 chip inside Apple’s earbuds or headphones, it’s not quite as precise as with an AirTag; you don’t see the arrows pointing you towards them, but the onscreen prompts will show statuses like far, near, or “here” when you’re right near them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAYsXz"&gt;Also super helpful: you can now automatically receive a notification if you leave your AirPods behind somewhere. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210515"&gt;support page on the Find My network&lt;/a&gt; explains the various features and how they work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPau41"&gt;Unfortunately, Apple still doesn’t offer any straightforward way to update AirPods firmware. It just sort of &lt;em&gt;happens &lt;/em&gt;randomly when they’re connected to your iPhone. But you can at least check what version you’ve got to see if you’ve got these latest features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="B0cZUY"&gt;Go to Settings on your iPhone or iPad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uBfxAq"&gt;Tap General, then About&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="612SpH"&gt;Choose AirPods, and in there, you should see a “firmware version” field. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="giiE1G"&gt;The new update that offers the improved Find My capabilities is version 4A400, so look for that. As for the regular AirPods, they’re still limited to the more basic functionality that was present before. But whenever the long-rumored third-generation AirPods make their debut, hopefully those will also offer the more robust location tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alexa will now let you take longer to ask a question</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_QtNB_3zwqHKU5eu1P75YcS3mqw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69956579/dseifert_201020_4247_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJgjZo"&gt;Amazon has added a valuable new feature to Alexa: you can now opt to have more time to finish your statement or question before Alexa responds to you. The feature could be useful if you wish you had a bit longer before Alexa replied to what you were saying, but it’s also a useful accessibility feature, particularly for people with speech impediments who may need more time to say something. If you want to enable this, you can turn it on in the Alexa app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9BMbG"&gt;The company has also added the ability for Android users to type requests in the Alexa app. This feature might be handy for when you don’t want to use your voice to ask Alexa a question, but it too could be a boon for accessibility. This feature, which was first added to the iOS version of the Alexa app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22149147/amazon-text-with-alexa-ios-public-preview-voice-assistant"&gt;in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;, is in public preview for users in the US. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22149147/amazon-text-with-alexa-ios-public-preview-voice-assistant"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15648472/google-assistant-keyboard-input-announced-io-2017"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; each offer similar functionality for their respective digital assistants.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is reportedly working on a smart fridge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g9EKchMY4L6FLkL9MoQnlKskg8Y=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69956487/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QSze1o"&gt;Amazon might be working on its own smart fridge, according to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-is-building-smart-fridge-that-monitors-your-buying-patterns-2021-10"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "Project Pulse," as the project is titled internally, is reportedly being developed by the same Amazon "physical-stores unit" that worked on the company's &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/5/13842592/amazon-go-new-cashier-less-convenience-store"&gt;high-tech Amazon Go stores&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQEctK"&gt;Project Pulse "is designed to track your inventory and purchase habits, predict what you want, and have it delivered," &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; writes. The fridge could also track expiration dates, suggest recipes based on the products in your fridge, and offer an easy way to order more food from an Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods grocery store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yVh5z0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon already introduced a microwave — why not a fridge?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bYC4hR"&gt;Amazon's foray into fridges has apparently been in the works for at least two years, &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; says, under the leadership of Gopi Prashanth, "a director of computer and artificial intelligence." There's no telling if or when Amazon will introduce the product, but it will likely partner with other manufacturers if it does, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIj0AHUpYrRcMlSLWVXiLsgn8-w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19568996/Family_Hub_CES2020_Black__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung, LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung and LG’s smart fridges from CES 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ejcxrT"&gt;Smart fridges aren't a new idea. Samsung and LG &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/2/21046822/samsung-lg-smart-fridge-family-hub-instaview-thinq-ai-ces-2020"&gt;have both offered appliances&lt;/a&gt; that can identify food, connect to digital assistants like Bixby, and in some cases, even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/5/10708380/samsung-family-hub-fridge-mastercard-app-groceries-ces-2016"&gt;easily order more groceries&lt;/a&gt;. If it really is working on a fridge, Amazon's value add would be its network of grocery stores and the work already done using computer vision to identify grocery items in Amazon Go convenience stores and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21323421/amazon-dash-cart-smart-grocery-shopping-woodland-hills-store-cashierless"&gt;Dash carts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mygIGK"&gt;Like other product categories &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701965/amazon-fitbit-ecobee-basics-design-halo-view-smart-thermostat-clone-ripoff-regulators"&gt;the company has barged into&lt;/a&gt; (most recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692248/amazon-smart-thermostat-price-ambient-computer-alexa-preorder"&gt;thermostats&lt;/a&gt;), Amazon is also well positioned to undercut its competitors on price and easily integrate another smart home device into its ecosystem after years of development on Alexa. "We don't comment on rumors or speculation," an Amazon spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EFcdJ"&gt;Take this report with a grain of salt, of course. Amazon is big and well-resourced enough to try plenty of things and never release them. Leaks and rumors related to Amazon's product ambitions have also been hit or miss. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691287/amazon-echo-alexa-devices-wall-mounted-soundbar-auto-robot"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; predicted&lt;/a&gt; the company wouldn't announce its long-awaited robot at its fall hardware event, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;it ultimately did&lt;/a&gt; — stoking possible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22699916/amazon-astro-home-robot-camera-surveillance-device"&gt;privacy concerns&lt;/a&gt;, among plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22675512/amazon-astro-robot-emotion-pets-anki-vector"&gt;other reactions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grFNoh"&gt;There's no telling what Amazon will do, but this is the company that surprised everyone with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882140/amazon-basics-microwave-alexa-2018-smart-features-price-release-date"&gt;an Alexa-enabled microwave&lt;/a&gt;, so what's another appliance? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/18/14308352/amazon-echo-refrigerator-reorders-groceries"&gt;We've already asked for it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCU49l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0EMlTF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Windows 11 launch event is a ‘6D musical experience’ with a free NFT</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ikhuxCq9U8YXZs-KsgImrXzDTzk=/105x0:1068x642/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69956455/IymeorV.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8GmTVs"&gt;Microsoft is launching Windows 11 virtually today, and the company is promising a “first-of-its-kind 6D streaming event,” featuring Allen Stone and Tate McRae. I’m not entirely sure what a “6D musical experience” is, but &lt;a href="https://elevenation.eluv.io/ms"&gt;Microsoft’s website promises&lt;/a&gt; multiple camera views during its stream and even a free Windows 11 NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agat7e"&gt;Microsoft describes its Windows 11 NFT as a “one-of-a-kind cryptographic token that lives in your digital wallet and unlocks valuable experiences and rewards.” Again, I’m not sure what valuable experiences and rewards this will unlock, but we’ll find out at 8PM ET / 5PM PT when the &lt;a href="https://elevenation.eluv.io/ms"&gt;Windows 11 launch stream&lt;/a&gt; goes live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="seyDRN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Bringing to you the launch of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Windows11?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Windows11&lt;/a&gt; straight from Burj Khalifa tonight! Stay tuned while we reveal the latest features and updates available to you from Windows. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ANr3kPpX6j"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ANr3kPpX6j&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Microsoft UAE (@MicrosoftUAE) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MicrosoftUAE/status/1445072333392207878?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oq17iM"&gt;Windows launch events typically happen in New York City, but Microsoft hasn’t held any in-person events since the pandemic began. Instead, Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/10/5/22711189/microsoft-windows-11-ice-cream-free-mikey-likes-it-nyc"&gt;giving away free Windows 11 ice cream&lt;/a&gt;, airing commercials on the screens at Times Square, and has even lit up the iconic Burj Khalifa hotel in Dubai with Windows 11 branding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nnuHL"&gt;Windows 11 technically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709166/microsoft-windows-11-release-download-available"&gt;launched yesterday on October 4th&lt;/a&gt;, as Microsoft started its rollout of the new OS a little early. New devices launch today with Windows 11 preinstalled, and Microsoft expects all existing eligible Windows 10 devices to be offered the free Windows 11 upgrade by mid-2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Now all of Battlefield 2042’s next-gen digital editions include cross-gen access</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6nn6tUAKcot57owHJSsJQGa7I4k=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69956068/RevealScreenshot_15_VistaBorderline_3840x2160_NoLogo.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: EA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DplA7l"&gt;EA is making &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; a little bit more accessible across generations. The company &lt;a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Battlefield-Announcements/Cross-Gen-Bundle-Added-to-the-Digital-Standard-Edition-for/m-p/10802679#M525"&gt;announced Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that the digital Standard Edition of &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S now includes the Cross-Gen Bundle, which gives you access to both the PS4 and the PS5 or Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S versions of the game. Previously, the Cross-Gen Bundle was only available with the more expensive digital Gold and Ultimate editions of &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Aj1jO"&gt;It’s important to note that this cross-gen benefit has only been added to the digital Standard Editions for next-gen consoles. If you buy the digital Standard Edition on PS4 or Xbox One, where it is $10 cheaper than it is on the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S, you won’t get the Cross-Gen Bundle. The Cross-Gen Bundle is also not an option for any physical copy of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="07B6uD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The game supports full cross progression&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UuRvhY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; supports full cross progression, though, so no matter where you play it, as long as you’re playing on profiles that connect to the same EA Account, your progress will carry over. If you’re considering picking up a next-gen console in the future but want to start playing &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; on your PS4 or Xbox One before you do, you might want to pick up the next-gen digital Standard Edition so that you have free access to the next-gen version of the game down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nv2ruT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; will be released on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676330/battlefield-2042-release-date-delay"&gt;November 19th&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to try it ahead of launch, EA is &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/open-beta?utm_campaign=bf2042_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_tw-open-beta&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cid=70479&amp;amp;ts=1633462226611"&gt;hosting a beta&lt;/a&gt; that runs from October 6th through the 9th. People who preordered the game or are an EA Play member will be able to play it first, starting on October 6th at 3AM ET. The beta will open up for everyone on October 8th at 3AM ET. More details can be found in &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/faq"&gt;this FAQ on EA’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scroll is shutting down in ‘approximately’ 30 days to become part of Twitter Blue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aT03Xi3ua5C22hXDbc_fLTlIdxg=/55x0:1369x876/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955763/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_2.45.15_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="skBV0d"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21111865/scroll-ad-free-website-subscription-launches"&gt;Scroll’s ad-free subscription web service&lt;/a&gt; is shutting down as an independent entity in “approximately” 30 days, the company announced in an email to subscribers. The service — which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22417852/twitter-buying-scroll-subscription-service-news-revue-newsletter"&gt;purchased by Twitter earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; — will instead be rolled into the burgeoning Twitter Blue premium subscription as “Ad-Free Articles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrPSNb"&gt;In its current form, &lt;a href="https://scroll.com/sites"&gt;Scroll is a $5-per-month service&lt;/a&gt; that offers ad-free browsing to hundreds of websites, including &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;, G/O Media, &lt;em&gt;USA Today, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Vox Media — which, full disclosure, includes &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; It works by using a combination of third-party cookies and browser extensions to stop websites from showing ads to paid subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VkR4B5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Aw man, Twitter is shutting down Scroll. It was a great little service that let me read The Verge, The Atlantic, and so many other sites ad-free while contributing dollars to journalism via my attention. Bring on Twitter Blue I guess &lt;a href="https://t.co/AP9G8GEIiG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/AP9G8GEIiG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Casey Newton (@CaseyNewton) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1445457953285234689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uTq31c"&gt;Scroll was bought by Twitter in May, at which point it stopped accepting new sign-ups while the company figured out its plans for the ad-free service; today’s announcement that Scroll’s service will be added to Twitter Blue seems to provide the answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfQzvq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue"&gt;Twitter Blue&lt;/a&gt; currently offers a variety of bonus features for the service, including an “undo send” feature for quickly retracting your tweets, a bookmarks folder for grouping and saving tweets, and a reader mode that converts long threads into a single, cohesive block of text. It also adds some cosmetic changes, including color themes and custom app icons. But the addition of Scroll’s ad-free service would mark one of the biggest features to come to Twitter Blue yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="if5IiU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Scroll makes hundreds of websites ad-free for $5 per month","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21111865/scroll-ad-free-website-subscription-launches"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hW6o6J"&gt;There’s not a lot of details in Scroll and Twitter’s announcement of what the changeover will look like, practically speaking. The two companies have yet to clarify how existing Scroll customers will transition over to Twitter Blue (assuming there’s a direct path to switch at all), when Scroll’s service will be available on Twitter Blue, or even a concrete day that the standalone service’s shutdown will be. The company is promising more information in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_VaR_OyLv0FwONnmd_gXIqkwP-I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903140/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_3.06.46_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1445457953285234689" target="_blank"&gt;Casey Newton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sg9WSM"&gt;Also absent from the news is any information on price and availability. One of the selling points for Scroll was that its $5-per-month fee would go (at least in part) towards funding the journalism that subscribers read: Scroll kept $1.50, while the other $3.50 per month was divvied up amongst sites based primarily on how much a reader was reading them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CPMJ0"&gt;Twitter hasn’t said if it’ll be changing that price, either — currently, Twitter Blue is only available in Australia and Canada for $3.49 CAD or $4.49 AUD, with a rumored $2.99 price tag for the US. Adding Scroll in its current form to that service without raising the price would mean a big change in how sites get paid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VqFNH"&gt;Additionally, Twitter Blue is currently only available in Australia and Canada so far, meaning that unless the service expands greatly in the next month, it could be some time before existing Scroll customers are able to get back their ad-free experience — assuming that Twitter’s implementation of its “Ad-Free Articles” is still the same Scroll experience. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook runs the coward’s playbook to smear the whistleblower</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lp8PQWck4HjdiQflrj_DbqM-I68=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955721/acastro_072121_4674_zuckerberg_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge Photo by Justin Sullivan / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="peMMK1"&gt;Facebook has chosen to respond to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;whistleblower Frances Haugen&lt;/a&gt; in the most cowardly way possible: by hiding Mark Zuckerberg, the man ultimately responsible for Facebook’s decisions, and beginning the process of trying to smear and discredit Haugen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vwnAk"&gt;This is some Big Tobacco bullshit — precisely what sleazeball PR guru &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1996/05/wigand199605"&gt;John Scanlon was hired&lt;/a&gt; to do when Jeffrey Wigand blew the whistle on tobacco company Brown and Williamson. Scanlon’s task was to change “the story of B&amp;amp;W to a narrative about Wigand’s personality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlD9pd"&gt;Of course, that strategy “backfired completely,” &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair &lt;/em&gt;reported in 2004. It probably won’t work here, either. One senator, Edward Markey of Massachusetts, has already called Haugen “a 21st-century American hero,” adding that “our nation owes you a huge debt of gratitude.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BLhed7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Zuckerberg has decided he is above it; he is on vacation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8e8Pug"&gt;Like Wigand, Haugen has receipts: internal documents and data from Facebook’s own researchers, all of which make for serious and supported claims about the platform’s harms and choices the company made to maximize profit and engagement in ways that would increase those harms. It is possible to contend with her allegations on the merits, but Facebook is too immoral for that — and Zuckerberg has decided he is above it, instead going on vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hz03cc"&gt;Let’s read through today’s Facebook statement on the Haugen hearing together, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQ1HANMS4-1633458071.281500-thread-list-threads-flexpane_1633458212.282000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook PR: “Today a Senate Commerce subcommittee held a hearing with a former product manager at Facebook who worked for the company for less than two years, had no direct reports, never attended a decision-point meeting with C-level executives — and testified more than six times to not working on the subject matter in question.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jrmxUj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Translation: Today, a peon testified in Congress; she is too unimportant to name&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nl4rSf"&gt;Translation: Today, a peon testified in Congress; she is too unimportant to name. Nothing she says is worthwhile because she is not fancy enough. And even though she had access to multiple internal research documents supporting her claims, you can’t trust her testimony on them — despite her subject matter expertise and years of experience in the field — because she didn’t write them herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QugElG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook PR: “We don’t agree with her characterization of the many issues she testified about.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tLFIq"&gt;Translation: We think she’s lying but won’t say how, or about what, specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="thB4GR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook PR: “Despite all this, we agree on one thing; it’s time to begin to create standard rules for the internet. It’s been 25 years since the rules for the internet have been updated, and instead of expecting the industry to make societal decisions that belong to legislators, it is time for Congress to act.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Oh95FV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If Facebook had evidence, it would show it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AA46W3"&gt;Translation: It is time to change the subject to something we like better, even though Haugen herself said Facebook is presenting false choices when it comes to privacy and free speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6pplnp"&gt;Now, let’s all notice what’s missing. Though Facebook disputes Haugen’s characterizations of the research in question, it doesn’t provide its own interpretation. Nor does it engage any of the claims Haugen makes — which are, incidentally, supported by internal Facebook research Haugen provided. If Facebook had evidence, it would show it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sg0QRD"&gt;After seeing this statement, the guy who was once Haugen’s boss’s boss, Samidh Chakrabarti, backed Haugen. Her concerns are real, he said. And as Facebook’s Civic Integrity Lead, he &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have direct reports and sat in on C-suite conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tZiz5U"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Well I was there for over 6 years, had numerous direct reports, and led many decision meetings with C-level execs, and I find the perspectives shared on the need for algorithmic regulation, research transparency, and independent oversight to be entirely valid for debate. &lt;a href="https://t.co/UT54vcsWzX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/UT54vcsWzX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Samidh (@samidh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/samidh/status/1445490555740250120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fqUK21"&gt;But the funniest part is the absence of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO and the only shareholder with the power to replace himself. Zuckerberg started Facebook as a Hot-or-Not clone — which almost certainly would negatively affect teen girls’ self-esteem. (At least he is consistent, I guess.) The decisions Haugen alleges, which put profits ahead of morals, have also enriched him more than anyone else. The buck stops, quite literally, with him. So where is he?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWx2gI"&gt;If the best Facebook can come up with is this disgusting attempt at character assassination, Haugen is telling God’s own truth. We should listen to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvHXjS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 5:21PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;Adds Samidh Chakrabarti’s tweet in support of Frances Haugen.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is giving away free Windows 11 ice cream in NYC today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eRhDEOPTSMNTU-0EUnTbJ5NQPLY=/0x0:4096x2731/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955641/windows11icecream.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberry is a limited edition ice cream at Mikey Likes It.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Mikey Likes It Ice Cream&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JRp864"&gt;Microsoft has teamed up with Mikey Likes It Ice Cream in New York City to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeyLikesItNY/status/1445447586450587651"&gt;give away free frozen dessert&lt;/a&gt; today. The collaboration marks the release of Windows 11 and part of what would normally, before the pandemic, include a Windows launch party in New York City. The “Bloomberry” (not to be confused with Bloomberg) ice cream looks like a frozen mix of the default Bloom Windows 11 wallpaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXrcqj"&gt;The blueberry flavored ice cream is free at &lt;a href="https://mikeylikesiticecream.com/pages/hours"&gt;Mikey Likes It locations&lt;/a&gt; in the East Village and Harlem until stocks freeze up. We’re not sure if there are any entry requirements to getting this Windows 11 ice cream, like having to enable TPM 2.0 at the door, so please get in touch if you have to turn Secure Boot on to get your free ice cream. Please also get in touch if you experience a human Blue Screen of Death (brain freeze) while you devour your blueberry ice cream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pz8ANd7i1qcp47RYMyInUlvS2UA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903089/windows11icecream2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not bad for free ice cream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kj6aBU2m-5vaF-FRIx-xLYSx8Oc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903090/windows11icecream3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yup, it’s definitely Windows 11 ice cream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yX2Gbg"&gt;Free ice cream isn’t the only way Microsoft is celebrating the release of Windows 11 in New York City. The Bloom wallpaper has also graced the famous screens at Times Square today, marking the launch of Windows 11. Microsoft is fond of launching products in New York City, with the company choosing the city for both its Windows 7 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/17/3347088/windows-8-launch-new-york-october-25th"&gt;Windows 8 launches&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/14/9322809/microsoft-surface-pro-4-lumia-950-october-6th-event"&gt;new Windows 10 devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjCWIm"&gt;Windows 11 is available on new devices today or for eligible existing hardware. Microsoft is taking a gradual approach to rolling out this new operating system, but it’s available as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708478/microsoft-windows-11-upgrade-free-os-how-to-download"&gt;free upgrade for eligible Windows 10 devices&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t see the Windows 11 upgrade just yet, there’s even a way to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683953/windows-11-upgrade-how-to-download-install"&gt;skip the line&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TCrG92"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Windows 11 release is Times Square-official   &lt;a href="https://t.co/1ehKWVvJfo"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1ehKWVvJfo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Katie Anderson (@AndeKat101) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndeKat101/status/1445210124281331714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>How to use snap layouts in Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bdslg0JlE-_tthhLPCHZXUj-dAk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955619/Screenshot__73_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FWzwaI"&gt;Windows 11 may not be exactly revolutionary, but there are some features that are just plain useful, and snap layouts are one of them. Replacing the drag-and-drop snap assist feature of Windows 10, snap layouts let you arrange your apps quickly and neatly on your desktop, making it much simpler to see all and use all at once. (Certainly, it’s a lot better than the constant Alt-Tab switching between apps that many of us are used to.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfvLtP"&gt;Here’s how you set it up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qGVfCP"&gt;Hover your cursor over the maximize icon in the upper right corner of an app or press Win-Z. You’ll see four (or six if you have a large monitor) different grid layouts that you can choose from. Each layout will have several zones in a different configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8jgEPt"&gt;Choose a layout and hover over the zone you want your active app to be in. That zone will turn blue; click on it. Your app will then snap into that position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Choose a layout and then the zone you want your active app to be in." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Lm20F4Agx0nLbXI-_wW5apgtUI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902888/Screenshot__70_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose a layout and then the zone you want your active app to be in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="gJaoqr"&gt;If you had other apps open, they may appear as thumbnails in another of the zones. Alt-Tab to each open app, and choose which zone you want that app to be in. You can also simply click on the app if it’s in the zone you want it to be in. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you choose a zone for one app, the others may appear as thumbnails in another zone. Just Alt-Tab to each and choose a zone." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q4Yozv1c-jee48kJ6cnAHcYpBGk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903006/Screenshot__74_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you choose a zone for one app, the others may appear as thumbnails in another zone. Just Alt-Tab to each and choose a zone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5DTPtl"&gt;(Note: Sometimes, while you’re rearranging, one app can overlap the other. If things get confusing, use Alt-Tab to see where each app is or find them in the taskbar.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lo3FAF"&gt;And you’re ready to go!&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snap layouts arranges your windows into a neat grid pattern.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rmxZmG"&gt;Your snap layout will be reflected in the taskbar as well. If you go to the taskbar and hover over the icon for one of the apps in your layout, you will see a thumbnail for both the app and for the layout group it’s part of; you can click on either.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Hover over an apps taskbar icon, and you’ll see both the app alone and its layout grouping." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HlszeAYyXER3kTMDSNahX0RnQ-g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903030/Screenshot__68_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hover over an apps taskbar icon, and you’ll see both the app alone and its layout grouping.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ipK62i"&gt;Need to maximize an app? Just click on the maximize icon. Click on it again, and the app will snap back into its former configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C89aJ0"&gt;Adjust layout settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0YkN0n"&gt;You can adjust the snap layouts by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “System” &amp;gt; “Multitasking.” You have a variety of options that you can enable or disable. For example, you can choose not to have the snap layout feature appear when you hover over the maximize symbol or when you hover over your app icon in the taskbar. You can arrange for the other windows to automatically resize when you manually resize one. And, of course, you can disable the feature entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to the multitasking section in your setup to tweak your snap layout features." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eu4Kc0CaeKBQ5qIWgkoZ7BKR5-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902896/Screenshot__69_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to the multitasking section in your setup to tweak your snap layout features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="81CVH8"&gt;Learn how to use it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FN773E"&gt;When you first start to use snap layouts, it may take a little getting used to, especially when it comes to deciding which app goes where. Once you’re set, however, you may find that snap layouts make it a lot easier to, say, monitor your Twitter or Slack account while working on a document or watching a video. Admittedly, if you have a smaller display, having more than two apps open at the same time could make things a bit crowded, but it’s worth experimenting a bit to see what works for you.&lt;/p&gt;
