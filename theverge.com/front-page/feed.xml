    <title>New York City votes to block new licenses for electric taxis, snubbing Revel’s Tesla plans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n0WradYZChYk7IuLi41Paw7LwRE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69493300/revel_pressimage.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NrBOyH"&gt;New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) voted to block the issuance of new for-hire vehicle licenses for electric vehicles. The move was widely perceived as a snub toward Revel, the company best known for its electric moped-sharing service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22405539/revel-ride-share-nyc-tesla-model-y-moped-uber"&gt;which was planning to launch a ride-hailing service&lt;/a&gt; using a fleet of Tesla vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGoT6h"&gt;Revel announced last April that it planned to launch a ride-hail service in Manhattan with a fleet of 50 Tesla Model Ys. The company had been hoping to exploit a loophole in the city’s current rules, which caps the number of new FHV licenses but exempts wheelchair-accessible and electric vehicles. The cap was originally enacted as a way to stem the tide of new Uber and Lyft vehicles that were flooding the streets. On Tuesday, the TLC voted 5-to-1 remove the exemption for electric vehicles, effectively closing off that pathway for Revel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IU5nvO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The TLC voted 5-1 remove the exemption for electric vehicles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IQIfuX"&gt;Anyone who wants to acquire a new FHV license for an electric vehicle will be subjected to the same semi-annual review process as those with gas-powered cars. And those who already own an FHV license for a gas car are still allowed to transfer those licenses to an electric vehicle if they so choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cooN5x"&gt;“This is one of the moments for which the cap was created — to provide a check and balance for businesses whose strategy is to disrupt the system, adding to congestion and putting profits and growth before the City’s welfare,” TLC Commissioner and Chair Aloysee Heredia Jarmoszuk said in a statement. “The TLC is committed to an all-electric future and our proposed rules would, for the first time, include BEVs in its required biannual analysis of potential need for additional vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnvReP"&gt;Jarmoszuk expanded on the notion during Tuesday’s meeting, characterizing Revel as a venture capital-backed disruptor that will harm yellow taxi drivers and worsen congestion. “It is not sustainable to allow an unlimited number of new vehicles to the road in a city that is all too familiar with the choke of traffic congestion,” Jarmoszuk said, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/06/22/nyc-bans-new-electric-taxi-licenses/"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “What we will not allow is the opportunity for another corporation — venture capitalists or otherwise — to flood our streets with additional cars.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6PCew"&gt;Revel’s pitch to launch a ride-hail service wasn’t just about putting cleaner vehicles on the road. The Brooklyn-based company said it also planned on hiring its drivers as employees, as opposed to classifying them as independent contractors like Uber and Lyft. In a statement, Revel CEO Frank Reig blasted the TLC for its lack of deliberation, claiming the vote was predetermined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1FreNJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The TLC never intended to consider what drivers and New Yorkers had to say”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lQVLEv"&gt;“The TLC never intended to consider what drivers and New Yorkers had to say, and only cared about jamming through this vote on Primary Day with as little scrutiny as possible,” Reig said. “This decision doesn’t change the fact that New York City needs an alternative to the predatory leasing system that exploits drivers and pollutes our environment, and Revel is exploring ways to accomplish that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vxdjf"&gt;The TLC’s vote was baffling to many people who see the environmental benefits of electrifying the city’s for-hire vehicle fleet. Andrew Salzberg, who worked at Uber as director of transportation policy and writes a newsletter about decarbonizing transportation, said he was “surprised” by the commission’s stance on Revel’s plans. In his latest newsletter, &lt;a href="https://decarbonizingtransportation.substack.com/p/new-york-is-proposing-a-rule-that?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo3ODczMzMsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM3ODI3NDk0LCJfIjoiSnh6VTEiLCJpYXQiOjE2MjQ0NTYwNDEsImV4cCI6MTYyNDQ1OTY0MSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTU4MzM0Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.vZGNyyPdq95DzFicDVh0RJyEt0l7Qfup3kwlFxoLhz0"&gt;Salzberg writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="P9ITIa"&gt;It’s reasonable to be skeptical of the chances of success of any individual business model. I can’t predict if Reig and his team at Revel will ultimately build a successful business, and many zero emission vehicle startups have come &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-14/ev-startups-lose-over-40-billion-after-taking-spac-route-public"&gt;crashing back to earth&lt;/a&gt; this year. But Revel is willing to put real money in the ground to build charging infrastructure, pay drivers a reasonable wage, procure dedicated electric vehicles, and try to put a little competitive pressure on Uber and Lyft’s long term plans for zero emission fleets. What’s not to like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="G2fO3t"&gt;The city’s tech industry is also taking shots at the TLC, calling the vote a “step backwards” in the fight against climate change. According to Julie Samuels, executive director of advocacy group Tech: NYC, the commission “sent the message that tackling climate change is not a priority, at a time when virtually all New Yorkers agree we should be doing everything possible to take on this urgent challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Watch Active 4 leaks in new renders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vvVVw5SBRKY_1L2DW0Skm1KOR1k=/1x0:1024x682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69493083/Galaxy_Watch_Active_4_4_1024x576.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The watch will reportedly be available in four colors.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1407653639011905539" target="_blank"&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.giznext.com/news/giznext-exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-5k-renders-details/" target="_blank"&gt;GizNext&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k1LD6y"&gt;Renders of an unannounced smartwatch from Samsung called the Galaxy Watch Active 4 have leaked online, giving us our best look yet at Samsung’s first post-Tizen wearable. The renders, which come from leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1407653639011905539"&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.giznext.com/news/giznext-exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-5k-renders-details/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GizNext&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, show a smartwatch with an edge-to-edge display and two buttons on the right-hand side but no rotating crown or bezel. Samsung is expected to announce the watch on June 28th during an event at which it says it’s “reimagining smartwatches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ov53tQ"&gt;Samsung’s next smartwatch is an important moment for the company. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439989/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-wear-os-tizen-switch"&gt;months of rumors&lt;/a&gt;, the company announced in May that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;it would be merging&lt;/a&gt; the Tizen operating system it’s used previously with Google’s Wear OS to create a new OS tentatively called “Wear.” It’s claimed the new joint effort will mean better battery life and load times, but it should also simplify things for app developers, who’ll need to target fewer operating systems for their software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ilyx0X"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And here comes your very first look at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Samsung?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Samsung&lt;/a&gt;’s upcoming new &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyWatchActive4?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GalaxyWatchActive4&lt;/a&gt; (gorgeous 5K renders + sizes + color options)!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On behalf of new Partner &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GizNext?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GizNext&lt;/a&gt; -&amp;gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/vedhEl4cUO"&gt;https://t.co/vedhEl4cUO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Q6fb4uWLT8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Q6fb4uWLT8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve H.McFly (@OnLeaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1407653639011905539?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3djYvR"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;GizNext&lt;/em&gt;, Samsung’s Watch Active 4 will reportedly be available in black, green, silver, and gold and two sizes: 44mm and 40mm. It’s also said to be running a 5nm processor. However, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-renders-will-make-you-drool/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the watch’s gold color scheme will be more of a rose gold color than what’s shown in the renders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y19dyq"&gt;The renders show a watch that looks like a pretty direct successor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20903452/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-review-fitness-tizen-apps-features-android-price"&gt;2019’s Galaxy Watch Active 2&lt;/a&gt;, which also lacked a rotating bezel for a sleeker look. If these reports are accurate, Samsung appears to have skipped the Watch Active 3 to bring the numbering of its Active lineup of smartwatches into sync with its regular Galaxy Watches. (It released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368752/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Galaxy Watch 3&lt;/a&gt; last year.) &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-watch-4/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the company could announce its Galaxy Watch 4 in August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="khBzt9"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ktnnonline.com/"&gt;KTNN&lt;/a&gt; radio station’s headquarters in St. Michaels, Arizona is less than ten minutes away from the Navajo Nation capital of Window Rock, but its reach encompasses all 27,000 square miles of the Nation across four different states. The station has been broadcasting bilingual content in both the Navajo language, Diné Bizaad, and English for over 35 years. But the station is quiet nowadays — many staff members are working from home if they can. That includes Dee Dixon who, after 15 years at KTNN, had to install internet access to her home an hour and a half away in Dilkon, Arizona so she could broadcast her 6AM show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JcfGnJ"&gt;Her regular listeners are scattered. During the day, KTNN covers the majority of the Navajo Nation across New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah. One can also tune into KTNN’s programming online via livestream from anywhere in the world. It is not the region’s only media. A few regional newspapers cover the reservation extensively, and Navajo Nation is also the only tribe in the country that owns, funds, and operates its own &lt;a href="https://www.navajonationtvandfilm.com/watchnavajo"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt; station. But none of these mediums produce stories primarily in Diné Bizaad: radio is the only way to hear the language in local media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdcbOu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yMbvUKC3kAb3bV53ViYQwYxGBJQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22675137/aponders_210618_4531_0089.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The St Michael’s KTNN building remains in lockdown. Many staff members are working from home if they can.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MponYc"&gt;When the COVID-19 pandemic bore down on Navajo Nation in early 2020, Dixon noticed a distinct divide between her regular listeners at home on the reservation and those outside of it. As Dixon worked on translating public health announcements and taking calls on the air, she noticed an uptick in listeners tuning in from Florida, Maine, Alaska, Louisiana, and Montana. Those callers away from home were hungry for local updates to know what was going on within the Nation — an ambiguous virus that no one understood thoroughly just yet was spreading. People wanted to know if their families were safe and just how transmission was occurring in a place where households are far flung across vast swaths of desert. But Dixon realized as her local listeners, specifically elders, called in that they wanted something different from her: they did not want to hear about the virus whatsoever, no matter how high the rates of infection in Navajo Nation were.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elIvD5"&gt;“According to Navajo tradition, you’re not supposed to give a name to anything that is not good for the reservation,” Dixon says. “The virus was like a monster. Traditionally, the more you talk about something like that, the more you’re inviting it into your home.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="BeHPE8"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="q4XRhY"&gt;Navajo Nation is the second-largest Indigenous tribe in the country with about 300,000 enrolled members, over half of whom live on the reservation. Much of the land is rugged and rural. Of those on the reservation, about 27 percent of households do &lt;a href="https://grist.org/justice/navajo-nation-electricity-power-covid/"&gt;not have electricity&lt;/a&gt;. Cellphone service can be spotty to nonexistent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSwX8G"&gt;But transistor and car radios do not require electricity to function. Radio waves are not dependent on cell towers. In fact, KTNN was the last station in the country licensed for a clear-channel radio signal at &lt;a href="http://www.ktnnonline.com/about.html"&gt;50,000&lt;/a&gt; watts — a strength used in the early 1900s to provide rural America with radio that wouldn’t be vulnerable to interference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f71RBo"&gt;A century later, radio across the Nation is just as vital because of the lack of consistent utility access. Stations that broadcast in Diné Bizaad are the bedrock of everyday Navajo life. And for the &lt;a href="https://navajotimes.com/reznews/data-shows-huge-reduction-in-dine-speakers/#:~:text=Community%20finds%20loss%20of%20Din%C3%A9%20language%20'scary'&amp;amp;text=While%20the%20Navajo%20language%20has,%2C%E2%80%9D%20it's%20considered%20at%20risk."&gt;7,600 people&lt;/a&gt; whose sole language is Diné Bizaad, there is no other option beyond radio to receive news, public health notices, and entertainment — that is the only link to the outside world. That population, whose sole language cannot be heard elsewhere, who are arguably the most vulnerable on the reservation to a lack of information access, were the ones who wanted to hear nothing about a virus that could kill them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LNZpM"&gt;Gallup, New Mexico is often dubbed the &lt;a href="https://galluprealtrue.com/the-real-gallup/gateway-to-native-american-experience"&gt;Gateway to Native America&lt;/a&gt; due to the proximity to a variety of Indigenous lands — the border town’s neighbors include the southeastern quadrant of Navajo Nation, the Zuni Pueblo, and the Hopi Tribe. Downtown Gallup is home to &lt;a href="https://gallupradio.com/"&gt;KYAT-FM&lt;/a&gt;, another full-time Navajo-language radio station that also covers the entirety of the Nation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y8QLYABfQDspCq_ht0XsJ8U9A7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22673581/aponders_210618_4531_0032.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ihVJ3a"&gt;Before the pandemic, KYAT focused on providing information to listeners in Diné Bizaad that included weather, rodeo commentary, and notices for the 110 &lt;a href="https://www.navajo-nsn.gov/history.htm"&gt;chapters&lt;/a&gt;, or designated communities, within Navajo Nation. “We focused on anything that pertained to everyday life on the reservation,” says Sammy Chioda, general manager and president of &lt;a href="https://gallupradio.com/"&gt;Millennium Media&lt;/a&gt;, KYAT’s parent company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJjEAN"&gt;Radio has carved a presence in Navajo life because of a logistical reality: folks spend a great deal of time commuting to go shopping in border towns or to work in them every day. The average Navajo must drive &lt;a href="https://www.pih.org/article/eating-well-grocery-program-takes-navajo-nation"&gt;three hours&lt;/a&gt; round trip to shop for groceries alone. Long daily commutes are reserved for getting up to date on the news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mk9LtT"&gt;When the pandemic began, KYAT realized that listeners’ main concerns were unaddressed by major media outlets. Most early coverage of the pandemic veered toward showing what was happening in major cities, not rural America. KYAT’s program director Deni Gonzales remembers these early days viscerally. “We had callers ask if the virus was contagious to their animals — people have horses, cows, and sheep on their ranches,” Gonzales says. “They asked, ‘Can my cattle get this? Can they give it to me?’ There were so many questions we didn’t have the answers to yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7inj7"&gt;In May 2020, Navajo Nation’s infection rates &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/18/us/navajo-nation-infection-rate-trnd/index.html"&gt;surpassed&lt;/a&gt; New York’s, which had been, until then, the highest in the country. Nearly a year later, just over &lt;a href="https://navajotimes.com/coronavirus-updates/covid-19-across-the-navajo-nation/"&gt;30,000 individuals&lt;/a&gt; have been diagnosed with COVID-19 — roughly 17 percent of Navajo Nation — and 1,258 of those infections have resulted in deaths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mliqmK"&gt;“We always get the bad brunt of that attention,” Chioda says. “One of the things I can’t stand is that sometimes people labeled this as a Navajo problem.” Gonzales reiterates that the publicity of infection rates on the tribe left the community feeling particularly maligned. “The virus is everywhere — when national reporters come, they can give us a big black eye.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWcaYh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZnsqcSye3UiOP3tVrVyI-u39fI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22675131/aponders_210618_4531_9919.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Millennium Media president Sammy Chioda.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XZSkvd"&gt;As the pandemic wore on, survivors called into Dixon’s show wanting to share tips on what common Navajo herbs they believed cured them of the virus. Various DJs at KTNN felt conflicted about allowing audiences to share what, at best, could be cultural remedies or placebos and, at worst, could be dangerous misinformation. Folk home remedies, like putting steak on a bruise, degrade quickly depending on the severity of illnesses. For Dixon, a memory surfaces of a loved one explaining that when they sprained an ankle, they visited a witch doctor who rubbed oil and herbs on their ankle and, thinking they were curing the pain, twisted the ankle further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vyJhKd"&gt;But more harmful suggestions were coming from outside the reservation, much of it motivated by financial gain. In 2020, there was widespread misinformation about ingesting substances like &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/06/does-colloidal-silver-work-covid-19/613177/"&gt;colloidal silver&lt;/a&gt; to cure coronavirus. That visibly took hold in Gallup — the local co-op displayed the blue liquid prominently at checkout during the height of infections. As early as March 2020, then-President Donald Trump was also &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/3/26/21193912/trump-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-treatment"&gt;touting&lt;/a&gt; the benefits of hydroxychloroquine, a drug commonly used for malaria, as a cure to COVID-19 even after the drug was &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/three-big-studies-dim-hopes-hydroxychloroquine-can-treat-or-prevent-covid-19"&gt;debunked&lt;/a&gt; for antiviral usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNiacf"&gt;With misinformation, Dixon chose to take a step back to see a bigger picture. Common herbal remedies in Navajo culture have been used for hundreds of years and are often made of local plants. The recommendations her listeners wanted to share were not necessarily created or promoted to profit off of plight — they were things that residents have been using all of their lives domestically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLasKy"&gt;“I allow survivors to share their recommendations, but I don’t tell people that they need to take these herbs to get better.” For Dixon, letting survivors share their stories was a way for people to stand on a leg of tradition. Local remedies were familiar in the face of something foreign and lethal. It was a way for her community to reach out into the void and care for one another — to fight not just the pandemic, but the isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfBMB6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/svb6Y4hLfU0Sn0pUKnUPP4_cbuU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22673591/aponders_210618_4531_0042.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Signs all over Navajo Nation ask people to remain wary and respectful of the pandemic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="I4qimg"&gt;If one goes on a drive in any direction outside of Gallup, they’ll see the names of the dead. Fluorescent neon poster boards are taped to signs on rural highways with an arrow drawn in the direction of a nearby car. Next to the car, family members are stationed at a folding table, ready to welcome loved ones and receive donations to produce funerals for the recently deceased. Even now as the Nation has taken a massive turnaround with vaccination and cases are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/04/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-cases#the-once-battered-navajo-nation-has-gained-control-of-the-virus-for-now"&gt;dwindling&lt;/a&gt;, any drive — to the pharmacy, grocery store, home — is punctuated with loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2wgWC"&gt;Radio stations like KTNN and KYAT are responsible for the drive-through donation sites. They have broadcast funeral announcements throughout the pandemic, directing far-flung family and friends across the Nation to drop off contributions to honor the dead. Both Chioda and Dixon are used to these everyday announcements and the implications from them — it is a part of their job. “Every time there was a wave, we were hitting 30 to 40 funeral announcements a day,” Dixon says. “As soon as some went out, more would come in.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xaCslD"&gt;When Chioda reflects on the whirlwind effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on local radio, he responds swiftly. “Imagine the pandemic here without radio. People take radio for granted and never realize it until it’s gone. But this is the local medium.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHHxVF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pzoW5zy9huTreb8W15zJ5bslVZg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22673557/aponders_210617_4531_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;KYAT DJ Sammy Boyd reads off PSAs in English and Diné Bizaad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u2x0GT"&gt;Gonzales remembers one particular caller from last year — a woman on Navajo Nation was in a deep depression after her husband passed. She did not want to leave the house, but she tuned into KYAT every day to listen to one specific DJ — his jokes, quips, and music choices. One day, she worked up the nerve to call the station. “That woman told me that he got her through dark times — hearing him every day, it was like he was a friend. That changed her life, and if we did that with one person, how many other people have we done that with that we don’t know about?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xui1F1"&gt;For Dixon, the pandemic was personal. She lost her younger sister to the virus. “My sister was a healthy person and she got sick and she didn’t even last… It took her.” Through tears, Dixon reflects on how losing her sister changed her life — she has started exercising, taking vitamins, and sharing her self-care efforts on the air. The opportunity to broadcast in Diné Bizaad throughout the pandemic, even with the criticism from elders and the ethical dilemma of promoting remedies, came down to reconnecting with her own culture. “A lot of the time, us Navajos forget our roots,” she says. “This made us take a step back to remember where our sacred bundles are, our prayers, our songs, our spiritual beliefs. It brought all of that back to us.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="nnxZsd"&gt;About an hour north of Gallup lies a swath of the Continental Divide on Navajo Nation. It is the midpoint of North America, the spot where rainwater splits to the east or west and flows into bodies of rivers. On the drive, stark-white chapter houses and sprawling ranches lie on either side of the country roads. Veering into the Continental Divide, what locals call The Canyon, the elevation is presented on a sign: 7,530 feet. To the east, red-rock bluffs are so dense with cedar and piñon trees that the rock isn’t visible beneath. To the west, rust-colored sandstone is shaped by the wind into squat hoodoos and natural arches. There is no home in sight. But if you turn the dial to 94.5, KYAT is clear even within the canyon walls: slow-dance country songs play and, in between ballads, a DJ gives updates in Diné Bizaad, for those who need to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDoNvb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to update your PS5 controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Vzm7Rmt5OeBh7_l4n9AqaN-Q7I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69492599/vpavic_4278_20201030_0150.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QvAzVD"&gt;If you’re one of the blessed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407195/sony-ps5-sales-numbers-q4-2020-earnings"&gt;8 million-ish&lt;/a&gt; people who’s been able to get their hands on a PlayStation 5, you’ve probably run into the controller update process at some point. I got mine &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323257/sony-playstation-5-ps5-in-stock-digital-disk-edition-where-buy"&gt;on launch day&lt;/a&gt; (November 12th, 2020), and I’ve had to update the DualSense controller a few times since, as well as when I got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529221/cosmic-red-ps5-controller-hands-on-series-x"&gt;the new red variant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPx71W"&gt;It’s easy, right? Well, maybe not so much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JRV2WD"&gt;Here’s how to update your PS5 controller automatically&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="E2Bpxl"&gt;Wake the PS5 from sleep &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="r63Pe2"&gt;See the text on-screen alerting you to the available controller update, which includes the choices to “Notify After 24 Hours” and “Update Now” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vKRHUb"&gt;Plug in a USB cable (because for some reason you can’t do this wirelessly) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VMJF5o"&gt;Highlight the “Update Now button,” and press X on the controller to update &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="GqEu1Z"&gt;But. If you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; press X at that point — if you press O, say, like I might, because as a long-term resident of Japan I am still getting over the fact that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18255901/ps4-x-o-cross-circle-remap-firmware-6-50-dualshock-4"&gt;not the confirmation button&lt;/a&gt; anymore — you will bring up the PS5’s account login screen, and the update prompt goes away. How do you get it back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDBqlo"&gt;Well, basically you don’t, unless you are willing to delve into unnecessarily convoluted trickery. That’s right. There is no option in the PS5’s settings that will let you manually update the PS5 controller. Waking the console from sleep again doesn’t bring the prompt back and neither does cutting the power altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The PS5 controller update prompt." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hs5CTSKkiDOVtJxGC8NyamvYrCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22666853/JPEG_image.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PS5 controller update prompt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eiDdGM"&gt;As far as we can tell (and judging from the option to “Notify After 24 Hours”), the update prompt is tied to a 24-hour cycle, so you are probably meant to just wait a day and try again. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Tom Warren, however, says he’s managed to force the update on his PS5 a few times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Q72EQ0"&gt;Here’s how to manually update your PS5 controller&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qNS4TJ"&gt;Disconnect from the internet by selecting Settings &amp;gt; Network &amp;gt; Settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eIsBe3"&gt;Skip the internal clock forward by 24 hours by going to Settings &amp;gt; System &amp;gt; Date and Time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ceWSk7"&gt;DualSense firmware updates might not be particularly exciting or even essential, but I’m right there with anyone who’s found this whole process to be a baffling element of the PS5’s software. It’s deeply confusing to be told you need to update something upon booting it, and then find you don’t have any obvious way of doing so by yourself later on — say, when you actually have a USB-C cable to hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AC6ScS"&gt;Hopefully the knowledge that you’re not missing something in the menus — or that you can engage in &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-acnh-guide/2020/3/20/21168240/time-travel-next-day-tomorrow-faster"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;-style time-skipping&lt;/a&gt; as a last resort — gives you some peace of mind the next time you press the wrong button.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These are the few Prime Day deals you can still get</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KT4K48"&gt;Prime Day 2021 is over. Most of the deals that we covered over the past two days are no longer available. You’ll certainly have another guaranteed shot to score similar discounts around Black Friday and Cyber Monday later in the year. However, that doesn’t mean that all of the Prime Day deals have up and disappeared. There are a few leftovers hanging around, and I’m going to point them out to you. You don’t need a Prime membership to access these deals.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony Alpha 1 review: everything nice at an expensive price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Sony’s highest-end camera is a combination of everything that came before it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7raCJ1"&gt;I was quite out of my element when kneeling in the middle of 42nd Street in New York City attempting to photograph Terry Barentsen, professional cyclist, YouTuber, and Twitch streamer. I have never shot a cyclist before, certainly no one as fast as Terry. But Sony’s new flagship camera, the $6,499 Alpha 1 (A1), made this task as easy as shooting the flowers growing outside of my stoop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afkiBT"&gt;The Alpha 1 is comprised of a 50.1-megapixel stacked CMOS sensor, an OLED viewfinder capable of 240fps refresh rate, and a mechanical shutter flash sync up to 1/400th of a second, all in a body that doesn’t look or feel that much different than any other Sony full-frame mirrorless camera. It can shoot 8K video at up to 30fps, make 120 autofocus calculations every second, and shoot 50-megapixel images up 30 times per second, complete with autofocus and auto-exposure. There is very little the Alpha 1 can’t do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FaOKGi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10619212"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rGJcnz"&gt;On paper, the Sony Alpha 1 is fast. But in practice, it somehow feels even faster. The standout capability to me is the 30fps burst mode. In order to reach those lofty capture speeds, you have to have your camera above 1/250 shutter speed, use the electronic shutter mode, and only shoot in either RAW compressed or JPEG format. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMlUbb"&gt;This burst mode also performs best when paired with Sony’s latest lenses that can very quickly move the focusing element within the lens. To test this, I had Terry ride very quickly down busy midtown Manhattan streets. I shot Terry with the 100-400mm Sony G Master lens, which has the latest and greatest linear XD focusing motors in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n97MFM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10618697"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aozWCv"&gt;The Alpha 1’s high-speed autofocus system had no problem finding Terry over 200 feet away and keeping him in focus despite my shaky hands, the moving traffic, and Terry’s fast pace. It almost felt like cheating when my only job was to stomp down on the shutter and keep my subject in frame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pzj4Rk"&gt;There were very few out-of-focus shots, even when Terry was advancing straight at the camera, and I was able to grab well over a hundred photos before buffering got in the way. And because the OLED EVF can refresh up to 240 times each second, my view was never interrupted or lagged. A white box comes up on the screen every time an image is captured in lieu of the sound or screen blackout of a shutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hbQlo"&gt;The 50.1-megapixel images from the A1 are sharp, full of contrast, and true to life. There’s so much resolution to work with that I wish I had shot wider and cropped in after the fact — there’s really very little loss of quality. Even better is the dynamic range I still had with the compressed RAW files. Sony claims the A1 has 15 stops of dynamic range, and when attempting to bring a shadowed figure back, I was able to do so with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axH7i0"&gt;Photos in low light manage to hold on to the deep blacks while not making the image overly grainy. These deep blacks provide a lot less dynamic range in post, but I was able to shoot at 10,000ISO before noticing too much grain in the shadows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uVtZBa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10618716"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qGYgJx"&gt;Video on the Alpha 1 tops out at the very impressive 8K 30fps at 10-bit 4:2:0 H.265. And while Canon’s R5 beat the Alpha 1 to that spec, the Sony does a better job shooting it, simply because it doesn’t overheat as easily. While the camera got warm to the touch, especially during these recent very hot days in NYC, it never stopped recording due to overheating when the heat allowance setting was set to high. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/eO1B9p_p7cE?t=63"&gt;Gerald Undone&lt;/a&gt; did loads of testing on long run 8K video, and in short, this camera doesn’t have the overheating problems of the Canon R5. Instead, it has quick recovery times, no record limits, and with a dummy battery connected to a power source, it can run for many hours straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k3I5NNiXoEYnlphC6GMFTFkSldI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22675203/bfarsace_4642_20210621_0015.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sony Alpha 1 comes with a plethora of ports: ethernet, HDMI A, USB Type-C, Micro USB, and 3.5mm headphones and microphone ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yb0jPmupcrfFafNh4rB__CFPWUc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22675202/bfarsace_4642_20210621_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The button layout on the Alpha 1 will feel similar to other high-end models from Sony.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GM9WcP"&gt;Video can be recorded in the very flat, malleable S-log setting as well as Sony’s S-Cinetone profile for a cinematic look right out of the camera. This profile is limited compared to shooting in log, but overall, it is great for people who are just getting started in video and who are intimidated by scopes, LUTs, and want some color grading training wheels. And it’s even better for the lazy among us who don’t feel like coloring footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54dj2B"&gt;Sony has also made some improvements to the rolling shutter problem of its older mirrorless cameras. Cars no longer appear as if they are made of jello, though at high speeds, I did still see this unwanted effect on trains. Sony has also added a variable shutter option for fine-tuning your shutter speed to avoid flickering lights (or in my case, flickering phone screens). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GRV5i"&gt;Finally, flash photography fans will be very happy with the mechanical shutter’s ability to sync with flashes up to 1/400th of a second. I am not a big user of flash, but this is a big deal since 1/250th of a second has been the industry standard for a while, and this is two-thirds of a stop faster than that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2UPZZ"&gt;Other reviewers have pointed out &lt;a href="https://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/64941631"&gt;EVF blackout problems&lt;/a&gt; with the A1 since its launch, and it’s something I observed in my testing as well. When attempting to use the EVF in bright sunlight, the camera will sometimes fail to switch from the monitor to the viewfinder, and all screens will go black instead. In my 14 days of use, the A1’s EVF failed to activate in bright sunlight once. I then had to power down the camera and turn it on again to get a view back. For a camera marketed toward speed and with a price tag this high, a slowdown like that is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8wVHGIAjBf0xQELhl-7QYWI4MGI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22675205/bfarsace_4642_20210621_0017.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Alpha 1 feels surprisingly light at 1.6 pounds without a battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="GVokQc"&gt;Physically, the Alpha 1 is nothing new, and if you have experience with any of Sony’s Alpha cameras, the A1 will feel very familiar. It’s compact, lightweight, feels great in my hands, and gives me enough physical buttons and dials to lessen the need for jumping into the menu, which, although better than it used to be, is still a labyrinthine behemoth that takes a great deal of getting used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0E47KN"&gt;The A1 also uses the same Sony NP-FZ100 batteries as other more recent Alpha cameras. It is definitely pulling more power than most other models, though, and one battery only lasts for about half a day of heavy photography use with the A1, compared to the full day or more I might get with a less capable model. With a larger sensor, more robust EVF, and ridiculously fast burst mode, that battery usage checks out though. I highly recommend using the A1 with an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1494689-REG%2Fsony_vg_c4em_vertical_grip_for_a7r.html%2F%3Fap%3Dy%26smp%3Dy%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjw8cCGBhB6EiwAgORey12ZqwPa3fIG_atep88OcKhwQNOGIU-SxdjcuFs7HfrN_Sa46j3iZBoCVysQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22545402%2Fsony-alpha-1-a1-mirrorless-camera-review-specs-price-features-test" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;extended battery grip&lt;/a&gt; or having additional batteries on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_V4W9d0VfO3jYPYt2dfqJ37U6z8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22675195/bfarsace_4642_20210621_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s batteries can drain fast depending on how you use the camera, but adding an optional $348 vertical battery grip will help.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0t9J5n"&gt;Since this is Sony’s top-end model targeted at professionals, there is a plethora of ports on the left side of the camera, including an ethernet port and full-sized HDMI. All are covered by solid-feeling plastic doors that close with a reassuring click. On the right are dual SD card slots that both support either SD or CF Express Type A cards. Sony seems intent on making CF Express Type A A Thing, but using Type B would have given shooters more options in price and brands, not to mention Type B cards are twice as fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1z8FVm"&gt;I was also disappointed by the articulating screen that does not flip out 180 degrees. A fully articulating screen is great for vlogging and is also very helpful for tight angles or setting up self-portraiture. Instead, I used Sony’s “Imaging Edge Mobile” app for filming myself. While basic in design, it works well enough for remote shooting and image transfer. It would be great to not have to re-pair the app to the camera every time I quit it, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nwE_0eCX52gi5XboyjYofbftd9s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22675206/bfarsace_4642_20210621_0018.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Alpha 1 is like all of Sony’s other cameras combined.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZqbCeh"&gt;At $6,500, the Alpha 1 is a professional tool with a professional price tag. That is certainly not cheap, especially compared to the equally professional Canon R5, which sits comfortably under $4,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgYsL8"&gt;But the A1 earns its price tag with its massive sensor, high-spec video, all of the dials and buttons one could need, an outstanding AF system, and fast burst modes. It can work across many disciplines with all of these features — from professional video work to studio, strobe work, and even action photography. It’s like Sony took all of the best features of the A9 Mark II, the A7S Mark III, the A7R Mark IV, added the ability to shoot 8K video, and then put it all into a single camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbJ54T"&gt;For pros in the Sony system looking for the ultimate single-body tool, this is it. The rest of us might choose to buy a few extra lenses and go with a more inexpensive camera in the lineup, depending on our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xUyj2l"&gt;Still, I’ll be wishing I had the Alpha 1 in my hands the next time an opportunity to shoot a professional cyclist comes around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="QehDFD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SnsCv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMIom5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JdXcur"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sea of Thieves’ Jack Sparrow crossover is a Rare treat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7RULfCsSDwOuqeNEpXxr-Mv1n5k=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69492316/Captain_Jack_Sparrow.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain Jack Sparrow in Sea of Thieves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qv0Bs9"&gt;I could almost smell the gloomy caverns of &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt; this week. Moments before meeting Captain Jack Sparrow in a surprise Disney crossover, I felt like I was sailing along in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland. “Dead men tell no tales,” warns the spooky and familiar voice, just as you navigate caverns full of skeletons and water. I could feel the thunder from the Disney ride, spot the same seagulls dotted around, and experience phantom smells that reminded me of the damp and dark environment that’s a key part of Walt Disney World’s Magic Kingdom attraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KN2q8x"&gt;As Captain Jack Sparrow graces the shores of &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves: A Pirate’s Life &lt;/em&gt;this week, developer Rare has created a crossover with Disney that brings &lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean &lt;/em&gt;characters to life in the perfect environment. It’s the result of a year of work during a challenging pandemic and what feels like a significant and free expansion to &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNUL8o"&gt;Rare has teamed up with Disney to make this a reality, and instead of opting for simple skins or a basic character appearance, there’s a whole narrative around &lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean&lt;/em&gt; characters entering the &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt;. It’s resulted in some strong fan service, thanks to a shared appreciation between Rare and Disney, and Captain Jack Sparrow fighting alongside players in &lt;em&gt;A Pirate’s Life&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NdSnf917dve1FwM7vUTUFPHLA20=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22676367/The_Black_Pearl.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Black Pearl from &lt;/em&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WKLTGe"&gt;“Disney actually reached out to us at E3 2019,” says Mike Chapman, &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt; creative director, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “We met with Disney and they were huge fans of the game, so they reached out as huge fans of &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves &lt;/em&gt;... and that alone was kind of mind-blowing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fP64na"&gt;This first meeting led to an opportunity to bring Captain Jack Sparrow to &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt; in a way that respects the virtual pirate world and the story of&lt;em&gt; Pirates of the Caribbean&lt;/em&gt;. “Essentially they summarized it as ‘you’ve made the game that we should have made, we’d love to make a &lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean&lt;/em&gt; game but you’ve kind of made it with &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt;.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPM6VQ"&gt;Rare has crafted five episodes as part of the expansion, or Tall Tales as they appear in &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves. &lt;/em&gt;These adventures let players explore some new environments and enjoy meeting familiar Pirates of the Caribbean characters. While the story content lasts around eight hours in total, if you’re new to &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt; or returning from months or years of not playing, you can jump into the &lt;em&gt;Pirate’s Life&lt;/em&gt; story freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qOTRe1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0hdWFZ38q20?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VROYnY"&gt;The opening episode sees players meet the Cursed Captain, an animated skull that you can carry around to unlock clues, lore, and parts of the adventure. The Cursed Captain is part of a wonderfully animated environment, with some fun puzzles for players to figure out. The Black Pearl also makes an appearance here, and Captain Jack Sparrow will help you fire cannon balls to defeat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29607b"&gt;Fans of &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt; will also be delighted to visit some key locations in the game this season. There’s a huge underwater Sunken Kingdom that allows players to swim to the very depths of the ocean and participate in underwater combat. It’s here you’re introduced to a new weapon, the Trident of Dark Times, that is used to defeat Sirens beneath the seas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SRV7y"&gt;You’ll also fight hoards of brand-new enemy types in the Sunken Kingdom, including bipedal crustaceans that attack from land or sea. Crabs, eels, and hermits will all prove challenging to defeat, and they’re the first non-skeleton enemies since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/13/17003856/sea-of-thieves-game-preview"&gt;launch of &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt; three years ago&lt;/a&gt;. The Kraken will also finally show its face in the murky depths of the Sunken Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1-UCdg9YeQjpcD_jeTaujnut7iY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22676371/Sailors_Grave.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sailor’s Grave location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ARh5m6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Pirate’s Life&lt;/em&gt; also coincides with season three of &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt;, with an improved progression and reward system. Seasons are still a new system in &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt;, but this latest one has opened with the most memorable content in the game’s history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhwAFl"&gt;Rare is also experimenting with how solo players and groups of friends experience the story. The multiplayer, open-world aspect of &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt; has often turned solo players away from the game. Some players don’t want to meet rival pirates on the seas that will happily sink their ship and ruin hours of progress. &lt;em&gt;A Pirate’s Life&lt;/em&gt; attempts to answer that by cordoning off parts of this new campaign from the shared open-world. It allows you to enjoy meeting Captain Jack Sparrow in peace, without having to worry that you’ll be sniped in the head or that someone is blowing up your ship and stealing all your bananas behind your back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oL9RE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Pirate’s Life &lt;/em&gt;feels like a big step forward for &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt;, and a combination of a lot of changes to the game over the years. I originally started playing &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt; at launch in March 2018, hitting the max Pirate Legend rank within weeks. While the jolly open world was intriguing at first, the novelty of sailing the high seas soon wore off for me due to a lack of things to do. Returning to play &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt; again this year has been a delight, and the virtual seas feel like they’re now truly alive with content. I’m hoping we see Rare deliver more of this delightful storytelling in future seasons of &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pzKbKC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves: A Pirate’s Life &lt;/em&gt;is available now on Xbox One, PC, Xbox Series X / S, and on Xbox Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arcade1Up’s new digital board game table will be available for preorder in July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0R-LFgapSOu4v92cMR-Zwz1hgCI=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69492206/Gameplay_Candyland.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcade1up’s Infinity Game Table.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Arcade1up&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PcndtV"&gt;Last October, Arcade1Up, known for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525100/the-simpsons-arcade-game-machine-cabinet-arcade1up"&gt;officially licensed arcade cabinets&lt;/a&gt;, launched &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/infinitygametable/infinity-game-table-by-arcade1up"&gt;a wildly successful Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; for the Infinity Game Table, which lets you play digital versions of many tabletop games like checkers, chess, &lt;em&gt;Monopoly&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Scrabble&lt;/em&gt; on a big touchscreen&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;If you missed the Kickstarter, though, you’ll soon be able to buy the Infinity Game Table for yourself: it will be available to preorder exclusively from Best Buy starting July 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ayMDY"&gt;Arcade1Up says the Infinity Game Table will offer more than 40 games for free at launch, and you can download them by connecting the table to the internet. And there’s more than just board games: you can also download things like a puzzle app, a coloring book app, a sudoku app, and a word search app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1EI7or"&gt;Arcade1Up also plans to make new apps available down the line. Two games you can look forward to are &lt;em&gt;Pandemic&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/em&gt;, though you’ll have to pay for those when they’re available. (Both will be free to Kickstarter backers, however.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HxgE9H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can play online with friends&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1l2LqF"&gt;You play games with up to six different players on the Infinity Game Table (as long as a game supports that many players), and because the table connects to the internet, you can also play online with friends. During a briefing, I played &lt;em&gt;Battleship&lt;/em&gt; online against an Arcade1Up exec, and we traded moves virtually exactly as you’d expect. (I was soundly defeated because I am truly awful at &lt;em&gt;Battleship&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HtGrWH"&gt;The table comes in 24-inch and 32-inch screen sizes. I’ve been testing the 24-inch model, and the size feels comparable to a small yet tall coffee table. The 24-inch version has huge bezels, but that’s not exactly a bad thing, since you can place a glass or a bowl of snacks on them without covering the screen. The 32-inch model, pictured at the top of this post, looks to have smaller bezels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QgzdUzGri6gb29Kalunqj8-48qU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22673647/Gameplay_Chutes_Ladders__2_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Arcade1Up&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 24-inch Infinity Game Table, which has giant bezels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AoCJDc"&gt;You can remove the legs from the Infinity Game Table if you want to use it on the floor or another surface. But if you want to bring the Infinity Game Table to another room, I will warn you that it’s quite heavy. The 24-inch model weighs 46 pounds, and the 32-inch model weighs 60, so it’s not exactly easy to lug around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brXuHG"&gt;One thing we don’t know yet about the Infinity Game Table is the cost, and it could be expensive. Arcade1Up told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that a final price hasn’t been determined with Best Buy, but &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/infinitygametable/infinity-game-table-by-arcade1up/description"&gt;the table’s Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; could give us an idea of how much you might have to pay — and it will likely be in the hundreds of dollars. The Kickstarter lists a $599 MSRP for the 24-inch model and a $799 MSRP for the 32-inch model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSCTXZ"&gt;If you’ve been looking for a digital way to replicate board game night, Arcade1up’s Infinity Game Table could be what you’re looking for. It has a big screen (no matter which model you get), there are a lot of games to play for free, and the ability to connect to the internet means you can play with friends if they have a table, too. But the potentially high cost could be prohibitively expensive, and we won’t know just how much you might have to set aside until a price is announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qStOJJ"&gt;If you’re interested in the table, mark your calendar for preorders on July 17th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple argues against sideloading iPhone apps as regulatory pressure mounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YKJG7cTmNKROtjO3RMvsT2dflkE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69492130/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QRE13b"&gt;In a new 16-page report, Apple has laid out its arguments against allowing sideloading iPhone apps, claiming the practice would make its phones less secure and trustworthy for users. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fprivacy%2Fdocs%2FBuilding_a_Trusted_Ecosystem_for_Millions_of_Apps.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F23%2F22546771%2Fapple-side-loading-security-risk-report-regulatory-pressure" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The report&lt;/a&gt;, which is titled “Building a Trusted Ecosystem for Millions of Apps,” outlines Apple’s existing security processes and how it believes these could change if it were forced by regulators to allow sideloading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9B99a"&gt;The report is part of Apple’s pushback against lawmakers and other critics, who have argued that it should be forced to allow apps to be sideloaded onto its iPhones, bypassing its centralized App Store. In the US, the House Judiciary Committee is expected today to debate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;a series of bills&lt;/a&gt; aimed at addressing tech monopolies, including Apple’s App Store policies. One such bill sponsored by Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI), chairman of the antitrust subcommittee, could force Apple to allow third-party app stores on its platform, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-23/apple-says-third-party-app-stores-would-open-iphones-to-scammers?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sPr0gs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Allowing sideloading would degrade the security of the iOS platform”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3cUmqE"&gt;Elsewhere, the EU’s proposed Digital Markets Act (DMA) could compel Apple to allow sideloading of apps. “The current DMA language that is being discussed, would force sideloading on the iPhone,” Apple’s CEO Tim Cook previously said, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/23/apple-warns-of-perils-installing-rogue-apps-ahead-of-antitrust-debate.html"&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. This “alternate way of getting apps onto the iPhone” would “destroy” its security, the CEO argued. Epic also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452035/epic-apple-antitrust-trial-final-arguments"&gt;argued for Apple to allow sideloading&lt;/a&gt; in its recent high-profile trial with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hx3Kqb"&gt;Apple already allows sideloading on its Mac computers, but it argues that this model doesn’t work for iPhones because they carry more sensitive and personal information. Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi recently argued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444353/mac-malware-not-acceptable-craig-federighi-apple-epic"&gt;during the company’s trial with Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; that the Mac’s model means that it has a level of malware that “we don’t find acceptable and is much worse than iOS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ViF7QT"&gt;“Allowing sideloading would degrade the security of the iOS platform and expose users to serious security risks not only on third-party app stores, but also on the App Store,” Apple’s new report says. Apps that don’t go through its App Store review process could contain malware that Apple’s reviewers would otherwise catch, the company argues, citing research that suggests third-party app stores on Android (which does allow sideloading) are more likely to contain malicious code. Non-App Store apps may also not use Apple’s security and privacy features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWgKac"&gt;However, critics have pushed back against Apple’s claims about the security of apps on its store. Despite Apple’s assurances that it has a 500-plus strong team reviewing around 100,000 new apps and updates every week, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;numerous examples of scam apps&lt;/a&gt; slipping through its checks, including some that hide &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386533/ios-app-scam-jungle-runner-magical-forest-apple-kosta"&gt;casinos in kids apps&lt;/a&gt; or others that charge extortionately high subscription fees. And forcing developers to use the App Store to distribute apps means many have to pay Apple a 30 percent commission on app sales and in-app purchases for digital goods, a commission that Cicilline has previously called “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295778/apple-app-store-hey-email-fees-policies-antitrust-wwdc-2020"&gt;highway robbery&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XH22xG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-app-store-antitrust-174909862.html"&gt;Some experts have also argued&lt;/a&gt; that the iPhone’s security has more to do with the security features of iOS, including the way apps run in a so-called “sandbox,” rather than the App Store’s review process. But Apple’s report claims that “the best defense relies on a combination of all layers,” combining App Store review with built-in platform protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ywVi16"&gt;Apple says allowing sideloading on iPhones would affect all of its billion-plus users, regardless of whether they actually want to download apps that aren’t available on the App Store. Users might need to download a non-App Store app because they need it for work or school, or they might be unknowingly tricked into it. More broadly, Apple claims that sideloading would give malicious actors more versatility for how they attack iPhones. In other words, this isn’t simply a matter of user choice, Apple says, because it would affect all iPhone users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iENdSf"&gt;Finally, developers could also suffer if sideloading is allowed, according to Apple. The company claims users are more likely to try out new apps from smaller developers if they come from a trusted source, and that allowing users to get apps from anywhere could harm this trust and cause them to spend less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVWvkL"&gt;Alongside its report, Apple is also lobbying lawmakers directly. Yesterday, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/22/technology/amazon-apple-google-facebook-antitrust-bills.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546286/apple-tim-cook-nancy-pelosi-google-amazon-facebook-antitrust-lobbying"&gt;Tim Cook called Speaker Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; to express his concerns about the antitrust bills. Today, Cook is scheduled to have a virtual meeting with the EU’s competition head Margrethe Vestager, according to her &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/calendar_en?field_editorial_section_multiple_tid=462&amp;amp;date_filter_min%5Bvalue%5D%5Bdate%5D=22/06/2021"&gt;official schedule&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8ZEbG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onyKCM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bird and Spin release new electric vehicles amid pressure to catch up to Lime</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I4yxl_O1H0bctZwREV_rQA0otW4=/0x1:2468x1646/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69491950/Bird_Bikeshare_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g00Un3"&gt;Two of the top shared electric scooter companies in the US, Bird and Spin, are releasing new vehicles today. Spin is revealing a new, more rugged electric scooter, which it is building in-house for the first time. Meanwhile, Bird is showing off a new electric bicycle with a baby blue paint scheme. Both companies are under increasing pressure to catch up to Lime, which is the number one micromobility provider in the world with over 200 million riders last year globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQOq0M"&gt;There has always been an arms race among shared scooter and bike companies to produce the best, longest-lasting, and most technically advanced electric vehicles. But with increasing pressure to become profitable and some micromobility companies choosing to go public via reverse mergers with special acquisition companies, the race to enhance and grow vehicle fleets is taking on new dimensions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hnEZMS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There has always been an arms race among shared scooter and bike companies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7P65L1"&gt;Bird, which was the first company to introduce shared electric scooters in a US city, has always flirted with the idea of e-bikes. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20926658/bird-scoot-electric-moped-la-cruiser-specs-speed"&gt;first rolled out its Scoot-branded electric mopeds&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles in 2019 but was forced to pause the Cruiser program because of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="952etA"&gt;Last May, the company announced that it was going public by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428864/bird-electric-scooter-spac-public-valuation"&gt;merging with a SPAC called Switchback II&lt;/a&gt;. In its &lt;a href="https://www.bird.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bird-Investor-Presentation.pdf"&gt;pitch to investors&lt;/a&gt;, the company included an image of a shrouded bicycle next to several graphs charting the meteoric rise in e-bike sales in the US. “Coming soon,” the graphic promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8J9Rrb"&gt;Well, soon appears to be now. The company says the bike, with a rear-hub motor and a top speed of 15.5mph (25kmh), will be available in “select cities throughout North America, Italy, Spain, Germany, Ireland and France this year.” Bird says the bike will have a range of 56 miles (90km), dual handbrakes, onboard diagnostic capabilities to help identify possible problems, and an “aerospace-grade” aluminum alloy frame that should stand up to the demands of shared use. A geofence mechanism will automatically slow or stop the bike in areas where motorized vehicles aren’t allowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jdh63V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10619143"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wLxnfP"&gt;The bikes will be available to rent using Bird’s smartphone app. The company says it also plans to partner with preexisting shared bike and scooter operators, like e-moped provider Zig Zag in Italy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jB1Ldp"&gt;“Cities and riders are best served by efficient, collaborative transportation networks, not walled gardens,” Bird CEO Travis VanderZanden said in a statement. “Bird’s vision of smart, responsible bike sharing is being able to provide the best shared bikes and operations when cities need them, and having the foresight to offer the best support and multimodal integrations when they don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OdOyeb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bird’s decision to add e-bikes coincides with Lime’s recent moves to expand its own fleet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="blHQaO"&gt;Bird’s decision to add e-bikes to its product lineup coincides with Lime’s recent moves to expand its own fleet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409409/lime-electric-moped-nyc-price-announce"&gt;such as with the addition of electric mopeds&lt;/a&gt;. While both companies are mostly known for their electric kick scooters, there is a growing sense among micromobility providers that the more varied your vehicle lineup is, the better your chances are at becoming a financially soluble business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxs2K1"&gt;Those are the types of concerns that are clearly on the minds of Spin’s new executives. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy/"&gt;Earlier this month, the Ford-owned scooter company announced&lt;/a&gt; that its co-founder and CEO, Derrick Ko, would be moving into a strategic advisor role, along with two other co-founders, Zaizhuang Cheng and Euwyn Poon. In their place, Ben Bear, Spin’s chief business officer, would be the new CEO. These changes came after &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/ford-is-said-to-weigh-exit-of-electric-scooter-unit-spin"&gt;reports surfaced&lt;/a&gt; that Ford was looking to divest itself from Spin, either by selling it or as a spinoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZZSzGb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10619149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aUtVTI"&gt;Against this backdrop, Spin announced a new flagship electric scooter today: the S-100T first edition. The company is touting the scooter as its most rugged model yet, having conducted over 400 different safety and durability tests, including extreme heat, extreme cold, and corrosive humidity. The scooter has a number of safety features, including three independent brakes and the industry’s first stomp brake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3nbbk"&gt;In a departure from most North American-based scooter companies, Spin said its new scooter would come with a swappable battery “to create a more efficient and sustainable charging procedure.” Other countries, like China, are embracing battery-swapping technology as a way to expand access to their electric vehicles. But US-based companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22455384/bird-electric-scooter-third-gen-emergency-braking-battery"&gt;like Bird&lt;/a&gt; claim that swappable batteries can lead to higher manufacturing emissions and require more vehicle miles traveled to retrieve, replace, and recharge scooters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kY8ko"&gt;Whether the new scooter will be enough to right-size Spin’s finances will depend largely on its life span. The more trips and miles a single scooter can cover, the better it is for scooter companies that have to recoup the cost of each vehicle before they can start making money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvlURy"&gt;In the early days of scooter sharing, the off-the-shelf Chinese-made models would last less than a month, as many weren’t built to withstand sustained fleet use. Now, scooter companies are churning out models that can last on the street for up to 24 months, which is helping improve the unit economics of scooter sharing. Spin wouldn’t share the new scooter’s estimated life span, but it did note that it was built to withstand the harsh demands of city riding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBsjPu"&gt;“To achieve our vision of a 15 minute city, we needed to build a vehicle that was tough enough to handle everything a city could throw at it and then still be reliable to earn our riders’ trust,” Bear said in a statement. “S-100T is that vehicle.”&lt;/p&gt;
