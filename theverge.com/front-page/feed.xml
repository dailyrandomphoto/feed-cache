    <title>Microsoft Xbox boss Phil Spencer tells staff he’s ‘deeply troubled’ by Activision Blizzard</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cnwmiN"&gt;Following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;a bombshell &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick allegedly knew, withheld, and even participated in harassment and abusive behavior, the company’s big console partners Sony and Microsoft are semi-privately expressing their distress. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/xbox-chief-says-he-s-evaluating-relationship-with-activision?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; is now reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft boss Phil Spencer has now told staff he was “disturbed and deeply troubled by the horrific events and actions” at Activision Blizzard and that Microsoft is “evaluating all aspects of our relationship with Activision Blizzard and making ongoing proactive adjustments” as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HFV3l"&gt;Yesterday, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; also reported that Sony PlayStation boss Jim Ryan had told employees that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787848/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-calls-out-activision-blizzard-staff-memo"&gt;the company had expressed “deep concern” with Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, adding that “[we] do not believe their statements of response properly address the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AliP1c"&gt;These private statements from Sony and Microsoft obviously don’t carry anywhere near the same weight as if these companies &lt;em&gt;publicly&lt;/em&gt; called out the situation at Activision Blizzard, and it’s not clear if either company is interested in taking any concrete actions yet. Activision Blizzard is one of the most powerful publishers in the video game industry, and both console makers rely on them to provide new big-budget games for their consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhf8mN"&gt;That said, Microsoft and Sony also want to be seen as committed to a less toxic video game industry, and Phil Spencer, in particular, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612620/phil-spencer-console-wars-tribalism-xbox-playstation-ps5-sony-microsoft"&gt;has made combating toxicity&lt;/a&gt; part of his public brand. “This type of behavior has no place in our industry,” reads part of Spencer’s new memo about Activision Blizzard, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Z214jo"&gt;Microsoft didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment; it didn’t reply to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment yesterday about whether it had any statement or would take any action towards Activision Blizzard, either.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X will be available today for Walmart Plus subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1SWZhK"&gt;Console restocks are getting more and more frequent these days — particularly as the Black Friday season heats up and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday deals continue to roll out&lt;/a&gt; — but retailers have been quick to cull the herd of potential customers by putting some stock behind paid subscription services. Walmart has a next-gen console restock happening today at 3PM ET / 12PM PT, though, it’s exclusive to &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus&amp;amp;subid1=consolerestocks111821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart Plus paid subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. You can queue up to purchase a disc-based &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420&amp;amp;subid1=consolerestocks111821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; for $500, a &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383&amp;amp;subid1=consolerestocks111821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt; for $400, or an &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=consolerestocks111821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; console for $500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dy2drl"&gt;Be sure to log into your Walmart Plus account ahead of time, and it’s always a good practice to save your billing and shipping in your account ahead of time. Note that &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus&amp;amp;subid1=consolerestocks111821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you’ll need to be a paid subscriber to Walmart Plus&lt;/a&gt; for a chance to buy any of these three consoles, as a free trial account will not be accepted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzNxrV"&gt;A Walmart Plus subscription costs $13 per month or $98 per year and promises early and special access to deals — such as console restocks like this one and a four-hour early window on Black Friday deals. It also includes free shipping options akin to competitors like Amazon Prime.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US government seizes $56 million in crypto from BitConnect’s ‘number one promoter’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q5YLZmM_7qt08JIU4Ahc_WYLBE0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70161152/jbareham_180313_1777__bitcoin_cryptocurrency_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DrIyot"&gt;The US government &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/56-million-seized-cryptocurrency-being-sold-first-step-compensate-victims-bitconnect-fraud"&gt;has seized $56 million worth of cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; from an admitted participant in the BitConnect scam and intends to sell the coins and use the proceeds to reimburse victims. The Department of Justice says that it’s the largest recovery of cryptocurrency to date — and that it was willingly given up by Los Angeles resident Glenn Arcaro, who has called himself BitConnect’s “number one promoter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8271A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-172"&gt;According to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)&lt;/a&gt;, BitConnect convinced people to invest a total of $2 billion by telling them that it had a bot capable of generating incredibly high rates of return from crypto trading. In other words, BitConnect sold itself as a way for people to easily invest in cryptocurrency and to make a lot of money doing so, at a time when people were hearing a lot about crypto but didn’t know much about it (around 2016 through 2018). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PN6nfG"&gt;In reality, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdca/pr/director-and-promoter-bitconnect-pleads-guilty-global-2-billion-cryptocurrency-scheme"&gt;the DOJ says it was all a scam&lt;/a&gt; — BitConnect used money from new investors to pay old ones (otherwise known as a Ponzi scheme), and its advocates built pyramid schemes where they would get a cut for convincing others to invest by promising them the same deal. In September, Arcaro pleaded guilty to participating in both parts of the scam while allegedly posting videos online to make fun of BitConnect doubters. He said that he had earned what was then valued at $24 million by his participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BoZLi3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lCcwn6bGUtU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EF6m5k"&gt;Some may also remember BitConnect from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCcwn6bGUtU"&gt;a heavily memed presentation&lt;/a&gt; given by one of its investors, who repeatedly shouted “BitConneeeeeect” and said that his wife accused him of falling for a scam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glDuls"&gt;While BitConnect &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2021/comp-pr2021-172.pdf"&gt;largely traded in Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; (victims would buy BitConnect’s own BCC tokens using Bitcoin and could ostensibly convert BCC back into Bitcoin through a convoluted process), the government plans to reimburse victims in USD. The DOJ’s press release says that the law enforcement arm of the US Postal Service will be helping convert the crypto to fiat currency. The government &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdca/us-v-glenn-arcaro-21cr02542-twr"&gt;has set up a website for victims&lt;/a&gt; who are looking for compensation after the court sentences Arcaro in January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Over 500 Activision Blizzard employees petition to remove CEO Bobby Kotick </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activision Blizzard employees stage a walkout in the response from company leadership to a lawsuit highlighting alleged harassment, inequality" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_lmXtcVKpk6FJ0B7eGTkG8FiQNo=/0x137:4200x2937/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70161004/1234303774.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TE5Cng"&gt;Over 500 employees and contractors at Activision Blizzard &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vSbxdA-egrhAK6TcydVcrTqQDDjU7QE4j4jpjwCO2pUIYFmtTjLksl7EBALc8O_Jla2qT1Oy0H5zn66/pub"&gt;signed and published a petition&lt;/a&gt; to remove CEO Bobby Kotick from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XCMZne"&gt;“We, the undersigned, no longer have confidence in the leadership of Bobby Kotick as the CEO of Activision Blizzard. The information that has come to light about his behaviors and practices in the running of our companies runs counter to the culture and integrity we require of our leadership—and directly conflicts with the initiatives started by our peers. We ask that Bobby Kotick remove himself as CEO of Activision Blizzard, and that shareholders be allowed to select the new CEO without the input of Bobby, who we are aware owns a substantial portion of the voting rights of the shareholders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dc9ehl"&gt;In a surprising move, the petition goes on to list the names, titles, and departments of the workers, which could potentially expose the signatories to retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmDoy6"&gt;The petition comes days after a bombshell report alleging Kotick knew about, enabled, and even participated in a culture of misconduct and harassment that has drawn the attention of government authorities. In response, the company’s board of directors issued a statement saying it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785776/activision-blizzard-board-statement-ceo-bobby-kotick"&gt;continue to support Kotick&lt;/a&gt;, even as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787484/activision-blizzard-shareholders-demand-ceo-bobby-kotick-resignation"&gt;a small group of shareholders demanded his removal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgqnBJ"&gt;This petition is the latest development in a series of worker-led actions against the company, which now includes two walkouts and the formation of an employee advocacy group, A Better ABK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nt7QpR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Casey Wasserman is on the board of directors for Activision Blizzard as well as the board of directors of Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees will return to offices February 1st in a hybrid work pilot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lG5ZOWYnElGYRkwdymZupYyprWk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160990/acstro_190902_apple_event_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple employees will return to offices February 1st | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cmtF4x"&gt;Apple employees will return to offices starting February 1st as part of a hybrid work pilot and will be able to work remotely for four weeks a year. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/apple-sets-feb-1-for-return-to-office"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, employees learned of the news Thursday via an internal memo from CEO Tim Cook. The company had previously offered two weeks of remote work per year but added two more weeks to give “more opportunity to travel, be closer to your loved ones, or simply shake up your routines,” Cook’s memo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPbyzN"&gt;The pilot will start workers at one or two days in the office, then in March, workers will come to the office to work on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. They’ll be able to work from home on Wednesdays and Fridays. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/apple-pushes-back-return-office-plan-february-rcna6026"&gt;Some employees may be asked&lt;/a&gt; to come into the office four or five days a week if their roles require more time in the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QyCOxO"&gt;Cook first announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;hybrid work model in June&lt;/a&gt;, when the company was planning a September return to offices that was moved back to October, then January, and now, to February. Some Apple employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;pushed back strongly against the hybrid model&lt;/a&gt;, writing in an internal letter to Cook that they wanted a more flexible policy that allowed anyone who wanted to work from home to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzcW1d"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;for more details on the company’s office return. Following widespread closures of Apple stores during the height of the pandemic in 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307723/apple-stores-reopened-us-retail-open"&gt;reopened its retail stores&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, with mask requirements in place. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="R7XrPj"&gt;Apple has completed “much of the core work” on a new processor meant to power its secretive autonomous electric car project known as Titan, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s &lt;/em&gt;Mark Gurman reports&lt;/a&gt;. The milestone comes as Apple is reportedly now accelerating its timeline for the autonomous car it’s developing, with a new target of launching it in just four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ynw50V"&gt;Apple’s own silicon team designed the chip, which Gurman says is the “most advanced component” that’s been developed for the project so far. The company is apparently getting ready to put the chip through its real-world paces in its fleet of test vehicles in California and hopes to make a vehicle with “stronger safeguards than what’s available from Tesla and Waymo,” according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fz0Qx5"&gt;The goal now for Project Titan, after multiple pivots, is to create an autonomous car that does not have a steering wheel. The interior would be spacious and look more like the limousine-style seating arrangement that EV startup Canoo has promoted in its electric van prototypes. Apple was at one point in talks to acquire Canoo, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous"&gt;recently hired one of the startup’s co-founders&lt;/a&gt;. There would be a large, iPad-style touchscreen display that will run a user interface similar to iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPgvES"&gt;The business model is reportedly still undecided, though. Apple has considered trying to create a self-driving fleet to compete with Uber, Lyft, and Waymo (something Tesla has proposed but is still very far from executing), but Gurman reports that the “more likely scenario” is that Apple will sell the cars to individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZlkdE"&gt;On the electric vehicle side of things, Apple is reportedly not looking to develop a proprietary charging cable for the car. Instead, it wants to make the vehicle compatible with the “combined charging system,” or CCS standard, which would make it possible to charge the vehicle at most public fast charging stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ib1zFC"&gt;Of course, all of this comes after years of reported changes to the project, which was started in 2014. Five different executives have run Project Titan after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665353/apple-watch-kevin-lync-project-titan-electric-car"&gt;Apple Watch lead Kevin Lynch took over earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The refocusing and timeline shift reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; could be a sign that there’s real progress being made with him at the helm, or it could just become the newest footnote in whatever the project turns into next.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC votes to let people text ‘988’ to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline starting in July</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vbAMJ5"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-approves-text-988-access-suicide-prevention-lifeline"&gt;on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; to expand access to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline by letting people text 988 starting next year. Text message providers have to support the three-digit code by July 16th, 2022, which is when the code will go into effect. On that same date, people will also be able to dial 988 to access Lifeline following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328600/national-suicide-prevention-lifeline-number-dial-988-fcc"&gt;a 2020 FCC ruling&lt;/a&gt;. People in need of help before calling or texting 988 is an option can call 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) or get connected to a counselor through an &lt;a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/"&gt;online chat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2U877"&gt;FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcelFCC/status/1461369809828986887"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; that nearly 6,000 Americans call the Lifeline on an average day. “As we know from 911, creating an easy-to-remember 3 digit number makes it easier for people to get help when they need it most,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcelFCC/status/1461369908089049093"&gt;she said&lt;/a&gt;. By allowing people to call or text the shorter 988 number, the Lifeline could be more accessible for people to turn to in a time of distress.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Belkin’s new $150 3-in-1 charger is the first to get Apple Watch Series 7 fast charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2qCus9mdPGv8YvNCxvFWvOMd7sQ=/125x0:1976x1234/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160686/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_11.40.18_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with MagSafe | Image: Belkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TxkRI0"&gt;Belkin has a pair of new wireless Apple Watch chargers it’s announcing today, which are notably the first third-party chargers to support the newly added fast charging on the Apple Watch Series 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iw8S32"&gt;The larger of the two is the $149.95 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2Fp-wiz016%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F22785707%2Fbelkin-apple-watch-series-7-fast-charging-magsafe-charger-boost-charge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, which follows in the footsteps of last year’s 3-in-1 Belkin charger. In addition to adding Series 7 fast charging, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21516404/belkin-magsafe-boostcharge-pro-charger-car-mount-iphone-12-accessories"&gt;Belkin has ditched the odd sculptural design&lt;/a&gt; on the previous model in favor of a more normal-looking flat rectangular pad that will probably fit better on a nightstand. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DKUMBJ0Oe14bbCcQ41uUJaZtDvA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024679/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_11.43.05_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with MagSafe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kl7fHl"&gt;The new charger aims to hit the perfect trio of Apple charging: full-speed 15W MagSafe charging for an iPhone, Series 7 fast charging for an Apple Watch, and a regular Qi charger for the AirPods. Of course, as has always been the case with Belkin’s combination chargers, the $150 price tag is far more than what it would cost to buy individual MagSafe, fast-charging Series 7 Apple Watch, and Qi chargers, meaning that you’re paying a decent premium for style and convenience here. That price also does include a 40W power adapter, so you’re at least getting a one-stop solution for your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZK3Mgx"&gt;The other new charger here is a bit more baffling: the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2Fp-wiz015%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F22785707%2Fbelkin-apple-watch-series-7-fast-charging-magsafe-charger-boost-charge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BoostCharge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, which is a pop-up Apple Watch charging stand that costs $59.95. Despite the “portable” in the name, Belkin’s solo charger isn’t a battery pack-style setup for recharging an Apple Watch while you’re out and about. And even more baffling, that $60 price tag doesn’t include a power adapter: while there’s an integrated USB-C cable built into the stand, you’ll have to provide your own 20W wall adapter to actually use it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XHQgQgrZSpBYCYdarKvgYBK6G-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024682/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_11.43.33_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BoostCharge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U6DJhU"&gt;The net result is a larger, bulkier version of the fast-charging cable that Apple includes with every Apple Watch Series 7 — except that Belkin’s version costs literally twice the standalone cable’s $29 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63ZAiZ"&gt;Looking more broadly, though, is the fact that the new Belkin fast chargers show — once again — the intentional limits of Apple’s MFi program. The new chargers from Belkin are the only third-party fast chargers on the market right now, and if the pattern of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;last year’s glacial MagSafe rollout&lt;/a&gt; is anything to go by, it’ll be some time before other companies are able to get the approval (and the parts) from Apple to make other options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LSmFy3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Vp3Hlv"&gt;Both the $59.95 BoostCharge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch and 149.95 BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with MagSafe are available to order today from Belkin and Apple’s respective websites in the US, Japan, Hong Kong, and China, with availability in more countries promised in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BTS fan Twitter accounts say they’re being targeted by copyright trolls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BTS’s Digital Single ‘Butter’ Release Press Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/38RjMaSFCY659sjiEI2DMhAsCRA=/60x0:6144x4056/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160572/1319740646.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by The Chosunilbo JNS/Imazins via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qvXJ9J"&gt;In the past several days, a number of headers, profile pictures, and tweets have disappeared across the wide network of BTS fan Twitter accounts. The culprit, the account owners say, is a recent barrage of fake DMCA takedown notices. Outcry from fans resulted in #TwitterMaliciousDMCA trending worldwide on Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkQIWA"&gt;The owner of a fan account with over 233,000 followers, which posts videos, photos, and memes related to the South Korean band, claims that their original header and profile picture, as well as multiple tweets including their own screenshots and memes, have been taken down by the trolls over the past few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l70oPn"&gt;Per the owner’s screenshots, the attackers appear to have reposted the account’s header on a spoof website in a backdated post, then claimed to Twitter that the image was their own. The spoof websites appear to have been taken down as of this writing, but the account’s header remains suspended “in response to a report from the copyright holder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IN0Le6"&gt;“Not gonna lie, this has been making me rather anxious,” the account owner tweeted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qeFqB1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hello, with copyright harassment going on for the past 24hrs (4 strikes), I've decided to go private for the next few days – soon!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Updates will still go on, probably slower! If you'd like faster updates, feel free to join the Telegram channel (&lt;a href="https://t.co/SEPXep0fys"&gt;https://t.co/SEPXep0fys&lt;/a&gt;) – (1/3) &lt;a href="https://t.co/qjNnz0os9x"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qjNnz0os9x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— BTS UPDATES⁷ | @BTSdailyinfo (@BTSdailyinfo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTSdailyinfo/status/1455600959061516297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kRrRhc"&gt;The group claiming to be behind these attacks calls themselves Team Copyright, and purports to be based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The group’s Facebook page is full of screenshots indicating that its members are responsible for the various copyright takedowns. It’s also full of threatening and discriminatory posts — the group claims it will “destroy the toxic fanbase” and criticizes BTS for “promotion of atheism and homosexuality.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8a056"&gt;A number of prominent BTS fan accounts, many of which have millions of followers, appear to have been hit by these notices. The profile pictures and headers of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bts_worIdwide"&gt;@bts_worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/charts_k"&gt;@charts_k&lt;/a&gt; (which tracks the band’s positions on various charts), &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/btsvotingorg"&gt;@btsvotingorg&lt;/a&gt; (which nudges followers to vote for the artists for music awards), &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTS_Trans"&gt;@bts_trans&lt;/a&gt; (which shares English translations of the group’s social media posts), and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/taehyungpics"&gt;@taehyungpics&lt;/a&gt; (which posts periodic pictures of BTS member V) are all in copyright limbo as of this writing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NEGL4d"&gt;Fans have scrambled to create second accounts, but those still don’t appear to be safe — tweets from a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTSUPDATESGER2"&gt;backup&lt;/a&gt; for Germany’s fan base are currently suspended due to a copyright claim, while the group’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTS_UPDATES_GER"&gt;primary account&lt;/a&gt; has replaced its header and footer with blank colors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esS97g"&gt;The attackers have even hit the band members a few times. Per screenshots widely shared among BTS fans, takedown notices resulted in the temporary removal of selfies from members &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jtoni_n/status/1448546895563870212"&gt;RM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joonlyricst/status/1431627242975678469"&gt;Suga&lt;/a&gt; that were posted from the band’s verified account over the summer, as well as the brief suspension of an official handle. (Both photos and the account have since been reinstated; Hybe, the label that manages BTS, has not responded to an inquiry about the reason behind their removals.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hyC6wB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They even took down actual photos posted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTS_twt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BTS_twt&lt;/a&gt; and had suspended an official account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTSW_official?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BTSW_official&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/7fmD8KJ1YQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7fmD8KJ1YQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— bora    (@modooborahae) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/modooborahae/status/1461101912695189509?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="10LTqy"&gt;Fans across Twitter have sprung to action, aggressively reporting the page to Facebook, tagging Twitter support in comments, and flooding Bangladesh’s minister of state for foreign affairs with tweets. Despite those efforts, Team Copyright’s page remains active as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdGGNW"&gt;Twitter and Facebook have not responded to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOwPFA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bt4PYb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite’s better Battle Pass progression is now live</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A50wvRCkP5eE5HZCF0drb4EN1yk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158973/HaloInfinite_RXJtJxSVSl.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="urkns2"&gt;If you’re still stuck on level 1 of the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass, fear not, as 343 Industries’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Unyshek/status/1461124062021763072"&gt;promised changes to progression&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HaloSupport/status/1461369370303598598"&gt;now live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qTANV"&gt;The existing &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass makes it difficult to level up, as you’re limited to completing daily or weekly challenges instead of earning XP for every game you play. While that isn’t changing yet, 343 Industries has added “Play 1 game” challenges, which will “help make sure you consistently progress through the Battle Pass by playing matches the way you want,” according to &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; community manager John Junyszek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3HF7SN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To address the feedback on Battle Pass progression we will be making targeted tunings to our model later this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To start, we'll be adding "Play 1 Game" challenges to help make sure you consistently progress through the Battle Pass by playing matches the way you want.&lt;/p&gt;— John Junyszek (@Unyshek) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Unyshek/status/1461124062021763072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yId2pq"&gt;343 Industries will also be removing some weekly challenges and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HaloSupport/status/1461369371427688452"&gt;fixing bugs&lt;/a&gt; with others, but these changes do have a small price. “When we make this update, we’ll need to reset your challenges, including your progress towards weekly ones,” explains Junyszek. “To make up for this reset, we’ll be granting this week’s Ultimate Reward, the Sigil Mark VII Visor, to everyone who logs in from November 23rd to November 30th.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jdgdvh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HaloInfinite?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#HaloInfinite&lt;/a&gt; players can now earn XP by completing matchmade games. The "Play 1 Game" Daily Challenge is worth 50 XP each. The Challenge deck is also being updated to better serve players of all skill levels. (1/4)&lt;/p&gt;— Halo Support (@HaloSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HaloSupport/status/1461369370303598598?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id="WhuQBV"&gt;XP boosts will also now double in duration, lasting for an hour instead of 30 minutes, which will help for longer Big Team Battles games. We may even see further changes to the XP and progression systems in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;in the future, too. “We’ll be watching these changes closely to make sure they have the positive impact we all want on your progression,” says Junyszek. “This is only our first step - we are committed to continue evolving these systems but it will take time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="UBbrpz"&gt;Criticism around the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass progression has been getting increasingly louder across the community of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; fans this week after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782786/halo-infinite-multiplayer-available-download-launch"&gt;surprise early release of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. While multiplayer previews over the summer felt like an exciting return to form, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22725770/halo-infinite-multiplayer-preview"&gt;we had concerns around the Battle Pass progression&lt;/a&gt; and XP systems. 343 Industries still went ahead with the same systems, despite concerns from many during the technical previews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3uFn2"&gt;It’s encouraging to see quick changes, though. This opening &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; season will last until May, which is double the three months that had originally been promised. That extra time could be why 343 Industries kept the slow Battle Pass progression in the first place, but we’ll have to check out the changes in practice to see if they make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aH9Sxd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 18th, 12:03PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The promised changes are now live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
