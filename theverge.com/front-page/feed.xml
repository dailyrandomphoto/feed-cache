    <title>How to type special characters on a Windows PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KyFfDbSg1BrFhmUnbhFSkzciu-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69029603/mchin_190527_4449_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nBtPSS"&gt;Here’s the situation: you’re typing a report for work, and you suddenly have to write the phrase “Jones née Berkowitz.” Or you are adding a phrase in Spanish and need to use the word “años.” How do you add the special characters to the letters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JFT5W"&gt;Special characters (also known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic"&gt;diacritical marks&lt;/a&gt;) may be more common in certain languages, but there are plenty of circumstances in which English speakers may need to use them. But because they are so rare in English, native English speakers may not have learned how to add those marks to documents, emails, or other writings. It’s not difficult to add them to your Windows document, although it’s not quite as smooth an operation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22347140/apple-mac-special-characters-how-to"&gt;as on a Mac&lt;/a&gt;, where all you have to do is hold the appropriate key down. (In fact, once upon a time, you would have had to look up the symbol character codes...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F2UXCI"&gt;Use the touch keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cK212s"&gt;The easiest way to add diacritical marks to a document is to enable the Windows touch keyboard. (Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-get-easy-access-to-symbols-emojis-and-other-special-characters/"&gt;Ed Bott from &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for first leading me to this method.) The touch keyboard automatically appears if you’re using a Windows tablet or if you’re using a PC in tablet mode. If you don’t have a touchscreen, you can use the keyboard icon that appears in the taskbar, on the right side near the date. Don’t see it? This is how you get it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="3mKSNx"&gt;Right-click on the taskbar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="guGqAk"&gt;Click on “Show touch keyboard button”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on “Show touch keyboard button.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zX5tGpTALETlEtcWIgb7syaRgx4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397964/special1.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on “Show touch keyboard button” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="isigzU"&gt;Now, when you want to use a special character:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MiArSp"&gt;Click on the touch keyboard icon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vkiOjM"&gt;The touch keyboard will appear. Long press (with your mouse button or, if you have a touchscreen, your finger) on the letter you want to use &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mxWCG7"&gt;You’ll now see several extra keys showing the ways you can type that letter with different symbols. Select the one you want, and it will appear on your document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YsM2S5"&gt;If you want to enter an emoji, click on the emoji key (on the left of the “space bar”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select the special character you want, and it will appear on your document." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ianQf8kqWF7MLYr-Jkzt0fc99TM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397970/special3.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select the special character you want, and it will appear on your document.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3KuFuR"&gt;Use the emoji keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ias5hY"&gt;Another keyboard that you can access and can let you easily add special characters to your text is Windows’ emoji keyboard. Yes, it is mainly for adding emojis to your text, but it’s got other uses as well. And it’s simple to use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YHAmrI"&gt;Hold down the Windows key (the one with the Windows symbol on it) and hit the period key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yERfP0"&gt;The emoji keyboard will pop up, showing a variety of emojis. Click on the symbols tab on top (the third from the left).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The emoji keyboard also lets you access special characters." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0rwi7njzEZ8YaPRWp_OnJwmWVBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399994/emoji4.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The emoji keyboard also lets you access special characters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="RBvuoy"&gt;Use the menu on the bottom line to select the type of symbol you’re looking for (if you’re looking for characters to use within text, you’ll probably want to select this one: Ç). Then scroll down until you find the character you want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="blWVk1"&gt;Use the character map&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MX8CIZ"&gt;If you’d like to try a more old-fashioned method of adding special characters to Windows, you can use the character map, which is a less polished and more complicated version of the touch keyboard but offers a similar service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCcyqh"&gt;To access it on your Windows 10 system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QyOOxs"&gt;Type “character” in your search field and then select the Character Map app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2thjaB"&gt;You’ll get a pop-up map showing a bunch of special characters for a specific font. You can change the font by clicking on the drop-down font menu at the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The character map lets you access a wide variety of special characters." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t7GknZWGbXmLDWNLFDoIqxsW84U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397981/special4.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The character map lets you access a wide variety of special characters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4Xgqtz"&gt;Click on the letter(s) or special characters that you want to use in your document and then click on the “Select” button. They’ll appear in the “Characters to copy” field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XN5Maf"&gt;Once you’ve selected all the characters you want, click on the “Copy” button and then paste the character(s) into your document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F8Ftnt"&gt;Use the Unicode value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cLBy3k"&gt;If you look at the lower right-hand corner of the character map after you’ve chosen a letter or special character, you’ll see the word “Keystroke” followed by “Alt” and a four-digit number. This number represents the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode"&gt;Unicode value&lt;/a&gt; of the symbol, and it’s the time-honored standard for adding characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKmqL4"&gt;If you use a few special characters consistently, it can be faster to simply add the character you want using your keyboard. There are several ways to do this; here are two of the easiest (each of which has its limitations):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="dMoLKy"&gt;Press the Alt key and then type the four-digit Unicode value. For this to work, you need to have a separate number pad on your keyboard, and the NumLock key should be enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PrXVUY"&gt;If you’re working with Microsoft Word, WordPad, Outlook, or another Microsoft app, you can type in the Unicode value and then type Alt-X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Hnw0dE"&gt;You can also press the Control key plus a symbol, and then the letter you want to accent. For example, Ctrl+’ and “e” will result in “é” — assuming you’re in a Microsoft app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="fcd8Jh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 26th, 10:50AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to add a section on using the Unicode values and the emoji keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOGU5g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 30th, 11:15AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to add another way to add special characters within Microsoft apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>League of Legends: Wild Rift makes one of the world’s biggest games more accessible</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0BGRXXZ0qifoUNmfn0FGnp0fEsE=/16x0:7984x5312/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048792/Key_Visual.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BOemoG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most popular games in the world, and it has been for the better part of a decade. But it’s also incredibly intimidating: a 5 vs. 5 competitive experience with all kinds of complex rules and quirks. It’s not a game you pick up and understand right away. That’s part of what makes &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;, a new spinoff for mobile, so surprising. It takes the core of &lt;em&gt;League &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;packages it in a way that makes it much more approachable for newcomers. This is by far the best way to start playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qz41s"&gt;First, it’s important to note that &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a direct port of &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, it’s a new version designed specifically for mobile (and, at some point in the future, consoles). It still feels like &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; in a lot of ways, but there are some key differences. The core is identical: it’s a team game where squads of five go up against each other with the goal of taking down the opposing team’s base. You still navigate a map made up of three lanes, with a jungle full of creatures to kill in between, and you have to choose between a variety of heroes with unique skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpLT6p"&gt;But the changes, while seemingly small, are noticeable. For one thing, the map is smaller, so it’ll take less time to clear out lanes on your way to the enemy’s base. In my experience, matches last around 20 minutes in &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;, compared to &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; on PC where they can stretch out past 45 minutes. It’s just about the ideal length for playing on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PeV6yAmfkvWU-Ec7HixYGwLWCik=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407862/dcf4f32e_8ef3_4fb5_80ad_f109c533de45.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YPahhn"&gt;The addition of touchscreen controls is a big shift as well. Riot has replaced a mouse and keyboard with lots and lots of on-screen buttons. There’s a virtual joystick for movement — it’s serviceable, but like all virtual joysticks, it can be unresponsive at times — and buttons for all of your different attacks. There are also auto-attack buttons so you can focus on killing nearby minions or destroying towers, one for warping back to base, as well as a mini-map and pop-ups whenever you can buy a new item. It’s a lot, and the screen can get pretty cluttered on a phone. (It’s a bit better if you’re on a tablet; I played on an iPad Pro, and the UI had a lot more room to breathe.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OITiz"&gt;Surprisingly, though, aside from a few small issues, the controls have worked fine for me across a dozen or so matches. The joystick can get sticky, and it’s easy to accidentally start recalling yourself back to base, but other than that, I haven’t had any issues. So long as you aren’t planning to go pro, you should be fine. Riot seems to have found a nice balance between streamlined controls and giving you lots of information. The game also has fewer characters to choose from — around 60, compared to well over 100 in the PC version — simplifying yet another aspect of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzN6gi"&gt;So basically, &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift &lt;/em&gt;is a slightly lightweight take on &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;. But aside from the controls and smaller map, the thing that really makes it work is the onboarding. &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt; has an excellent tutorial series that teaches you the basics — how positions work, why you might want to wander off to kill a dragon — and it even gives you some in-game rewards for completing it. You can also bring up a version of the in-game map at any point and refresh yourself on everything from how the monsters work to what a top laner is supposed to do. It’s still an incredibly complex game, and you won’t learn everything from the tutorial, but it does an excellent job of easing in new players by explaining the basics in simple terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Nl4jn"&gt;A mobile version of &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; makes a lot of sense — so much so that it’s surprising it took so long. Most of the biggest online games are available on smartphones. Sometimes, like with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt;, those games offer an identical experience across platforms. Others, like &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22345184/rocket-league-sideswipe-android-ios-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and — now — &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, have opted for a mobile-specific spinoff. (That strategy worked out for &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350782/pubg-mobile-one-billion-downloads-tencent"&gt;which recently celebrated 1 billion downloads&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLG8Cf"&gt;It may be a decade old, but &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; is arguably as popular as it’s ever been, with multiple spinoffs and even a Netflix series in the works. &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt; may be a bit late to the party, but it looks to be an important part of the game’s next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdmftB"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Wild Rift &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is currently in open beta on both &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/league-of-legends-wild-rift/id1480616990"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riotgames.league.wildrift&amp;amp;hl=en_CA&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snag a refurbished, waterproof Kindle Oasis for $100 at Woot (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l-BqAzxZY0UEFyaHmf5tTTkgh8s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048214/akrales_190327_3174_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cfs4g1"&gt;The refurbished Kindle Oasis has sold out at Woot after about an hour of this post being live. Unfortunately, refurbished versions of the current model are a little over twice the cost of the $100 version this post originally highlighted, but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L8W2S8C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s an option if you need to buy today&lt;/a&gt;. One big perk is that the newer version has a display with an adjustable color temperature that might make reading a little easier on the eyes wherever you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9FOkE"&gt;Another solid deal happening at Woot is on the Beats Solo Pro wireless headphones that have active noise cancellation. We’re including them here today because they’ve dropped another $5 below the best price yet. You can get the light blue color for $145, while the others available are $150. These are Beats’ best on-ear headphones yet, though people who aren’t enmeshed in the Apple ecosystem might want to know upfront that they recharge via Lightning. If you have an iPhone or iPad, there’ll be no adjustment necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tOwYwy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625639"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="upHxe9"&gt;Apple’s latest MacBook Air equipped with its M1 processor is $50 off at Best Buy and Amazon. It’s not a huge price drop, but it’s less than what Apple is charging for the same model. This laptop has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. For the price, you’ll get fantastic performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Yg2xIT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4FaIO5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 11:36AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The refurbished Kindle Oasis has sold out at Woot. Updated to reflect this, and to provide a link to the refurbished version of the current generation Oasis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe’s new $14.99 iPad subscription bundles Photoshop, Illustrator, Fresco, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1cPb6twTH06ncxwJfv8ueZJLqmQ=/497x0:1199x468/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048662/ezgif.com_gif_maker__3_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0t3urR"&gt;Adobe has launched a new bundle for iPad creators. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fcreativecloud%2Fmobile-design-bundle.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F30%2F22358304%2Fadobe-design-mobile-bundle-price-ipad-photoshop-illustrator-fresco" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Design Mobile Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is available for $14.99 a month or $149.99 a year, and it includes access to iOS Creative Cloud apps like Photoshop, Illustrator, Fresco, and Spark, as well as services like Adobe Fonts and 100GB of cloud storage. Unlike Adobe’s other bundles, this won’t get you access to its desktop apps. Adobe says the bundle saves you 50 percent compared to paying for each app separately and that “they all work with touch and Apple Pencil.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vnMg16"&gt;Adobe’s mobile apps have come on a lot in the last couple of years. Photoshop only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20937111/adobe-photoshop-ipad-now-available-download-cloud-psd-workflow"&gt;arrived on the iPad&lt;/a&gt; back in 2019, lacking many of the features of its desktop counterpart. But over time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21336315/photoshop-ipad-refine-edge-brush-rotate-canvas-update"&gt;Adobe has continued to add features&lt;/a&gt;, including a new rotate canvas tool that’s soon &lt;a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/03/30/everythings-coming-together-for-mobile-creativity.html#new-ways-to-create:~:text=Our%20work%20on%20mobile%20applications%20is,capability%20to%20Illustrator%20on%20the%20desktop."&gt;making its way to desktop Photoshop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V47tWP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Soon, you’ll be able to load your brushes onto Photoshop on the iPad”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bvjiXE"&gt;Adobe also says that support for Photoshop’s desktop brushes is coming soon to iPad. “Soon, you’ll be able to load your brushes onto Photoshop on the iPad, meaning that all the great brushes you’ve discovered or created on Photoshop on the desktop will be close at hand on the iPad as well,” the company writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zw0SHn"&gt;A monthly cost of $14.99 makes this one of the less expensive bundles Adobe offers, though you are limited to only accessing it via an iPad (and iPhone in the case of Fresco). Currently, you can subscribe to all of its apps for $52.99 a month. Meanwhile, if you only need Photoshop and Lightroom, there’s a bundle with 20GB of storage for $9.99 a month that works on both desktop and tablet. (A bundle with 1TB of storage costs $19.99 a month.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Broadcasting George Floyd’s death violates Twitch rules, even during a murder trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-RACISM-POLICE-TRIAL-FLOYD" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s7-lHEZGApizMj36c87IQrcpqnw=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048591/1232019313.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eKQtDC"&gt;On Tuesday, Twitch removed graphic video of Minneapolis resident George Floyd’s death, shown during the trial of his alleged murderer Derek Chauvin — the latest test of how Amazon’s live streaming platform handles newsworthy events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="deb6e7"&gt;Nonprofit &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UR_Ninja/status/1376561580956123139"&gt;news site &lt;em&gt;Unicorn Riot&lt;/em&gt; said&lt;/a&gt; its Twitch account was suspended during the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin, who is accused of murdering Floyd. Trial witnesses were shown footage of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck for over nine minutes, an act of apparent police brutality that led to months of protests. That footage apparently ran afoul of Twitch’s guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRnAEl"&gt;“A few minutes ago our [Twitch] account was suspended for 30 days for rebroadcasting the #DerekChauvinTrial, which showed the video of the death of #GeorgeFloyd,” the outlet tweeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CvtQc6"&gt;Twitch declined to comment on the specifics of &lt;em&gt;Unicorn Riot’s&lt;/em&gt; ban, but it offered more general guidelines on violence. “Our community guidelines prohibit any content that shows gore or extreme violence, and we remove this type of footage when it is reported to us,” a spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jIXSf5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our community guidelines prohibit any content that shows gore or extreme violence”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2Kd1hG"&gt;Other social platforms like YouTube and Facebook have similar policies about graphic content. But these sites make exceptions for content with news value — like a recent live stream of a mass shooting in Colorado, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346465/boulder-mass-shooting-live-stream-youtube-moderation"&gt;which YouTube said&lt;/a&gt; didn’t violate its rules. A spokesperson noted that Twitch has no such exception, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217421/capitol-building-trump-mob-protest-live-stream-youtube-twitch-facebook"&gt;echoing statements the company has made before&lt;/a&gt;. So while &lt;em&gt;Unicorn Riot&lt;/em&gt; streamed the video on YouTube, Facebook, and Periscope without issue, it may not be returning to Twitch anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCUSdo"&gt;Twitch, like most online platforms, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20804614/bernie-sanders-twitch-presidential-campaign-gamers-streaming-donations-streamlabs-fec"&gt;become a venue&lt;/a&gt; for political commentary in recent years. And it was one of several platforms to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22241201/twitch-donald-trump-ban-permanent"&gt;ban former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; after the January 6th attack on the US Capitol. But so far, it’s dodged much of the criticism and regulatory pressure that YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook have faced. As cases like the Chauvin trial crop up, Twitch will have to balance the value of keeping out potentially controversial material with the opportunity to offer users a platform for broader political expression.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volkswagen is really rebranding as ‘Voltswagen’ in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VMZw1oqsursZ1FT2ZyxUpONW9c4=/0x120:716x597/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048185/Large_13212_VoltswagenAnewnameforaneweraofe_Mobility.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7zveic"&gt;Volkswagen is changing the name of its American brand to Voltswagen, in a not-so-subtle nod to the German automaker’s multibillion-dollar effort to become the biggest electric vehicle manufacturer in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HgHZ6"&gt;The company was apparently planning to make the announcement at the end of April but accidentally published a press release about the name change early Monday afternoon, which was &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/vw-accidentally-leaks-new-name-for-its-us-operations-voltswagen.html"&gt;first spotted by CNBC&lt;/a&gt; before it was taken down. The proximity of the name change to April Fool’s Day initially raised suspicions that it was just a joke. But VW insists that it’s a real thing, so here we are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6VX75"&gt;The company confirmed the change to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1499#images"&gt;the announcement was later published on Tuesday morning&lt;/a&gt;. The larger Volkswagen Group (which sits over brands like Audi, Porsche, and others) will keep the Volkswagen name for its American division. The name change will officially take effect May 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9uMfTO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The name change will officially take effect May 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yuLxzz"&gt;It’s not clear how the new name will be incorporated into the company’s upcoming slate of electric and gas-powered vehicles. For example, will it appear in any of the branding for the VW Atlas SUV, which typically gets 24 miles per gallon of gas? It seems doubtful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r18ZZb"&gt;“We might be changing out our K for a T, but what we aren’t changing is this brand’s commitment to making best-in-class vehicles for drivers and people everywhere,” said Scott Keogh, president and CEO of Voltswagen of America, in a statement. “The idea of a ‘people’s car’ is the very fabric of our being. We have said, from the beginning of our shift to an electric future, that we will build EVs for the millions, not just millionaires. This name change signifies a nod to our past as the peoples’ car and our firm belief that our future is in being the peoples’ electric car.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64GkK4"&gt;The name change is by far the most outrageous move from Volkswagen to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;draw attention to its electric vehicle efforts&lt;/a&gt;. Others include Volkswagen boss Herbert Diess &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/20/22240725/volkswagen-herbert-diess-twitter-elon-musk-vw-tesla"&gt;joining Twitter and letting a bit loose&lt;/a&gt;, a la Elon Musk, and the company’s recent “battery day” event, where it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;showed off the technology it’s developing&lt;/a&gt;. (Musk also authored a name change of his own recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331315/elon-musk-tesla-technoking-title-ceo"&gt;taking on the title of “Technoking” at Tesla&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcqPvW"&gt;But while the company is pouring tons of money into this push into EVs, there is currently only one long-range electric Volkswagen for sale in the United States: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22302883/vw-id4-review-volkswagen-ev-specs-range-photos-video"&gt;the ID 4&lt;/a&gt; SUV. The US also currently lags behind China and Europe when it comes to overall EV sales, despite being home to Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LF4We6"&gt;Voltswagen — sorry, Volkswagen isn’t the only legacy automaker leaning on groan-worthy puns or redesigned logos to emphasize its shift from internal combustion engine vehicles to ones powered by electrons. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220574/gm-new-logo-electric-vehicle-brand-ces-2021"&gt;General Motors unveiled a new logo meant to evoke the shape of an electrical plug&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wFRdw"&gt;We’re still waiting on the news that Ford is changing its name to the atomic symbol for Lithium. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google celebrates the unblocking of the Suez Canal with a small boat parade in search</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="EGYPT-SUEZ CANAL-TRAFFIC-RESUMPTION" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XsotSuSJqOtD3rcTS8zllPyGxTQ=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048067/1232015129.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Xinhua/Ahmed Gomaa via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iKWLsu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/3/25/22350300/suez-canal-ship-stuck-ever-given-boat-stuck"&gt;The big boat&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356465/suez-canal-big-boat-ever-given-stuck-unstuck"&gt;no longer stuck&lt;/a&gt;. After days of rapt attention from the internet, a non-metaphorical rising tide has indeed lifted all the boats — and particularly, the Evergreen Marine Corporation’s Ever Given cargo ship — reopening the Suez Canal to regular shipping traffic and ensuring that the precious lifeblood of capitalism can continue to flow freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MqrGft"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"I shed a single happy tear for the big boat","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356465/suez-canal-big-boat-ever-given-stuck-unstuck"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wcDcrF"&gt;Naturally, Google is celebrating this simultaneously momentous and absurd moment in human history the only way it knows how: an Easter egg in Google searches for the phrases “Suez Canal” and “Ever Given” that show a tiny parade of cute lil’ emoji boats marching across your screen, just like the (much bigger) boats that can now (less cutely, one presumes) float their way through the aforementioned canal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zK2KGgtqGRJ9uNuugbqO1F0fJW8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407705/boat.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AtBTh7"&gt;There’s probably a larger metaphor to be made about the flow of information on the internet that Google search facilities and the similarly unrepressed flotilla of real-world cargo now making its way through the canal, if you really wanted to. Or you can just enjoy the fun emoji. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUHReB"&gt;Float on, little boats. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s Resizable BAR frame rate boosts now available on all 30-series GPUs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="nvidia, nvidiastock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8NK44W7DaatMN8xxvfwqn484YYU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048041/DSC00697.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OCbGQm"&gt;Nvidia is launching Resizable BAR support today, a feature of PCI Express that can boost frame rates in certain games by up to 10 percent. Resizable BAR works by unlocking access to the full graphics frame buffer, instead of limiting it to 256MB block reads. This can improve frame rates in games, but it will require a compatible CPU, motherboard BIOS update, and even a VBIOS update for all 30-series desktop GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDe6aF"&gt;Nvidia has been working with both AMD and Intel to provide chipset support. AMD’s Zen 3 CPUs are supported, alongside Intel’s 10th Gen processors and the company’s new 11th Gen desktop chips that launch today. You can find &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fgeforce-rtx-30-series-resizable-bar-support%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F30%2F22357980%2Fnvidia-resizable-bar-support-30-series-gpus-available-now" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nvidia’s full FAQ on motherboard and VBIOS updates right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzYFZh"&gt;Resizable BAR works the same as AMD’s Smart Access Memory, which also promises to improve frame rates in certain games by up to 10 percent. The frame rate increase using both will really depend on the game, and resolution will also impact how much performance will improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fInGao"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;new RTX 3060 graphics card&lt;/a&gt; was the first to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302679/nvidia-rtx-3060-resizable-bar-support-30-series-gpus"&gt;include Resizable BAR last month&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-resizable-bar-tested-with-evga-rtx-3060-xc-black/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;wccftech &lt;/em&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that it improved performance between 4 and 11 percent in certain games. Nvidia initially limited support to fewer than 10 games, as the company warned enabling it on all games might result in performance decreases in some. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7DTOkH"&gt;Nvidia is now pre-testing titles and using special game profiles to enable Resizable BAR only where the performance increases. That means that only 17 games are currently supported, including &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs Legion. &lt;/em&gt;More games will be added in future driver updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PN76oF"&gt;Resizable BAR support on the AMD side has been tested thoroughly, and &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/article/2178-amd-smart-access-memory/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechSpot &lt;/em&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that some games making use of Smart Access Memory could see a nearly 20 percent boost at 1440p and 4K.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s dinosaur eggs have hatched, and now raptors roam the island</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b2MG3J0Ft7uv0s6JZxqYzbxHoo0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048016/slack_imgs.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h4SOxO"&gt;The newest season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22332371/fortnite-chapter-2-season-6-primal-battle-pass-tomb-raider-neymar"&gt;dubbed “Primal,”&lt;/a&gt; did two main things: it introduced animals to the island and added a prehistoric theme. So it’s only fitting that the latest update includes a dinosaur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wK67q9"&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/getting-to-know-fortnite-s-wildlife-in-chapter-2-season-6"&gt;a recent patch&lt;/a&gt;, raptors now roam the battle royale game, joining other predators like wolves and sharks. They appear to spawn at random, however, so there’s no guarantee you’ll encounter one in a match; I played for more than an hour this morning before I spotted one in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pXlLZX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite’s experimental story is an attempt to create ‘the entertainment experience of the future’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KgCPVN"&gt;In traditional &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fashion, the news had been teased over the last few days; giant eggs scattered across the island began to crack, hinting that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; was in the works. It was reminiscent of previous events like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525410/fortnite-volcano-eruption-season-9-alien-runes-spaceship-loot-lake"&gt;the volcano eruption&lt;/a&gt;, Kevin the rolling cube, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20691016/fortnite-robot-mech-season-10-countdown-kaiju-monster-patch-940"&gt;the time a massive robot was slowly constructed&lt;/a&gt;. It’s all part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"&gt;the game’s unique approach to storytelling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AevYI3"&gt;This is the first major update for season 6, so there could be other creatures on the way as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zqf8s1BA__I3V10P5ytyiwHAX_4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406522/Fortnite_20210329165502.jpg"&gt;

    <title>Intel’s 11th Gen Core i9 processor boosts Microsoft Flight Simulator by 20 percent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pgCgSyJxWiUIsyQzK7DdLIWe-lA=/9x0:2631x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047970/intelcorei9_11900K_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Intel delivers a speed boost and PCIe 4.0&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="EnDGaS"&gt;I built a new gaming PC in September to play new games like &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;. I figured that picking Intel’s Core i9-10900K and Nvidia’s RTX 3090 would make this machine last for years and offer top tier performance in demanding titles like &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;. I was wrong. &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is a notorious beast of a game and is quickly becoming the new &lt;em&gt;Crysis &lt;/em&gt;test for PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKZ5ER"&gt;It has struggled to run smoothly above 30fps with all settings maxed out at 1440p on my PC, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21552336/amd-zen-3-ryzen-review-roundup-5950x-intel-comparison"&gt;AMD’s Intel-beating Ryzen 9 5950X&lt;/a&gt; only improved the situation slightly for some. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8aEXza"&gt;Intel’s latest 11th Gen processor arrives with a big promise of up to 19 percent IPC (instructions per cycle) improvements over the existing i9-10900K, and more specifically the lure of 14 percent more performance at 1080p in &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; with high settings. This piqued my curiosity, so I’ve been testing the i9-11900K over the past few days to see what it can offer for &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UzxkC"&gt;It’s less than a year after the i9-10900K release, and I’m already considering upgrading to Intel’s new i9-11900K because I’ve found it boosts &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; by 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4td3oPFclFVU8HrC0dgiUwB_8_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407556/intelcorei9_11900K_2_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel’s Core i9-11900K processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fl32l2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t typically review processors, so we don’t own dedicated hardware testing rigs or multiple CPUs and systems to offer all of the benchmarks and comparisons you’d typically find in CPU reviews. For those, we’re going to recommend you visit the excellent folks at &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-core-i9-11900k-and-i5-11600k-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.kitguru.net/components/cpu/leo-waldock/intel-core-i9-11900k-review/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KitGuru&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-intel-core-i9-11900k-i5-11600k-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JW6ezT"&gt;Intel’s new Core i9-11900K ships with eight cores, 16 threads, and boosted clock speeds up to 5.3GHz. On paper, that sounds like it would be less powerful than the 10900K with its 10 cores, 20 threads, and boosted clock speeds up to 5.3GHz, but the reality is far more complicated thanks to how games and apps are designed. Most of &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; currently runs in a main thread that’s often limited by how well your CPU can run single-threaded applications and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jhmwDG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10419674"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rNPoqR"&gt;So in recent years Intel has managed to stay on top with its single-threaded performance, despite AMD offering more cores. That was until AMD’s Ryzen 9 5950X managed to beat the final Intel performance advantage late last year. Intel’s new 11th Gen chips are trying to reclaim its traditional advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1CgKD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is a good example of where Intel typically has an advantage. It’s also an increasingly rare example of a game that’s very sensitive to your entire system components and not just how good your GPU is at rendering games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aDPhrmvWPvKMfg19eXP2K3EY4eA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407557/705ff7fe_2f40_4e85_a2fd_b17a854aee38.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;em&gt; is a demanding title on PC.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="L89LfM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10419610"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y4YXju"&gt;Intel’s Core i9-11900K does its job well enough here to boost performance by around 20 percent depending on resolution. I’ve tested a variety of flights taking off from different airports and flying over some of the world’s most beautiful locations and the most demanding cities the game has to offer. Everything feels smoother with Intel’s latest chips, but the results aren’t dramatic enough to get me beyond 60fps without stepping some settings down. A flight over Seattle with all the settings maxed out shows a 24-percent performance improvement with the new 11th Gen Core i9 at 1080p and an 18-percent increase at 1440p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Loo0e0"&gt;On my i9-10900K PC, I saw average frame rates of 38fps at 1440p and 33fps at 1080p. The Core i9-11900K managed to bump these to 45fps average at 1440p and 41fps average at 1080p. Averages during a particular benchmark don’t always tell the whole story, though. Over the hours I’ve been playing &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, I’ve noticed the game dip and stutter less than before. It’s still not perfect, but it’s certainly smoother overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQb8jl"&gt;If I dial the game back to high settings, it immediately jumps to a 66fps average at 1440p — demonstrating just how much the ultra settings hit frame rates. I can personally barely notice the difference between high and ultra settings in &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;so the boost here is noticeable thanks to the smoother gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvAxDG"&gt;I also tested &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider &lt;/em&gt;and the Cinebench R23 and Geekbench 5 benchmarks. &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; saw a tiny bump of around 3 percent at both 1080p and 1440p, while the i9-11900K managed some impressive single core performance gains in both Cinebench and Geekbench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xOQgPv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10419602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AZ8W7P"&gt;I should note I was also hoping to do most of my testing with my existing Z490 motherboard, but that didn’t go to plan. I swapped the chip in with the latest BIOS update for 11th Gen processors and found that the system rebooted a few minutes into games without even a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). I wasn’t able to troubleshoot it fully in time for review, but the Asus Maximus XIII Hero (Z590) board supplied by Intel worked just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXgm4G"&gt;You should be able to easily use 11th Gen processors with Z490 motherboards, as most manufacturers have already issued BIOS updates to support Intel’s latest processors. Some will even support M.2 NVMe storage using PCIe 4.0 with these latest chips, while others like Asus only support PCIe 4.0 on the Primary PCIe x16 slot with 11th Gen processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ywp8M4"&gt;Intel’s 11th Gen processors finally deliver PCIe 4.0 support, and that’s good news for storage. Manufacturers have started to fully support PCIe 4.0 drives in recent months, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507807/western-digital-wd-first-pcie-4-0-nvme-ssds-sn850"&gt;Western Digital&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21444428/samsung-pc-980-pro-ssd-solid-state-drive-storage-price"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, GigaByte, and MSI all launching high-speed drives. If you have a compatible PCIe 4.0 NVMe drive, the upgrade to 11th Gen processors will certainly be worth it. I’ve managed read speeds of 6729MB/s and write speeds of 5206MB/s using Western Digital’s new SN850 1TB drive. Corsair’s MP600 also manages 4987MB/s read and 4259MB/s write speeds. Using Intel’s older 10th Gen chip, the Corsair drive managed 3484MB/s reads and 3235MB/s writes, so an 11th Gen upgrade improved speeds by more than 40 percent. If you work with a lot of files every day, the upgrade to 11th Gen processors will be worth it for PCIe 4.0 alone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2JD0BzaEMSVfes6_0gQATqsY1B0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407569/xF0EPe6.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Western Digital’s SN850 has super fast PCIe 4.0 speeds with Intel’s 11th Gen processors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="12kbsp"&gt;I don’t think the Core i9-11900K does enough for me personally to upgrade from a 10900K, but the PCIe 4.0 support would tempt me more if I needed the speeds there. At $550 (if you can find it at this retail price), the Core i9-11900K sits in between AMD’s offerings, being less expensive than the top 5950X and 5900X Ryzen 9 chips and $90 more than the 5800X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9HgZj"&gt;There’s some solid single-thread performance here, and the 11900K and AMD’s 5900X and 5950X all trade blows depending on the games. Intel’s performance improvement will come at a cost of energy efficiency, though. &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-core-i9-11900k-and-i5-11600k-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; found&lt;/a&gt; that the 11900K “sets the new high power mark” in several of its power tests, drawing over 200 watts in the same test that AMD’s Ryzen 9 5900X drew 116 watts. If you even need a new CPU, it’s worth considering just how much Intel’s latest chips will influence your energy bills and the games you play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWfCyt"&gt;Whether you decide to upgrade to Intel’s 11th Gen or one of AMD’s chips will probably depend on the games you play and stock availability. A lot of games do a bad job of utilizing multiple cores on CPUs, mostly because console gaming hardware hasn’t offered solid CPU performance and spreading multiple rendering and physics threads across different cores can complicate game design. Intel’s new chips do a better job of handling these single threads to improve performance, but it’s very game-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCEapG"&gt;For &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, the general consensus is that the game desperately needs to be moved to DirectX 12 for improvements to multi-core CPU performance. But Intel’s IPC improvements have managed to help until the Direct X 12 update arrives with the Xbox Series X release this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MF8rmK"&gt;Where Intel might have an advantage over AMD here is availability of chips. It has been increasingly difficult to find AMD’s latest Ryzen processors in recent months, thanks to a global chip shortage. Intel partners have already been accidentally selling some 11th Gen desktop CPUs, which may indicate it will have a steadier supply in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="p7mm3d"&gt;The winner between Intel and AMD will be the company that can get these chips into the hands of PC gamers eager to upgrade. Much like the GPU market right now, benchmarks don’t matter when the best chip is often the only one you can actually buy.&lt;/p&gt;
