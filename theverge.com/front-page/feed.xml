    <title>Apple is reportedly going to make more of its own chips</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uziLaj"&gt;Apple is reportedly working to design more chip components in-house, with the company said to be establishing a new office with the aim of replacing components that Apple currently sources from Broadcom and Skyworks, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-16/apple-builds-team-in-new-office-to-bring-wireless-chips-in-house"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9yzwE"&gt;The new office is said to be in its early stages but will eventually focus on “wireless radios, radio-frequency integrated circuits and a wireless system-on-a-chip,” in addition to “semiconductors for connecting to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12mJgk"&gt;While the A-series and M-series SoCs that contain the CPU and GPU for Apple’s iPhones and Macs get most of the attention, there are tons of additional chips inside those devices, handling things like power management, USB connectivity, wireless charging, and more. As &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FiPhone%2B13%2BPro%2BFull%2BChip%2BID%2F144993&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F16%2F22839850%2Fapple-office-develop-chips-in-house-broadcom-skyworks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iFixit’&lt;/em&gt;s iPhone 13 pro teardown&lt;/a&gt; documents, Skyworks and Broadcom supply a significant portion of the iPhone’s third-party circuitry — parts that Apple, it seems, would prefer to design on its own to create more bespoke solutions for its hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E4HLXA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple wants to rely less on third-party suppliers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ETAvVH"&gt;One of the most prominent examples of third-party chips is the iPhone’s modem, which is currently manufactured by Qualcomm (but had previously been the subject of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18410985/apple-qualcomm-settle-royalty-dispute-patent-licensing-terms-high-fees"&gt;years-long legal battle&lt;/a&gt; that briefly saw Apple switch to using Intel parts). Apple has made no secret about its ambitions to develop its own 5G chips instead of paying for Qualcomm’s chips, either: the company bought Intel’s smartphone modem business in 2019 for around $1 billion and is said to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22800144/apple-own-iphone-modem-2023-tsmc-4nm"&gt;looking to switch over&lt;/a&gt; to its own in-house modems for the iPhone as early as 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6uxU8"&gt;That Apple is looking to build more of its own chips may not just be about exercising a greater level of control and hardware integration, though: it could also be about getting a better handle on part supply. Right now, Apple is already feeling the impact of the ongoing global chip shortage with supply issues for parts from suppliers like Broadcom, which forced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723209/apple-iphone-13-chip-shortage-manufacturing-report"&gt;Apple to slash its manufacturing targets back in October&lt;/a&gt;. Building its own chips could help Apple alleviate some of those issues in the future, assuming it’s able to continue to work well with its manufacturing partners. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After 21 years Google Toolbar is finally gone, so we installed it one last time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="This is the page that opens after installing Google Toolbar, giving a synopsis of some of its features." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uJoVgmSe38z3gmS01nrUGLyy444=/0x0:876x584/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282160/gdesktop14.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Success! You just installed the last Google Toolbar.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L7I2iY"&gt;I was lost and in search of myself after hearing the &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/12/happy-21st-birthday-to-google-toolbar-which-inexplicably-still-exists/"&gt;devastating news on &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Google Toolbar had been put down by the search giant after nearly 21 years — longer than most projects &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/killedbygoogle/status/1470410675554033666?s=20"&gt;the company lets live&lt;/a&gt;. (A recent &lt;a href="https://museletter.area120.google.com/"&gt;newsletter effort&lt;/a&gt; didn’t make it past three months).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvGf27"&gt;There was no ceremony, no announcement, no moment of silence, nor any closure — just a “no longer available.” That’s what Google has now on its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/toolbar/answer/81376?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=6317538"&gt;Install Google Toolbar help&lt;/a&gt; page; it tells you how to uninstall the Google Toolbar and install Chrome instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i3H8_qjtM4guEqJ4mKipZynSQQk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100539/Screen_Shot_2021_12_14_at_4.41.45_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to “install” Google Toolbar — the result may surprise you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jwh8Zz"&gt;It feels unreal for Google to silently forsake a tool that was, in 2008, &lt;a href="https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/googles-chrome-kills-the-lucrative-toolbar-business/"&gt;responsible&lt;/a&gt; for 12 percent of all Google searches — and then convince a new internet generation that everyone should just download Chrome if they love Googling so much. Chrome is great (&lt;em&gt;fine?&lt;/em&gt;), but it isn’t what it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards"&gt;used to be&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unDrdA"&gt;I have a confession: I was not a Google Toolbar user, but we had a relationship. Google Toolbar existed to help me blame it for my family’s and friends’ computer problems. If they ask me about tuning their computer or complained about websites loading slowly: I told them it’s the Google Toolbar, and I was happy to uninstall it for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJNqJ2"&gt;It always seemed to work, too: removing not only Google Toolbar but also Yahoo! Toolbar, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/ask-jeeves-toolbar-review/"&gt;Ask Jeeves Toolbar&lt;/a&gt;, or any toolbar would give back so much screen real estate (we are talking about the 1024 x 768 screen resolution days of the 2000s) that there was at least the perception of a tune-up. Sure, I’d still end up going the extra mile and actually fix their real issues, but each removal of the omnipresent Google Toolbar felt almost like material change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1shFzR9f8tb3xO4j9B9fApxkMOE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100650/gdesktop16.PNG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internet Explorer 8 (released in 2009) on Windows XP. You could do a Google search in the Google Toolbar, the IE8 search field, or the Google website — the choice is yours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VSzvDf"&gt;The popularity of Google Toolbar — and other browser toolbars — in the 2000s was what pushed web browsers to adopt web searches as a built-in feature. Internet Explorer 7 (2006) was one of the first browsers to have a dedicated search field next to the address bar, making web searches quick — though the default search engine was Microsoft Live Search, to the dismay of many. That’s why Google Toolbar would continue to thrive and build a dependence of Google services on users for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zN5ZPl"&gt;With Chrome dominating web browser usage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/21/3033566/chrome-most-popular-browser-weekly-may-2012"&gt;since 2012&lt;/a&gt;, the redundant web search fields have finally come to an end. Now let’s get together and install Google Toolbar one last time to celebrate its life and let it rest in peace:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Aka4vk"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Find a PC that has Internet Explorer, Preferably IE8 or newer.&lt;/strong&gt; It could be your first build with a Pentium 4 and a Radeon All-In-Wonder that your family threatens to dump. The important thing is it should be a computer no one is using, cares about, or otherwise wouldn't mind toolbars being added to Internet Explorer. I found a PC running Windows XP x64 Edition, so that should work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PrXb0TbTNGTY6A23BpN33IGZ2hw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100874/IMG_0947.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The computer I found had a CPU fan error since it was filled with thick dust, but I flicked the blades until it started spinning. It has a Pentium 4 and an Nvidia Quadro FX 1700.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="osCne0"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Find and install Google Toolbar.&lt;/strong&gt; Some &lt;a href="http://google-toolbar.findmysoft.com"&gt;freeware sites&lt;/a&gt; still have it, or if you’re lucky, there might be about three toolbar installers deep in the downloads folder of any old PC. Open the installer and run it. After install, it will close all browsers and reopen Internet Explorer. Congratulations, Google Toolbar is here!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bYYCiH4-UyAdTWOtdkgpNFrET-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100790/gdesktop11.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be sure your finding is actually from Google. Though that is no longer verifiable since Google doesn’t host the file anymore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Znnr2gDlPxaVOT2DYUY-xnUIHk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100799/gdesktop13.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This one is specifically for Internet Explorer, but it will close Firefox when you click Restart Now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Z9tKaS"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Consider your search options.&lt;/strong&gt; You can Google on your new Google Toolbar, Google on Google.com, or Google in the Web Search field — though you would have to drop the default Live Search or Bing (in my case it was mywebsearch.com, which was probably set inadvertently or maliciously on this PC). In the Search Provider Default window that pops up, select Google (after all, this is a Google Toolbar tribute).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/82ewC9scsbxsXphqF4l6_r9puX0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100802/gdesktop18.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The war between browser and search engine rages on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="BiwL4A"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Try signing in with your Google account for the full experience.&lt;/strong&gt; Click on the Sign In button on the right side of the bar. You’ll get error messages and a wonky Google sign-in screen pop-up. If you enter your credentials, it will give you another error message, so maybe don’t bother. Let’s just pretend it works, quietly close the error messages, close the sign-in window, and continue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3tVKBEYuj2-xeunfZddxE4mLEsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100804/gdesktop23.PNG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The services don’t seem to work anymore, but it’s also because Google stopped supporting old versions of Internet Explorer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="nIZX1r"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Enable geolocation.&lt;/strong&gt; Go to Toolbar options &amp;gt; Tools under the wrench menu. Check “My Location.” We may as well contribute to a decade or two of targeted ad tracking while we’re at it, right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uDdIno_Ln1o4CRPEutzoa_F9108=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100805/gdesktop24.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Toolbar options have tools that let you block pop-ups (before browsers could do it), sync bookmarks between computers using Google Toolbar, and help with spell checking!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="sbnLGV"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Review the Google Toolbar Privacy policy.&lt;/strong&gt; Click on the Privacy side tab. You’ll find the 2014 edition of Google’s Privacy policy (though it does link to the latest policy). You could even opt in to “enhanced features,” although I admittedly didn’t look into what it does (but you can).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2AYGmGOk9uA_BrtLh0VNVS-YZGE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100806/gdesktop28.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There was also a button to opt out of all the features that send information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="YEtupt"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A moment of silence.&lt;/strong&gt; Click on the About Toolbar tab. Gasp at the fact that you’ve just updated to the final version of Google Toolbar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IkJYko0l3jCckFXJewgafniAfk4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100813/gdesktop25.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We installed version 7.5.5111, but the software still downloaded the latest version with 7.5.7210.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="IEifyN"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Share your favorite sites to social media. &lt;/strong&gt;Under the More button on the toolbar, you can translate the page, share to social media, and more. MySpace and Google Plus are the recommended places to share.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XJML9NG_5XVHFTg5tPb8k0egwd0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100810/gdesktop21.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can add more buttons to this list under the Toolbar Options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="TMSZ1K"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Uninstall the toolbar (Optional).&lt;/strong&gt; It’s so easy with just two clicks — next to the wrench icon in a drop-down menu click “Uninstall.” Or, instead, continue and you could get your Google Toolbar a companion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tTwTHF06kGMY8mKtplIkM3FRRSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100811/gdesktop22.PNG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the step I took helping people over the years. I’ve got a lot of thank you’s uninstalling this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="agkxxH"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Get Yahoo! toolbar.&lt;/strong&gt; Find it in the same place(s) where you found Google Toolbar. It’s the same steps, but scarier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t think I’ve ever opened this installer myself, and I shudder thinking about everyone who has. Let’s carry on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="dMgrLR"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Be bold.&lt;/strong&gt; Make Yahoo! your default search engine, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/19/7250513/firefox-signs-yahoo-as-default-search-engine-"&gt;and commit to it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notice the check box to share your data. Let’s skip that and save it for Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="GA2Kgh"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Experience search overload.&lt;/strong&gt; Internet Explorer will ask you again about what default provider to use. Feel forever conflicted by choosing between the two... there’s not much more you can do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This takes me back to the computer conditions of some friends and professors I’ve helped.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="0ejqN4"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Time to put Google Toolbar to rest. Turn off the PC.&lt;/strong&gt; If it’s a computer you don’t care about, skip the shutdown. Just hold the power button so the last thing the computer did was operate Google Toolbar. If you’ve made it this far, I’m proud of you. You’re a strong and beautiful human. Now we can finally lay Google Toolbar to rest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; I stumbled upon another relic, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Desktop"&gt;Google Desktop&lt;/a&gt;! Maybe you will find this on an old PC you procure. The program came out in 2007 (full release) and was basically a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(software)"&gt;Sherlock&lt;/a&gt; — but for any PC. Google would index all your files so you could find anything, and interfaced through a web browser. Comes with a sidebar of widgets like weather and RSS feeds. I tried adding &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; RSS feeds, but it wouldn't load. Google Desktop was discontinued in 2011.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Amazon Echo Show 15 review: Alexa’s on your wall</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;This Echo Show on the wall is the fairest of them all, but it’s not that smart  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="fkjUWo"&gt;The original idea for Amazon’s Echo Show was a large, screen-based device that would offer up relevant, glanceable information for the modern family, replacing outdated devices like bulletin boards, paper calendars, and sticky notes on the fridge. In 2017, Amazon couldn’t quite achieve that vision for a price that a modern family would be willing to pay. So, instead, it released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/26/15865292/amazon-echo-show-alexa-review"&gt;small, squat seven-inch touchscreen smart speaker&lt;/a&gt; that, frankly, did little more than Amazon’s screen-less Echos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08tjb1"&gt;But it was a start. And as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"&gt;Echo Show has evolved over the ensuing four years&lt;/a&gt;, the company finally has a device that it thinks fits that original vision: the Echo Show 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CaGBMJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10927033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lnGwZr"&gt;The $249.99 Echo Show 15 is billed as a shared hub for families to see things like upcoming calendar appointments, to-dos, digital sticky note reminders, and shopping lists. It’s also an excellent kitchen TV (not a high bar, to be fair). Of course, it does everything other Echo displays and speakers do, thanks to the presence of Amazon’s smart voice assistant, Alexa. This includes playing music, showing weather reports, streaming video, controlling smart home gadgets, telling fart jokes, all the stuff you’ve come to rely on Alexa for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KiQzbX"&gt;A very solid piece of hardware, the Echo Show 15 is a stunning device. It looks impressive on your wall when called into action, and otherwise blends into the background as a digital photo frame displaying art or family photos. It fills a niche that no device has reliably conquered to date: a wall-mounted tablet to replace the plethora of analog paper tools busy households traditionally rely on to communicate with each other. You can use it on your countertop with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099LF68JS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an optional stand&lt;/a&gt; if you can find the room — at 15.8 x 9.9 x 1.4 inches, this thing is huge — but the wall is the better option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LPagWr"&gt;The concept is good. But the execution is underwhelming. As is a theme with Amazon devices, on day one there is plenty of room for improvement on the software front. There’s a lot crammed onto this admittedly large screen, but ultimately while the Echo Show 15 tries to be something for everyone, it ends up struggling to be particularly useful for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MF2A_rhwtifc1hZKLtpphgu2sno=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086571/dseifert_211208_4924_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 15 can be mounted on the wall or on a counter (with an additional stand) in either portrait or landscape.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nh8WoI"&gt;In terms of specs, the Echo Show 15 is a 15.6-inch screen with a 1080p touch display, with the processing power of the new Amazon AZ2 neural edge processor behind it — the first Show to use Amazon’s latest chip. It has a new homescreen layout that divides its time between the standard rotating Echo Show content (which you can customize) and a new feature: widgets. You can also have it just display art or photos (stored in Amazon Photos or Facebook, nowhere else, sadly), fulfilling its picture frame ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9qkkL"&gt;Aesthetically, the Echo Show has a black frame with a white mat, resembling a standard picture frame. Tech-wise it looks like the Samsung Frame TV and the Facebook Portal had a baby. It comes in one color, and you can’t change the familiar Alexa blue background behind the widgets — I’d like to see some customization options all around. Two 1.6 speakers on either side (or top and bottom in portrait) provide decent if slightly tinny sound, and a small row of buttons on the top or side (depending on orientation) offer volume up / down, mute, and camera shutter controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4IemQc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Show 15, like Goldilocks’ proverbial porridge, is just the right size. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eVSlRy"&gt;The widget concept is a nice addition, and the potential is huge — especially as Amazon has released an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586033/amazon-alexa-widgets-featured-skill-api-developers-echo-show-screen"&gt;API that developers can use&lt;/a&gt; to add widgets to their Alexa Skills. Currently, however, you’re stuck with a dozen or so Amazon widgets that are limited in their usefulness. They include calendar and reminders (you can import calendars from Google, Apple, and Microsoft), shopping list, sticky notes, smart home controls, a to-do list (Alexa only), weather, your commute, photos, maps, music and audio, reorder suggestions, Alexa suggestions, and your Amazon deliveries. A new What to Eat option offers up recipes and nearby delivery suggestions from partners such as Domino’s and Whole Foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQXLDZ"&gt;In our app-driven world, you likely already have favorite tools that do most of these things, and frustratingly, you can’t port any of them to the Show. It’s all Amazon, for now. There’s also limited customization, and while you can rearrange and resize some widgets, if you have any enabled they take up almost half the screen. While the Show 15 is noticeably snappier than others in the family, it’s not super responsive and takes two or three seconds to respond to taps and swipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixMTZl"&gt;Interestingly, the widgets take the Show from being a voice-first device (which is something I’ve always struggled with) to one with a lot more touch functionality. It’s the most tactile Show to date, and the widgets invite you to come on in and stay awhile as you check your calendar, browse shows to watch on the expanded Video Home screen, and attempt to control your smart home from the (limited) Smart Home widget (more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1OyI8Wcq925FEwslEPrE7-m2g5I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086562/jtuohy_211208_4924_0011.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 15 is best suited for wall mounting and can be set to just display photos until someone approaches it when it switches to the widget format.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wnwvA0"&gt;While the Show 15 is designed as a hub for family organization, it is not a communication device. My biggest disappointment here is its 5-megapixel camera that produced pixelated, blown-out images during my Alexa calling and Drop-In testing. (Zoom is not yet supported, but Amazon says it will be coming next year.) Despite the souped-up processor, video constantly freezes and lags, making it unusable for an actual conversation. It also doesn’t have the auto-framing of its Echo Show 8 and Show 10 counterparts, both of which have a more robust 13-megapixel camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYEELh"&gt;It seems Amazon was looking for a differentiator from the Show 10, which Amazon tells me is its “communication device.” The rotating 10 can follow you around a room while you talk, keeping you in the frame as you chop veggies or unload the dishwasher. But who really is going to have a Show 10 and a Show 15 in their kitchen? Two $250 devices in one room seems like legitimate overkill. If they had bumped up the camera in the 15 to make video calling better, this would be a much more useful device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tMWfWH5Of2w9mWGgnCUTYm4_mcc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086566/jtuohy_211209_4924_0016.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A slimline design allows room for speakers without a super bulky form factor when mounted on the wall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JdP4cW"&gt;The best feature of the Show 15 is its size. To date, screens for the kitchen have either been too large (see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18170285/ge-google-netflix-spotify-exhaust-vent-smart-display-kitchen-hub-ces-2019"&gt;GE Appliances’ monstrous screen&lt;/a&gt; built into an over-the-range hood) or too inflexible (Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/5/4/11591780/samsung-family-hub-smart-fridge-hands-on-price-release-date"&gt;Family Hub fridge&lt;/a&gt; with a portrait tablet built in). The Show 15, like Goldilocks’ proverbial porridge, is just the right size. The 15.6-inch screen’s housing is just shy of 10 inches tall and 16 inches wide and is designed to fit under standard kitchen cabinets or between two doorways in an open plan house, Chris Green, VP of industrial design at Amazon Lab126, tells me. It’s also very flexible. You can mount it on the wall in either a portrait or landscape orientation, and thanks to the included, cleverly designed mount, it’s easy to swap it from one to the other when your use case changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9xrNQ"&gt;A compelling reason to buy this is for a good-quality, compact screen for watching TV while in the kitchen. It’s the first Echo Show to support full HD resolution streaming from Netflix, Prime Video, and Hulu, but it’s missing key players such as Disney Plus and HBO Max. Sling TV support is coming soon, which will bring another option for watching live TV (Hulu Live being the other).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUy1Pd"&gt;One downside, however, is the 16:9 ratio of the screen means you get two black bars when watching widescreen movies. The white picture frame design also doesn’t lend itself to immersive viewing — but for a kitchen TV, it’s a nice device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A52ML6"&gt;A new feature that makes this more useful is picture-in-picture. This allows you to view a security camera feed or video doorbell while also looking at other content. So, you can have a baby monitor running while you’re following a recipe. The Show can stream video from any Alexa-compatible camera and if you have a Ring video doorbell, it will pop up a live feed on the screen when someone rings the bell and you can talk to them through the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The volume, mute, and camera cover buttons are on the top or side of the device, depending on how it’s mounted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ogzfXFtrv833Pn71YwgIFCnkxKk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086556/jtuohy_211207_4924_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The mounting system works with a wall mount or stand (pictured) as well as other mounting accessories made by Sanus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="frPXIA"&gt;In my testing, I initially assumed I’d want it in the landscape orientation — and for TV viewing, that was the best option. But for the family hub features — shopping lists, calendars, and even widget use — it was more helpful in portrait as you see more information on the screen. This was especially true for smart home control. And while you can’t pin a full-screen widget (it always reverts to the home screen), the full-sized portrait smart home widget shows 12 separate tiles for your devices, compared to just six or seven in the landscape. Frustratingly, you only get individual devices to control in the widget (no groups) but in the full-screen mode, you do get the option to use groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5qSOoK"&gt;Setting up the Show is an easy process; once powered on, you walk through a series of screens to connect to Wi-Fi and accept Amazon’s litany of terms and agreements. New here is the option to add Visual ID (Voice ID and enabling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448926/amazon-sidewalk-ring-echo-tile-wifi-mesh-ble-location-tracking"&gt;Amazon Sidewalk&lt;/a&gt; may also be new to you if you haven’t set up a Show in a while). These are all optional, but the Visual ID — a new feature that leverages that AZ2 processor — uses the camera to serve up relevant content such as calendar appointments, commute times, and notes from family members, depending on who is standing in front of it. It can even be used to gate content to kid-safe things if you set it up to recognize a child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tl9Ffc"&gt;This is great in theory, but in my testing, it repeatedly failed to identify who was there and sometimes couldn’t see anyone at all. The Show can also recognize your voice, but that regularly failed in my testing, too. Amazon says the processing for the Visual ID happens locally, and the identifying information is stored on the Echo Show 15 itself, not in the cloud. The facial profiles aren’t shared across devices, so you need to set it up with each Echo Show 15. This feature is also coming to Show 8 and Show 10, according to Amazon’s press materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuKQkd"&gt;I ran into several issues setting up Visual ID and Voice ID for my family members, specifically my children. If you have Amazon Kids profiles set up already, you just tap on those in your account settings and walk through the process. I had no problems setting up my daughter’s Voice and Visual ID, but when it came to my 13-year-old son, the Show kept thinking he was my daughter. He was not amused. After the third time Alexa recognized him as a 10 year-old-girl, he was done with the whole thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="UVPGxP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10927032"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xkuwd9"&gt;Visual ID was also buggy in everyday use — it seemed to like my daughter the best, often mistaking me and my husband for her. But occasionally, it just wouldn’t work at all, stubbornly refusing to see me as I stood in front of it. When it did work, the only real personalization features were recently played music. It can offer up different calendars based on who is viewing, but in the time I had to review the device, I wasn’t able to reconfigure all my family’s individual Apple and Google calendars to sync with Alexa. Instead, I ported in a shared Google calendar we use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UieyI"&gt;I’d advise setting up the device first and trying it out in a couple of locations before committing to a wall mount, although that was my preference after spending a week testing it. The wall mount option is nowhere near as daunting as I’d anticipated. Amazon provides a paper template, and you’ll want to break out a level and a drill, but it’s mostly painless and not much more work than hanging a large picture or artwork on the wall. Drill holes for four screws, attach the wall mount, and you’re done. The Show slides onto the mount thanks to four grooves in the back and you can switch between portrait and landscape at will without having to re-drill anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hO6Lyb"&gt;A tabletop stand sold separately &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099LF68JS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $30&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t offer as much flexibility (you need a screwdriver to reconfigure the orientation). For &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099LFLKMP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$40&lt;/a&gt; there’s an option that will let you change from portrait to landscape without having to break out a screwdriver. An &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099LCK96Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;under-cabinet mount for $50&lt;/a&gt; lets you tilt and swivel. I tested the $30 stand, and it’s solid and well-made but very large. The footprint this thing takes up on a countertop (289 square inches in our test setting) is too big for a lot of kitchens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYHPYI"&gt;The biggest issue with wall mounting is going to be cable management. If you’re okay with a cord going down your wall and you have a nearby outlet, you’re all set. But if you’re like me, you are going to want to route this through the wall or devise another way to hide the cable. Amazon’s Chris Green tells me that snaking the cable through the wall as you might with a TV is perfectly fine, but you know — at your own risk and endeavor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WE51ru"&gt;The Show 15 comes with a five-foot cable, potentially making placement tricky (a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099LK8V8G?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;six-foot extension cord is available for $13&lt;/a&gt;). I had nowhere in my kitchen to wall mount this, as all my walls are tiled, except for one corner of the room that would have made the perfect spot, but there’s no outlet anywhere nearby. I ended up placing it in portrait mode in a main hallway that we use to come in and out of the house. While we sacrifice the TV aspect this way, it’s actually a more useful place for some of those visual reminders, and I have the lights for the three closest rooms set up on the smart home widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UoIDdJ2917DmPN_k4Mdnvq4UOPA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086559/jtuohy_211207_4924_0008.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 15 is the largest smart display available today, here you can see it dwarfs the 10-inch Nest Hub Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CCcONQ"&gt;Speaking of the smart home side, it’s a big disappointment. There’s no Zigbee radio built in for connecting devices; you can’t use it as a motion sensor to turn on lights when you walk in the room (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22779044/amazon-echo-speakers-ultrasound-people-detection"&gt;as you can with other Echo displays and speakers&lt;/a&gt;); and the three or four individual devices you can access from the smart home widget limit its usefulness for managing your connected home. You can’t pin the full-screen smart home control to the display; it will always revert to the homepage. You also can’t tap the widget to get to it, you have to swipe down and tap the Smart Home button from the menu. I couldn’t even get a voice command to bring it up. It was not designed with the smart home front of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="TInvot"&gt;However, if that’s not your primary use case, this can be a handy tool for household organization. That is once some software updates roll out to fix those Visual ID bugs and a few non-Alexa widgets start appearing. As of today, it’s only helpful if you are all-in on Amazon for organization of your shopping, reminders, and to-do lists. If you’ve been wanting a wall-mounted smart display, this is really your only ready-to-use option and will be a great addition to your kitchen if you’re happy with the limited ecosystem. But if you like using other services, I’d advise waiting to see what widgets third-party developers come up with before picking one up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KOZJaC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gaRBSd"&gt;Peter Membrey, chief architect of ExpressVPN, remembers vividly seeing the news of the Log4j vulnerability break online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ofbz1n"&gt;“As soon as I saw how you could exploit it, it was horrifying,” says Membrey. “Like one of those disaster movies where there’s a nuclear power plant, they find it’s going to melt down, but they can’t stop it. You know what’s coming, but there are very limited things you can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQQvQO"&gt;Since the vulnerability was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828303/log4j-library-vulnerability-log4shell-zero-day-exploit"&gt;uncovered last week&lt;/a&gt;, the cybersecurity world has kicked into overdrive to identify vulnerable applications, detect potential attacks, and mitigate against exploits however possible. Nonetheless, serious hacks making use of the exploit are all but certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z64xJe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“As soon as I saw how you could exploit it, it was horrifying”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f1YfRj"&gt;So far, researchers have observed attackers &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/12/15/microsoft-confirms-new-ransomware-family-deployed-via-log4j-vulnerability/"&gt;using the Log4j vulnerability to install ransomware&lt;/a&gt; on honeypot servers — machines that are made deliberately vulnerable for the purpose of tracking new threats. One cybersecurity firm reported that &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/log4j-flaw-nearly-half-of-corporate-networks-have-been-targeted-by-attackers-trying-to-use-this-vulnerability/"&gt;nearly half of corporate networks&lt;/a&gt; it was monitoring had seen attempts to exploit the vulnerability. The CEO of Cloudflare, a website and network security provider, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1469350732692217863"&gt;announced early on&lt;/a&gt; that the threat was so bad the company would roll out firewall protection to all customers, including those who had not paid for it. But concrete news on exploitation in the wild remains scarce, likely because victims either don’t know or don’t yet want to acknowledge publicly that their systems have been breached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzArZD"&gt;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; known for sure is that the scope of the vulnerability is huge. A list of affected software compiled by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) — and restricted to only enterprise software platforms — runs to &lt;a href="https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db"&gt;more than 500 items long&lt;/a&gt; at time of press. A list of all affected applications would undoubtedly run to many thousands more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvCe7b"&gt;Some names on the list will be familiar to the public (Amazon, IBM, Microsoft), but some of the most alarming issues have come with software that stays behind the scenes. Manufacturers like Broadcom, Red Hat, and VMware make software that enterprise clients build businesses on top of, effectively distributing the vulnerability at a core infrastructural level of many companies. This makes the process of catching and eliminating vulnerabilities all the more difficult, even after a &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/second-log4j-vulnerability-found-apache-log4j-2-16-0-released/"&gt;patch for the affected library has been released&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmSDqK"&gt;Even by the standards of high-profile vulnerabilities, Log4Shell is hitting an unusually large chunk of the internet. It’s a reflection of the fact that the Java programming language is used widely in enterprise software, and for Java software, the Log4j library is exceedingly common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xRy0q"&gt;“I ran queries in our database to see every customer who was using Log4j in any of their applications,” says Jeremy Katz, co-founder of Tidelift, a company that helps other organizations manage open-source software dependencies. “And the answer was: every single one of them that has any applications written in Java.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z26C5o"&gt;The discovery of an easily exploitable bug found in a mostly enterprise-focused language is part of what analysts have called a “&lt;a href="https://blog.f-secure.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-log4j-vulnerability-rocking-the-internet/"&gt;nearly perfect storm&lt;/a&gt;” around the Log4j vulnerability. Any one company could be using numerous programs containing the vulnerable library — in some cases, with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1471484218119180290"&gt;multiple versions inside one application&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWX8D2"&gt;“Java has been around for so many years, and it’s so heavily used within companies, particularly large ones,” says Cloudflare CTO John Graham-Cumming. “This is a big moment for people who manage software within companies, and they will be running through updates and mitigations as fast as they can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Kz5UKi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I ran queries in our database to see every customer who was using Log4j. The answer was: Every single one of them that has applications written in Java”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rg1CMt"&gt;Given the circumstances, “as fast as they can” is a very subjective term. Software updates for organizations like banks, hospitals, or government agencies are generally conducted on the scale of weeks and months, not days; typically, updates require numerous levels of development, authorization, and testing before making their way into a live application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYiBIQ"&gt;In the meantime, mitigations that can be pushed out &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt; provide a crucial intermediary step, buying valuable time while businesses large and small scramble to identify vulnerabilities and deploy updates. That’s where fixes at the network layer have a key role to play: since malware programs communicate with their operators over the internet, measures that restrict incoming and outgoing web traffic can provide a stopgap to limit the effects of the exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtxSmV"&gt;Cloudflare was one organization that moved quickly, Graham-Cumming explained, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cve-2021-44228-log4j-rce-0-day-mitigation/"&gt;adding new rules for its firewall&lt;/a&gt; that blocked HTTP requests containing strings characteristic of the Log4j attack code. ExpressVPN also &lt;a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/log4shell-protection/"&gt;modified its product&lt;/a&gt; to protect against Log4Shell, updating VPN rules to automatically block all outgoing traffic on ports used by &lt;a href="https://ldap.com/"&gt;LDAP&lt;/a&gt; — a protocol that the exploit uses to fetch resources from remote URLs and download them onto a vulnerable machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oONfBq"&gt;“If a customer gets infected, we’ve already seen scanners as a malicious payload, so they might start scanning the internet and infect other people,” says Membrey. “We wanted to put a cap on that, not just for our customers’ sake but for everyone else’s sake — a bit like with Covid and vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="y7J7Zr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Sophisticated attackers will exploit the vulnerability, establish a persistence mechanism, and then go dark”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m3aWW9"&gt;These changes typically happen faster because they take place on servers belonging to the firewall or VPN companies and require little (if any) action from the end user. In other words, an out-of-date software application could still receive a decent level of protection from an updated VPN — though it’s no substitute for proper patching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjWNxV"&gt;Unfortunately, given the seriousness of the vulnerability, some systems will be compromised, even with quick fixes deployed. And it may be a long time — years even — before effects are fully felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mLO55M"&gt;“Sophisticated attackers will exploit the vulnerability, establish a persistence mechanism, and then go dark,” Daniel Clayton, vice president of global cybersecurity services at Bitdefender, says. “In two years’ time, we will hear about big breaches and then subsequently learn that they were breached two years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSrlwX"&gt;The bug in Log4j once more highlights the necessity and challenge of adequately funding open source projects. (A huge amount of tech infrastructure might as well depend on “a project some random person in Nebraska has been tirelessly maintaining since 2003,” as a &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/"&gt;perennially relevant XKCD comic&lt;/a&gt; explains.) &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported earlier this week that many of the developers involved in the race to develop a patch for the Log4j library &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-13/how-apache-raced-to-fix-a-potentially-disastrous-software-flaw"&gt;were unpaid volunteers&lt;/a&gt;, despite the global use of the software in enterprise applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJK7pS"&gt;One of the last vulnerabilities to rock the internet, Heartbleed, was similarly caused by a bug in a widely used open-source library, OpenSSL. Following that bug, tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/24/5646178/google-microsoft-and-facebook-launch-project-to-stop-the"&gt;committed to putting more money&lt;/a&gt; into open source projects that were critical for internet infrastructure. But in the wake of the Log4j fallout, it’s clear that managing dependencies remains a serious security problem — and one we’re not close to solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlfovD"&gt;“When you look at most of the big hacks that have happened over the years, it’s not normally something really sophisticated that undoes big companies,” Clayton says. “It’s something that hasn’t been patched.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An Afghan refugee who drove for Uber was killed in San Francisco — his family is seeking answers</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The family of a slain Uber driver wants the company to help them | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SJLghf"&gt;Ahmad Fawad Yusufi, a refugee from Afghanistan and father of three, was shot and killed last month in San Francisco during what &lt;a href="https://sfist.com/2021/12/08/potrero-avenue-shooting-victim-identified-as-father-of-three-who-helped-u-s-army-in-afghanistan/"&gt;police said was a botched robbery attempt&lt;/a&gt;. His family says Yusufi, a former interpreter with the US Army who lived in Sacramento, was in San Francisco to drive for Uber, a job which was their sole source of income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VkI7B"&gt;The ride-hailing company has said &lt;a href="https://www.abc10.com/article/news/crime/family-seeks-answers-afghan-refugee-shot-in-car/103-09455a67-69bf-4788-861d-248743a8fc47"&gt;Yusufi appeared to be “offline”&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the shooting, meaning he was not on duty, but his brother Ilyas says Yusufi worked all night Sunday driving for Uber, which was his reason for being in San Francisco at the time of the shooting early on a Monday morning. He’s written a letter to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, chief legal officer Tony West, and senior VP for marketing and public affairs Jill Hazelbaker, demanding $4 million in aid for Yusufi’s family — which he says the company has an “ethical obligation” to provide — and access to Yusufi’s disabled Uber account. Ilyas believes the account may provide more information about the circumstances surrounding his brother’s death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjAdoF"&gt;In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Ilyas said it feels like Uber doesn’t care about what happened to his brother. “He worked for them, but they don’t want to help us,” he said, adding that Yusufi’s wife doesn’t speak English and is unable to work, so the family is in danger of losing their home. “Right now, we don’t know what to do. But when his kids ask me what I did for their father, I have to tell them I tried. I need to try to make a good life for them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3wurT"&gt;In his letter, Ilyas points to &lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/supporting-afghan-refugees/"&gt;Khosrowshahi’s September blog post&lt;/a&gt;, where he wrote about being an Iranian refugee as a child and pledged that Uber would support Afghan refugees. The CEO announced Uber had added an in-app donation button that sends funds to refugee resettlement programs of the International Rescue Committee and added Pashto and Dari language support to its Uber Driver app. “We want to make it even easier for Afghan refugees to access economic opportunities, if and when they are ready to do so,” Khosrowshahi wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wyZcR8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“...you are turning your backs on us in our time of need”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6uqzdD"&gt;But Ilyas said he and hundreds of other Afghan drivers often sleep in their cars while driving for Uber. “And now, after all the work we did for your company, you are turning your backs on us in our time of need,” he writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTsTv6"&gt;In reply to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Uber spokesperson Austen Radcliff said in an email that the company was “saddened by this senseless act of violence that took Mr. Yusufi’s life. Our hearts go out to his family during this difficult time.” Radcliff added that Yusufi was not online or on a trip at the time of the incident, that his last trip was the previous night. Uber has been in touch with the family to offer its condolences, Radcliff said, and is working to provide them access to the account. He pointed to an article from the &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/Sacramento-man-shot-and-killed-in-S-F-identified-16683093.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in which police said Yusufi was with a friend near a park at the time of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MB9TVu"&gt;Uber has a history of trying to defer responsibility for incidents with its drivers — who are not considered employees of the company but independent contractors — if the drivers weren’t actively working at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3WuZR"&gt;Perhaps the best-known test of this position is a 2013 incident where a driver who said he was working for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/28/5350660/lawsuit-uber-accident-death-girl-liability-insurance"&gt;Uber in San Francisco struck a family in a crosswalk&lt;/a&gt;, killing six-year-old Sofia Liu. The company maintained, however, that while the driver was an Uber “partner,” he was not “providing services on the Uber system during the time of the incident.” A lawyer for Liu’s family said the driver was logged in to Uber’s app at the time seeking fares, even though he didn’t have a passenger in the car when he struck Liu. The company eventually settled with the family out of court, and the incident prompted a new state law requiring ride-hail drivers and companies to have liability insurance coverage whenever they’re using a ride-hailing app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kClxf9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yusufi is not the first Uber driver to be killed while on the job&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IxKJTx"&gt;And Yusufi is not the first Uber driver to be killed while on the job; two recent incidents include &lt;a href="https://abc7chicago.com/chicago-carjacking-uber-driver-killed-shooting-police/10445793/"&gt;Javier Ramos, who was shot and killed&lt;/a&gt; during an attempted carjacking in Chicago in March, and Timothy Perkins, who was &lt;a href="https://www.wilx.com/2021/01/31/teens-charged-in-uber-drivers-death/"&gt;beaten and stabbed to death In Detroit&lt;/a&gt; in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ye2XG"&gt;Driving for the company’s Uber Eats delivery platform can be hazardous as well; &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/teens-get-maximum-sentence-death-uber-eats-driver-n1273276"&gt;Pakistani immigrant Mohammad Anwar was killed&lt;/a&gt; after an attempted carjacking in Washington, DC, in March. Two teenagers pleaded guilty to murder charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKgZmI"&gt;Cherri Murphy, an organizer with Gig Workers Rising, a Bay Area organization supporting Yusufi’s family, said Uber drivers sleeping in their cars was not uncommon in the area and criticized the company, which she said “washed their hands” of him and his family. “That’s simply unacceptable. We stand in strong solidarity with Ahmad’s family and for workers everywhere who are endangered or killed on the job.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Px0dX6"&gt;Ilyas, who also drives for Uber, says he and his brother came to the US in 2017 and usually made the trip from Sacramento to San Francisco every weekend to earn money on the ride-hailing platform. Included in his letter to the Uber executives is a demand that the platform pay its drivers better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62AiIN"&gt;“When my brother and I drove to San Francisco every weekend, we could never afford a hotel room after delivering your customers around the city all night,” Ilyas wrote. “We drop people like you off to your multi-million dollar homes every day. We deserve a safe, hospitable place to sleep at night afterwards.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Chrome’s last-minute holiday shopping tools track prices and abandoned carts</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q6D22QNwytUyCDd8hdOiV0pRNto=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70281759/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="srD6OS"&gt;With time ticking away before shipping deadlines put a stop to your online holiday shopping, Google is &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/5-tips-finish-your-holiday-shopping-chrome/"&gt;highlighting a few new Chrome features&lt;/a&gt; that might help you out. Still, it’s not lost on us that these features used to keep track of stuff to help you shop are also useful for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770569/alphabet-google-market-cap-hits-2-trillion"&gt;nearly $2 trillion company&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747193/google-q3-2021-earnings-record-revenue-profit"&gt;makes most of its money from serving up relevant advertisements and making sure shoppers hit the “buy” button&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="c7q7IQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the shipping deadlines to get your holiday gifts there on time ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22833986/ups-usps-fedex-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target-shipping-deadlines-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oNQsFi"&gt;But you will probably use Chrome anyway, so you should know that a new feature in the mobile browser on Android will show updated pricing for items inside your open tabs grid, so you’ll know if the prices suddenly drop. Google says iOS Chrome browsers will get the feature “in the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Chrome price tracker on Android" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rmHZAPLTKVMV_rj3NKb2kwfvP_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23101433/_Chrome_Shopping_Inline_No_shell_V2__1__800.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Chrome price tracker on Android&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QBZMMI"&gt;Another handy tool for Android browsers is the ability to search the internet for something you’re already looking at in real life, using Google Lens inside Chrome. The Lens icon will pop up in the toolbar, and you can use the camera to identify something on a shelf or in a window and start searching without typing. This is also coming to desktop browsers soon, where you can right-click (unless it’s an NFT and you’re trying not to be rude), then select “Search images with Google Lens” and use the mouse cursor to draw over whatever is catching your eye in the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U8yivY"&gt;The other new element is available for Windows and Mac desktop Chrome users in the US, where it will keep an eye on shopping carts you haven’t checked out yet. If you open up a new tab page, there’s a “Your carts” card that will hold sites where you’ve added items, and Google says that at some stores, there may be a discount waiting when you come back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus’ latest true wireless earbuds offer noise cancellation for $99</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/okbTRFLEISgenYk-aiOXjOuipts=/30x0:1410x920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70281630/image.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Buds Z2 in black and white.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uVNUnN"&gt;OnePlus’ latest pair of true wireless earbuds are the $99 OnePlus Buds Z2. They’re double the price of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515636/oneplus-buds-z-earbuds-announced-features-price"&gt;$49.99 OnePlus Buds Z&lt;/a&gt; from last year but now benefit from active noise cancellation, a shorter stem, and a more lightweight construction. They’re available now in the US and will release in the UK and EU on December 20th for £99 and €99, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdarED"&gt;Although the Buds Z2’s price sits halfway between the Buds Z and OnePlus’ more premium $150 Buds Pro, it actually has better battery life than both of them. Battery life from the earbuds themselves is around five hours with ANC turned on, rising to seven hours when you turn it off, and combined with the case you get up to 38 hours total (dropping to 27 hours with ANC on). In comparison, the Buds Z offered five hours from the buds and up to 20 hours including the case. The Buds Pro offer seven hours of playback with ANC off, five hours with it on, and up to 31 hours when combined with the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4Wlb4v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Buds Z2 offer up to 38 hours of battery life with their case&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1RSCot"&gt;Elsewhere, the Buds Z2 match many of the specs of the Buds Pro, despite their more affordable price. They offer the same 94ms of latency when used in their “Pro Gaming mode,” there are still three mics in each earbud, they come in either black or white, and they even have the same 11mm drivers as the Buds Pro. But the Buds Z2 don’t offer wireless charging, a feature present on the Buds Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAuFTC"&gt;The $99 price point is proving to be increasingly competitive for true wireless earbuds equipped with noise canceling. Most notably, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;Nothing’s Ear 1 earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which come from OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei’s new company, offer noise cancellation as well as wireless charging support at that same price point. Increasingly, you don’t have to pay much more than $100 to get a feature-rich pair of true wireless earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo says test vehicle was in manual mode when it struck a pedestrian in San Francisco</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/waXbatJxvDwDk9MpXCM7JMxFMlc=/311x0:3689x2252/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70281606/qcxxlr3tsu581.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A Waymo vehicle apparently struck a pedestrian in Lower Haight in San Francisco | KWillets on &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/rhlcg8/our_neighbor_was_hit_by_a_selfdriving_car/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IJ7ZkG"&gt;A Waymo autonomous vehicle struck a pedestrian in San Francisco Wednesday night, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/rhlcg8/our_neighbor_was_hit_by_a_selfdriving_car/"&gt;according to a post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. A spokesperson for the Alphabet-owned company confirmed the incident on Twitter but clarified that the vehicle was in manual mode at the time of the collision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hl1Y4Z"&gt;The incident took place in the Lower Haight neighborhood of San Francisco, where Waymo has been testing its vehicles since last summer. The Reddit user KWillets, who claims to have witnessed the collision, posted a photo of a Waymo vehicle stopped in the middle of the road with the driver-side door open. A firetruck is parked to the side, while a number of firefighters and bystanders are gathered in front of the vehicle. According to KWillets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eqF9rZ"&gt;Just when we thought 2021 couldn’t get worse, we heard a thump. I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zsehg4"&gt;Our neighbors had gotten out of a ride share on the far side and one crossed while the other stayed behind apparently taking a picture. An SFPD patrol stopped to say something to her about being careful crossing the street(?), when a Waymo passed in the near lane and hit the one who had already crossed, as I think he returned. The victim was conscious and standing afterwards, but went to SFGH for a more accurate diagnosis. Hope he’s OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWGAX8"&gt;You can say there’s no such thing as Waymo, but as for me and Grandpa, we believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xZRTW8"&gt;Asked by a commenter whether the person who was hit was jaywalking, KWillets clarified some details: “They both got out somewhere near the upper left. One crossed to the right with many seconds to spare but apparently returned and was Waymo’ed. The other one ironically did not cross, but was accosted by a patrol car.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sRFHNm"&gt;When contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;KWillets noted that they only “heard” the incident and then replayed it on closed-circuit television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="723CIi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are aware of this incident involving a Waymo vehicle”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="beqHyv"&gt;“I’m OK with the testing,” KWillets says, when asked about autonomous vehicle companies using San Francisco as a proving ground, “but SFMTA has encouraged speeding and reckless driving on our block. I had already complained about poor signal timing and drivers racing the lights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7y2vD"&gt;The incident was picked up by Omar Qazi, a Tesla fan who tweets under the handle WholeMarsBlog. Katherine Barna, a spokesperson for Waymo, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kathbarna/status/1471449449146822657"&gt;responded to Qazi’s tweet&lt;/a&gt;, stating, “We are aware of this incident involving a Waymo vehicle, which was being driven in manual mode, and are continuing to investigate it in partnership with local authorities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vihi4k"&gt;In a follow-up email, Barna said that the collision took place on Haight Street, midblock between Webster and Buchanan. “The pedestrian was treated for injuries at the scene and was transported to the hospital in an ambulance,” Barna said. “The trust and safety of the communities in which we drive are paramount to us, and we will continue investigating this incident in partnership with local authorities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UXex12"&gt;The safety driver has been placed on “administrative leave” by Transdev, the workforce company that supplies drivers and other operational staff to Waymo, pending the outcome of the investigation, Barna said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3EQq9"&gt;A spokesperson for the San Francisco Fire Department referred questions to the city’s Police Department. In a statement, SFPD said that when officers arrived at the scene, a 33-year-old male pedestrian was in the roadway. The Waymo safety driver, a 37-year-old male, also remained at the scene and cooperated with investigators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bOAXb5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No arrests have been made in this incident”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oOdko3"&gt;“The pedestrian was transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries,” SFPD said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The cause of the collision is under investigation. At this time investigators do not believe that alcohol/impairment was a factor in this collision. No arrests have been made in this incident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6UJC4"&gt;Waymo’s safety drivers are not actually employed by the company, but rather are contracted out by Waymo’s workforce partner, Transdev North America. Over the last two years, some drivers in California and Arizona have complained &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21473719/waymo-cruise-self-driving-car-backup-safety-driver-pandemic-wildfires-california"&gt;safety lapses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21123049/waymo-self-driving-cars-workers-vendor-contracts-benefits-needles"&gt;reduced benefits&lt;/a&gt;, and poor communication while working as safety drivers for Waymo.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDu2HL"&gt;AV operators are required to &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/"&gt;report crash incidents&lt;/a&gt; to California’s Department of Motor Vehicles, which oversees AV testing in the state. The department recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834496/pony-ai-av-test-permit-suspend-california-dmv-crash"&gt;suspended the license&lt;/a&gt; of AV startup Pony.ai after one of its vehicles was involved in a single-vehicle crash while in autonomous mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyOYr9"&gt;Waymo has a better safety record than most AV companies, but the company has still been involved in a number of incidents. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21538999/waymo-self-driving-car-data-miles-crashes-phoenix-google"&gt;Waymo published 6.1 million miles of driving data&lt;/a&gt; in Arizona in 2019 and 2020, including 18 crashes and 29 near-miss collisions. In those incidents where its safety operators took control of the vehicle to avoid a crash, Waymo’s engineers simulated what would have happened had the driver not disengaged the vehicle’s self-driving system to generate a counterfactual. The company has also made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/21/20822755/waymo-self-driving-car-data-set-free-research"&gt;some of its data available to academic researchers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvhoYZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 16th, 11:52AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated to include a comment from Waymo’s spokesperson. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38QErU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 16th, 12:49PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated to include a statement from the San Francisco Police Department. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The House is a creepy stop-motion anthology coming to Netflix in January</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="58dteY"&gt;Once the holidays are over, and the &lt;em&gt;Home Alone&lt;/em&gt; marathons are done, you might be looking for something a little gloomier to watch — and it looks like Netflix has just the thing. The company just revealed the first trailer for its upcoming stop-motion anthology &lt;em&gt;The House&lt;/em&gt;, which debuts next month. It’s described as an “eccentric dark comedy about a house and the three surreal tales of the individuals who made it their home” that also has talking cats and mice for some reason. Each episode of the anthology is helmed by a different director — that includes Emma de Swaef and Marc Roels, Niki Lindroth von Bahr, and Paloma Baeza — and it’s produced by Nexus Studios. It also looks like it has quite the cast, with voice talent including Helena Bonham Carter, Matthew Goode, and Mia Goth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9ROd6"&gt;All three episodes will be available to stream starting on January 14th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple delays full office reopening and is giving every employee a $1,000 bonus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Park in Cupertino" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lnpnMzFmSPR6ZAIBNuxzY3gu6ns=/0x0:5149x3433/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70279002/1236193236.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WsOlSF"&gt;Apple has indefinitely delayed the date on which corporate employees will have to return to the office, according to a letter that CEO Tim Cook sent to staff on Wednesday. The letter, a copy of which was obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, said the company’s date for returning to work, was “yet to be determined,” and he encouraged all employees to get the coronavirus vaccine and booster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HLBgb"&gt;“Our offices remain open and many of our colleagues are coming in regularly, including our teams in Greater China and elsewhere,” Cook wrote. “As we look forward to more of our teams being together again, we will continue to make decisions based on local conditions and will be sure to notify you at least four weeks before beginning the pilot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awDSvn"&gt;The news was first reported by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1471237100255252484"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1471236946160619524"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News’&lt;/em&gt; Zoe Schiffer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKPsQi"&gt;Cook also announced Wednesday that Apple would be giving all employees $1,000. “These funds are intended to help you with your home workspace and can be used as you see fit,” Cook wrote. Apple spokesperson Nick Leahy confirmed the $1,000 bonus to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and says it will apply to every Apple employee, including retail workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgiBNs"&gt;An internal message to Apple employees said the $1,000 would appear in their next paychecks, and be subject to tax and withholding. “Keep in mind that when you return to the office, you’ll be bringing your Apple-owned equipment back, so you should consider what you’ll want for your home workspace,” the message reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YjAOP"&gt;The delay comes as COVID-19 cases rise and the omicron variant begins to spread. Workers were previously set to return to offices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789631/apple-employees-return-offices-february-1st-hybrid-work-pilot"&gt;on February 1st&lt;/a&gt; in a hybrid work pilot announced internally in November. That itself was already delayed, and it’s not the first time Apple has announced such a delay; the company has shifted its pandemic-related return-to-office plans in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633616/apple-delays-mandatory-office-return-january-covid-surge"&gt;past&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfoFF4"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22838172/apple-stores-close-retail-covid-19-cases-infections"&gt;closed three retail stores&lt;/a&gt; this week in response to growing COVID-19 infections. On Tuesday, it began requiring customers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834419/apple-retail-store-mask-requirement-december-2021-omicron-covid"&gt;wear masks&lt;/a&gt; while inside its retail stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y94C8m"&gt;Cook told workers in the letter that he was “grateful” for their flexibility and resilience. “You continue to prove how much we can accomplish when we take on our challenges with boldness, creativity and — most importantly — together.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpPMjd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 16th, 10:54 AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds details from Cook’s letter to employees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
