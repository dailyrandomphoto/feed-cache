    <title>Apple botched the MacBook Pro notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x9TlV48LFAI48qHXlzAIzozo3O0=/25x0:1936x1274/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70015766/Apple_MacBook_Pro_16_inch_Final_Cut_Pro_10182021.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xxYGjp"&gt;The day that many have been dreading has finally arrived. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"&gt;Apple has added a notch to its new MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;. And somehow, Apple — notch pros at this point — managed to utterly botch the notch. Because the new MacBook Pros completely missed out on the most important part of the notch: &lt;em&gt;adding Face ID&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePfAmo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678603/iphone-13-notch-2021-face-id-touch-id"&gt;I’ve been on the record&lt;/a&gt; of being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/6/18057258/macbook-air-update-face-id-notch-bezel-security"&gt;extremely pro-MacBook notch&lt;/a&gt;: back in 2018, I argued that Apple &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do exactly what it’s done here: add a notch to its MacBook laptops, taking up the exact width of the persistent menu bar that already permanently lives on the top of its macOS software (barring the occasional dip into a full-screen app). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VsI5JT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The MacBook Air needs Face ID and a delightful notch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/6/18057258/macbook-air-update-face-id-notch-bezel-security"},{"title":"The iPhone’s notch: should it stay or should it go?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678603/iphone-13-notch-2021-face-id-touch-id"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tQHLHR"&gt;And to be fair, Apple has actualized most of the benefits of a notch: smaller bezels, particularly at the top of the display, allowing for Apple to at least play in the same ballpark (if still not quite on the same level) as the ultra-thin bezels that have become the norm on premium Windows laptops from companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2yZ10E"&gt;Which is why the lack of Face ID here is such a glaring miss. As a means of visual identity across its product lineup, the notch is practically synonymous with Face ID on Apple’s devices. Seeing one here (and then not offering the tech) is incongruous right off the bat. It starts things off on the wrong foot; sure, most people don’t &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the idea of a notch, but usually, there’s the acceptance that you’re getting the addition of Face ID. Here the cost of the notch returns far fewer rewards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9Xq8j"&gt;It’s possible that there are still technical issues here: maybe the Face ID module is just too big to fit into a laptop display, although Apple managed to fit it into both its iPhone and iPad hardware just fine. The existence of any number of IR-powered Windows Hello facial unlock systems would also indicate that the challenges (if they even exist) can be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a68sYc"&gt; Plus, look at the thickness of Apple’s new MacBook Pro lid:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h6ouCH7C7m5U_ybPSfd_JQVpctE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938870/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MBoLCy"&gt;You’re telling me that can’t fit a Face ID module? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phou79"&gt;The hardware is all there: the M1 Pro and M1 Max share the same architecture as the A-series chips that Apple has offered for years, and Apple already offers Face ID on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;its M1-powered iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. And Apple’s notch already conceals a few extra components: as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pogue/status/1450489697382408192"&gt;David Pogue notes on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, the cutout also hides Apple’s TrueTone sensor, light sensor, and an LED status light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8Quzzv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As you evaluate your opinion on the MacBook Pro’s notch, keep in mind that it houses more than just a 1080p camera. It also houses the TrueTone sensor (colors consistent in all lighting conditions), light sensor (adjusts brightness/keyboard illumination), and “camera on” LED. &lt;a href="https://t.co/XpKvhvtEWn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XpKvhvtEWn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— David Pogue (@Pogue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pogue/status/1450489697382408192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KhtKML"&gt;It’s easy to imagine Apple integrating a lot of the useful things that Face ID does on its phones directly into its laptops. The highly marketed ability to instantly boot the new MacBook Pros with the ultra-fast M1 Pro and M1 Max chips could go even faster by unlocking your computer before you’ve even touched the keyboard. Face ID’s password unlocks would be incredibly convenient on websites since you’re already staring at your computer the whole time. And Apple would get to play up its Animoji and Memoji avatars with the sorts of wacky demos the company thinks are hilarious at its events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VQbge7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple even says that Face ID is more secure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YwhXQZ"&gt;The lack of Face ID means that Apple is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; playing catch up to Windows. The past few years have seen Windows Hello facial recognition unlocking become more and more of a standard feature across laptops. Apple, meanwhile, despite arguably doing the most to popularize facial recognition unlocking (and Face ID) for personal tech, is still weirdly sitting on the sideline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="La6en2"&gt;Plus, there’s the security aspect. Apple &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; to brag about how secure its computers are. And yet, the company insists on locking down its computers exclusively with Touch ID — security tech that is, by Apple’s own estimations, orders of magnitudes less secure. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204587"&gt;According to Apple’s documentation&lt;/a&gt;, the odds of guessing a four-digit passcode are 1 in 10,000. The odds of someone else having a matching fingerprint to unlock Touch ID on your computer are 1 in 50,000. But Apple &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208108"&gt;also says&lt;/a&gt; that the probability of a random person managing to unlock your device using Face ID is a whooping 1 in 1,000,000. Apple has better biometric security available that it could put on its laptops; it’s just choosing not to, year after year and redesign after redesign. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PjFa_Ynp8kmOnhpfBkcU_mo9AdU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938880/Untitled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The notch has arrived, whether you like it or not&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iD84Cf"&gt;Apple — and customers — do both still like Touch ID, at least conceptually. The argument for fingerprint-based biometrics has become a stronger one when wearing a mask for health purposes defeats a lot of the convenience of Face ID. And there have been rumors for years that Apple has been planning to bring back Touch ID to its iPhones in the form of an in-display sensor. But if Apple really is worried about losing some of the convenience of Touch ID, it could simply offer both security options, taking the bold step of actually letting its customers decide which biometric method they’d like to use. Or Apple could really take a stance on security and let users use &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; Touch ID and Face ID for even more secure biometric authentication, giving the company more security stats to tout and customers an extra layer of security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUZrdV"&gt;A notch for Face ID would have been acceptable — even great. Or maybe Apple really, truly believed that Touch ID was the right solution for its computers and that all the new MacBook Pros needed was a higher resolution webcam and smaller bezels. But in that case, Apple could have tried to engineer a hole-punch camera, like those found on virtually every major Android flagship, for a more seamless look and feel that would still allow it to cut down the bezels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hbb7vL"&gt;But instead, the new MacBook Pros are stuck in a terrible no man’s land: all the size of a notch, without any of the utility. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The MLB may launch streaming service for local games — no cable TV required</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a Major League Baseball (MLB)..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QHc7fNjyFZaQfB_tdfSCR6crjB8=/45x0:3764x2479/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70015718/1234971615.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IGTruc"&gt;You may soon be able to watch your local teams’ home games without cable TV, as the MLB is considering launching a web-based streaming service that will do exactly that (via &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/17/mlb-in-talks-to-launch-nationwide-streaming-service-for-home-games/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Shrinking viewership rates may be the main factor behind the potential streaming service. As the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; points out, the MLB viewership has dropped 12 percent this year in comparison to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFHPAf"&gt;The MLB already offers MLB.TV, a streaming service for out-for-market games. Unlike MLB.TV, the planned streaming service will only focus on local games that you can currently only view via regional cable. MLB.TV would still be available if and when the new streaming service launches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UZ5mcS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A subscription could cost anywhere from $10 to $20 per month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uovjtD"&gt;Having both MLB.TV and the new service would, in theory, let you view both local and out-of-market games without paying for regular cable, preventing you from having to deal with broadcast blackouts. This still isn’t the perfect solution — ideally, there would be one streaming service that lets you watch any game you want. That probably won’t happen anytime soon, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRmdUl"&gt;The new streaming service would give the MLB the chance to win back cable-cutting fans, airing the same games that you’d normally see on cable TV but without the added costs of cable. The &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; reveals that subscriptions for the service would vary based on location and could range anywhere from $10 to $20 / month. The MLB has experimented with having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/9/17100294/facebook-exclusively-streaming-25-mlb-games-2018"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18524132/youtube-mlb-baseball-games-exclusive-streaming-13-deal-sports"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; stream games in the past, but having a dedicated service for home games will make them more convenient to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtMzZ8"&gt;And as an added bonus, the MLB might not be the only sports league streaming on the service either — the National Basketball Association and National Hockey League may partner with the MLB on the platform, which could launch as early as 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get 10 percent off a PC you can build yourself at NZXT</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aAsUZCX3XDSgh_es0_ubGd_Zr-I=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70015591/NZXT_BLDKit_RGB_Banner_1920x1080_Blog_header_EN_JPG_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O8f2dO"&gt;For the next 48 hours, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnzxt.com%2Fcollection%2Fgg-sale&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F10%2F19%2F22732659%2Fget-10-percent-off-a-pc-you-can-build-yourself-at-nzxt-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NZXT is giving 10 percent off all of its pre-built BLD systems&lt;/a&gt;. This includes its pre-fab configurations, as well as any custom-tailored builds. With PC parts at something of a premium right now, a sale like this is fantastic for anyone that’s been biding their time on investing in a new PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K06gA1"&gt;Pre-builts are the easiest way to currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022"&gt;get your hands on a new GPU&lt;/a&gt; without having to spend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;an absolute mint&lt;/a&gt;, and with NZXT’s BLD service, you also get the added benefit of a two-year warranty on parts and labor, as well as guaranteed performance right out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQIvpN"&gt;While NZXT has been in the pre-built PC game for a while now, a new service it’s offering is the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnzxt.com%2Fcollection%2Fbld-kit&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F10%2F19%2F22732659%2Fget-10-percent-off-a-pc-you-can-build-yourself-at-nzxt-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NZXT BLD kit&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first time a major PC manufacturer has offered a service like this and sounds perfect for anyone that's wanted to build their own PC but has found the prospect too intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISCIWB"&gt;The BLD kit comes with an illustrated guide, and videos to lead you through each step of the process.

This absolute beast of a machine might be considered by some to be overkill, but is just what you’ll need if you need to edit photos or videos or play games at their highest settings. This desktop comes equipped with an RTX 3090 GPU, 64 GB of RAM, and an unlocked Intel i9-11900K CPU. This model even includes primary and secondary storage with a 4TB hard drive and a 1TB SSD.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What is the new Apple Music Voice plan, and who is it for? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oPgqtP1eofYR_1L0cCWkwBn9-1o=/0x87:1306x958/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70015526/Apple_HomePod_mini_Apple_Music_Voice_AirPods_3rd_gen_10182021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Music Voice relies entirely on your dulcet tones to play music from any Siri-enabled device&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BKzS5L"&gt;The new Apple Music Voice plan that Apple announced at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max"&gt;“Unleashed” event&lt;/a&gt; on Monday is causing some confusion. I’m here to help you understand this new, cheaper option, which capitalizes on the power of Apple’s smart voice assistant, Siri (don’t laugh).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dfonFq"&gt;Put simply, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733053/apple-music-voice-plan-playlists-price-siri"&gt;Apple Music Voice plan&lt;/a&gt; is a voice control-only access to the service’s catalog of 90 million songs. It arrives later this year, and with it, you can play everything — full albums, individual songs, Apple’s playlists; it’s all-you-can-eat Apple Music. The caveat is you have to use your voice to control it, and you have to play it through a Siri-enabled device, such as a HomePod Mini (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22723141/apple-homepod-mini-new-colors-price-release-date-features"&gt;now in some spiffy new colors&lt;/a&gt;), AirPods, or an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtGi64"&gt;What it is not is a fee to use Siri to play your own music. If you have tracks purchased through or stored on iTunes, you can still play those with the Apple Music app and control them with voice, as before. What paying for this service does is add access to the company’s streaming catalog for a lower price than its Individual or Family plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anApKx"&gt;Apple Music Voice seems best suited to casual listeners who don’t spend hours carefully curating playlists and just want to listen to some music on the fly. While you can request specific songs and albums, you can also just say, “Hey, Siri plays some ’90s Britpop” or “Hey Siri, play something chill.” There’s also access to Apple Radio.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i3X4-3Zt9-7jRKtrziV3ZJqGzuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938603/Apple_HomePod_mini_hero_5up_10182021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HomePod Mini is a Siri-enabled smart speaker you can use to play songs on the Apple Music Voice plan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CNpJMp"&gt;The most significant difference between the two plans — beyond price: one is $4.99, and one is $9.99 — is access to the Apple Music app. With the Voice plan, you can’t open the Apple Music app, search for an artist or song, and select a track. Instead, you have to ask Siri to play the song you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lboR5"&gt;You can use the Apple Music app to see a queue of recently played music and suggestions for using Siri to control your music. There are also “suggestions based on the listener’s music preferences” that include limited content available for playback through the app, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-introduces-the-apple-music-voice-plan/"&gt;according to Apple&lt;/a&gt;. Apple hasn’t shared how exactly this will look or work yet, so we’ll have to wait for the service to roll out to test it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IFaIVk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The cheaper plan doesn’t let you create playlists&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l42mQc"&gt;The cheaper plan also doesn’t let you create your own playlists, manage your playback queue, download songs to your library, scroll the lyrics on your iPhone or iPad, or stream from any third-party speakers (such as Google Nest Hub, which does support the full Apple Music plan). It also won’t play some of the higher-quality audio formats available in Apple Music, such as lossless and spatial audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wT27Qb"&gt;You can use Apple AirPlay to play music through any and all AirPlay 2-enabled speakers you might have — which makes this plan a notch better than Amazon’s similar voice-only music streaming service. That plan — the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKLDPRYNF2VUAKMM"&gt;Amazon Music Unlimited Single Device Plan&lt;/a&gt; — costs $3.99 to access Amazon Music’s catalog, but you can only play it on one Echo or Fire TV device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJCX2r"&gt;What’s unique about both these voice streaming plans is that you can just buy a smart speaker — an Amazon Echo or a HomePod Mini — plug it in, and ask it to play music. (You can literally say, “Hey Siri, start my Apple Music Voice trial” and be up and running.) This takes away a lot of friction from getting going with streaming music, providing an easy set-up for someone who’s not very techie. It will probably make a great gift for your parents this Christmas if you’re tired of listening to The Eagles on their FM radio every time you visit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFg4eY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram will let users co-author posts and share likes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BG8S0n0OHYXez8Bi4C9GvtuoXk0=/0x1:1581x1055/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70015436/Collab_Post_Accept_or_Decline_Flow.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users will have to accept an invite to be co-author of a post.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HKMpaI"&gt;Instagram is kicking off a week of product reveals with the announcement of “Collabs,” a new feature that lets two users jointly share ownership of a single feed post or Reel. Tomorrow, it’s following this up by testing a new way to add a nonprofit fundraiser to a post, and finally on Thursday it’s rolling out the ability to create photo and video posts on desktop, as well as launching new music-focused effects for Reels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLIFRT"&gt;The new Collabs feature effectively allows two accounts to co-author a post or Reel. The post or Reel will appear jointly to each user’s followers and will share the same comment thread, as well as view and like counts. Collabs are enabled from the tagging screen, after which the second account will have to accept the invite.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yyh-hdEDxNXdrfzjxL00OMKUBUs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938184/Reels_3D_Lyrics.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the new 3D Lyrics effect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rnE5YF"&gt;The service is also rolling out the ability for users to post photos and videos from desktop browsers on Thursday, following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550010/instagram-post-from-desktop-web-browser-testing"&gt;limited test earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. This might sound like a very basic feature to only now be coming to desktop, but Instagram’s desktop functionality has historically lagged well behind what’s possible on its apps. It only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21215449/instagram-dm-web-browser-update-direct-message"&gt;added DMs to the browser last year&lt;/a&gt;, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwY2Gq"&gt;Finally, there are a couple of minor features also coming this week. Tomorrow, Instagram will start testing a new way to create fundraisers in posts, which will be accessible after tapping the “+” button on the top right of its interface. There are also a pair of new music-focused features coming to Reels on Thursday. Superbeat adds effects to a video to the beat of a song, while Dynamic and 3D lyrics offer a more interesting way to display song lyrics during a video. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Casio G-Shock GSW-H1000 review: bad timing</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A shock to the ecosystem&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="NoJZpA"&gt;Although the Wear OS watch market has been dominated by the likes of Fossil for many years now, Casio has quietly carved out a niche for itself as a purveyor of more rugged devices. The Japanese company first released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/29/11525360/casio-smart-outdoor-watch-fs10-android-wear-review"&gt;Smart Outdoor Watch&lt;/a&gt; all the way back in 2016 and has continued to iterate on the idea with Pro Trek-branded models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4ZCAE"&gt;All this time, though, there was one obvious question. Why hasn’t Casio made a G-Shock smartwatch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJUN5u"&gt;G-Shock is one of the most iconic watch brands in the world and has long had a strong association with streetwear culture. Unlike, say, Tag Heuer, whose Swiss luxury always seemed like an odd fit for smartwatches, many G-Shock models are both status symbols and relatively accessible digital pieces at the same time. It doesn’t make much sense for most people to spend thousands of dollars on a smartwatch that will likely be obsolete in a few years, but there are lots of G-Shocks that cost under $100. Surely this is the perfect brand for smartwatches?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtCwoi"&gt;Well, here’s the G-Squad Pro GSW-H1000. It’s Casio’s first truly smart G-Shock watch — unless you count some earlier models with limited Bluetooth functionality — and it’s available now for $699. That’s a high price for any smartwatch, and this one struggles to justify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t4fhRr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10813305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nf0lLW"&gt;G-Shocks come in several shapes and sizes, and the GSW-H1000 is definitely toward the bulkier, more rugged end of the lineup. It feels extremely well made, has 20-bar water resistance, and is absolutely huge. It’s not really the sort of watch I would normally wear, but I do quite like the way it looks. Then again, my wife immediately laughed at it and said, “You would need to be far more into streetwear than you actually are in order to pull that off.” Which, ouch. But maybe that means Casio has pulled off the G-Shock look?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ni56nC"&gt;Style is, of course, subjective, and I think this watch achieves what it was going for. But if you’re into the subtler, more slimline G-Shocks like the &lt;a href="https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/the-casio-g-shock-value-prop"&gt;recently popular GA-2100&lt;/a&gt;, just know that this very much isn’t that. While it was comfortable enough on my wrist, I’m not sure I could recommend it to people with smaller frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YB0Xw5"&gt;In truth, the GSW-H1000 isn’t all that different to Casio’s prior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/17/17247436/casio-pro-trek-smartwatch-wear-os-cheaper-version"&gt;Pro Trek Wear OS watches&lt;/a&gt;. The focus is more on fitness than hiking this time around, but the physical proportions are similar and you still get the compass, altitude sensor, barometer, and GPS connectivity. (One major omission is any form of NFC, so there’s no mobile payments support.) The proprietary barrel charger is as awkward as ever, and Casio is also still making use of a dual-layer LCD that can extend battery life up to a month in its basic monochrome timekeeping mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvkD3b"&gt;Underneath that monochrome display is a fully circular 1.2-inch 360 x 360 LCD screen. It feels quite small relative to the rest of the watch, but it isn’t difficult to use, and I like that it doesn’t dominate the watch’s design. The bigger problem is that it just doesn’t look great compared to the OLED panels used in most smartwatches — it’s quite low in contrast and isn’t easily visible in bright sunlight. The monochrome layer, however, can be left on all the time and is much more glanceable if you don’t need to use it for anything complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VKaUU9TzpqKDPGCvsHPxUImXrv0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22935253/IMG_0233.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ppkkpn"&gt;One slight oddity with the GSH-H1000 is that Casio included very few watchfaces. You only get an information-dense digital face, a basic analog option, and one that matches the layout of the monochrome LCD. That latter setting was my favorite because it felt less jarring shifting between always-on and active display modes. Obviously, you can download whatever watchface you like from the Play Store, but it’s clear that Casio designed this watch around the dual-layer mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbRatj"&gt;The sense that this is more of a curated Wear OS product extends to the software, which is built around a dedicated Casio app that you activate with the bottom-right button on the watch. This handles features like the barometer and altimeter, as well as letting you access G-Shock Move, a fitness-focused app that you have to install on your phone alongside the base Wear OS app, which is a slightly awkward process. Once set up, though, G-Shock Move can be linked to Google Fit and supports a ton of activities — from paddleboarding to fishing — and I found it worked well for tracking my bike runs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tN3kv1"&gt;The unfortunate thing about this watch’s software is that Casio announced it right before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;Google and Samsung came out with the Galaxy Watch 4 and Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;, which is the biggest refresh Google’s smartwatch platform has received in several years. From Casio’s point of view, it might not be a necessary upgrade. So much of your interaction with this watch is through Casio’s own custom software, and if that’s what you’re buying it for, the underlying OS isn’t quite as important as it might be with a Wear OS Michael Kors. Even battery life concerns are mitigated somewhat because of the dual-layer screen — I got a couple of days’ use out of this watch easily in dual-layer mode.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X1032QZaBQC1WRv31WELwpeW3fg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22935254/IMG_0230.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3E5qkC"&gt;Personally, though, I would like my smartwatch to be functional as a smartwatch, especially if I’m dropping $699 on it. I’m not about to dual-wield this thing with an Apple Watch, after all. And Wear OS 2 is really just not fit for purpose at this point. That’s why Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617462/galaxy-watch-4-classic-samsung-apple-watch-google-ecosystem"&gt;essentially abandoned it with Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;, which lifts features from Samsung’s much better Tizen-based watches. Casio’s customizations work well enough by themselves, but I know what I’d rather have running behind the scenes. There’s no word from Casio on whether this watch will get an update, and I wouldn’t bank on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1IMXZ"&gt;The GSH-H1000 arguably has more going for it than any other Wear OS 2 watch ever made. The build quality is great, it has genuine brand cachet, and Casio has done a lot of work to improve the software and performance. If you’re a G-Shock fan who’s been waiting for a smartwatch and you love this particular design, then hey, this is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbA0Fq"&gt;But it’s expensive, the styling is divisive, and it’s come at a really bad time considering the launch of Wear OS 3. Considering all of that, it’s hard to imagine this being the right watch for many people. I do think Casio is onto something here and I’ve mostly enjoyed wearing the GSH-H1000, but I have to think there’s going to be a more broadly appealing G-Shock smartwatch somewhere down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s digital wallet finally launches... without Diem cryptocurrency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M05wGRo7g5aJkhQPMbcXApy_p1M=/119x0:1417x865/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70015384/NoviWordmark.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qgaP6N"&gt;Facebook is finally &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidmarcus/status/1450447443250728962"&gt;starting to roll out&lt;/a&gt; a “small pilot” of its Novi digital wallet today in the US and Guatemala, more than two years after it was first announced. The pilot program will let users send and receive money “instantly, securely, and with no fees” using the Paxos stablecoin, in partnership with Coinbase (&lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-to-power-crypto-custody-for-facebooks-novi-90dc8d3f5830"&gt;which will be serving as the custody partner&lt;/a&gt; that holds the actual funds for the pilot). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OHnMT"&gt;According to Facebook’s David Marcus, the head of F2 (Facebook Financial), the pilot is meant to “test core feature functions, and operational capabilities in customer care and compliance,” in addition to trying to demonstrate a viable use of stablecoins for payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R2Wwhh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Remittances are a critical way to achieve financial inclusion. Today, we’re rolling out a small pilot of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/novi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Novi&lt;/a&gt; digital wallet app in two countries — the US and Guatemala. People can send and receive money instantly, securely, and with no fees. 1/8&lt;/p&gt;— David Marcus (@davidmarcus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidmarcus/status/1450447439341580293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MWskf2"&gt;Most notably, though, is the fact that Novi is launching without its biggest feature: the Facebook-backed Diem cryptocurrency that was meant to be the cornerstone of the project. Diem was formerly known as Libra, before the name was changed in an effort to distance the now-independent group from Facebook, which initially started it. But Diem is still facing regulatory approval and has yet to launch its cryptocurrency in any country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DdlQgA"&gt;Libra came under heavy criticism when it was first announced, with multiple major partners (including PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, eBay, Stripe, and Mercado Pago) all pulling out from the project just a few months after it was announced. The company recently moved its operations back to the US after halting plans to get regulatory approval for its stablecoin in Switzerland. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/facebook-backed-diem-is-moving-from-switzerland-to-the-us.html"&gt;CNBC reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that Diem plans to launch just a single, US-based stablecoin tied to the dollar (instead of the broader scope the company had originally planned), but it's telling that the token wasn’t ready for Novi’s pilot today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zanXCc"&gt;Marcus does note in his announcement that Novi is still committed to Diem and will launch with the cryptocurrency when it does go live. The announcement doesn’t give any update on when that will be, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNsiVA"&gt;The launch today, however, establishes just how much Novi and Diem have been reduced in scope and scale since Facebook’s original announcement, and how far the company has to go to achieve its goal of a truly mainstream cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A missed opportunity&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Efv34S"&gt;Latin America isn’t a common destination in video games. In the few instances where digital landscapes have taken place in the region, results have been mixed. Characters often fall into the trope of saying random Spanish words during conversations to remind us of their nationality. Local socio-political issues are rarely handled with the proper nuance, while cultural portrayals can be hit or miss. &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt;, the latest installment in the open-world series by Ubisoft, doesn’t do much to &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22711610/far-cry-6-review-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc-ps4-xbox-one"&gt;evade these problems&lt;/a&gt;. But interestingly enough, it’s the first AAA game set in Latin America that gets close to putting Spanish front and center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3E983"&gt;Taking place in the Cuba-inspired region of Yara, &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt; is set amidst a clash of conflicts. The leader in power, Antón Castillo, who is voiced by Afro-Italian actor Giancarlo Esposito, rules over the citizens with a dictatorship. As everyone below the upper class is suffering under an abusive regime, protagonist Dani Rojas is tasked with uniting guerrilla groups to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQqyGm"&gt;Much like &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 5&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/29/17176308/far-cry-5-review-xbox-ps4-pc"&gt;elusive attempt&lt;/a&gt; at tackling white supremacy in the United States, it’s difficult to digest such heavy topics at face value in the context of the Far Cry formula. The games aren’t exactly known for their seriousness, as the core gameplay tends to lean on weapon experimentation and highly flammable objects in every corner to create your own &lt;em&gt;The A-Team&lt;/em&gt; set pieces. Sadly, the Latin American culture that the game wants to evoke is intertwined with this, making it harder to ignore the dissonance of calling “Amigos” to help you in battle while you plan the next step to take down a dictator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKBT6s"&gt;None of this took me by surprise, as I had arrived at the game expecting to see this conflicting clash of ideas. But I was willing to give Yara the benefit of the doubt. We hadn’t seen an open world setting in Latin America since &lt;em&gt;Ghost Recon Wildlands&lt;/em&gt; in 2017, also from Ubisoft, which presented such a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18563382/ubisoft-ghost-recon-breakpoint-politics"&gt;hurtful depiction of Bolivia&lt;/a&gt; that led the government to issue a &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-03-03-ghost-recon-receives-formal-complaint-from-bolivian-government"&gt;formal complaint&lt;/a&gt; to the developer. I was curious to see, then, if any lessons had been learned at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="far cry 6" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0yVAL9FEq1jlL1KPh0AOXkJJmg0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907623/Far_Cry__6_20211004072139.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NXHt0z"&gt;Right off the bat, the characters I met throughout the story did not provide me with hopeful signs. While often charismatic (if not overly cliche at times), it was hard to digest the uneven back and forth between English and Spanish during conversations. Dialogue is mostly spoken in the former, but characters are constantly replacing words without much coherence. Examples like president, dad, and revolution seem nonexistent in their vocabulary, replaced by presidente, papá, and revolución in 90 percent of the cases instead. This adds a certain welcoming touch, but when they frequently appear out of nowhere across conversations in English, it stands out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmMNRO"&gt;Some cases are even more abrupt, where instead of one or two words, it’s half of a sentence. In a few rare moments, some exchanges are completely in Spanish, and the game goes as far as translating them in the captions. Now, it’s worth mentioning that Spanglish (in a lesser or higher frequency) is not uncommon. Latinx folks born in the US are a good example of a demographic that makes use of it, but each and every case varies. I’ve met people who, for a myriad of reasons, knew very little Spanish. Meanwhile, a friend of mine would constantly switch between both languages without realizing it, which felt surprisingly natural and easy to follow in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GhuFD"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt;, however, it lacks authenticity. As of 2020, the only &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2020/02/03/english-official-language-these-five-countries/4556924002/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Latin American country with English as the official language is Guyana. This doesn’t mean that it’s nonexistent everywhere else, but in the majority of countries, Spanish is the leading language. This is the case of Cuba as well, which makes for a confusing presentation considering how the language is showcased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EWvBuj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Far Cry 6 review: a waste of potential","url":"https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22711610/far-cry-6-review-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc-ps4-xbox-one"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6dZJRV"&gt;One of the first standouts I noticed while navigating Yara is that every sign is in Spanish. Not just for transit purposes while you’re driving your car but also in stores; they have Spanish names and sell Spanish goods. Most of the graffiti carries that spirit on, too. This was enough of a surprise, but it went further from there. At any time, you’re able to grab your smartphone to take pictures or investigate reference images during missions. While not fully interactive, I found the phone’s UI to be entirely in Spanish as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zx1aM1"&gt;These decisions help to create subtle, yet meaningful moments as one traverses the region. I was taken aback when I heard the protagonist singing over songs on the radio in perfect Spanish. Interestingly enough, this happened again on several occasions, but it also included songs in English. Moments like these are a great showcase of the plurality of cultures that intersect every day with the media we consume, and it’s extremely common for music in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EH7aHZ"&gt;Sadly, the overall dialogue between characters is more uneven. There were some occasions during cutscenes where people spoke in full Spanish for a few seconds, but they all defaulted to the often exaggerated Spanglish I mentioned before. Screens scattered across the world often show speeches from Castillo on national TV, but while the presenter introduces him in Spanish, the speeches are always in English instead. Halfway through the main story, I couldn’t stop thinking about the missed opportunity to have the local characters speak their local language freely instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="far cry 6" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xr-seV4peCy6YzBGyF3EWsDmJIU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907637/Far_Cry__6_20211003001828.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EaPaU6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Max Payne&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;3&lt;/em&gt; is one of the rare instances where this idea was presented, with the townsfolk of São Paulo, Brazil speaking Portuguese around Max. The writing wasn’t stellar, considering that characters relied a bit too much on cursing to express themselves, but it was still a bold choice. Brazilians didn’t need a translation, but English-speaking folks have been &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGUWRA3uXx4"&gt;on a mission to translate&lt;/a&gt; everything from dialogue to other environmental objects, such as TV shows and newspapers. When part of the background interactions and imagery aren’t translated, it leads to a particular sense of authenticity that wouldn’t be present otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3QQXD"&gt;In one particular sequence in &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt;, two characters broadcast a song live as you defend both audio and light equipment surrounding the stage. Interestingly enough, this set piece begins with a cutscene focused on the singer, and the song lyrics are fully captioned in English. The song is then repeated on loop without captions as you play the mission, but the context is established early. Whereas the lack of captions in &lt;em&gt;Max Payne 3&lt;/em&gt; toys with the idea of seeing the protagonist in a foreign country without knowledge of the primary language, there is no narrative to back this up in &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dztJv9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Games that prioritize Spanish over English are few and far between&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zk5157"&gt;As a &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22272236/hitman-3-mendoza-argentina-representation"&gt;writer from Argentina&lt;/a&gt; who works for international outlets, I always play games in English. Pretty much all I’ve learned over the years has been from pure practice and exposition, whether it is from games, movies, music, or my work itself. Unlike Rojas, my phone isn’t in Spanish, but this comes from a place of being used to living through my second language on a daily basis. As I navigated Yara and encountered signs to read or dialogue exchanges that weren’t captioned, however, I was able to be on the opposite side for once, understanding the world and the people around me without the need for captions or a quick Google search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgZe7N"&gt;Games that prioritize Spanish over English are few and far between, even when their settings are inspired by local cultures and regions. For small studios trying to break through internationally, this can vary greatly. The Game Kitchen, a team based in Seville, Spain, initially wrote the script for &lt;em&gt;Blasphemous&lt;/em&gt; in Spanish. As the developers mentioned in an &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/88977a/blasphemous-was-written-in-spanish-now-its-characters-finally-speak-it"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;, months prior to the end of development, they decided to release the game in English. Budget constraints couldn’t justify having both languages, so they opted for the “right commercial choice” between the two. But these budgetary concerns aren’t the same for a conglomerate of studios as big as Ubisoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fU84V9"&gt;As I played through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708841/lost-judgment-review-ps5-xbox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lost Judgment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; during the past few weeks, a spin-off that comes from a series of games that have always been predominantly in Japanese, I realized how accustomed I’ve become to subtitles. Both &lt;em&gt;Lost Judgment&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt; are recent examples of localization with optional English voice over as well. And I believe that option should be present for various reasons. But it’s strange to see a game set in Cuba with the option to select Latin American Spanish voice-over when it should be the opposite case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hc2vj"&gt;During the latter half of the main story, &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt; introduces a Canadian antagonist who fails to pronounce Spanish properly during an interview with a local news channel. Then, after an encounter with Rojas, he mocks the protagonist by saying that there’s “surely a fiesta” waiting for them “with a piñata and everything.” It’s supposed to showcase an English-speaking person from the first world who is only interested in exploiting Yara for his personal gain and can’t be bothered to say the right verbs during a short conference. But it doesn’t come across that way because every Yaran character in the game talks like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3O633v"&gt;I had multiple issues with the ways Yara and its inhabitants are presented in &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt;. But what hurt the most was seeing the many ways the game &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have put Spanish in the spotlight, defying the predominance of English in Latin American settings. Ultimately, that promise goes unfulfilled. Unlike Max Payne, we shouldn’t be tourists in our own countries.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook content moderators protest low wages with mobile billboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="RUSSIA-US-EU-FACEBOOK-INTERNET-METAVERSE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/14N2l04Delz-UtGXfrQA8qB5RUg=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70015212/1235960474.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IBmMNp"&gt;Facebook moderators are protesting low wages at contracting agency Accenture in the form of a mobile billboard and an internal letter, according to a tip received by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Most of all, moderators say they just want to be treated as humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ly0zSp"&gt;The content moderators, who are contracted by Accenture, will run a mobile billboard today targeting Accenture CEO Julie Sweet. The billboard features a picture of Sweet, along with a prominent statement that reads: “Julie Sweet stop exploiting your workers. Pay up. Clean it up. Fix it.” &lt;a href="https://www.erieri.com/executive/salary/julie-sweet-4pqm"&gt;Sweet made a total of $17 million in 2020 alone&lt;/a&gt;, a sum that shot up drastically from 2019. The mobile billboard will start its journey in Bethesda, Maryland, the very place that Sweet resides, and come to a stop in Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Facebook moderator billboard" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nqh-qutKzCggiB3Koav3hFRATaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22927499/julie_sweet_facebook_moderators_billboard.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Foxglove Legal&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="arkzCD"&gt;Big tech companies like Facebook often outsource content moderation duties to third-party contracting firms, and Accenture is one of the biggest ones doing it. A report by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/31/technology/facebook-accenture-content-moderation.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; initially revealed the $500 million contract that Accenture has with Facebook to perform content moderation. The billboard compares that exorbitant number with the amount of money that Accenture moderators actually receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQ9Ymj"&gt;Hourly rates at Accenture fall between $16.50 and $18.50, with Ukrainian and Spanish language moderators on the lower end of that scale. They’re excluded from the $2 premium that bilingual moderators are rewarded with, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556436/whatsapp-spanish-language-content-moderators-contractor-equal-pay"&gt;prompted a demand for equal pay earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; — even still, nothing ever came of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOgttp"&gt;“In expensive cities like Austin, with prices driven up by the tech industry, this falls far short of a living wage,” the moderators’ letter to Sweet reads. “For every US-based content moderator, in the &lt;em&gt;Times’&lt;/em&gt; estimation, you pocket $50.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvnoO8"&gt;Accenture has continually ignored moderators’ pleas for higher pay. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona"&gt;Facebook moderators see some gnarly stuff&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s so bad that lawyers suing Facebook estimated that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/5/13/21255994/facebook-content-moderator-lawsuit-settlement-mental-health-issues"&gt;half of all moderators may develop mental health disorders&lt;/a&gt;. They’re subject to the horrors of cleaning up questionable content across Facebook’s services, which might include violent videos, sexual content, and hate speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JcyMXB"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.foxglove.org.uk/2021/10/19/letter-facebook-content-moderators-julie-sweet/"&gt;Foxglove Legal, the nonprofit organization backing the moderators&lt;/a&gt;, Accenture only offers moderators access to behavioral coaches, rather than professional psychological care. “Saying ‘we understand your concerns’ 100 times can’t undo a decade of her [Sweet] paying moderators peanuts — and offering life and wellness coaches instead of doctors,” Foxglove Legal said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yajs6g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The secret lives of Facebook moderators in America","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vQWm70"&gt;AI does play a role in moderating content on Facebook, but as an anonymous content moderator told us, it mainly deals with benign posts. Human moderators are the ones tasked with sifting through the more disturbing content. “For all the talk of algorithms and ‘AI’ catching harmful content to protect Facebook’s 2.8 billion users, we — and you — know the truth: moderators do the work,” the letter asserts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eh7pwb"&gt;In the end, moderators at Accenture just want to be recognized as humans and feel valued for the work they do. “People often don’t realize that we are quite essential workers,” said the anonymous moderator during an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Without us, all of social media wouldn’t be useful at all.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Flight Simulator: Game of the Year Edition will include DirectX 12 support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yAlez9YcgUALU6Q3KFgZMu3CVfM=/0x0:660x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70015078/flightsimgoty.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BoFOvU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator: Game of the Year Edition&lt;/em&gt; is arriving on November 18th with DirectX 12 support. The free update will include five new aircraft, eight new airports, and new discovery flights and tutorials. The big addition will be DirectX 12 support for PC players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VKALQ"&gt;Asobo, the developers of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;already shipped an update earlier this year that included huge PC performance improvements. This new DirectX 12 update should improve things even further for certain PCs, as DirectX 12 includes better CPU utilization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nRoU6l"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnljQuHhvM8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sdThQf"&gt;The move to DirectX 12 will also open the door to ray tracing in &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; in the future. Effects should include better water, improved shadows, and the usual reflections we expect to see in ray-traced games. Asobo is also introducing an updated weather system and a dev mode replay system in this upcoming update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDPVJw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator: Game of the Year Edition &lt;/em&gt;also includes access to a &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/19/microsoft-flight-simulator-announces-reno-air-races-release-date/"&gt;separate Reno Air Races mode&lt;/a&gt; that lets players race against their friends and other online pilots in a competitive multiplayer mode. The Reno Air Races expansion pack is the first major expansion for &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator &lt;/em&gt;and is modeled on the famous STIHL National Championship Air Races.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XzN-VCewEmrP3mlmToBYIEYEBmA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938233/BacktoBackXGS_Oct2021.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a busy period for Xbox Game Studios.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4mM5Y1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator: Game of the Year Edition&lt;/em&gt; will launch on November 18th, just after &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;’s debut on November 9th and ahead of the &lt;em&gt;Halo: Infinite&lt;/em&gt; release on December 8th. It’s part of a series of Xbox Game Studios launches this fall, including &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV&lt;/em&gt; on October 28th and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; joining Xbox Game Pass for PC on November 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlYvN4"&gt;Microsoft is also holding a special broadcast on November 15th to celebrate 20 years of Xbox. “While we won’t announce any new games, this anniversary broadcast will be a special look back at 20 years of Xbox,” &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/19/celebrating-the-biggest-three-months-of-back-to-back-blockbuster-game-launches-in-xbox-game-pass/"&gt;says Matt Booty&lt;/a&gt;, head of Xbox Game Studios. “We’ll share more details soon, so stay tuned.”&lt;/p&gt;
