    <title>Gamers! Protect your precious tendons with this tabletop hand massager</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VKMWiGX_osthJuU-6oV2JNrM-no=/0x40:1675x1157/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70333046/g04.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The test is simple. Remove your hand from the box and you die. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bauhütte&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A0rANT"&gt;Here’s something for the gamer that has everything: a &lt;a href="https://www.bauhutte.jp/product/msg01h/"&gt;tabletop hand massager&lt;/a&gt; that can be used to remove fatigue from your aching mitts and keep you on top form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HBLfg"&gt;Created by Japanese makers of gaming hardware and peripherals, Bauhütte, the device uses 15 heated air cushions to supposedly simulate the feeling of a real massage and, well, why the hell not. Bauhütte recommends you use the massager before gaming to warm up your hands; during breaks to improve circulation; and after you’ve finished to rub the stiffness out of your tired little fingers. Because you deserve it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7v9ud"&gt;A shiatsu mode will apparently rub your palms with firm pressure, while a “thimble” mode will pull and stretch each finger one by one. The only thing missing is a hand-holding mode to give you a squeeze of encouragement when you need a boost mid-game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tpq_PSpe1NIjaUVRBTxE5F0viog=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23136135/f01_1_a.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matte black everything. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4_b-F7U8Iee_kEunJzkzpaQHyHU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23136136/f01_2_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A pro gamer in his natural habitat. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q_Ztnzi2gxiLE9yssTD6fqEc-MM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23136138/f03_1_b.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shiatsu mode works the palm. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dfTk8o1U5HwW0TsomsfLm0od_M0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23136139/f05.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heating mode supposedly boosts circulation. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W2ae9Q"&gt;The device (which we spotted &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/behold-a-japanese-hand-massaging-device-for-gamers-1848285815"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is a fun little contraption, sure, but not that great of an innovation. You can find dozens of similar items online with a quick search for “electric hand massager,” though Bauhütte has given the thing a stylish matte black makeover to appeal to its target audience. The device pairs well with the company’s other SkyMall-for-gamers contraptions, including a &lt;a href="https://www.bauhutte.jp/bauhutte-life/winter-items/"&gt;heated mattress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bauhutte.jp/product/msg02f/"&gt;portable foot massager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RrrWj"&gt;Really, though, what terrifies me about this gadget is not what it says about the potential market for gaming-related frippery (every hobby has its trinkets), but the idea that it might one day be compromised in some sort of cyberpunk espionage plot. Imagine a high-stakes esports competition, where one team hacks a rival’s hand massager to break a few fingers before or even during the big game. What machines have given, machines can take away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbOYOt"&gt;The hand massager is apparently only available in Japan right now for around $150, but Amazon does stock a bunch of similar devices if you can feel those cramps coming on strong.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games Store closes out 15 days of free games by giving away the Tomb Raider trilogy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shadow of the Tomb Raider" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zW88mHcGr0QSdaHWD2EeNtb2Iyk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70332332/1adad5c96c2752dd1b034b597c48fcaf.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4qnlS2"&gt;If you’re a PC gamer who has not already done so, you may want to open up the Epic Games Store and &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/free-games"&gt;snag the final installment for its 15 Days of Free Games promotion&lt;/a&gt;. It’s especially worth your time because instead of gifting users a single title like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840143/epic-games-store-holiday-sale-free-games-coupon-shenmue-iii-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shenmue III&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/26/22854581/control-free-epic-games-store"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Epic Games Store is ready to cough up the entire rebooted Tomb Raider trilogy: &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider Game of the Year Edition&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/9/9695274/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rise of the Tomb Raider 20 Year Celebration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/11/17845776/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-review-xbox-ps4-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rZQCa"&gt;Trying to add the titles to your digital library earlier today was harder than it should’ve been, as continued server problems, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/29/22858478/fortnite-down-servers-offline-banned-epic-games-store"&gt;yesterday’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; outage&lt;/a&gt;, slowed down the store. It’s unclear if Epic Games is still having issues or if people just really wanted these games, but according to its status page, everything should be running smoothly now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0E6Sgo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Let’s go out with a bang.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the final day of 15 Days of Free Games, we’re giving you… not one, not two, but three (3!!) Tomb Raider titles!  &lt;a href="https://t.co/1bzgT8Rlyy"&gt;https://t.co/1bzgT8Rlyy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/G83gfAhncb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/G83gfAhncb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Epic Games Store (@EpicGames) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1476629157312229376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lG0qzd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Three reasons why Epic Games can give away $17.5 billion worth of games for free ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380895/epic-games-store-afford-give-away-17-5-billion-free-games"},{"title":"Epic spent at least $11.6 million on free games and gained 5 million new users in return ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418782/epic-games-store-free-games-cost-apple-trial-arkham-subnautica-mutant-year-zero"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Suqjls"&gt;If you’re wondering how Epic Games can afford to just give away games, check out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380895/epic-games-store-afford-give-away-17-5-billion-free-games"&gt;documents that surfaced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; as a part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;legal battle with Apple&lt;/a&gt; over the App Store. As Tim Sweeney &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1381021318640979968"&gt;confirmed on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, the company negotiates a flat fee for the giveaways instead of per copy, so suddenly billions of dollars worth of software become much cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iziznh"&gt;We don’t know how much the company is paying Square Enix to give away the Tomb Raider games, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875378/batman-arham-asylum-city-knight-free-epic-games-store-lego-batman"&gt;an &lt;em&gt;Arkham Trilogy&lt;/em&gt; giveaway in 2019&lt;/a&gt; only cost the company $1.5 million — a relative drop in the bucket compared to the money &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;brings in, plus the value of adding more customers to its games store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gclPEm"&gt;They will be available to add for free until January 6th at 11AM ET, so you have plenty of time to get them — unless you forget and never actually do it, so it’s probably a better idea to just click that “Get” button now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N0Xg5B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;That’s right! And it has proven to be a fantastic success in reaching gamers with great games and a fantastic investment into growing the business! &lt;a href="https://t.co/MN8OjM5FEP"&gt;https://t.co/MN8OjM5FEP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Yl0LmCZjKB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Yl0LmCZjKB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1381021318640979968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air and new iPad Mini have the same design and shape as the iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OqDG5sf2dQljUBF65yxBXRiy6oE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select iPad models go on sale quite regularly.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;We saw some of the best iPad deals of the year during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but if you missed out, there are still a couple of decent discounts available. Whether you’re after the high-end iPad Pro or the most affordable Apple tablet, the entry-level iPad, there’s a sale going on somewhere you may be interested in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2aVlZ"&gt;Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find the most notable deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals available on each iPad model that is currently available, some of which are outgoing models with freshly introduced replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ehglg9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="jzeS15"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10754964"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best iPad (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;Announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;the September iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"&gt;2021 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s latest entry-level tablet and replaces the outgoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;eighth-gen model from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, this would leave the older model ripe for the picking as retailers may drum up some fire sale pricing to get rid of old stock, but at this time, there are no good deals to be found on the eighth-gen model, if you can even find it. As a result, you can feel comfortable steering clear of the 2020 version and get the latest and greatest of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZ13y"&gt;The new, ninth-generation iPad starts at $329, just as its predecessor, though the base model now has &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; instead of 32GB. You can also still opt for the model with &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWwO2PdJE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $479. If you prefer your iPad to include cellular connectivity, the 64GB, LTE-equipped configuration runs $459 and the 256GB variant $609. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMpIom"&gt;The updates for the 2021 model include a faster A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP ultrawide camera with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt;, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. Many other features carry over from its predecessor; the new entry-level model has the same 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qnjdLM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/955948/9383?subId1=VergeBestiPadDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Silver%2F483978365&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; are both currently discounting 64GB iPad with Wi-Fi by $30, which remains the steepest discount we’ve seen on the latest model. The same $30 discount also extends to the 256GB model with Wi-Fi, which is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G91TLNJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon in the silver colorway for $449&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/955948/9383?subId1=VergeBestiPadDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F870975735&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart in either color&lt;/a&gt; for the same price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MKkmFl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"},{"title":"10 of the best Apple Arcade games for your new iPhone or iPad","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22815442/iphone-ipad-best-games-apple-arcade-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2019) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KUcr6D"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; from 2019 has the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations but with refreshed internal specs. It could be a good choice for fans of the classic home button, Touch ID, and a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;We’ve seen the outgoing 64GB iPad Mini with its older A12 Bionic processor drop to as low as $299, and the 256GB model was recently on sale for $495 instead of $550. At the moment, however, we’re not seeing any discounts on the older iPad Mini — at least in new condition. Many retailers have discontinued selling the last-gen model, and even refurbished versions are becoming more difficult to find. If you have your eyes set exclusively on the 2019 model, however, Apple is currently &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/793924/7613?subId1=VergeBestiPadDeals123021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FFUQX2LL%2FA%2FRefurbished-iPad-mini-5-Wi-Fi-64GB-Silver" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling a refurbished, Wi-Fi-equipped model&lt;/a&gt; with 64GB of storage in space gray for $339 instead of $399.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6tfbCt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="njqbEo"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jTw4HZ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sixth-generation iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; has a larger screen, a top-of-the-line processor, support for USB-C, and options for 5G. It has sadly forfeited its headphone jack in the process, but overall it’s a solid device that brings a fully refreshed design to Apple’s small tablet form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBkkEE"&gt;The changes and refinements to the new iPad Mini come at a heftier price, however, and the new 64GB Wi-Fi model now starts at $499. Electing 256GB of storage brings the price up to $649, while the 5G cellular models are $649 for 64GB and $799 for 256GB. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want the latest and greatest from Apple in a smaller format, this is where the action is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="zw4xQv"&gt;Right now, discounts on the sixth-gen Mini at Amazon are fairly limited. Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9BXKF5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering the 64GB model with Wi-Fi in select colorways&lt;/a&gt; for $489.99, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9DQDDQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model with Wi-Fi for $644&lt;/a&gt;. Best Buy isn’t offering a discount, however, it is offering new subscribers six months of Apple Music and Apple News Plus — as well as three months of Apple TV Plus — when they &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUz2VOgrdA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;purchase the 64GB iPad Mini with Wi-Fi at full price&lt;/a&gt;. If the prior-generation iPad Mini has given any indication, deals on the 2021 iPad Mini might be light and infrequent moving forward, partly because it has such minimal competition in its product segment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. Apple has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, too, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-generation iPad Air comes in 64GB and 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at around $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than the prior gen. The units equipped with LTE start at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2yrbb"&gt;We’ve previously seen the base model drop to as low as $489. While it’s currently not available for that cheap, Walmart is selling the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229396/9383?subId1=VergeBestiPadDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F650223175&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wi-Fi-equipped model with 64GB of storage in multiple colorways for $539&lt;/a&gt;, a modest 11 percent off the typical list price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-generation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year, which means there are many deals to be had on the prior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-generation iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model, when this design was first established, aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike some of the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10917835"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance but only if you’re interested in buying the massive 1TB variant. Right now, Best Buy is selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjJQICs36o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB, Wi-Fi-equipped variant&lt;/a&gt; in silver for $1,099.99 instead of $1,299.99. Additionally, Best Buy will throw in a six-month subscription to Apple News Plus and Apple Music, if you’re a new subscriber, as well as three months of Apple TV Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important factor to your purchasing decision, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-gen model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kIHPXF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mini LED display reportedly coming to 11-inch iPad Pro next year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569690/mini-led-11-inch-ipad-pro-macbook-air-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="I5hP3e"&gt;If the latest model is what you desire, the 11-inch, 128GB iPad Pro with Wi-Fi starts at $799. While we’ve previously seen the price of this model drop to as low as $649.97, right now &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-11-inch-Wi%E2%80%91Fi-128GB/dp/B0932B5NVD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is only selling it in silver for $749&lt;/a&gt;, which is a modest $50 discount. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-11-inch-Wi%E2%80%91Fi-128GB/dp/B0931Z3CWQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is also currently discounting the 11-inch, 1TB model with Wi-Fi&lt;/a&gt; to $1,429, a $70 discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhnrgA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10840379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj7Nj6"&gt;Meanwhile, the 12.9-inch, 128GB model with Wi-Fi is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932BKSLP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon in silver for $999&lt;/a&gt;, the second-best price we’ve seen on Apple’s high-end tablet to date. Amazon is also selling the Wi-Fi-equipped, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0931ZZBJ9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09328Z69V/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2TB configurations&lt;/a&gt; for around $100 off — a slight discount, to be sure, but one of the better deals we’ve seen this year. If you’re looking for the 256GB model with Wi-Fi, it’s &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F385211636%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Walmart for $1,099&lt;/a&gt;, a $100 discount, or at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932DZPW2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $1,103&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canon’s flagship DSLR line will end with the EOS-1D X Mark III, eventually</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dbX_qDi9y-beWjD7duTcufjg94s=/0x0:1445x963/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70332118/1DXbody_3Q_hiRes.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Canon EOS-1D X Mark III&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Canon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0KNIqu"&gt;When Canon revealed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21054254/canon-eos-1d-x-mark-iii-professional-dslr-announcement-news-price-specs-ces-2020"&gt;EOS-1D X Mark III&lt;/a&gt; in January 2020, we proclaimed that the DSLR “still isn’t dead,” but that camera will mark the end of the line for a flagship model that some pro photographers still swear by to capture everything from sporting events to wild animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OuN6NA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An end to the production and development timeline of the EOS-1 is estimated as “within a few years.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i3eqfW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.canonrumors.com/canon-exec-confirms-that-the-eos-1d-x-mark-iii-is-canons-last-dslr/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CanonRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out an interview Canon’s chairman and CEO Fujio Mitarai gave this week to the Japanese newspaper &lt;a href="https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/economy/20211228-OYT1T50000/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yomiuri Shimbun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://ymcinema.com/2021/12/28/canons-chairman-and-ceo-fujio-mitarai-eos-1d-x-mark-iii-is-our-last-dslr/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Y.M. Cinema Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).  The piece highlight how high-end mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras have taken market share digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras previously dominated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDw5GE"&gt;In it, the CEO is quoted (in Japanese, which we’ve translated to English) saying “Market needs are rapidly moving toward mirrorless cameras. So accordingly, we’re increasingly moving people in that direction.” The article states that the Mark III is “in fact” the last model in Canon’s flagship EOS-1 series and that in a few years Canon will stop developing and producing its flagship DSLR cameras in favor of mirrorless cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3v2TEp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Canon reveals its EOS R3 pro mirrorless camera in full ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673196/canon-eos-r3-camera-price-specs-release-date-announced"},{"title":"Canon’s new camera kits make it easier to turn your DSLR and mirrorless into webcams ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336762/canon-webcam-accessory-kits-dslr-mirrorless-cameras"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hME1QS"&gt;However, despite what some headlines say, it doesn’t mean this is the end of Canon DSLRs (yet). While the article makes it plain that mirrorless cameras like Canon’s own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673196/canon-eos-r3-camera-price-specs-release-date-announced"&gt;EOS R3&lt;/a&gt; represent the future of the segment, it also says that because of strong overseas demand, the company plans to continue making intro/mid-range DSLR cameras for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A8E784"&gt;As for the Mark III itself, while a new model is not around the corner, its estimated lifespan as an active product is still measured in years. In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Canon US spokesperson confirmed, “The broad details of Mr. Mitarai’s interview as described in the article are true. However, while estimated as “within a few years,” exact dates are not confirmed for the conclusion of development/termination of production for a flagship DSLR camera.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung teases Exynos 2200 with AMD’s RDNA 2 graphics coming January 11th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KEgTJsb_Jz7ZuWI64xcM6kx_z5E=/266x0:1985x1146/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70331839/Screen_Shot_2021_12_30_at_5.17.19_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wRBqpn"&gt;Samsung has &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/exynos/playtime-is-over/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;started teasing its next flagship smartphone SoC&lt;/a&gt; — expected to be called the Exynos 2200 — ahead of a January 11th announcement with a tantalizing tidbit of information: the new chipset will feature a GPU powered by AMD’s RDNA 2 graphics architecture, better known for powering the next-gen graphics on the Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and AMD’s RX 6000-series graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TNfkkr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung’s leaked Galaxy S22 Ultra is just straight up a Galaxy Note now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="lLMoxs"&gt;Of course, given that the Exynos 2200 will be powering a smartphone, the new GPU won’t be magically enabling next-gen graphics on par with the most powerful consoles and gaming PCs. But it likely will enable some improvements in graphics, along with whatever other upgrade Samsung has up its sleeve for its latest flagship chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HjFMkm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlaytimeIsOver?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PlaytimeIsOver&lt;/a&gt;. The gaming marketplace is about to get serious. Stay tuned for the next &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Exynos?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Exynos&lt;/a&gt; with the new GPU born from RDNA 2. January 11, 2022. &lt;a href="https://t.co/0H2MeVUbeS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0H2MeVUbeS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Samsung Exynos (@SamsungExynos) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SamsungExynos/status/1476538563235831810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bZz6Yi"&gt;As a successor to 2021’s Exynos 2100, the Exynos 2200 will likely power some of Samsung’s most powerful phones in 2022, including the presumed Galaxy S22 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"&gt;S22 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. As is usually the case, though, it’s likely that phones using Samsung’s in-house designs will be limited to international models of its upcoming flagships, with the US variants presumably set to use Qualcomm’s recently announced Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWTdkT"&gt;Fortunately, we won’t have to wait long to get more details on the Exynos 2200 (or whatever Samsung calls it), given that the company is promising a formal debut on January 11th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s leaked Galaxy S22 Ultra is just straight up a Galaxy Note now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zbSEqAa5HvBi6XrDoYApqqsUvCE=/15x0:1065x700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70331734/s22U.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1476660792527306754" target="_blank"&gt;evleaks (Twitter)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZL2j1N"&gt;It looks like Samsung’s next flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S22 Ultra, will borrow more heavily from the Galaxy Note’s DNA than ever before. In fact, a newly leaked official render &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1476660792527306754"&gt;published by Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt; confirms that the phone is pretty much a Note in every way except for its name. Wider screen with more surface to write on? Check. S Pen silo? Check. Flat top and bottom? Yep. Around back is a camera array that sticks closely to the layout from the S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjmHlF"&gt;Personally, I think the S21 Ultra was one of the boldest, best-looking phones Samsung has ever produced — especially that sleek matte black version. It owned the large camera bump in a way that actually looked &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Galaxy S21 Ultra, in Phantom Black" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hqNHCbYQFfkdxl7hLhCT0VijTvk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248897/vpavic_210118_4377_0090.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra put a unique spin on the camera bump. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9xbO2A"&gt;While I’m glad to see Samsung has found room for the sensors in a way that keeps the back of the device uniform, there’s definitely something a little more bland about this design. It looks every bit like a Note 10 Plus or Note 20 Ultra with a revamped camera system, but maybe that’s exactly what some Samsung fans want. &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s22-ultra-black-images-awesome/"&gt;Real-world shots of the S22 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; have also leaked out recently, and yet again, it’s looking pretty great in black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLi9Xg"&gt;Whatever can help boost sales of the company’s traditional phones is probably the right move. The company is happy to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22859804/samsung-foldable-phone-sales-shipments-2021-forecast"&gt;talk up the momentum of foldables&lt;/a&gt;, but the S21 lineup reportedly disappointed in its retail performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AuSiwk"&gt;Based on past history, Samsung should announce the S22 family sometime in February. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="GWroGG"&gt;PCIe 5.0 SSDs have already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22851422/samsung-adata-pcie-5-0-ssd-ces-speed-date"&gt;started to get announced&lt;/a&gt; ahead of CES 2022, with Samsung and Adata teasing early hardware that supports the new standard. But it’s not just theoretical: Intel has released a new demo video showing off Samsung’s new PM1743 PCIe NVMe SSD in action (together with Intel’s Core i9-12900K CPU, of course) to hit data speeds over 13GB/s in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YH3LX7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Perks of the job! Was going to save this demo for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2022?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CES2022&lt;/a&gt; but with that off the table, why not just share it with everyone right now?! Here’s a 12th Gen ⁦&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/intel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@intel&lt;/a&gt;⁩ Core i9-12900K system paired with a new ⁦&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Samsung?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Samsung&lt;/a&gt;⁩ PM1743 PCIe 5.0 SSD getting over 13GB/s!! &lt;a href="https://t.co/oyL08KzDtV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/oyL08KzDtV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan Shrout (@ryanshrout) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ryanshrout/status/1476609814402945029?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HdrgbT"&gt;To put that in perspective, the PlayStation 5 touts a PCIe Gen 4 SSD as one of its main selling points, with Sony arguing that the ultra-fast speeds on its solid-state drive enable the near-instant load times on its consoles. &lt;em&gt;That &lt;/em&gt;drive tops out at about 5.5GB/s, or more than half of the speeds that the Intel / Samsung system can manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xxaDcV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"First super fast PCIe 5.0 SSDs teased ahead of CES","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22851422/samsung-adata-pcie-5-0-ssd-ces-speed-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WYC2i1"&gt;Of course, that kind of data transfer rate isn’t exactly the most feasible set up right now, given that it requires a rig with Intel’s latest, most powerful processor and an enterprise-grade SSD that isn’t even out yet (and, presumably, will come with a pretty hefty price tag whenever consumer-grade versions do hit shelves sometime in the future). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eh5OWq"&gt;Still, the demo is an impressive one that shows off the potential of what next-generation storage setups could offer once PCIe 5.0 drives do become the norm down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c41wbB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Plans to capture CO2 from coal plants wasted federal dollars, watchdog says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Operations Inside The NRG Energy Inc. Coal Power Plant" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e7W9uT-1pNS9Aszswgz-VWra69U=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70331211/643866618.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Water vapor rises from the NRG Energy Inc. WA Parish generating station in Thompsons, Texas, U.S., on Thursday, Feb. 16, 2017. The plant was home to the Petra Nova Carbon Capture Project, until it shut down in 2021 because of high costs.&amp;nbsp; | Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="36YVlb"&gt;The Biden administration wants to shove more money into projects that are supposed to capture CO2 emissions from power plants and industrial facilities before they can escape and heat up the planet. But carbon capture technologies that the Department of Energy has already supported in the name of tackling climate change have mostly fallen flat, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105111"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the watchdog Government Accountability Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hO15jY"&gt;About $1.1 billion has flowed from the Department of Energy to carbon capture and storage (CCS) demonstration projects since 2009. Had they panned out, nine coal plants and industrial facilities would have been outfitted with devices that scrub most of the CO2 out of their emissions. Once captured, the CO2 can be sent via pipelines to underground storage in geologic formations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcylDn"&gt;That’s not what happened. The DOE doled out $684 million to coal six coal plants, but only one of them actually got built and started operating before shuttering in 2020. Of the three separate industrial facilities that received $438 million, just two got off the ground. Without more accountability, “DOE may risk expending significant taxpayer funds on CCS demonstrations that have little likelihood of success,” the GAO says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="9guAAj"&gt;&lt;q&gt; There ought to be more congressional oversight &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OTp64u"&gt;To stop that from happening, the GAO says there ought to be more congressional oversight of DOE-funded demonstration projects. The GAO report also recommends that the DOE do a better job of choosing which projects to fund and that the DOE should establish more consistent “scopes, schedules, and budgets” for projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLreGg"&gt;It’s a critical time to figure all these things out, because CCS projects in the US are about to get a big boost. In November, Congress passed a bipartisan infrastructure bill that included $2.5 billion for CCS demonstration projects. It also includes another $6 billion for large-scale CCS projects and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606395/pipeline-battle-co2-removal-carbon-capture-bipartisan-infrastructure"&gt;pipelines to transport CO2&lt;/a&gt; to storage sites. Altogether, the new infrastructure law marks the largest investment in carbon capture and storage in the history of the technology, &lt;a href="https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/news-media/latest-news/us-congress-passes-bill-with-the-single-largest-ccs-infrastructure-investment-ever/"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the think tank Global CCS Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3R7ftj"&gt;More money could be on the way if Democrats successfully push through their budget reconciliation bill, a $1.75 trillion environmental and social spending package. The bill could increase tax incentives for carbon capture technology, giving power plants outfitted with it a maximum of $85 per ton of CO2 captured compared to the current $50 maximum under the current 45Q tax credit. Power plants would need to capture at least 75 percent of their emissions in order to qualify for the tax credit, under the new parameters in the bill. It’s a requirement that some CCS advocates &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/big-payout-more-co2-greens-split-over-dems-ccs-plan/"&gt;want to eliminate&lt;/a&gt;, because they think the high standard could chill investment in the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0F7uP"&gt;Investors’ cold feet doomed CCS demo projects at coal plants that the GAO studied, says the Clean Air Task Force. The nonprofit, which supports CCS technology, is one of the groups pushing to get rid of the 75 percent requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCSb8K"&gt;“Coal power projects were not great candidates for demo dollars not primarily because of technical issues with the plants but because they couldn’t secure outside investor support,” Lee Beck, international director of carbon capture at the Clean Air Task Force, said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YW14Ok"&gt;Falling natural gas prices and uncertainty around markets for carbon credits “negatively affected the economic viability” of coal plants with carbon capture technologies, the report says. Adding CCS to power plants also increases the cost of electricity production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hu1fPY"&gt;Compared to power plants, capturing carbon from industrial facilities — for example, those that make ammonia used in fertilizer — can be more cost effective because they often produce more concentrated streams of CO2. Because the CO2 in coal plant emissions is relatively diffuse, carbon capture devices hooked up to coal plants require more energy to run. Beck called the DOE’s spending at industrial sites a “big success” since two of the three projects got up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZDuh9"&gt;In comments sent back to the GAO, the DOE said that developing CCS technologies for new coal plants is important because “current trends indicate that globally many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641178/global-power-sector-emissions-rise-pandemic"&gt;new coal power plants will continue&lt;/a&gt; to be built in coming decades.” The GAO also says that the US “will need to rely on CCS as an essential mitigation option” for climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="i2rz6l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They are simply fossil fuel subsidies by another name.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VJMP0e"&gt;Other environmental advocates are much more skeptical of the technology and say the GAO report only shows that CCS projects are a bad investment. “We should stop deploying hundreds of millions of dollars to prop up the industries responsible for the climate crisis through fantasy technologies like CCS,” Adrien Salazar, policy director at the nonprofit Grassroots Global Justice Alliance, wrote to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email. “Federal investments for CCS are greenwashing – they are simply fossil fuel subsidies by another name.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kWlAKE"&gt;CCS paired with a polluting power plant has yet to be rolled out at a commercial scale, according to the GAO report. For the most part, Salazar points out, the technology has been used by the fossil fuel industry &lt;a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/fossil-gas/world-cannot-meet-climate-targets-relying-carbon-capture-and-storage/"&gt;for a process called enhanced oil recovery&lt;/a&gt;. Fossil fuel companies shoot captured carbon dioxide deep into the ground to push out hard-to-reach oil reserves. So critics of CCS say the technology is just a tactic to keep the oil and gas industry afloat even as the world increasingly turns to renewable energy to stave off the climate crisis. Even if the captured CO2 isn’t used for enhanced oil recovery, they worry, the technology might extend the life span of gas and coal power plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imqqrO"&gt;Development in any new oil, coal, and gas infrastructure needs to completely stop in order to avoid catastrophic climate change, the International Energy Agency warned in a landmark &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; this year. That’s coming from an agency that formed in the 1970s to safeguard the world’s oil supply but has more recently heeded urgent calls from the scientific community to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;within a few decades&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Two NFT copycats are fighting over which is the real fake Bored Ape Yacht Club</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PHAYC leftward-facing Bored Ape Yacht Club avatars" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p_uWUfl1t3tugia26lqE2D3MTug=/0x0:1352x901/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70331194/Screenshot_2021_12_30_140753.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4cnebo"&gt;A pair of non-fungible token projects are testing the boundary between plagiarism and parody. Digital marketplace OpenSea has banned the PHAYC and Phunky Ape Yacht Club (or PAYC) collections, both of which are based on the same gimmick: selling NFTs with mirrored but otherwise identical versions of high-priced Bored Ape Yacht Club avatars. Now the dueling projects are selling their apes while dodging bans from other marketplaces, becoming the latest example of how the NFT world handles copied art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvitS4"&gt;Bored Ape Yacht Club (or BAYC) NFTs are some of the most expensive crypto art assets — they recently overtook CryptoPunks as the &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/89060/bored-ape-yacht-club-nfts-flip-cryptopunks-floor-price-in-ethereum"&gt;highest-priced NFT avatars&lt;/a&gt; with the cheapest available ape selling for $217,000. Like other avatars, though, anybody can technically copy or modify the associated ape picture. So PAYC and PHAYC simply flip the right-facing BAYC avatars to face left, associate them with cryptocurrency tokens, and resell them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="untLg0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6MdGmz"&gt;PAYC announced its launch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/phunkyApeYC/status/1467946301748748292"&gt;in early December&lt;/a&gt; with a loose mission statement &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/phunkyCaesar/status/1468896212019400704"&gt;promoting decentralization&lt;/a&gt; and denigrating “rich douchebags” who had (allegedly) taken over the original ape market. It called back to CryptoPhunks, &lt;a href="https://editorial.superrare.com/2021/08/19/cryptophunks-cryptopunks-parody-or-copycat/"&gt;a similar project&lt;/a&gt; that flipped and resold expensive CryptoPunks images earlier this year. Early arrivals could mint left-facing apes for free starting December 28th, while others paid a fee of .042 ETH (currently around $157).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYbn62"&gt;PHAYC launched shortly after with a tongue-in-cheek website describing the project as “a limited NFT collection where the token itself offers no membership and no allegiance,” an inversion of the promise made by BAYC creator Yuga Labs. One PHAYC community member &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/30/nft-project-bored-ape-yacht-club-spawns-left-facing-copycats/"&gt;described the project to &lt;em&gt;CoinDesk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as “a satirical take on the current state of NFTs and members of the NFT community who might be taking the NFT market a little too seriously.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Zl8yG"&gt;Somewhat ironically, PAYC and PHAYC have since fought on Twitter over which one is the &lt;em&gt;authentic &lt;/em&gt;Bored Ape Yacht Club ripoff, with PAYC’s founder &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ape_musa_i/status/1476472038491508736"&gt;referring to PHAYC&lt;/a&gt; as a “cash grab fraud project.” PHAYC charged people to mint its apes, and &lt;em&gt;CoinDesk&lt;/em&gt; reports that it took in around 500 ETH (or around $1.8 million) in sales. By contrast, it says PAYC earned around 60 ETH (or roughly $225,000) from its paid sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odlAfx"&gt;Both projects may be in legally dicey territory. It’s common for NFT lineups to copy each other’s art styles or use similar names. But Yuga Labs owns the copyright on its ape images, and PAYC and PHAYC were booted from OpenSea apparently for violating its rules against copyright infringement. (PAYC was also removed from competing markets Rarible and Mintable, although PHAYC is still listed on Rarible.) If Yuga Labs files a formal legal complaint, PAYC and PHAYC could potentially defend their apes as transformative fair use, following the footsteps of people like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/18/17979422/richard-prince-instagram-lawsuit-fair-use-defense-guide"&gt;appropriation artist Richard Prince&lt;/a&gt;. But there’s very little legal precedent surrounding NFTs at all, let alone their copyright implications specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7t2m8"&gt;Yuga Labs didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it might file such a complaint, and PHAYC didn’t respond to a Twitter message about the issue. PAYC &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/phunkyApeYC/status/1476609081209069568"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that it hasn’t received any legal threats from the BAYC team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VM3ZmA"&gt;So far, both projects appear more concerned with trying to make their apes tradeable online. NFTs are theoretically supposed to live outside any given platform, but markets like OpenSea have become huge bottlenecks by simplifying the selling process. While the sites have hosted plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22334527/nft-scams-artists-opensea-rarible-marble-cards-fraud-art"&gt;NFT projects based on stolen art&lt;/a&gt;, they’ve delisted copycats like CryptoPhunks in response to complaints from companies like CryptoPunks creator Larva Labs, and they’ve banned some &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/calvinbecerra/status/1454892316200562692"&gt;individual NFTs&lt;/a&gt; that were stolen from their owners. Both &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/phunkyApeYC/status/1476412719704068097"&gt;PAYC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/phaycbot/status/1476310090735099905"&gt;PHAYC&lt;/a&gt; have tweeted that they’re working on alternative marketplaces that can sell the leftward-facing apes — although, by the time you read this, someone else might have started selling an even &lt;em&gt;faker &lt;/em&gt;fake ape.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW, IBM, Panasonic, and Mercedes to skip planned in-person events at CES 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Attendees walk through the Las Vegas Convention Center January 10, 2020 on the final day of the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show (CES)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMGvZxqSubxFb3b2WJ-BhDTYvAk=/5x0:4996x3327/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330060/1192992530.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nb0HqF"&gt;BMW has announced it will no longer be showing up in person for media events at CES 2022 — the giant electronics show that’s typically held each January in Las Vegas, attracting well over 100,000 attendees per year from around the world. It’s the latest company to at least partially bail on the show, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;following announcements from Intel, AMD, GM, Google, T-Mobile, Amazon, Meta,&lt;/a&gt; Waymo, and a large number of tech publications, including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as COVID cases rise in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="EggSjj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reports indicated BMW will show a car with color-changing paint and a “Theater Screen” for in-car cinematic experiences&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PPzBBN"&gt;A statement from BMW says, “Out of an abundance of caution, BMW will move all planned media activities at CES to a fully online program from Germany on January 5.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBJICy"&gt;CTA, which produces the event, says in a statement today that “CES is excited to return ‘home’ to Las Vegas for a physical event in just a few days. Construction of exhibitors’ show floor space is well underway and over 2200 companies will be participating in person. For those attendees who are unable to join us in Las Vegas, they can participate digitally. Important details on &lt;a href="https://www.ces.tech/Logistics/Health-Protocols.aspx"&gt;updated health protocols&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ces.tech/Logistics/CES-2022-Know-Before-You-Go.aspx"&gt;show entry process&lt;/a&gt; can be found at &lt;a href="https://www.ces.tech/"&gt;CES.tech&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfckIt"&gt;While BMW’s media events are a late scratch compared to some other announcements, it’s not the only featured exhibitor recently announcing a change of plans, as IBM said it will forgo in-person appearances. In a statement, an IBM spokesperson says, “Due to the evolving COVID conditions - and out of an abundance of caution - IBM has recently decided not to participate on-site in Las Vegas this year. We do still look forward to participating virtually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esTeSB"&gt;On Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/ces-2022-amid-covid-surge-mercedes-amd-and-oneplus-drop-out-joining-microsoft-google-intel/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that fellow German automaker Mercedes-Benz is going to skip the in-person event as well, while &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/ces-2022-covid-dropouts"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said Panasonic, which usually has a massive central hall booth, is shifting to a virtual press conference showing with “limited on-site staffing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N96vro"&gt;In a statement, Panasonic North America CEO Megan Myungwon Lee says, “The health and safety of our employees, partners and customers remains our top priority. With this commitment in mind, we have updated our hybrid CES activation plans maintaining a modified physical footprint, with limited on-site staff, following CTA’s health safety protocols as well as our own proactive measures to ensure the health and well-being of attendees. We have shifted our press conference to a fully-virtual platform and will continue with our plan to deliver a seamless, virtual experience highlighting our newest technology products, solutions and innovations across Sustainable Energy, Smart Mobility, Immersive Experiences, Food Tech Solutions, Lifestyle Technologies and Healthy Environments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="u0NUAb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"CES 2022 in-person exhibitor list continues to shrink as AMD and MSI drop out ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wfe0FL"&gt;Some companies had already reduced their presence at the show over safety concerns. Over the last few years, BMW has had a significant showing at CES in recent years, demonstrating cars around the outside of the Las Vegas Convention Center while also showcasing innovative demos inside, like at the last pre-pandemic show in 2020 where attendees could customize their own concept car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZjwSg"&gt;This year at CES, &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/43494/bmw-will-show-car-paint-that-changes-color-with-the-touch-of-a-button-at-ces"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports BMW said it would have a car with color-changing paint, while &lt;a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2021/12/15/bmw-theater-screen-ces-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMW Blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said we should also expect to see a new Theater Screen that “really gives an immersive, cinematic experience in the vehicle” that could launch in high-end models like the 7 Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuXmmH"&gt;Mercedes will continue with &lt;a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/release-bb71195b68ec7523e1b4dfa8cc0e738b-digital-world-premiere-of-the-vision-eqxx-the-most-efficient-mercedes-benz-ever"&gt;an all-digital premiere of its new Vision EQXX&lt;/a&gt;, which it says is “the most efficient vehicle the brand has ever built.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="20hoUH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mercedes-Benz says it will go all-electric in 2030, but with a major caveat ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588587/mercedes-benz-electric-ev-2030-caveat"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nE3F6H"&gt;As of Thursday, LG, Sony, and Samsung told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they were still planning to attend in person. CTA president and CEO Gary Shapiro &lt;a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-ces-will-and-must-go-on-in-las-vegas-2502202/"&gt;published a Christmas Day op-ed in the&lt;em&gt; Las Vegas Review-Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that says, among other things, “CES 2022 will kick off 2022 in messy fashion, but it will be chock full of innovation and full of entrepreneurs and businesses. We will all be taking risks. But without risk there is no innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBIgSb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 30th, 10:26AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Noted that BMW and Panasonic will maintain a presence on the show floor, and added statement from Panasonic North America CEO.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvvAVt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 30th, 2:15PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from the CTA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
