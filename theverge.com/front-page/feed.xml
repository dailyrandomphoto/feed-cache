    <title>US recommends pausing Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine in an ‘abundance of caution’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nzVmvT"&gt;Federal agencies recommended that the United States pause use of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine until authorities can gather more information about reports of a rare blood clotting disorder in six people who received the shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBJ1j4"&gt;“We are recommending a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution,” the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in a joint statement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). An independent CDC committee will meet Wednesday to review the cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9e4BI"&gt;Nearly 7 million doses of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine have been administered in the US. Six women developed a type of rare blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, which forms in the brain, in combination with low levels of blood platelets. The clots appeared between six and 13 days after the women received the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvtKNv"&gt;This type of reaction is so far extremely rare, the agencies said in a statement. There is no conclusive evidence that the reactions were caused by the shot. People who received the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine within the past three weeks should call a doctor if they develop a severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath, the CDC said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cyquDG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For scale, pls keep in mind:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;—About one in every 588 Americans have died of COVID (562K of 331 million ppl)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;—About one in 10 Americans have been infected w COVID (31 million of 331 million)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;—About 1 in a million who got J &amp;amp; J have had blood clots— just 6 ppl out of 6 million &lt;a href="https://t.co/OLPgGqinSL"&gt;https://t.co/OLPgGqinSL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dr. Steven W. Thrasher (@thrasherxy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thrasherxy/status/1381936102005739534?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="buhzi2"&gt;On Friday, the European Medicines Agency announced it was reviewing the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine after receiving reports of &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-europe-vaccines/jj-covid-19-vaccine-under-eu-review-over-blood-clots-astrazeneca-probe-grows-idUSKBN2BW1MB"&gt;four clotting cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="txt1vs"&gt;Cases of a similar clotting disorder have also been seen in people who took the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/10/health/astrazeneca-vaccine-blood-clots.html"&gt;AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, which is being used in Europe, Britain, and Canada (but not the US). The AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine were built using the same technology: both use a benign, weakened virus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266897/coronavirus-vaccine-development-strategies-pros-cons"&gt;called an adenovirus&lt;/a&gt; to carry bits of the coronavirus genetic material into the body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HG8j3a"&gt;Even if the FDA and CDC do conclude that there could be a relationship between the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine and the blood clots, the agencies could still say that the vaccine should be used. The benefits — preventing COVID-19, a deadly disease, and ending the pandemic — might outweigh the very rare risk of a dangerous but treatable blood clotting disorder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tOiLJb"&gt;Over 120 million people in the US have received at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine. The vast majority received either the Pfizer / BioNTech or Moderna vaccine. The US has enough supply of those two shots for every adult. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony now lets you store — but not play — PS5 games on external hard drives</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pEv46m7LPNmSEiT8hxwaHF54i2w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117839/vpavic_4261_20201023_0018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KSE1yR"&gt;Sony has released its &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/04/13/ps5-april-update-brings-new-storage-options-and-social-features/"&gt;April update for the PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt;, adding several key features to the next-generation console, including the long-awaited ability to store — but crucially, not play — PS5 games on an external hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAzKBp"&gt;The PS5 only offers 825GB of storage (with just 667GB of usable space when formatted with the operating system and other essential files), which means that even just a few massive next-gen games can quickly eat up your entire SSD. Sony has attempted to alleviate the issue by allowing players to stash backward-compatible PS4 titles on external drives, but until now, it hasn’t offered the same option for PS5 games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="b02ugT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony will reportedly enable PS5 SSD expansion this summer","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eFREat"&gt;Unfortunately, unlike PS4 titles, Sony won’t allow players to actually &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; those PS5 games from an external drive. “Because PS5 games are designed to take advantage of the console’s ultra high-speed SSD,” the company explains, you’ll still have to copy them back over to the console’s main SSD before you can play them. Still, Sony does say that the local data copy should be faster than reinstalling it from the internet or copying games from a disc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRuTZq"&gt;All of this is still a stop-gap measure until Sony manages to enable the PS5’s M.2 expansion slot, which will eventually allow players to add usable extra storage that can both store and play next-generation games. There’s no news on that update in Sony’s announcement, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;an earlier report&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/sony-to-open-playstation-5-for-storage-upgrades-in-summer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says that it’ll arrive this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gv2h1s"&gt;Along with the new storage option, the April update also adds several other key features to the PlayStation 5. There are better options for quickly disabling in-game chat on a system level — something that should help prevent the kinds of issues that dogged &lt;em&gt;Destruction: AllStars&lt;/em&gt; at launch. Users can also adjust overly loud or quiet players individually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ha8XsL"&gt;Sony is also adding the option for players to search their library of purchased games, as well as the option to hide games in their library, which should help organization. There’s also a new feature for developers that will allow games to pre-download updates when the console is in rest mode for faster updates.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Photos’ much improved video editor arrives on Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DVXEN1mNPqo6nWgsE7nwu4SQ00Q=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117673/ezgif.com_gif_maker__9_.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xp5IYO"&gt;Android’s Google Photos app is being updated with the improved video editing tools that were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21409339/google-photos-ios-update-crop-trim-add-filters-video-editor"&gt;previously exclusive to iOS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/12/powerful-new-google-photos-video-editor-starts-to-roll-out/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; spotted&lt;/a&gt; the rollout, and reports that it appears to be available for both Google Pixel devices and other Android phones. The tools appear to have arrived with a server-side update, though you can try updating to the latest version of Google Photos if they’re not yet live in your app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etj8Rg"&gt;As Google explained &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/new-video-editor-plus-enhanced-editing-features/"&gt;back in February&lt;/a&gt;, the new video editing tools include over 30 controls, covering everything from cropping, filters, and color grading options like adjusting contrast, saturation, and brightness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p095tu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The features were previously available on iOS&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GhmwA4"&gt;The video editing tools are arriving on Android as Google’s Photos service is going through some big changes. As part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278149/google-photos-pixel-paywall-editing-features-one-subscribers"&gt;February announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the company said it would be bringing some machine-learning powered editing tools previously exclusive to Pixel devices to other Android phones, but only for Google One subscribers. Next, in June, Google Photos will end its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;unlimited free photo storage&lt;/a&gt;, and will ask users to pay for storage beyond 15GB. The app is getting more powerful, but increasingly you’re having to pay for more advanced features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eT7LN2"&gt;As well as announcing that the iOS video editing tools would be coming to Android, in February Google also said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495793/google-photos-editing-tools-app-update-machine-learning-suggestions-android"&gt;Android’s new photo editing tools&lt;/a&gt; would be making their way to iOS. Google announced they’d be arriving “in the coming months,” but as of this writing they don’t appear to be live.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Watch review: big, basic, and boring</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;OnePlus’ first smartwatch is missing a lot of what makes a smartwatch smart&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ERVyka"&gt;What makes a smartwatch “smart”? Is it the ability to show you notifications from your phone? What about the ability to track your physical activity and wellness, such as step counts, workouts, and sleep? How about providing you information about your day, such as the weather and upcoming calendar events? Or perhaps it’s the inclusion of a voice assistant on your wrist that you can ask to do things without having to use your phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7h69Ye"&gt;Those are the questions I’ve been asking over the past week-plus as I’ve been testing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22314135/ticwatch-pro-3-fossil-gen-5-lte-review-smartwatch-wear-os"&gt;new OnePlus Watch&lt;/a&gt;, a $159 smartwatch and the first wearable from the smartphone company. The OnePlus Watch has all the looks of a modern smartwatch, but as I’ve learned wearing it on my wrist day and night, it doesn’t have all the smarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s14NeP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10442559"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qrKylt"&gt;The OnePlus Watch is not like a Wear OS smartwatch, such as those made by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20835364/fossil-wear-os-smartwatch-android-gen-5-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Fossil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21162829/moto-360-review-smartwatch-third-gen-wearos-specs-features-price"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22314135/ticwatch-pro-3-fossil-gen-5-lte-review-smartwatch-wear-os"&gt;Mobvoi&lt;/a&gt;. Nor is it like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368752/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Watch&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;. All of those have software platforms that integrate with other apps and services, so you can download apps or watchfaces to the watch itself, just like you might with a phone. That makes them very extensible and customizable — you can easily make the watch look unique and do the things you need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIDiQN"&gt;The OnePlus Watch, on the other hand (or wrist?), runs its own proprietary software, based on a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system"&gt;real-time operating system&lt;/a&gt;. This software is very quick and power efficient, but it is not extensible — there’s no app store or third-party watchfaces to download on the OnePlus Watch. It’s similar to the software on the budget smartwatches you can get on Amazon; if you’ve ever used an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Smartwatch-Storage-Bluetooth-Water-Resistant/dp/B08HR91GQB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazfit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/UMIDIGI-Uwatch-2S-Waterproof-Smartwatch/dp/B08DCPKCHV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Umidigi&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-watch.html"&gt;Wyze watch&lt;/a&gt;, you’ve used a real-time operating system. The OnePlus Watch is not very different from those in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCN2Ou"&gt;This choice of platform affords the OnePlus Watch its greatest strength, long battery life, and also its greatest weakness: it just doesn’t do all that much compared to other smartwatches you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9AxjHQN2FGup3x8v00jutddG9PI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22436131/dseifert_4521_oneplus_watch_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Watch looks like many other smartwatches, but most especially the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5Jq16X"&gt;OnePlus Watch software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qLm1cu"&gt;The OnePlus Watch pairs with and is controlled by the OnePlus Health app for Android — there’s no iPhone compatibility at all. But you don’t need to own a OnePlus phone, it works with basically any modern Android device. I tested it on both OnePlus and Samsung smartphones and the experience was the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHDLxw"&gt;The app is where you can see what health and fitness metrics the watch has recorded, adjust which apps send notifications on your wrist, and view the available watchfaces. OnePlus has about 50 watchfaces so far, with some offering limited customizability in the form of selectable shortcuts or widgets, such as a weather widget, date, or shortcut to a built-in app like the timer. You can choose up to 14 faces to store on the watch and switch between them without using your phone. The company says it plans on adding more in the future, but as I mentioned earlier, there are no options for third-party watchfaces or third-party app widgets like you get with Samsung, Wear OS, or Apple smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mfmvuh"&gt;The watchfaces themselves are what you’d expect: there is the assortment of analog and digital styles to choose from, with some showing more information about your activity than others. I’m not a big fan of the analog options, so I settled on a digital face. Unfortunately, there’s a bug where digital watchfaces on the OnePlus Watch are stuck in 24-hour time and can’t show 12-hour time. The company tells me it is aware of this bug, and it is slated to be fixed “this month.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IziKEX7cLRFNO3bHwIpR6ZRbI2s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22436124/dseifert_4521_oneplus_watch_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Watch’s interface mimics Wear OS and is easy to navigate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0nWfJg"&gt;The watch interface has a familiar layout: swipe down for settings, swipe up to see notifications, press the side button to see your apps. You can swipe right from the watchface to access basic widgets for music control, weather, and activity tracking, similar to Wear OS or a Samsung watch. The design of the interface all looks mostly fine, and there thankfully aren’t any stutters or lags when navigating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaOrPI"&gt;I do have a few gripes with how notifications are handled. You can’t clear notifications by just swiping them away, like you can with every other smartwatch. Instead, you have to tap into each one and then press clear or scroll to the bottom to clear them all. It’s a clumsy and fiddly process. The OnePlus Watch doesn’t always sync with the notifications I’ve cleared on my phone, either, and occasionally notifications for the same messages would get duplicated, forcing me to see the same alerts more than once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0nbDs"&gt;You can’t do much with those notifications, either. There are no actions you can take other than clearing them from your wrist. OnePlus supports canned message replies in just five apps: WhatsApp, Telegram, Line, Discord, and Facebook Messenger. Notably and frustratingly, that list doesn’t include standard SMS messages. On top of that, there are only four basic replies to choose from: “OK”; “Be right there!”; “In a meeting, contact you later”; and “I’m driving, contact you later.” I frequently use a smartwatch to triage notifications, delete incoming emails, or reply to messages when I’m away from my desk, but I can’t do most of those things with the OnePlus Watch.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Watch supports quick replies in just five apps and there are only four replies to choose from — you cannot use your voice to dictate something to the watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/udXA5vQWPe7cJYBH4ApRMSV0xIg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22436125/dseifert_4521_oneplus_watch_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Watch does not support third-party apps, what you get is what you get.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3CSp2L"&gt;The OnePlus Watch comes with a basic set of apps: weather, timer, stopwatch, alarm, workout, sleep tracking, etc. Oddly, it doesn’t have a calculator or a calendar app, so I can’t easily see my next meeting or appointment, something I do a lot with other smartwatches. There’s no way to get your next appointment on your watchface, either. And since there isn’t an app store, I can’t add any apps to that list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yysc4Z"&gt;You can forget about streaming music from Spotify or playing podcasts through your favorite app — the only thing you can do with the OnePlus Watch is control what’s playing on your phone or transfer MP3 files from your phone to the watch’s 4GB of storage. Want to track your runs with Strava or MapMyFitness instead of OnePlus’ app? Sorry, no dice. If you want to control smart home devices from your wrist, the OnePlus Watch is entirely useless unless you have a OnePlus TV, where you can use it as a remote. The OnePlus TV is only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/26/20884862/oneplus-tv-announced-specs-india"&gt;available in India&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bEnAm"&gt;The OnePlus Watch also lacks a voice assistant. I can’t ask it to start a timer when I’m in the kitchen and my hands are dirty, I can’t ask it to turn the lights off or open my garage door, and I can’t dictate a reply to an incoming message. How well voice assistants work varies greatly between smartwatches (Siri on the Apple Watch, pretty good! Bixby on a Samsung watch, less so), but OnePlus isn’t even trying here and I’ve missed having one available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5iLWI"&gt;Lastly, even though the OnePlus Watch has an NFC radio, it does not support mobile payments. You can’t tap your wrist to pay for something like you can with an Apple Watch, Samsung watch, or Wear OS smartwatch.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Watch’s fitness tracking features hit the standard beats.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="62bvpC"&gt;OnePlus Watch fitness tracking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0nrmub"&gt;The fitness tracking features are quite basic. It will track your steps throughout the day; the watch will nudge you to get up and move when you’ve been sitting for too long; you can choose between 14 different workouts for the watch to track; and if you wear the OnePlus Watch to bed, it will make an attempt to track your sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GH61fh"&gt;I’m not a gym rat, but I did wear the OnePlus Watch on my left wrist with a Fitbit Inspire HR on my right wrist throughout this review and the OnePlus counted thousands fewer steps than the Fitbit every day. None of these devices are perfect with their step tracking, but that kind of discrepancy is going to make tracking a longer-distance run or other intense workout inaccurate or just plain hard to do. I asked a few other reviewers I know who are also testing the OnePlus Watch and each one has had the same issues with inaccurate step counting. OnePlus says a bug fix for GPS optimization and to add more workout modes will be available sometime in mid-April.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vrDsaiWghDdQLtPQM61SUAoi_28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22436137/dseifert_4521_oneplus_watch_15.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;While the OnePlus Watch frequently undercounted my steps, it overestimated how much I slept each night.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mzSWlk"&gt;Sleep tracking, oddly enough, has the opposite problem. The OnePlus Watch consistently overestimates how long I slept each night compared to the Fitbit and Google’s Nest Hub. A bug has also prevented the Watch from syncing its sleep data with the OnePlus Health app, even though other activity synced over fine. The company says this bug should also be fixed sometime this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIcHik"&gt;As mentioned earlier, you can’t use other fitness apps on the OnePlus Watch. The OnePlus Health app provides syncing with the Google Fit platform, so it’s possible you could cobble together a syncing solution between other apps using Fit as glue, but I did not test this. In general, the OnePlus Watch’s fitness tracking is fine for basic activity trends, but any fitness enthusiasts will want something more capable and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/upJaG882X8BSnfj6iRDYwLGXGnY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22436134/dseifert_4521_oneplus_watch_12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Watch only comes in one size: a large 46mm face.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="17033p"&gt;OnePlus Watch hardware and design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="e1ROrq"&gt;In terms of design, the OnePlus Watch is generic-looking — it reminds me a lot of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Active line. It’s got a round face, there are two buttons on the side, and the body is made of polished stainless steel, which is nice to see at this price point. It comes in silver, black, or a gold-colored special edition — I’ve got the black model and it’s a little boring to look at. Either way, the hardware is solid and put together well — it’s not creaky or plasticky, and there are no rough edges to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="3xpwsk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10442966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h4BCwe"&gt;OnePlus is only offering the watch in one size, 46mm, and frankly, it’s big. It’s bigger than I like watches to be on my wrist, and if you have smaller wrists than me you’re not going to have a fun time with this. On the plus side, it’s not the thickest smartwatch I’ve ever worn. Just one size band comes in the box — OnePlus says that customers who need a shorter band will be able to get one by contacting customer service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2goU9"&gt;The touchscreen is a 1.39-inch 454 x 454 OLED that’s easy to see both indoors and out. It’s colorful, like you’d expect an OLED to be, but there’s no always-on display option, which nearly every other smartwatch has now. That makes it that much more annoying to check the time, though the wrist turn gesture does work well to wake it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grr22K"&gt;On the underside are the sensors for heart rate and blood oxygen. As usual, you should not use these sensors for medical purposes — and blood oxygen monitors on even the best smartwatches notoriously struggle with giving accurate readings. Inside the watch are the accelerometers and gyroscopes necessary to track your activity and workouts, plus GPS and Bluetooth radios. There’s no Wi-Fi or LTE here — if you leave your phone behind, you’re going to miss notifications and alerts until the watch is back in Bluetooth range of your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3UPut"&gt;Also missing from the OnePlus Watch are any rotating bezels or crowns — the only way to interact with it is to tap and swipe on the screen itself or push the buttons on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddUR7s"&gt;Even though it doesn’t have a voice assistant, the OnePlus Watch does have a microphone and speaker, so you can answer calls from your wrist via Bluetooth. It worked fine in my tests; callers said I sounded clear to them, but the speaker on the watch is a bit crackly at full volume. It works in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cF4fTl7v_14ozNWsXGgJBeRI8b8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22436141/dseifert_4521_oneplus_watch_19.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Watch has exceptional battery life and charges very quickly on its included charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CG0epx"&gt;The best thing about the OnePlus Watch is its battery life. OnePlus claims up to 14 days of usage between charges — it lasted about 10 days for me, wearing it day and night. Charging the watch is also quick and easy: just 20 minutes on the charger adds half a charge, which translates to literal days of usage. No Apple, Samsung, or Wear OS watch can last this long or charge this quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDLEdz"&gt;But at the same time, the OnePlus Watch has such great battery life because, frankly, it just does less than those other smartwatches. The best comparison I can make is that the OnePlus Watch is a fitness tracker in a smartwatch body, which would be an acceptable premise if it were a better fitness tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zFwAW-tP8MMRljDacGE8Rtzvgdo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22436135/dseifert_4521_oneplus_watch_13.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are about 50 different watchfaces to choose from for the OnePlus Watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="J1JDG7"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="DzdEi4"&gt;The OnePlus Watch may look like a lot of other smartwatches, but I can’t say it compares well to them. It’s limited in features, only comes in one size, and as I’ve gone over, there are several bugs with it that make it feel like an unfinished product. Aside from its long battery life, the OnePlus Watch’s bestselling point is its low price, which is half that of a Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 and over $100 less than the comparably sized Galaxy Watch Active 2. But if you’re looking for a smartwatch for your Android phone, it’s not that hard to find Wear OS models on sale, often for less than the cost of the OnePlus Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YtpoMr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The OnePlus Watch needs to do more to earn its place on my wrist&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EYx6FL"&gt;For me, a good smartwatch is a lot like a personal assistant on my wrist. It tells me the time, when my next calendar appointment is, what the weather is like, and how active I’ve been throughout the day. I can quickly ask it to set a timer when I’m making a cup of tea or use it to reply to a message from my spouse when I’m running an errand. It also lets me customize its appearance and capabilities through third-party apps, watchfaces, or both. For others, it’s a way to track workouts and keep on top of their personal health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BcGvu0"&gt;In that framing, the OnePlus Watch isn’t really a smartwatch and based on my experience, it isn’t a great fitness tracker either. Instead, it’s just a clever watch, and it can be useful if your expectations of it are low. But if a smartwatch is going to take up real estate on my wrist, it has to be more useful than the OnePlus Watch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Siri says next Apple event is April 20th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XWBAavh_ooh4qTkAo7hiYd9UWKI=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117300/image__5_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asking Siri, “When is the next Apple Event” generates the following response.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DMxULF"&gt;Siri appears to have spilled the beans on the next Apple launch event. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/13/siri-apple-event-tuesday-april-20/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; was first to report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;asking the voice assistant “When is the next Apple Event” prompts it to say April 20th. We’ve managed to get the same response, though only on a device that’s associated with a US Apple ID. Apple typically announces its events with invites sent out a week in advance, meaning the news should become official later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDVUxr"&gt;“The special event is on Tuesday, April 20th, at Apple Park in Cupertino, CA. You can get all the details on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FApple.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F13%2F22381336%2Fsiri-apple-event-april-20th-ipad-pro-announcement-launch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple.com&lt;/a&gt;” says Siri. Tapping the link takes you to the standard &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-events%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F13%2F22381336%2Fsiri-apple-event-april-20th-ipad-pro-announcement-launch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Event landing page&lt;/a&gt;, where the launch isn’t listed. It seems odd that the response claims the event is happening in Cupertino, since this will almost certainly be another of Apple’s pre-recorded online-only events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0DloBJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The special event is on Tuesday, April 20th, at Apple Park in Cupertino, CA.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jPQCrH"&gt;The message itself doesn’t give any hints about what Apple might be planning to announce at the event. However, recent rumors point towards new iPad Pro models, at least. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336917/apple-new-ipad-pros-mini-base-april"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt; new iPad Pros will debut in April. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro will reportedly be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452182/ipad-pro-mini-led-display-oled-contrast-burn-in-screen-technology"&gt;Apple’s first device with a Mini LED screen&lt;/a&gt;, allowing it to offer a high contrast ratio without the risk of burn-in associated with OLED displays. Reports indicate that the new iPad Pros could be in short supply &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379337/new-ipad-pro-mini-led-production-issues-date-report"&gt;due to production issues&lt;/a&gt; Apple is facing with the Mini LED displays. Other rumored iPad Pro upgrades include new processors with a similar amount of power to the M1 chip found in Apple’s recent MacBooks, better cameras, and USB-C ports with faster transfer speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZniWj"&gt;There are rumors that Apple is also close to launching its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875341/apple-tags-location-rumor-roundup"&gt;long-rumored AirTags&lt;/a&gt;. The location tracking devices, which should allow users to keep track of items using Apple’s Find My software, were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/18/21142249/apple-tags-iphone-kuo-location-tracking"&gt;expected to launch last year&lt;/a&gt; but ultimately never appeared. With Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;recently opening up its Find My network&lt;/a&gt; to track items from third-party companies, the stage is now set for the launch of its own physical trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCdU3B"&gt;Unless Siri is lying, the invitations should arrive imminently.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Quantum 2 has quantum cryptography built in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RrYlX1bpoTaEsCDXGHFFrnhDoIA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117262/_Photo__SKT_to_Launch_QRNG_Powered_5G_Smartphone_Galaxy_Quantum2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oD1Wz8"&gt;Samsung and South Korean carrier SK Telecom have announced the Galaxy Quantum 2, Samsung’s second phone that features built-in quantum cryptography technology for increased security. It’s the follow-up to last year’s Galaxy A Quantum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ka7P1O"&gt;The Quantum 2 includes a chip developed by a company called ID Quantique, which says it’s the world’s smallest quantum random number generator (QRNG) at 2.5mm square. It works by capturing random noise with an LED and a CMOS image sensor. According to SK Telecom, the QRNG chip “allows smartphone holders to use services that require security in a more safe and secure manner by generating unpredictable and patternless true random numbers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4QGTZ"&gt;Quantum cryptography RNG is considered to be extremely challenging to hack without extensive physical access to a given device. The benefits will seem pretty niche to the average customer, but the QRNG chip does automatically work with apps that use the Android Keystore APIs, which should make the technology more accessible for developers. SK Telecom is touting local compatibility with the likes of Shinhan Bank and Standard Chartered Bank Korea, plus its own services like T World. The carrier says it’ll work with more services in the future, including Samsung’s own credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6b3mCn"&gt;The phone itself has reasonably high specs, close to what you’d have found in a high-end flagship phone from a year or two ago. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus processor, a 64-megapixel camera, and a 6.7-inch 120Hz OLED display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arWTr7"&gt;The Galaxy Quantum 2 is only confirmed for a release in South Korea right now. It’ll go on sale on April 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4HM3F"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Disney’s ‘real’ lightsaber patent actually works</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V6ZLQAZEJHiRfZx8KGG-mA5KDto=/0x0:693x462/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117120/josh_d_amaro_lightsaber.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_xISgAjp5a/" target="_blank"&gt;Josh D’Amaro (Instagram)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vUus05"&gt;A real lightsaber. How is that possible? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HgwXmQ"&gt;It’s probably not, of course. But when Disney Parks chairman Josh D’Amaro ended his April 8th presentation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/9/22375720/disney-parks-lightsaber-retractable-blade-rumor-patent"&gt;by whipping out a never-before-seen retractable lightsaber&lt;/a&gt; — no video evidence, mind — Disney and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fans went wild online. Speculation ran rampant, much of it pointing &lt;a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10065127B1/en"&gt;to a 2018 patent&lt;/a&gt; for a “Sword device with retractable, internally illuminated blade.” I pored through that patent late that evening, and I’ve been trying to figure out a way to show &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers how it works ever since. Heck, I even ordered a pair of LED slap bracelets that have yet to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOitWf"&gt;But it looks like I won’t need them, because VR developer Ben Ridout &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benridout/status/1381412831707422721"&gt;has already done better&lt;/a&gt;, brilliantly illuminating Disney’s patented concept with a set of simple animations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cf6Lj1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Did &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Disney?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Disney&lt;/a&gt; invent a real working &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/lightsaber?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#lightsaber&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes they did. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It won't melt through metal blast doors, or cut off your hand, but it does feature an illuminated blade that will extend and retract at the push of a button. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This animation shows the concept behind the tech. &lt;a href="https://t.co/e7fwP06CxF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/e7fwP06CxF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ben Ridout (@benridout) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benridout/status/1381412831707422721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="HRdWz4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Next, widen the tapes and increase the curve, allowing them to partially wrap around each other and form a complete cylinder. Drive this system with a motor so both reels can be extended and retracted in synch at the push of a button. Now, you've got a lightsaber! &lt;a href="https://t.co/B3lLMmclDN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/B3lLMmclDN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ben Ridout (@benridout) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benridout/status/1381412847054360576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SjAl5r"&gt;Yes, that’s correct — the magic here really does boil down to a pair of fancy motorized tape measures. The patent even mentions “a metal carpenter’s tape measure” as inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vTjESF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10443399"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pXG82S"&gt;According to the patent, the lightsaber’s “blade” consists of two spools of translucent material that lie flat when fully wound, like a tape measure inside its reel. When each ribbon is shot out the end, it curves into a semicircle that forms one half of the blade. They’re permanently mounted to a rounded lightsaber “tip” that also pulls along a string of flexible LEDs that’s mounted on a third motorized spool inside the lightsaber’s frame. The two halves of the blade get zipped together by a “blade form” as they exit the lightsaber, creating a single lightsaber beam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g9UN59"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Building the ultimate Star Wars lightsaber|7799" data-volume-uuid="5a56bbf90" data-volume-id="7799" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-59" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YhCxp0"&gt;Will such a lightsaber be rigid enough for a practice duel? Only Disney’s Imagineers can say for sure — but either way, this could be a gamechanger for the lightsaber community. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/10/11371902/star-wars-lightsaber-fx-sabers-custom-luke-skywalker-graflex"&gt;We went on a hunt for the ultimate Star Wars lightsabers in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and while modern lightsaber props have incredible light, sound and detailing, the basics haven’t changed in years: you generally choose between a glorified flashlight with a toy telescoping blade that can actually fit inside a handle, or more commonly now, a rigid LED-filled tube you’ll have to remove and store whenever you want to display your saber on a belt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MWF7k1"&gt;Now, Disney may have created the full-size, evenly lit, disappearing lightsaber blade of our dreams. Minus the whole “slice objects in half with a beam of energy” part, of course. I’m just wondering whether it’ll be a prop for Disneyland actors, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22376256/hasbro-700-optimus-prime-toy-transform-motor-automatic-voice-command"&gt;the latest incredible toy I can’t quite afford&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It may be curtains for Arclight and Pacific, the theaters I’ve only dreamt of attending</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Daily Life In Los Angeles Amid Coronavirus Outbreak" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i1Gc25N1dYbXtDeEc8kqWokGuSg=/181x0:4665x2989/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69116853/1219631225.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by David Livingston/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="shBPHs"&gt;The owner of famous movie theater chains Arclight Cinemas and Pacific Theaters has revealed that the theaters will never reopen from their COVID shutdowns, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/arclight-cinemas-pacific-theatres-covid-1234949832/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Decurian, the company that operates both chains, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/arclight-cinemas-and-pacific-theatres-wont-be-reopening-1234732936/"&gt;gave a dire statement to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: it includes phrases like “exhausted all potential options” and “does not have a viable way forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3Sa4j"&gt;I don’t live in California, and I’ve never seen a movie at either an Arclight or Pacific, but their shuttering hurts me deeply: I’ve always hoped to see a movie at an Arclight and experience Pacific’s Cinerama Dome, and it seems like I may never have the opportunity. (Those aren’t my only movie dreams in distress: the dinner and a show chain I’ve hoped to visit, Alamo Drafthouse, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/alamo-drafthouse-bankruptcy-chapter-11-sale-1234920558/"&gt;has recently filed for bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s854rK"&gt;I’m aware that most people probably don’t dream of traveling to other states just to see a movie, but these chains have long been considered the gold-standard in the online filmmaking community. I’ve long heard about Arclight Cinemas’ top-tier picture and sound, and many of them were located in the heart of Hollywood. Tinseltown is feeling the loss too, with many actors and filmmakers tweeting in despair (or in the hopes that someone else will buy the theaters and restore them to operation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aa7It6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Difficult to process this news. Truly devastating. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ArcLightCinemas?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ArcLightCinemas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/qymeJ2StI1"&gt;https://t.co/qymeJ2StI1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elijah Wood (@elijahwood) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elijahwood/status/1381762753296097280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="nU3yuv"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wKNxYC"&gt;There’s also the matter of the Cinerama Dome. The famous Hollywood theater is named after a famous 70mm film format (one of the many that came about as theaters tried to lure in viewers with ever-increasing spectacle). As &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i12oWm3v6Ho"&gt;any film nerd will tell you&lt;/a&gt;, 70mm is pretty much the ultimate in movie-exhibition, whether you’re watching &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Hateful Eight&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;It’s A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6WbNPN"&gt;The latter is a movie my dad introduced me to, and I would’ve loved to see it in its original format — getting my eyes on original film prints has kind of been an obsession ever since I got to watch Disney’s &lt;em&gt;The Aristocats &lt;/em&gt;back in college, but now &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinerama#Legacy"&gt;the list of US theaters&lt;/a&gt; that can even play Cinerama movies is vanishingly small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4ZREc"&gt;What will happen to these theaters remains unknown. The buildings won’t instantly crumble just because the company that owns them is shutting down, but without someone to take care of them they may not last. This would be an additional tragedy in the case of the Cinerama Dome — Silicon Valley &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/21/5628202/sunset-on-the-domes"&gt;got rid of the rest of its dome-shaped theaters&lt;/a&gt;, and partly justified it with the fact that Cinerama would still be around to keep the tradition alive. While the Cinerama Dome and Silicon Valley’s Century 21 dome are both historical landmarks, that doesn’t always mean preserving its purpose: &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/07/30/federal-realty-investment-trust-santana-row-office.html"&gt;last we checked&lt;/a&gt;, the Silicon Valley dome was slated to become an “innovation hub” inside a new tech office campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICbkki"&gt;Speaking of tragedies, it’s worth keeping things in perspective: while I may not get to experience these theaters, there are many Pacific and Arclight employees who have just lost their jobs, according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;. If I had one wish (that was, hypothetically, strictly limited to this specific situation), it’d be that those people could find good jobs at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22326343/los-angeles-la-movie-theaters-reopen-movie-capitol"&gt;other theater chains&lt;/a&gt; that are opening back up. But if I had two, I’d love to make sure that these theaters somehow survive, so I could someday visit them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s follow up to the Z Fold 2 could be smaller, but maybe not in the dimension you want</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l5HaK0iuv9C7whGTmTMSI2pFSaY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69116445/vpavic_200907_4181_0010_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u8ZMiY"&gt;Samsung’s next Galaxy Z Fold folding phone might have a slightly smaller screen than its previous models, feature a smaller battery, and quite possibly launch in July alongside a new Galaxy Z Flip, &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=11865"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elec &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-3-will-reportedly-be-smaller-than-the-galaxy-z-fold-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CmxEB"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 will reportedly have a 7.5-inch main tablet screen and a 6.2-inch screen on the front cover of the phone, &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; writes, which would be virtually the same as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;the Fold 2’s&lt;/a&gt; 7.6-inch main display and 6.2-inch cover display. &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; says these screen sizes come with the added benefit of “zero bezels,” so even though the screens may be the same size, the third Fold could feel slightly smaller because the actual body of the phone might shrink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBiiEB"&gt;In comparison to the Fold 2’s 4,500mAh battery, the Fold 3 will reportedly make do with a slightly smaller 4,380mAh battery. Again, not a dramatic change in size and it might not even noticeably impact battery life, but it’s interesting to note if it effects other changes to the Fold’s design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uujIi-TwtsLqEJjklQdTF3pllPs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439698/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_4.30.23_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even with a slight taper, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 is still almost as thick as two phones back to back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hwzwyn"&gt;There’s other rumored changes to the Fold line, including the possibility of S Pen support, just like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra got earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. For the Fold, a stylus could also pose additional challenges if Samsung tries to integrate stylus storage directly in the phone rather than using an add-on case like the Ultra. A hole for a stylus could take up space that could be filled with extra battery capacity or removed entirely for an overall thinner phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MF37JS"&gt;And — though &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t mention it at all, so don’t expect a change — thinness is the dimension that might actually matter when it comes to a new Galaxy Fold. Including the extra gap created by its hinge, the Fold 2 is about two S21 Ultra thick when folded. If Samsung isn’t thinning out the rumored Fold 3 to make it easier to hold and fit in a pocket, I hope they’ll consider that the next time around: it could also help Samsung compete with newcomers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;Huawei’s Mate X2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;Xiaomi’s Mi Mix Fold&lt;/a&gt; which both use similar folding designs and are already thinner than the Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6H3DQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PC market isn’t slowing down after an amazing 2020, despite chip shortages  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wz2tdsJ1oqgQY-io0AdhW15c594=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69116431/akrales_190930_3689_0120.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bc9WpY"&gt;The PC market had a great first quarter, despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22363232/global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-pandemic-consoles-cpus-graphics-cards-cars"&gt;the global shortage of semiconductor chips&lt;/a&gt;. Research firm &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-12-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-grew-32-percent-in-first-quarter-of-2021"&gt;Gartner estimates&lt;/a&gt; that shipments of “traditional PCs,” meaning laptops and desktops, are up by 32 percent compared to Q1 2020 (&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/12/pc-market-had-best-q1-since-2015-fastest-growth-in-20-years-gartner.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS47601721"&gt;IDC puts the number even higher&lt;/a&gt;, estimating 55 percent growth year-over-year. This seems to be the continuation of a trend — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;the PC market had a great 2020 as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpJGl8"&gt;Both firms agree that the growth is atypical — Gartner says that the growth is the fastest it’s seen since it started tracking the market in 2000, and IDC says that the drop in shipments from Q4 to Q1 is the smallest it’s seen since 2012. The raw numbers are also impressive — Gartner estimates that just under 70 million PCs were shipped, while IDC estimates around 84 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sxVCmi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The return to normalcy on the horizon may affect people’s buying habits in the future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P253JZ"&gt;Of course, these numbers don’t exist in a vacuum — you may have already realized that the time period being compared against, Q1 2020, was rough for... well, everything, which includes the manufacturing and shipping of PCs. But while the growth comparison is definitely tilted in favor of Q1 2021, both firms estimate that the numbers could’ve been even higher, had it not been for the chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gfFfq"&gt;The silicon shortage has affected almost everything, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;trucks and cars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;consoles&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;gaming PC component&lt;/a&gt; market. There are even reports that Apple has had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373281/chip-shortage-apple-macbook-ipad-delay-nikkei"&gt;delay production of MacBooks and iPads&lt;/a&gt;. IDC points out that the shortage has contributed to higher average prices in the PC market, and that the shortages are likely to make PCs more difficult to get for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id1pNg"&gt;It’s also worth noting that the pandemic is also likely affecting demand, and the return to normalcy on the horizon may affect people’s buying habits in future quarters. Whether demand will stick around or not isn’t certain, but both IDC and Gartner seem to think it will. &lt;/p&gt;
