    <title>The best wired or wireless gaming headsets to buy</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A few options for each platform&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZkrThV"&gt;If you’re shopping for a gaming headset, you have a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of options. While there are some great ones out there, it’s easy to pay too much, to accidentally purchase a headset that doesn’t work with your desired console or platform, or to get one that’s just uncomfortable. Knowing a thing or two about headphones &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; aid in your search, but gaming headsets have only gotten more complicated to shop for — especially the wireless ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOIb46"&gt;For instance, wireless headsets made for Xbox operate without a dongle via Microsoft’s proprietary wireless protocol. They’ll only work on Xbox consoles or a PC that has one of Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless Adapters plugged in, in most cases. Conversely, if you get a multiplatform wireless headset that includes a 2.4GHz wireless dongle, it’ll likely work on the likes of the PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch (when plugged into the console’s TV dock), and PC — but not Xbox. It’s best to buy the headset that mentions support for your preferred platform(s) explicitly, or else there’s a good chance you’ll run into some compatibility issues. Of course, you can eliminate most of the guesswork by buying a wired gaming headset instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7JNU3"&gt;This guide focuses on newer options that you’re more likely to encounter at stores as opposed to older models that, while possibly still being worthy of your money, are often tougher to find affordably and easily online. Also, just to mention it at the top, I have a large-ish head and that factor obviously played a major role in how I judge the comfort of these headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKGdzA"&gt;You’ll find a few categories below, including the &lt;strong&gt;best multiplatform wireless headsets&lt;/strong&gt; that are compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch via its dock, the &lt;strong&gt;best Xbox wireless gaming headsets&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;best wired gaming headsets&lt;/strong&gt; that support the widest variety of platforms, from console controllers to phones, tablets, and VR headsets that feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="McEjqN"&gt;Best multiplatform wireless gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519747/hyperx-cloud-ii-wireless-pc-gaming-headset-ps4-ps5-nintendo-switch-usbc-review-release-date-price"&gt;HyperX Cloud II Wireless&lt;/a&gt; ($150)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QxhUUV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch (via its dock)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sxpL6zcXsuLE6hAiQUeioEP8vfE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973780/cfaulkner_201016_4245_0001.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="riIMhm"&gt;The HyperX Cloud II Wireless makes an excellent first impression before even turning it on for the first time. Its headband expands to fit a range of head sizes, and the ear cups rest gently around my ears without nary a pinching feeling around my cranium. The cups can be stretched even further than my head requires, which gives me faith that they’ll be a durable pick for years to come. This is the downfall of many otherwise good gaming headsets. HyperX nailed the fit, and it also aced a lot of other winning elements with the Cloud II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7HwnV"&gt;The Cloud II Wireless boasts a balanced sound that delivers just enough gusto for every scenario. It’s not the right choice if you want bass to rattle your head, but it’s good if you want your headset to be just as enjoyable to use for gaming as it is for music and voice chats. I also like that the Cloud II Wireless has USB-C charging, and its battery life is long-lasting. HyperX claims 30 hours of battery per charge, and the headset lived up to that mark during my testing. The wireless range of the headset and the included 2.4GHz wireless receiver are also great, suffering no drops anywhere in my apartment. It even remained stable when I stood on the other side of a wall or window, each being about 25 feet away from the receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7a8Vev"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: The Cloud II Wireless seems to be out of stock at most retailers that sell it. As for which headset makes for a suitable alternative if you need to buy now, people looking for comfort above all else should check out &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081415GCS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=b5590989a235e9347cd765002d60dd96&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logitech’s G733&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. For a headset that closely matches its features, the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723931742397286408" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astro A20 Gen 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; below should satisfy you.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iHCKN5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568047" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nlqrJU"&gt;Compared to competitors in this price range, the Cloud II plays it simple when it comes to the buttons, and the result is that it’s easy to learn how to master the layout. And if all the functions you require are a volume dial, power button, and a microphone mute button, this will suit you better than other headsets that try to fit too many buttons onto ear cups. On the other hand, it’s missing a game and chat audio mix dial that easily lets you fine-tune your game audio with your pals chatting on Discord or while streaming. You can do this manually by clicking a few windows, but other headsets mentioned below make this easier to do. This headset also makes it easy to turn on mic monitoring to hear yourself talk (and hear things happening around you) by simply holding the mute button to activate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQCvSA"&gt;The Cloud II Wireless doesn’t have an overwhelming lead over the major players in the space, like Logitech, SteelSeries, and Razer. In fact, it may get the boot if a similarly priced and comparably cozy model with wired 3.5mm connectivity and Bluetooth support comes along. But since that has yet to happen, HyperX’s flagship wireless headset is the easy choice for PC, PlayStation, and Switch gamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TQibPD"&gt;Here’s what the microphone sounds like on the HyperX Cloud II Wireless:

&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="YdssKP"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DSU9zw"&gt;The runner-up: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21404415/astro-a20-gen-2-next-gen-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-wireless-headset"&gt;Astro A20 Gen 2&lt;/a&gt; ($120)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="a7jGKR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multiplatform but requires an extra $20 adapter to work with both PS and Xbox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMAE19hTSmz0CsTc9TF32Tv1bnw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21830232/Aquarius_Blue_Desk_Stage_2_0058.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Astro&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SrrIBJ"&gt;Astro’s new A20 for the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S consoles is unique in that it’s one of the few cross-platform wireless headsets out there. Buying just one of them (in either the PlayStation blue / white colorway or the Xbox green / white) can let you connect to either system. However, there’s a small catch: you’ll need to buy &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.astrogaming.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Faccessories%2Fcable-adapters%2Fa20-gen-2-usb-transmitter.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21549510%2Fbest-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an additional $20 wireless adapter&lt;/a&gt; to let it connect to the console opposite of your headset’s color styling (each headset includes one adapter). Despite the string attached, this functionality makes it an appealing option for people who will be getting both the PS5 and Xbox Series X or S consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntDrFp"&gt;Whichever platform you’ll use with this headset, Astro’s A20 Gen 2 is packed with more buttons and features than the Cloud II Wireless above. On the ear cups, Astro managed to also fit in a dedicated button for switching the equalizer to your liking to add or subtract bass and vocal clarity. There’s also a game and chat audio mixing dial to help you find the right balance of sounds between your apps. I love this feature, and I also dig that it has a good amount of mic monitoring, so you can hear a little bit of the outside world. This headset’s microphone doesn’t detach. Instead, you’ll just move it up to mute it, which gets it out of your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4o0BxC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568052" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j1b0Ap"&gt;Astro’s latest headset checks a lot of boxes considering its $120 price. The A20 Gen 2 doesn’t quite reach the comfort of HyperX’s model above, as it hangs most of its weight at the top of your head. It doesn’t get painful as the ear cups don’t pinch, but it can result in some fatigue after a while (on top of some very bad headset hair). Also, while I appreciated the EQ button that cycles between sound profiles, the sound quality on the whole isn’t as balanced and punchy as the Cloud II Wireless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfpjga"&gt;But speaking on its features alone, it’s a more affordable runner-up choice if you want better console compatibility (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.astrogaming.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Faccessories%2Fcable-adapters%2Fa20-gen-2-usb-transmitter.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21549510%2Fbest-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;even though it comes at a $20 cost&lt;/a&gt; to have both Xbox and PlayStation support), and a headset that has a physical game and chat mixing dial. I found the wireless range of the A20 Gen 2 and its included wireless receiver to be quite good. My studio apartment is about 40 feet long and 15 feet wide, the headset kept a solid connection throughout. I was even able to run some trash outside without a drop. Astro claims up to 15 meters of range.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C dongle that ships with the SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless makes it an alluring choice for Switch gamers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VyHuQL"&gt;Other good options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="H0bxb3"&gt;The amount of wireless gaming headsets is blossoming, and I expect to make an update to this section on a regular basis — perhaps more regularly than the sections below. As such, there are plenty of other options that didn’t quite make the cut as the “best” but are still pretty good in a few ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1RkbU"&gt;Logitech’s G733 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081415GCS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=b5590989a235e9347cd765002d60dd96&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$127&lt;/a&gt;) came very close to being the runner-up headset. It’s comfortable with breathable ear cups, it has good sound for the price, and the vertical strips of LEDs actually look sharp. It misses the mark by not allowing a wired listening mode and for not having a game-chat audio mix dial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJyiFA"&gt;The G Pro X Lightspeed (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081PP4CB6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=19e702d2b62186465b570dcca369fd9f&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200&lt;/a&gt;), also from Logitech, nails the basics of having good build quality, USB-C charging, and punchy sound quality. It goes a step beyond the G733 with better noise isolation. However, its heavy build wore uncomfortably on my head after a few hours and I don’t think it offers enough features to justify the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ5uWQ"&gt;The Audeze Penrose (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Wireless-Playstation-Low-Latency-Bluetooth/dp/B08D9PBR9X?&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=6e608f6933710a8443e333369413294a&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$299&lt;/a&gt;) has incredible sound quality, along with a plethora of features, like Bluetooth support for connecting a phone and console simultaneously, USB-C for charging, and a 3.5mm port for wired listening. However, considering its high price, it’s not nearly comfortable enough for my head size — it is heavy and too tight — and I think it is likely to wear heavily on other heads, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgokdG"&gt;If you’re mostly into playing games on the Nintendo Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20836987/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-usb-c-nintendo-switch-gaming"&gt;SteelSeries’ Arctis 1 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best choices out there when it comes to ease of use. It isn’t a super comfortable headset, as it lacks the company’s ski band-style headband that distributes weight gently on your head. But it ships with a USB-C wireless receiver that can plug directly into the Switch or Switch Lite. Connectivity is strong, and audio quality is quite good given the headset’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X64MTGL?&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=cfbb36f4c557294387d3902c446fc9a1&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 price tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kVCQQA"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j1QvYC"&gt;Best Xbox-specific wireless gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;Microsoft Xbox Wireless headset&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9eHTCI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, Bluetooth-ready devices, and PC if you have an adapter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Xbox Wireless headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8T3InI_Jx1ABKPuq9tgDd-BkhyM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363682/cfaulkner_210311_4469_0006.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BF4Nbd"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless headset is surprisingly good for $100. It has all of the same features as our previous top pick, Razer’s Kaira Pro, but knocks $50 off the price and has a better design. Like the Surface Headphones, this headset features twistable dials on the outside of its earcups, and it simplifies making quick adjustments, like turning up the volume on the right side, or tweaking the game / chat audio mix on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrpptY"&gt;This headset operates on the Xbox Wireless protocol, letting it connect effortlessly to a modern Xbox console with a push of its pairing button (it pairs just like a controller). It supports a concurrent Bluetooth connection, too, so you can be paired to your phone and console at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTAiuF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: it’s tough to find the Xbox Wireless headset in stock currently. Best Buy is the first place you should look for restocks. If you have to get a headset now, the best alternative is the runner-up below, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LRV49W8?&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=eaf86b6a935186a1ebd412c822bc4cc5&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s Kaira Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LIHpB2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420028"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dv7vfB"&gt;Battery life is fine, but not spectacular at around 15 hours per charge. While I really like the Bluetooth feature, this headset lacks a multifunction button for controlling, say, phone calls or playing / pausing music or podcasts coming from your phone or tablet that might be connected. Razer’s Kaira Pro makes this easier. Another fault is that this model lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack, but that might not be a big deal for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYmful"&gt;Microsoft’s headset doesn’t break new ground, it just does a lot right for a reasonable price. There are other options that offer noise cancellation and more hearty sound quality than this model. But if you don’t want to spend more than $100, most people should be very happy with what the Xbox Wireless headset offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A6JDyP"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Xbox Wireless headset sound like:

&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yPjxFw"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tJaksn"&gt;A runner-up: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21545683/razer-kaira-pro-xbox-wireless-gaming-headset-series-x-s-one-pc-microsoft-usb-c"&gt;Razer Kaira Pro&lt;/a&gt; ($150)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5FyUOH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, Bluetooth-ready devices, and PC if you have an adapter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Kaira Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2FuzXKAnHOyvPWuGUIY0MkDYOf8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22011747/kairapro1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="66Orpz"&gt;Razer’s new Kaira Pro for Xbox consoles and PC is one of the company’s most impressive headsets yet. It narrowly loses the matchup to the HS75 XB listed below when it comes to sound quality, but it leaps ahead with more features. It includes the option to connect to devices via Bluetooth so you can listen to music, podcasts, or take calls while you game on Xbox or PC. The Kaira Pro also has other features I expect to have in a wireless gaming headset, like USB-C charging and a handy game and chat dial for a customized audio mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baXqF7"&gt;A particularly cool feature here are the built-in microphones that kick in when you’re connected to a device over Bluetooth. While the Kaira Pro includes a detachable boom mic for use with gaming on your console, these additional microphones are useful for on-the-go voice calls when you don’t want to be seen using the bigger microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hIYdw1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568243" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nZtxXA"&gt;As I mentioned before, the Kaira Pro sounds great, but it’s not quite as robust when put up against the Corsair model below. If you’re a stickler for crisp sound quality and better positional audio, opt for the runner-up since they’re open-back and not closed like Razer’s headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEhXsi"&gt;Razer’s headset looks and fits mostly like your average set of over-ear headphones, which is ideal since you can easily use it in that fashion with its Bluetooth function. The Kaira Pro’s build quality is better than I expected, particularly when it comes to comfort. It places equal pressure on the top of your head and around your ears, feeling just tight enough to keep the sound in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hnqkBI"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Razer Kaira Pro sounds like:

&lt;p id="qgNCwe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, and PC if you have an adapter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="orJF4d"&gt;If you’re locked to team Xbox, or find yourself switching between PC (with Microsoft’s Xbox wireless adapter) and your console, Corsair’s HS75 XB Wireless is currently the headset that I recommend if you want superb audio quality. It’s a $150 model that surprised me with impressive sound and a styling that looks like a set of premium open-back headphones. In addition to a bombastic sound that, at least for a moment, made me forget that I wasn’t using my Sony WH-1000XM3 wireless headphones, it’s comfortable to wear for hours. These look far heavier in images than they feel on my head, and I was delighted that they didn’t give off much of a pinching sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGpDXo"&gt;It’s usually the small details that win me over in a headset, and in the HS75 XB, it’s the symmetrical button layout. Thus, the learning curve for mastering the buttons is low, and this model has everything I need in a pinch, including a game and chat audio dial, volume dial, and an easy way to mute the microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7H0E2q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568253" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="obhus1"&gt;Corsair’s 20-hour battery life claims for the HS75 XB are a tad lower than competing models. But its USB-C charging at least makes recharging faster and more simple to do than plugging in via Micro USB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HiN4Uu"&gt;I mentioned this with the Razer Kaira Pro, but wireless range is an issue here. Your living arrangement might yield different results, but breaking line of sight with the Xbox Wireless Adapter plugged into my PC or straying more than 15 or so feet away made the audio begin to crackle. I think I’d prefer if Corsair simply made its own dongle that was compatible with Xbox than going this route. Still, this is a great headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OkJraT"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Corsair HS75 XB Wireless sounds like:

&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ix1BVV"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BO7lTo"&gt;Other good options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ySUxNR"&gt;The options above deliver the best experience for the money, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t other solid options out there. We tested other wireless gaming headsets from manufacturers like Turtle Beach and LucidSound. Though, there was usually one or more deal-breakers about each model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5rOlW"&gt;For instance, the Turtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 2 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stealth-Premium-Wireless-Gaming-Headset-Console/dp/B08D45WDR7/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=89ece5e076095169f2188aa3e8230262&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt;) sounds great and has USB-C charging, but its fit is tight and it’s uncomfortable to wear after a while. Your experience may vary depending on your head size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9V3HE"&gt;The LucidSound LS15X (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MMSW147/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=83aa2896b7a6f9de3c8cac25250149e1&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$86&lt;/a&gt;) and SteelSeries Arctis 7X Wireless (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-headsets%2Farctis-7x&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21549510%2Fbest-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt;) are also good in some ways, but not good enough that I suggest you seek them out over the others above. Both offer better comfort than the Stealth 700 Gen 2, but they’re relatively light on extra features and they charge via Micro USB, which is just inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fD8Ib3"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NvDGre"&gt;Best PlayStation-specific wireless gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731191871792355944" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony Pulse 3D&lt;/a&gt; ($100)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Nz0scw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with PS5, PS4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sony Pulse 3D headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rOf5ce2ocE5G4xWmRzB8Os1tqq8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22276836/pulse3d.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Sony Pulse 3D gaming headset&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KWlvfW"&gt;Sony’s $99 Pulse 3D wireless headset for the PS4 and PS5 is a surprisingly feature-packed headset that’s also one of the most comfortable options on this list. I’m a sucker for well-fitting headsets, and the bungie-style headband Sony supplies is fantastic. Instead of having a hard plastic band pulling down on the top of your head, this headset hangs its weight on a silicone band. It gives the headset a near-weightless feel when it’s on my head. Just a note: the ear cups are on the smaller side, and while mine fit just fine, folks with larger ears might not find them all that comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avxDnB"&gt;The Pulse 3D’s headline feature, though, is its ability to serve up 3D audio from the PS5’s Tempest sound engine. Actually, Sony says most headphones can push out the 3D effect, but this headset was made to really show it off. Support for 3D audio varies from game to game, but I found the PS5’s &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; to be a great showcase for it. In that game, everything from the highs that ring out from swords clashing to daunting fire-breathing dragons that push out medium- and low-frequency sounds were a delight to hear. For a more relaxing experience, &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt; sounds great, too. There are little sounds coming from everywhere, it seems. Games that don’t support 3D audio still sound good but are not quite as enthralling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPcK8B"&gt;For a $99 headset, the positional audio quality is better than I expected, as is the sound balance. There’s not an overwhelming amount of bass or tinny highs — everything is delivered delicately. I like that because it helps prevent fatigue during long play sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="63qvPj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420564"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fbTnpB"&gt;Almost everything else about this headset is impressive for the price as well. The controls are a little more intuitively laid-out than Sony’s previous model for the PS4. The Pulse 3D features a tactile rocker that lets you balance game audio with your chat, and there are separate buttons just for adjusting volume. I like that there’s a dedicated switch for turning on mic monitoring, which helps to funnel in just a little bit of outside sound (including your own voice) through its built-in pinhole microphones, so you’re not totally isolated while wearing them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KiOAWK"&gt;Speaking of mic quality, these kinds of mics are certainly not as good as what you’d get with most boom microphones. For instance, some “s” and “f” sounds are often muddled. But on the whole, it’s serviceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHWw0L"&gt;The Pulse 3D supports listening via an included 3.5mm cable or wirelessly when paired up to the 2.4GHz receiver. What’s new here is support for USB-C charging. Sony is by no means the only company putting USB-C in headsets these days, but it’s nevertheless nice to use the same cord that charges your DualSense to recharge this headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gb182h"&gt;Sony claims 13 hours of wireless performance per charge. The headset actually landed between about 10 and 12 hours during my testing, which is an underwhelming result. Of course, this is less of an issue if you’re connecting it to a power source each time you stop gaming for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="srEr31"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Sony Pulse 3D sounds like:

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uWo9Sy"&gt;Bose’s QC 35 II gaming headset offers the most features, but at the highest cost of any other headset featured in this guide. Despite costing more than an Xbox Series S or Nintendo Switch, this set delivers on value. It comes with the QC 35 II wireless noise-canceling headphones that can be used on the go with Bluetooth and wired 3.5mm connectivity. There are no other options I’ve listed that have a noise cancellation feature and support for voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant. It’s also among the most comfortable, lightweight options on this list. You’ll know when the QC 35 II is on your head, but it doesn’t pinch or press hard against your ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRyE2r"&gt;Used as a gaming headset, either connected via USB through its included desktop controller or via 3.5mm, the QC 35 II makes for a lightweight, comfortable option with a microphone attachment that’s easy to use. This model offers the best noise isolation (even without the battery-draining noise cancellation feature switched on) in any headset I’ve tested. Noise isolation is usually something most headsets fumble, but with this one you’ll be able to better hear footsteps and other crucial noises that might decide the match. With noise cancellation switched on, it really does make everything around you very quiet — perfect for boosting the immersion in your games. The desktop controller I mentioned above adds more features, including a nice volume dial and button that adjusts the intensity of mic monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZtgrRG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568255" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s3ZNt7"&gt;The $329 price is high, but if you value noise cancellation and want to have a headset you can easily take on the road (and that has ear cups that can swivel and fold into a compact size), check this out. It’s worth noting that current owners of the QC 35 II headphones unfortunately won’t be able to easily acquire the microphone attachment, as Bose isn’t selling it separately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b6Zsn5"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Bose QC 35 II gaming headset sounds like:

&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oHaXwr"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YUH1Gy"&gt;The runner-up: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345836/razer-blackshark-v2-x-budget-friendly-wired-gaming-headsets"&gt;Razer BlackShark V2 + sound card&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="U8pXiM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with any device with an available 3.5mm jack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer BlackShark V2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_xx8tXQweQhnns7y4ri_KSFBcyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20782512/blacksharkv2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Ejvb7t"&gt;Razer’s updated BlackShark headset is my runner-up choice for a wired headset you can buy. It’s $100, yet it features a similar design and general feature set to Razer’s $200 wireless V2 Pro model. That also means it’s just as comfortable, with a plush headband and breathable ear cups that don’t apply too much pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOPElj"&gt;This model’s build materials are a step above the $59 BlackShark V2 X when it comes to being breathable, and it includes a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345836/razer-blackshark-v2-x-budget-friendly-wired-gaming-headsets"&gt;USB sound card&lt;/a&gt;, into which the headset’s 3.5mm end plugs. With it, you’ll get slightly better sound quality. Also, using the sound card allows you to use THX spatial sound in Razer’s Synapse 3 software, which I found to be a nice value add but not particularly alluring in practice. Razer says it’s adding spatial audio profiles for popular games moving forward, so you’ll have plenty of ways to utilize the sound card, if this feature strikes your interest. Regardless of your interest, you’ll also be able to plug the headset’s 3.5mm end into a variety of controllers and the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gz2EXW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568257" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HgFwUw"&gt;Something that stood out to me during testing is that finding a comfortable fit took almost no effort. And while many headsets are comfortable enough to wear for hours, I didn’t want to take the BlackShark V2 off my head. Another nice touch is its volume knob, which affords fine-tune adjustments that dials don’t usually provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SMekMu"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the BlackShark V2 sounds like:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;audio controls=""&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TY1VFp"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ryiJOs"&gt;Other good options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bXkzte"&gt;If you’re committed to getting a wired headset, there are some really interesting options out there. I got to test a few other headsets that, while not as good as the models above, might be better for your needs or budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlIgFJ"&gt;For something less expensive than Bose’s headset that still sounds good, HyperX’s Cloud Revolver 7.1 wired headset for a PC (&lt;a href="https://www.hyperxgaming.com/unitedstates/us/headsets/cloud-revolver-gaming-headset"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt;) might be worth checking out, particularly if you’re looking for something comfortable. This model is just as comfy to wear as the Cloud II Wireless, my top wireless pick at the top of this article. Sound quality isn’t at the same level, though, and I’d recommend holding off on any purchases until the price drops, as the package here is fairly light on features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Uaxxs"&gt;Creative Audio’s SXFI Gamer (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BNPSZVP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=d134f5aa0a291f3f43cb53e066c7546d&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$130&lt;/a&gt;) is a USB-C wired headset that has a simple design and a sound profile that’s pleasant to listen to for games, voice chat, or music. My complaints with this one are on the minor side, with its sizing adjustments not holding very well and its voice prompts sometimes being confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="QJEfi2"&gt;The Sennheiser EPOS 601 (&lt;a href="https://www.eposaudio.com/en/us/gaming/products/gsp-601-gaming-headset-1000413"&gt;$220&lt;/a&gt;) nails the fundamentals, with great sound and a quality microphone. But the ear cups are too darn big, and that excess spills into its overall design. It’s also too expensive for a relatively basic wired headset that doesn’t offer but a couple of special features, like replaceable sidearm plates and a twist-to-adjust volume knob.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H0w5VY"&gt;To help make travel during the pandemic a little less stressful, Apple Maps &lt;a href="https://aci.aero/news/2021/03/30/covid-19-airport-travel-guidance-now-available-in-apple-maps/"&gt;will now display travel guidance information&lt;/a&gt; provided by the Airports Council International (ACI) so you know what to expect before you take off or land at your destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5OqhAK"&gt;The travel guidances — like mask requirements, health screenings, and quarantine guidelines — will be displayed on an individual airport’s place card in Apple Maps, with links to official airport guidance websites as well. The information should be viewable on iPhones, iPads, and Macs — though, currently, only airports that are participating in the &lt;a href="https://api.acris.aero/homepage/"&gt;ACI’s Health Measures Portal&lt;/a&gt; will feature the new information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Travel guidances in Apple Maps on iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uviDZn"&gt;Apple Maps has been updated to display other useful COVID-19 information over the last year, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240546/apple-maps-covid-19-testing-sites-mobility-trends"&gt;the location of testing sites&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334609/apple-maps-facebook-google-covid-19-vaccine-locations"&gt;available vaccine providers&lt;/a&gt;. You can check Apple Maps to see if the airport you’re traveling to has guidance, or use the &lt;a href="https://api.acris.aero/check_and_fly/COVID19/v1/"&gt;ACI’s Check &amp;amp; Fly&lt;/a&gt; tool to find participating airports.&lt;/p&gt;

Leveraging Chrome OS’s Guest mode feature, the attack would require physical access to the device, but it can be executed without knowing the user’s password or having login access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9aFQ61"&gt;The bug was flagged to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by the Committee on Liberatory Information Technology, a tech collective that includes several former Googlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80sy20"&gt;“We are looking into this issue,” said a Google spokesperson. “In the meantime, device owners can turn off guest mode and disable the creation of new users.” Instructions for turning off Guest browsing are available &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1059252?hl=en"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d3Oj6d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“anyone with quick physical access to the device could potentially get in as guest”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H1Rdot"&gt;The bug stems from the way Chromebooks treat their Wi-Fi logs, which show when and how a computer connects to the broader internet. The logs can be confusing for nontechnical users, but they can be deciphered to reveal which Wi-Fi networks were in range of the computer. Combined with other available data, that could reveal the owner’s movements over the period of time covered by the logs — potentially as long as seven days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayP75U"&gt;Because Chrome OS keeps those logs in unprotected memory, they can be accessed without a password. Simply opening a Chromebook in Guest mode and navigating to a standardized address will bring up the logs in local storage. That will show all logs for the computer, even ones generated outside of Guest mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBUnil"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation researcher Andrés Arrieta confirmed the attack and said it was of particular concern for targeted and marginalized communities. While the bug wouldn’t be useful to conventional cybercriminals, it’s a potentially devastating privacy issue for those worried about surveillance from family members or co-workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msQSZ5"&gt;“It’s worrisome because anyone with quick physical access to the device could potentially get in as guest and quickly take some logs, and out details of location,” said Arrieta. “Security teams should try to better understand the potential repercussions of those bugs for all their users and include that in their assessment and prioritization of bugs.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anti-Asian hate is spilling over to LinkedIn</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UJ6jj5pB39BtlZRp-EhN-FORZKw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69050079/VRG_ILLO_4053_003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6KJZTe"&gt;Ingrid Fung hadn’t anticipated that her post on LinkedIn would cause a stir. She’d written about escalating anti-Asian violence, reposting a graphic that said attacks on Asian Americans had risen dramatically in the past year. The message might have drawn racist comments on Twitter or Facebook, but this was the world’s biggest &lt;em&gt;professional&lt;/em&gt; social network — one where people had to use their real names and list their employer. What was the worst they would say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xK3H6n"&gt;“This statistic is crap and from a questionable source,” wrote one user who took issue with the data collected by the nonprofit Stop AAPI Hate. “...I would not be surprised if AAPI isn’t [Chinese Communist Party] backed.” Another user said she was propagating “CCP narratives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IlUjvH"&gt;Fung, a venture capitalist, was shocked. “It felt like a violation,” she says. “You wouldn’t expect this to happen in a professional space.” She reported the first post to LinkedIn, only to be told it did not violate the company’s community policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyLRq4"&gt;(LinkedIn told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it had reversed its decision and took action on the post, noting that its “Community Policies make it clear what is and is not ok on LinkedIn.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uNLPFN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The model minority myth has wreaked havoc on our communities”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UfF99h"&gt;Fung’s experience is part of a growing wave of hate directed at Asian American and Canadian professionals. The trend reveals the extent to which anti-Asian racism has been normalized — in part because of the misleading idea that the Asian population is homogenous. “We have been very clear about the ways in which the model minority myth has wreaked havoc on our communities,” says Manjusha Kulkarni, co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate. “It suggests that Asian American communities don’t have problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFUwBQ"&gt;Indeed, the income gap in the United States is greatest among Asians, &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/07/12/income-inequality-in-the-u-s-is-rising-most-rapidly-among-asians/"&gt;according to the Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1970 to 2016, economic gains made by low-income Asians lagged behind other poor communities. Yet, overall, Asians are still the highest-earning racial group in the US — a fact some LinkedIn users chose to cite when dismissing anti-Asian violence.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Obhh6X"&gt;“Statistics show Asians are the most successful immigrant group in the USA,” wrote one. “I don’t buy that Asians are targeted more than any others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3l83r"&gt;Kulkarni says the xenophobia is linked to language used by former President Donald Trump, who called &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/with-kung-flu-trump-sparks-backlash-over-racist-language%E2%80%94and-a-rallying-cry-for-supporters/2020/06/24/485d151e-b620-11ea-aca5-ebb63d27e1ff_story.html"&gt;COVID-19 the “kung-flu,” “China virus,” and “Wuhan virus”&lt;/a&gt; on multiple occasions. &lt;a href="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.69.231/a1w.90d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/210312-Stop-AAPI-Hate-National-Report-.pdf"&gt;Stop AAPI Hate’s 2020 national report&lt;/a&gt; documented incidents of harassment and assault where attackers directly quoted Trump’s ideas. “A number of the people have weaponized Trump himself,” Kulkarni says. “These people get their direction from their former President.” The CCP conspiracy theories in Fung’s replies support that claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jie7z7"&gt;On LinkedIn, the comments are made possible by the platform’s determination to become more than just a resume repository. Years ago, it rolled out a personalized news feed, and in 2020, it inexplicably launched its own version of Snapchat Stories. The features were largely home to cheerful corporate missives until Black users began posting about racial discrimination in the workplace amid the George Floyd protests.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5d0lkM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s OK to bring your whole self to work when you’re white”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BT2VLQ"&gt;The posts put LinkedIn content moderators in the “incendiary position of determining what manner of race-related speech is appropriate for its virtual workplace of 706 million users,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/business/black-linkedin.html"&gt;wrote Ashanti M. Martin in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company did not appear to welcome the challenge, and Black users told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; their posts were vanishing under “vague rules of decorum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7nmUIq"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Greg Snapper, a LinkedIn spokesperson, said that in the past year, there have been some “significant shifts” in how members discuss workplace issues. “And at the same time, we’ve seen an increase in the volume of member reports on posts, comments and messages,” he added. “We’ve taken a number of actions to protect our members who have a high bar for safe conversations given the professional context of LinkedIn and we couldn’t agree more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dMt0XR"&gt;The issue about what language is accepted on LinkedIn is reminiscent of the ongoing debate about bringing your “whole self” to work. Mike Robbins, a self-described thought leader, wrote a book on the topic, saying that people can “work better, lead better, and be more engaged and fulfilled” if they show up “fully and authentically,” rather than hide who they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVM8OI"&gt;Unfortunately, he quickly realized the reality was far more complicated. “It’s OK to bring your whole self to work when you’re white. And cisgender. And male. And straight. Or whatever,” &lt;a href="https://digiday.com/media/the-boundaries-have-broken-employers-deal-with-the-reality-of-workers-bring-their-whole-selves/"&gt;he said in &lt;em&gt;Digiday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But such acceptance didn’t always extend to other identities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LIm8gf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;He was jumped by three men who said, “You gonna try some kung-fu on us?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a9lUVg"&gt;Some Asian professionals who spoke to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; said they’d been taught to do the opposite: keep their heads down and focus on their work. “From my own experience, the way you’re brought up is very goal-oriented,” says Kane Ma, a former UNC at Chapel Hill basketball player and chief technology officer at Kamo Digital. “Sometimes I think it leads to minimizing other topics like talking about racism or discrimination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGq5LL"&gt;After the Atlanta spa shooting, more people began to speak out condemning anti-Asian violence. Ma posted about a hate crime he’d experienced in Chapel Hill, where he was jumped by three men who said, “You gonna try some kung-fu on us?” before fracturing his skull. “As an Asian American and person of color, I have experienced the recurring theme of racism in America,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKOq10"&gt;It was the first time he’d spoken publicly about the attack — and he did so to build awareness with executives in the business community. “There are leaders of organizations who have a lot of influence over the people who work for them,” he says. “So I think sparking discussion or at least introspection could be really productive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymsvYX"&gt;Almost immediately, however, Ma realized he’d struck a nerve with white supremacists. “Kane Ma, perhaps you should read this article and stop implying Caucasians are the de facto source of this hatred,” wrote one user. “Yeah, what about the Arab who just killed all of the white people in Boulder?” responded another. “Funny, don’t hear any race hacking about that, huh?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5binOF"&gt;Ma says the comments didn’t surprise him. “If I posted this on Facebook, I’m sure I would have gotten worse,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8D5U4Y"&gt;To Ingrid Fung, what made the LinkedIn comments stand out was that users felt confident using their real profiles. “What made me most uncomfortable was that people were okay attaching their professional identities to what they were saying,” she explains. “They felt so comfortable, they didn’t expect there would be any repercussions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZ1TsI"&gt;In fact, when she emailed the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay to report the man who’d said her statistics were “crap” and suggested Stop AAPI Hate was backed by the Chinese Communist Party, the assistant vice chancellor of policy and compliance responded to say that while the school did not support the man’s statements, it was “limited” in its response because he was just an ad hoc instructor. He then &lt;a href="https://www.uwgb.edu/UWGBCMS/media/Dean-of-Students/files/Civility-and-Inclusion-Statement-17.pdf"&gt;sent Fung a public statement on “civility and inclusion.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MUVGmE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I feel like I’m being held up at these organizations to cover other people’s lack of action and racism”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="en4xcu"&gt;She says the interaction disappointed her. Her goal wasn’t to get the man fired; she just wanted the school to speak with him so he’d know he’d been out of line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPrLim"&gt;The lack of action was made worse by the fact that Fung says she’s received numerous requests over the past year from organizations looking to increase diversity on their boards. “I feel like I’m being held up at these organizations to cover other people’s lack of action and racism,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avySre"&gt;The responses Fung and Ma received on LinkedIn show how difficult it is for people to understand racism against Asian Americans and Canadians. Both were able to speak out in part because they are successful — as a venture capitalist and business executive, respectively, they’re in positions of relative power compared to other parts of the Asian community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeyJoN"&gt;That fact also makes it easy for people to fall back on stereotypes, dismissing their concerns as the complaints of wealthy professionals. These comments imply that certain kinds of employment prevent them from experiencing any form of racism — or that their experience must be representative of the entire Asian community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5B2ddG"&gt;In the case of anti-Asian discrimination, that perceived success has been both the catalyst for resentment and the reason the Asian community’s lived experience has been repeatedly denied, even on a social network for professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is reportedly working on custom networking chips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lbkUBTrpsvxHgfQxv9tnLllxHgE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049922/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="94Xrs2"&gt;Amazon is reportedly working on custom silicon chips for its hardware network switches, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-steps-up-silicon-ambitions-with-new-networking-chip"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The chips, which could help Amazon improve its internal infrastructure as well as AWS, are said to be the result of &lt;a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/198140-amazon-buys-secretive-chip-maker-annapurna-labs-for-350-million"&gt;Amazon’s $350 million acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of Israeli chipmaking firm Annapurna Labs back in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6Mh6d"&gt;Amazon building the silicon for its switches could help it solve bottlenecks and issues in its own infrastructure, especially if it’s also custom-building the software that runs on them. &lt;a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2015/10/12/the-custom-gear-inside-amazons-cloud/"&gt;Amazon already builds its own switches&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s reliant on Broadcom for the silicon that powers them. It makes sense for the company to want to completely control those machines, especially given how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"&gt;important its web services business is&lt;/a&gt;. It’s possible Amazon could even offer some services it wasn’t able to offer before, powered by the new switches, &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;suggests, citing the machine learning software that Amazon offers that currently runs on Annapurna chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQEWWR"&gt;The reported chips aren’t Amazon’s first custom silicon product. The company has previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453205/amazon-az1-neural-edge-processor-echo-show-10-alexa-voice-on-device"&gt;worked with MediaTek to create a chip for its Echo smart speaker products&lt;/a&gt;, designed to make Alexa respond faster. It also has its &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/01/amazon-debuts-trainium-a-custom-chip-for-machine-learning-training-workloads/"&gt;custom machine learning chips it calls Trainium&lt;/a&gt;, which will become available to AWS customers soon. It makes sense that the company would also want its own chips to power the backbone of its network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZ5gGm"&gt;Custom chip design is also quickly becoming table stakes for big tech companies. We’ve recently seen reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21221062/google-processor-pixels-chromebooks-whitechapel-samsung-qualcomm"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; are building custom processors for their devices, and Apple has been doing it for years now, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;the M1 Macs being an example&lt;/a&gt; of how much more potent a company’s products can be when it controls both the hardware and software. While Amazon may not be a titan in the smartphone or PC space, it’s a giant in the cloud, and that’s where it seems to be focusing on putting new chips to work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon says it will shut down its 3G network — for real this time — on December 31st, 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JsotKMjQE5x4o8PYbbzbbVWUHvM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049900/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon stopped activating phones on its 3G network several years ago.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rjM2ZN"&gt;After years of delays, Verizon says it will finally &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F3g-cdma-network-shut-date-set-december-31-2022&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F30%2F22358628%2Fverizon-3g-cdma-shutdown-date-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shut down its 3G CDMA network&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2022 — and the company means it this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KIxAK"&gt;Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/11/3488546/verizon-sunset-2g-3g-cdma-2021"&gt;initially targeted 2021&lt;/a&gt; for the shutdown and later revised with a more ambitious goal of 2019. That didn’t happen, and as recently as January 2021, the company said the plan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215453/verizon-3g-shutdown-paused-delay-network-old-phones"&gt;was on hold indefinitely&lt;/a&gt;. Now, Verizon has confirmed an official shutdown date of December 31st, 2022, and a statement that “the date will not be extended again” on the company’s news site leaves no room for ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzdy3l"&gt;This move won’t affect anyone who has activated a phone with Verizon in the past few years; the company stopped activating 3G-only phones in 2018. Verizon is also keen to point out that it will be the last major US carrier to take its 3G network offline. AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022"&gt;says it will shut down its network&lt;/a&gt; in February 2022, and &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/05/t-mobile-3g-shutdown-reportedly-delayed-until-2022/"&gt;T-Mobile is aiming for January 1st, 2022&lt;/a&gt;, which could &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/what-t-mobile-3g-cdma-shutdown-means-for-boost-mobile"&gt;cause serious problems&lt;/a&gt; for millions of Dish Network’s Boost Mobile customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lUxhZH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon stopped activating 3G-only phones in 2018&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H3cshK"&gt;If you happen to still be using a 3G device on Verizon at this point (well done, you!), then you’ll need to upgrade to something 4G-compatible by the end of 2022 to keep using the network — and it might be a good idea to go for a 5G device at this point just to stay ahead of the next curve.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arm’s first new architecture in a decade is designed for security and AI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TAIWAN-IT-ARM" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ESs0sPl2rm3oMayVntuIpaawZ-0=/0x0:6482x4321/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049703/1146397412.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;SAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N5tgzt"&gt;Chip designer Arm has announced Armv9, its first new chip architecture in a decade following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/28/2522146/arm-reveals-64-bit-architecture-armv8-expects-prototype-systems-in"&gt;Armv8 way back in 2011&lt;/a&gt;. According to Arm, Armv9 offers three major improvements over the previous architecture: security, better AI performance, and faster performance in general. These benefits should eventually trickle down to devices with processors based on Arm’s designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWCTbJ"&gt;It’s an important milestone for the company, whose designs power almost every smartphone sold today, as well as increasing numbers of laptops and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300097/fugaku-supercomputer-worlds-fastest-top500-riken-fujitsu-arm"&gt;servers&lt;/a&gt;. Apple announced its Mac computers’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;transition to its own Arm-based processors last year&lt;/a&gt;, and its first Apple Silicon Macs released later in the year. Other manufacturers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20948092/microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; have also released Arm-based laptops in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LQxszL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Benefiting the wide array of machines using Arm-based processors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7iO0ck"&gt;First of the big three improvements coming with Armv9 is security. The new Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA), attempts to protect sensitive data with a secure, hardware-based environment. These so-called “Realms” can be dynamically created to protect important data and code from the rest of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i4j4VN"&gt;Next up is AI processing. Armv9 will include Scalable Vector Extension 2 (SVE2), a technology that is designed to help with machine learning and digital signal processing tasks. This should benefit everything from 5G systems to virtual and augmented reality and machine learning workloads like image processing and voice recognition. AI applications like these &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21435890/nvidia-arm-acquisition-40-billion-ai-cloud-edge-why"&gt;are said to be&lt;/a&gt; a key reason why Nvidia is currently in the process of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"&gt;buying Arm for $40 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5qTar0"&gt;But away from these more specific improvements, Arm also promises more general performance increases from Armv9. It expects CPU performance to increase by over 30 percent across the next two generations, with further boosts performance coming from software and hardware optimizations. Arm says all existing software will run on Armv9-based processors without any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKdbPT"&gt;With the architecture announced, the big question is when the processors using the architecture might release and find their way into consumer products. Arm says it expects the first Armv9-based silicon to ship before the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0j8SQG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Privacy and ads in Chrome are about to become FLoCing complicated</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p&gt;Google is forging ahead with its third-party cookie replacement technology&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="U3YqX7"&gt;Repent, o ye ad trackers, for the cookiepocalypse is nigh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNP7Co"&gt;If Google sticks to its roadmap, by this time next year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox"&gt;Chrome will no longer allow websites to use third-party cookies&lt;/a&gt;, which are cookies that come from outside their own domains. The change theoretically makes it vastly more difficult for advertisers to track your activities on the web and then serve you targeted ads. Safari and Firefox have already blocked those cookies, but when it comes to market share, Chrome is currently the leader and so its switchover is the big one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fy6BTy"&gt;Blocking third-party cookies means that only websites you explicitly visit will be able to save those little cookie files on your computer, and they should theoretically only do what cookies were originally intended to do: keep track of smaller things like whether you’re logged in or which shopping cart is yours. Blocking third-party cookies also means ad networks can’t figure out who you are and serve you targeted ads, which is a big problem for the ad industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCFctf"&gt;Google, which is the biggest player in online ads, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310332/google-privacy-replacing-third-party-cookies-privacy-sandbox"&gt;has claimed&lt;/a&gt; that it does not intend to replace third-party cookies with “alternative identifiers to track individuals as they browse across the web.” This seems like a win for privacy all around, but if something about the story of Google as the privacy and anti-ad crusader strikes you as a little... off, you are far from alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zkgCd8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google doesn’t want to kneecap the online ad industry&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nt7rfK"&gt;Because of course Google doesn’t want to kneecap the online ad industry — the one it dominates and from which it makes all its money. Instead, Google wants to replace the third-party tracking cookie with a &lt;a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-advertising#ideas-and-proposals-links-outside-this-repo"&gt;complicated set of (bird-themed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/WICG/turtledove"&gt;) technologies&lt;/a&gt; that are meant to let ad companies target specific demographics like age and location, while at the same time allowing the people who are targeted to remain anonymous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHIMox"&gt;Google is trying to avert the cookiepocalypse for the ad tech industry, no repentance necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jLW3d"&gt;And so today, the &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/privacy-sustainability-and-the-importance-of-and/"&gt;company is forging ahead with an “origin trial” for one of these new technologies&lt;/a&gt;, the Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC). In an &lt;a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/OriginTrials/blob/gh-pages/developer-guide.md"&gt;origin trial&lt;/a&gt;, websites are able to begin testing without asking browser users to turn on specific flags. The feature itself will be slowly turned on inside Chrome via the usual process of introducing it into developer builds, then beta, then finally in the shipping version most people use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6ALbh"&gt;But what the hell is FLoC, and does it really protect your privacy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CR5S6t"&gt;FLoC: a Federated Learning of Cohorts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="UnuGjX"&gt;FloC is a proposed browser standard that, in Google’s words, will enable “interest-based advertising on the web” without letting advertisers know your identity. Instead, you’ll be associated with a “cohort,” a group of users sufficiently large enough to make you at least semi-anonymous to the companies targeting you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFgCKf"&gt;That’s the simple explanation. The technical one gets very complicated very quickly. Here’s a quick version. Chrome browsers will use algorithms (the “Federated Learning” part) to create a very large number of “cohorts,” groups of people that share certain qualities and interests. Each person’s individual browsing history is kept private and never shared with anybody, but the browser itself will look at the history and then assign a user to one of those cohorts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cG9z2e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instead of identifying you individually, FLoC wants to make you part of a “cohort”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BnzzMp"&gt;When you visit a website, Chrome will tell that site that the visitor is part of cohort 198273 (or whatever) and then it’s up to the website to know that cohort 198273 (or whatever) is interested in pickup trucks and shoes with vegan leather. Since Chrome will never assign a user to a small cohort (Google has proposed that it will wait until there are “thousands” in a group), your identity as an animal-loving &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_coal"&gt;coal roller&lt;/a&gt; is theoretically protected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBoWj8"&gt;Chrome itself isn’t assigning any content labels to these FloCs; Google is leaving that to the ad tech industry to figure out. So you won’t be able to open up a privacy page inside Chrome and see what it thinks you’re interested in (though there’s theoretically nothing stopping a third-party website from telling you). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JzTu5"&gt;Since FLoC is structured in this way, it could mean that the powerful players in ad tech could become even more entrenched, because they have the technology to parse what FLoCs mean and what ads to target against them. Or it could mean smaller players could find a way in. We don’t know all the possible repercussions of FLoC, which is why it has both ad industry executives and privacy advocates so unsettled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUHz46"&gt;You can read the whole proposal and even check out the code for how it works at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/WICG/floc"&gt;GitHub repository for FLoC&lt;/a&gt; inside the &lt;a href="https://wicg.github.io/admin/charter.html"&gt;Web Incubator Community Group&lt;/a&gt;. As with most things on the web, it’s being developed out in the open and is part of a process of proposals, critiques, counter-proposals, attempts to get other browser vendors to join, arguments, harangues, screeds, and good-faith efforts to make the web a better place. It’s a party, y’all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X9mQ2C"&gt;The new front in the browser wars: privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PM0Zxy"&gt;No other browser vendor has signaled its intention to support FLoC. The rest are simply blocking third-party cookies and letting the chips fall where they may. And those chips are messy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hc6BTO"&gt;Whatever motivations you want to imbue on the Chrome team, it is already apparent that simply blocking third-party cookies will lead to very problematic new solutions from the ad tech industry. So Google is creating both FLoC and a suite of other technologies to replace the third-party cookie, in order to hopefully forestall even worse replacements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2W2zba"&gt;One of the very bad things Google is trying to forestall is fingerprinting. That’s the generalized term for ways that websites can identify you through little data signals that leak out of your browser when you visit a site. Sites can look at your IP address, the OS you’re browsing from, the size of your window, whether your browser supports Bluetooth controllers, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swJfEu"&gt;Battling fingerprinting is a huge arms race for browser engineers and new, nefarious methods pop up seemingly weekly. Here’s a &lt;a href="https://fingerprintjs.com/blog/audio-fingerprinting/"&gt;new method of fingerprinting I just came across&lt;/a&gt;: playing a very tiny bit of audio and then analyzing how your particular browser and device handle it, and then using that data to individually identify you in milliseconds. (The website that proposed it &lt;a href="https://fingerprintjs.com/why-fpjs/"&gt;sells fingerprint services to legitimate companies&lt;/a&gt; so they can ostensibly use it to better identify potential fraudsters on their sites.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="h3vA9w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fighting browser fingerprinting is a huge arms race to protect your identity and privacy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3LwbgD"&gt;Apple has very publicly and vociferously advocated for cutting off all methods of individualized tracking, including fingerprinting, and has committed itself to that arms race indefinitely. The Chrome team’s concern is that essentially such a hard line creates an incentive for legitimate ad tech companies to start engaging in fingerprinting, which will then be all but impossible to stop or regulate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t89Rm2"&gt;Here’s how Google puts it in its blog post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qpzLCK"&gt;When other browsers started blocking third-party cookies by default, we were excited about the direction, but worried about the immediate impact. Excited because we absolutely need a more private web, and we know third-party cookies aren’t the long-term answer. Worried because today many publishers rely on cookie-based advertising to support their content efforts, and we had seen that cookie blocking was already spawning privacy-invasive workarounds (such as fingerprinting) that were even worse for user privacy. Overall, we felt that blocking third-party cookies outright without viable alternatives for the ecosystem was irresponsible, and even harmful, to the free and open web we all enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TRvPBc"&gt;It’s hard to separate each company’s financial incentives from their very real philosophical differences. Google prints money with its de facto monopoly on monetizing the open web through ads and is therefore incentivized to keep it going. At the same time, Chrome’s developers are true believers in the power and importance of the open web. Meanwhile, Apple wouldn’t be sad if Google made less money amid a massive online ad tracking reckoning. At the same time, Apple’s developers are true believers in the importance of personal privacy and the urgent need to go all-out in protecting that privacy against constant online assaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJqFdO"&gt;In any case, the problem with fingerprinting is that once you’re identified, it’s much harder to anonymize yourself. A cookie can be deleted, but the way your particular computer processes a milliseconds-long snippet of audio is much harder to change (though Brave has an innovative solution called &lt;a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates-4/"&gt;Farbling&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5SJzZ"&gt;The basic argument from the Chrome team is that erecting a so-called “privacy wall” will entice legitimate ad tech companies into succumbing to the temptation of fingerprinting. Google is hoping that ad tech companies will adopt FLoC as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBfw8T"&gt;If nothing else, there’s one big thing to take away from all this: FLoC is a hell of a lot better than the current status of third-party cookies that directly identify you anywhere you go on the web. But “better than the worst” is a low bar, and it’s hard to know yet whether FLoC just clears it or vaults way over it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZINDvs"&gt;Is FLoC really private?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="lkhzqX"&gt;Instead of a trying to build a metaphorical privacy wall that blocks all forms of ad targeting, Google plans on building a &lt;a href="https://www.privacysandbox.com/"&gt;Privacy Sandbox&lt;/a&gt; inside Chrome. Within that sandbox, websites can still legitimately request to know certain details about your browser as they need. A game streaming site could ask to know if your browser supports a game controller, for example. But ask too much and you’ll exceed the browser’s “privacy budget” and get cut off. Websites can have just a little identifying information, as a treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LbHOiE"&gt;FLoC will be part of that privacy sandbox and further should protect your identity by only associating you with a cohort if that cohort is sufficiently large. Chrome will also change what FLoC cohort your browser is associated with on a regular basis, say once a week or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWzm7e"&gt;But whether FLoC is actually anonymous is very much up for debate. Bennett Cyphers at Electronic Frontier Foundation recently put up a &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea"&gt;handy post detailing some of the biggest concerns with FLoC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="d3qB4c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;FLoC could potentially identify you as being part of an at-risk group&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AP8jNV"&gt;One of the key aspects of FLoC is that Google isn’t making some giant list of interests and demographics and then assigning you to them. Instead, it’s proposing to use Federated Learning to create a ton of these cohorts algorithmically. Chrome won’t really know what any of them are actually about; it’ll be up to ad tech vendors to understand that over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtlJPS"&gt;But as Cyphers points out, that algorithm will inevitably create cohorts that could be incredibly dangerous — say, a group of people who have visited sites about getting out of domestic abuse situations. The Chrome team says it recognizes this concern and so will be analyzing the algorithmically created cohorts to see if any are related to what it deems to be &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/143465?hl=en"&gt;sensitive topics&lt;/a&gt; — and then Chrome won’t serve those cohort IDs. But FLoC isn’t centralized, so it’s important to know that if another browser vendor adopts FLoC, it will be incumbent on that browser to create similar block lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXp4M0"&gt;Websites will be able to opt out of participating in FLoC, meaning that visits to their sites won’t contribute to an individual FLoC user’s profile. Similarly, the Chrome team intends to put opt-out toggles somewhere in Chrome’s settings for users who don’t want to provide FLoC IDs to the websites they visit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbojiV"&gt;Could FLoC become just another data point for fingerprinters? It seems likely, and defending against that seems to be another job for Chrome’s privacy budget and privacy sandbox algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWJdL1"&gt;One more thing: FLoC is a very convenient way for the websites you visit to know enough about you to target relevant ads, which means that FLoC is a very convenient way for websites to know things about you. It’s certainly no worse than the current cookie situation, but it’s far from the “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgNrvnY1mo0"&gt;You Shall Not Pass!&lt;/a&gt;” philosophy other browser vendors (like Apple and Brave) apply to allowing access to potentially identifiable information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iMjQpO"&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WOiYUZ"&gt;This first FLoC “origin trial” is designed to help websites learn how FLoC works; some of the testing for Chrome users will come later. Here is how Google describes the way it’s going to work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="vDlLMw"&gt;The initial testing of FLoC is taking place with a small percentage of users in Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines and the U.S. We’ll expand to other regions as the Privacy Sandbox expands globally. In April, we’ll introduce a control in Chrome Settings that you can use to opt out of inclusion in FLoC and other Privacy Sandbox proposals. In the meantime, if you’ve chosen to block third-party cookies, you won’t be included in these origin trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EvtG3R"&gt;If you look at that list of countries, you might notice that something stands out: none of them are in the EU, where GDPR regulations are in effect. Recently, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robinberjon/status/1374389427716321286"&gt;Robin Berjon of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; wondered&lt;/a&gt; whether that meant that FLoC would run afoul of those privacy regulations. According to the product manager for the Chrome privacy sandbox, Marshall Vale, it’s more a matter of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marshallvale/status/1374494962646020098"&gt;limiting the size of the early tests and that his team&lt;/a&gt; is “100% committed to the Privacy Sandbox in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Bfhf19"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"And now, a brief definition of the web","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/24/15681958/what-is-web-definition"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PxhEI3"&gt;Under normal circumstances, a newly proposed web technology wends its way through mailing lists and W3C conference room debates. It gets supported by the browser vendor that championed it and then, if its lucky, other browsers. Thus, the web manages to not become browser-specific in the ways it was back in the bad old days of Internet Explorer 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHxA8W"&gt;But when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox"&gt;Google originally announced its intention to block third-party cookies last year&lt;/a&gt;, I pointed out that the rhetoric between browser vendors was getting sharp. It’s only gotten sharper as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, Brave, and others have gone further down their respective paths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqECse"&gt;It seems unlikely that FLoC will lead to a standard because everybody agrees on a good way to allow targeted advertising. If FLoC does become a standard, it’ll probably be because Chrome will eventually turn it on and it will become the norm just through sheer market share — both Chrome’s within the browser market and Google’s within the ad tech market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="54fTFu"&gt;That possible future might avert the cookiepocalypse, but it could also become a different kind of nightmare for the web: one where websites once again try to push you to use the browser they can best monetize via whatever ad tech platform they’re using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0WrLum"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CD Projekt Red is changing how it makes games after disastrous Cyberpunk 2077 launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JO_jXMdoWt0XhCr6Th8tnQxdk9w=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049625/screen_ripperdoc_clinic_en.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cdpU1h"&gt;Polish game studio CD Projekt Red announced a sweeping restructuring plan on Tuesday, just months after the disastrous launch of its much-hyped title &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. One of the key goals of the new plan brings “a change in the way [the studio] develops video games,” according to a press release. The changes will allow CD Projekt Red to work on “multiple AAA games and expansions in parallel” starting in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01zpnN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; launched in December after years of hype; the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P99qJGrPNLs"&gt;first teaser trailer&lt;/a&gt; for the game was released in January 2013. And following the huge success of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/22/10636822/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-best-video-game-2015"&gt;CD Projekt Red’s &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, expectations were sky-high for the studio’s cyberpunk RPG, especially following the glitzy and action-packed trailers shown in the months leading up to the game’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KhVkq6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Cyberpunk 2077’ was riddled with bugs when it launched&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="REZjSJ"&gt;But the game, released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069016/cyberpunk-2077-new-release-date-date-delay-september-cd-projekt-red"&gt;after&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295705/cyberpunk-2077-delayed-again-release-date-november-19th-bug-fixes-balance-cd-projekt-red"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536662/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-delay-december"&gt;delays&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494499/cyberpunk-2077-development-crunch-time-cd-projekt-red"&gt;reported six-day workweek&lt;/a&gt; for the developers ahead of the launch, was riddled with bugs and performance issues when it was finally available, &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-12-10-cyberpunk-2077-is-super-rough-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-and-the-memes-have-already-begun"&gt;particularly on older consoles&lt;/a&gt;. The performance was bad enough that Sony took the extraordinary step of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;removing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; from the PlayStation Store&lt;/a&gt; and offering refunds. (More than 100 days later, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; still hasn’t returned to the store.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpbKe2"&gt;In the months since launch, CD Projekt Red has released numerous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22198029/cyberpunk-2077-106-update-patch-corrupted-save-file-crashes"&gt;hotfixes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22239765/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-bug-fixes"&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253990/cyberpunk-2077-new-1-11-update-hotfix-game-breaking-bug"&gt;even hotfixes for the updates&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to shore up &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s&lt;/em&gt; issues and get it running smoothly. (Just yesterday, the studio released an update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356546/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-2-bug-fixes-console-stadia"&gt;with hundreds of fixes&lt;/a&gt;, though there still seem to be &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22358419/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-patch-update-1-2-driving-cars-cops?utm_campaign=polygon&amp;amp;utm_content=chorus&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;some hilarious bugs&lt;/a&gt;.) Many of the plans announced on Tuesday seem to be in service of preventing another high-profile fiasco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQARLf"&gt;One major change is that CD Projekt Red plans to change how its proprietary REDengine game engine is developed, which could improve performance for future games. “The Studio’s REDengine technology will be improved and centralized, while reorganizing the Studio as a set of interdisciplinary agile teams will transform the way games are developed, making its approach more proactive,” CD Projekt Red said. Theoretically, those changes could prevent issues in future games where games run much more poorly on older consoles, like many experienced with &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdBadN"&gt;Single-player RPGs “will remain our priority,” Michał Nowakowski, the studio’s SVP of business development, said in a statement, and you can expect to see more of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;. “We also perceive the huge potential of both &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt;, and we want to expand their reach to include new areas, media and content types,” Nowakowski said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="RvnHWi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Single-player RPGs ‘will remain our priority’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6K4hCV"&gt;Despite the focus on single player, CD Projekt Red does plan to expand its games’ online capabilities, though the studio wasn’t specific about what those features might be. These online features will be gradually rolled out to CD Projekt Red games, the studio said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kh0XcI"&gt;And perhaps recognizing that the years-long promotional campaign for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; may have backfired, CD Projekt Red committed to changing how it promotes its future games. “Future marketing campaigns will be much shorter, with promotional content released closer to the actual release of the given game, presenting its operation on all supported hardware platforms,” CD Projekt Red said. The company is also committing to publishing a new roadmap each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kfbKHX"&gt;The studio also committed to improving working conditions for its employees. “CD Projekt will remain an inclusive and diverse workplace; however, we also want to emphasize the well-being of our employees and provide them with professional and personal development opportunities,” studio head Adam Badowski said in a statement. CD Projekt Red did not provide further specifics about what changes will be made. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amnesia: Rebirth has a new ‘Adventure Mode’ with no monsters, new puzzles, and more lights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amnesia: The Dark Descent cave" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iHpsTCko9Q7jk5L1Ql3VPIGbOGY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049319/Rift.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Frictional Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xwQM7l"&gt;If you like puzzles and eerie deserts, but not darkness and horrifying ghouls, Swedish studio Frictional has a new version of its game &lt;em&gt;Amnesia: Rebirth&lt;/em&gt; for you. A less stressful “Adventure Mode” is being added to &lt;em&gt;Rebirth&lt;/em&gt; today via GOG, Steam, and the Epic Store. The game’s PlayStation version will get Adventure Mode in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYcWZL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amnesia: Rebirth, &lt;/em&gt;released last year, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21519899/amnesia-rebirth-frictional-games-pc-ps4-horror-review"&gt;a strong sequel&lt;/a&gt; to the notoriously scary &lt;em&gt;Amnesia: The Dark Descent&lt;/em&gt;. Adventure Mode removes encounters with &lt;em&gt;Rebirth&lt;/em&gt;’s numerous monsters, as well as special effects that damaged its protagonist Tasi’s mental state. It also adds light to the game’s spookier levels, so players won’t have to ration matches or face the darkness. And Frictional says it’s adding bonus puzzles to Adventure Mode, so while you might spend less time sneaking and hiding, you’ll theoretically have more classic adventure game mechanics to make up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amnesia: Rebirth Adventure mode comparison shot, showing added light to a dark level" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n1F1lqTA98XvCMDWA9ZgFK5gPoU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408212/OriginalAdventure_Vertical.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Frictional Games&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dCTYFA"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Amnesia: Rebirth&lt;/em&gt; creative lead Fredrik Olsson describes it, “the game still has its very serious theme and sometimes unnerving ambience, but the new mode feels a lot more like an &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt; type of adventure in places where it would otherwise be more of a horror experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ryydd3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Frictional added a similar “safe mode” for ‘Soma’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s3tMLf"&gt;Adventure Mode is comparable to &lt;a href="https://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2017/11/what-is-somas-safe-mode.html"&gt;the Safe Mode that Frictional added&lt;/a&gt; to its 2015 horror game &lt;em&gt;Soma&lt;/em&gt;. But Safe Mode was a relatively simple mod that stopped monsters from attacking players, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/somas-new-safe-mode-takes-the-survival-out-of-survival-horror/"&gt;broadening the appeal&lt;/a&gt; of a world where failure could be seriously frustrating. Games like &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/hades-guide/21456205/god-mode-difficulty-easy-damage-reduction"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/43kadm/celeste-assist-mode-change-and-accessibility"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have adopted similar systems, giving a boost to players who want to enjoy the standard game at a lower difficulty level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZWkUd"&gt;Adventure Mode sounds like a broader aesthetic change to a game that already helped players progress if they “died,” albeit at a subtle narrative cost. It’s aimed at making the overall atmosphere more approachable, or as Frictional puts it, removing “anxiety-inducing and very distressing elements present in the original game.” It sounds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/20/17033024/assassins-creed-origins-discovery-tour-educational-mode-release"&gt;a little more like&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Origins&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;educational mode, which swapped combat for a museum-style tour — although Frictional is still keeping players focused on &lt;em&gt;Rebirth’s&lt;/em&gt; original narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLaPm2"&gt;Frictional expressed ambivalence about giving &lt;em&gt;Rebirth&lt;/em&gt; a “safe mode” before launch, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/884kzb/why-the-developers-of-amnesia-waited-10-years-to-make-a-sequel"&gt;telling &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that removing monsters “wouldn’t make story-wise sense.” Adventure Mode may get around that issue by tweaking the game’s entire world — not just the parts that can kill you.&lt;/p&gt;
