    <title>Apple will use Tesla’s ‘megapack’ batteries at its California solar farm </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IK7GvX"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F03%2Fapple-powers-ahead-in-new-renewable-energy-solutions-with-over-110-suppliers%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360839%2Fapple-tesla-megapack-energy-storage-grid-solar-batteries" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced Wednesday that it’s building a big battery storage project&lt;/a&gt; at a Northern California solar farm it spearhead in 2015. But what the company didn’t share is that the battery packs will come from Tesla, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ym0hqc"&gt;The newly-announced setup, which will store up to 240 megawatt-hours of energy, was approved by the Monterey County Board of Supervisors in 2020, according to &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22412130/Attachment_C___Applicant_s_Narrative_of_Project.pdf"&gt;documents&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22412167/Item_No__4_.pdf"&gt;submitted&lt;/a&gt; last &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22412129/Item_No__3_.pdf"&gt;year&lt;/a&gt;. It will consist of 85 Tesla lithium-ion “megapacks” and be used to help power the company’s corporate headquarters in Cupertino. Monterey County’s planning chief confirmed that Apple will use the Tesla batteries in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Apple declined to comment. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kbMZB"&gt;Tesla first announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/29/20746170/tesla-megapack-battery-pge-storage-announced"&gt;the megapack battery system back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The 60MW storage setup Apple will be using is not Tesla’s biggest, though. The company has built bigger overall battery &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18715585/tesla-australia-renewable-energy-houses-electrical-grid-battery-installation"&gt;storage solutions in Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-03-08/tesla-is-plugging-a-secret-mega-battery-into-the-texas-grid"&gt;south of Houston, Texas&lt;/a&gt; of around 100MW in size. Still, Apple touted it as “one of the largest battery projects in the country” in a press release, saying the battery system could power more than 7,000 homes for a whole day. The Tesla batteries will make it possible for Apple to store energy generated by its 130-megawatt solar array at the farm, which is called &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/2/10/11558876/apple-to-build-848-million-solar-farm"&gt;California Flats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qFN9Id"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The project was quietly approved last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nPgoN5"&gt;“The challenge with clean energy — solar and wind — is that it’s by definition intermittent,” Apple VP Lisa Jackson &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-environment-idUSKBN2BN206"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. “If we can do it, and we can show that it works for us, it takes away the concerns about intermittency and it helps the grid in terms of stabilization. It’s something that can be imitated or built upon by other companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfKT0C"&gt;While Apple uses lithium-ion batteries in many of its products, it’s not known to be working on any grid-scale projects. The company is &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-autos-exclusive/exclusive-apple-targets-car-production-by-2024-and-eyes-next-level-battery-technology-sources-idUSKBN28V2PY"&gt;reportedly developing a lithium iron phosphate battery for its electric car project&lt;/a&gt;, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kl9B7F"&gt;Apple and Tesla don’t have much overlapping history, though each company is notorious for poaching talent from the other. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also said in December that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195959/elon-musk-tesla-tim-cook-apple-sale-meeting-acquisition-refused"&gt;he tried to pitch the idea of Apple buying his company back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, but that Apple CEO Tim Cook “refused” to take the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1s3G2X"&gt;Tesla is best known for its electric cars, but it’s spent years trying to build up an energy storage business to compliment the solar products it acquired when it bought Solar City. It has gotten increasingly involved in large-scale energy storage projects like Apple’s over the years in addition to its home battery business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHVpjw"&gt;While it’s still modest compared to the billions of dollars generated by Tesla’s car business, the energy storage division’s products has already netted at least one other strange bedfellow customer: in 2019, Volkswagen announced it was using Tesla batteries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/4/18210439/volkswagen-tesla-battery-packs-ev-charging-station"&gt;at some of its Electrify America charging stations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Alexa lets you control a Lamborghini’s air conditioning with just your voice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_0-3UJiPYadaVP1N_89H-L8_PjA=/41x0:3800x2506/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69057759/Lamborghini_Car_Picture.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lamborghini&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SQ6lbQ"&gt;Amazon is taking a bigger step into cars today by &lt;a href="https://media.lamborghini.com/english/latest-news/all/new-suite-of-connected-services-for-the-lamborghini-hurac-n-evo-range---automobili-lamborghini-is-fi/s/0a54b05c-9ce1-453e-8cc8-be5c2d4ec69b"&gt;integrating Alexa into Lamborghini’s Huracán EVO&lt;/a&gt;, and not just to ask questions or remotely control your home — it’s giving the assistant the ability to control settings inside the car, hands-free. The partnership was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21048587/lamborghini-rivian-amazon-alexa-integration-cars-ces-2020"&gt;originally announced last year&lt;/a&gt; as part of Amazon’s push into cars, but the integration goes beyond Alexa’s usual bag of tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="efbK88"&gt;Alexa’s integration allows users to control “climate and comfort settings including air conditioning, heater, fan speed, temperature, seat heaters, defroster and air flow direction, as well as lighting,” Lamborghini says. (It can also pull up a screen showing you the car’s torque vectoring and traction control.) Of course, Alexa also has its own suite of skills for interacting with your smart home appliances, playing music and podcasts, and basic navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p4SkndFRlxvpW7WtZz7feC71cI8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410789/Alexa_Icon_Headunit.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lamborghini&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If Alexa-integration means less time looking at the Huracán EVO’s center console, I think that’s a win for everyone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H02ibp"&gt;The Huracán EVO has some physical controls on the steering wheel and driver side door, but a majority of the car’s features are adjusted through a screen in the center console. Giving Alexa more control over the actual car itself means less time hunting and pecking through menus — “Alexa, I am hot” is apparently enough to get air conditioning going —  and more time with eyes actually on the road, which could be a win for safety and convenience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="32LI2q"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C_RjYCd_Rbw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vUPmxk"&gt;It’s not like Alexa will be &lt;em&gt;driving&lt;/em&gt; your car, but give it time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSKk8G"&gt;The automotive industry’s switch from controls like knobs and dials to entirely touchscreen-based displays has been ongoing, and we even ran a review series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/screendrive-car-review"&gt;examining in-car displays as gadgets&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago. Amazon’s tried to help smooth the transition with the Alexa-enabled Echo Auto in the past, but we found the accessory worked best as a simple speakerphone and Bluetooth adapter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20754404/amazon-echo-auto-review-alexa-car-price-specs-features"&gt;in our review&lt;/a&gt; — tasks that required knowledge of location or a consistent cellular connection did poorly. The Huracán EVO’s implementation of Alexa, with all the benefits of actually having real control over a connected car, might be a better version of the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="366b7Q"&gt;Amazon and Lamborghini isn’t the only automaker / tech company team-up tackling the problem of built-in car software. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;Volvo’s Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt; launched in 2020 with Android Automotive built-in and Google Assistant integration for similar control over settings like air conditioning, something that wasn’t part of the old Android Auto. We liked the Polestar’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537200/google-android-auto-volvo-polestar-2-hands-on-demo-io-2019"&gt;Google-built software&lt;/a&gt;, though much like Lamborghini, it comes with a high price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtDCi8"&gt;New Huracán EVOs should have the feature from the jump, but Lamborghini says all existing Huracán EVO customers can be retrofitted with support for Alexa, free-of-charge.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter now lets you add stickers to Fleets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u_IVEvgAr1baU7UUnbGCn82UiGk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69057753/Screen_Shot_2021_03_31_at_4.46.09_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yjTLCq"&gt;Twitter is adding stickers to its ephemeral, Snapchat Stories-like Fleets, the social media company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1377387235952181251"&gt;announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. Stickers are available for users on both Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ep3v6w"&gt;When you’re making a Fleet, you’ll be able to add stickers by tapping the smiley face icon on the bottom row of your screen. When you do, you’ll see a collection of Twitter-made animated stickers and emoji (the latter of which Twitter calls “Twemoji”). And if you search for something in the search bar at the top of the screen, Twitter will pull up GIFs sourced from Tenor and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/15/21259965/facebook-giphy-gif-acquisition-buy-instagram-integration-cost"&gt;Facebook-owned Giphy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fjgQvo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Your Fleets just got an upgrade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now you can express yourself in the conversation with stickers. Add GIFs and Twemojis to a Fleet by tapping the   icon, on Android and iOS. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ihh9ZZh70a"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ihh9ZZh70a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1377387235952181251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iVxCKM"&gt;If you’ve ever used stickers on Snapchat or Instagram, this new feature should feel quite familiar to you. That said, the feature might feel so familiar because both Snapchat and Instagram have offered it for years. But Twitter is still in early days with Fleets, which only became available to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570368/twitter-fleets-disapeating-tweets-stories-launch-available-now"&gt;everyone back in November&lt;/a&gt;, so perhaps stickers are just a first sign of more additions to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LzhXB1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter’s disappearing tweets, called Fleets, are now available for everyone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570368/twitter-fleets-disapeating-tweets-stories-launch-available-now"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Ubiquiti is accused of covering up a ‘catastrophic’ data breach — and it’s not denying it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-nIdL5HMV_AF2MKywigY6S8kIvw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69057731/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P6uFed"&gt;Ubiquiti, a company whose prosumer-grade routers have become synonymous with security and manageability, is being accused of covering up a “catastrophic” security breach — and after 24 hours of silence, the company has now issued a statement that doesn’t deny any of the whistleblower’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSMSAB"&gt;Originally, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22226061/ubiquiti-data-breach-email-third-party-unathorized-access"&gt;Ubiquiti emailed its customers about a supposedly minor security breach&lt;/a&gt; at a “third party cloud provider” on January 11th, but noted cybersecurity news site &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/"&gt;KrebsOnSecurity is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that the breach was actually far worse than Ubiquiti let on. A whistleblower from the company who spoke to Krebs claimed that Ubiquiti itself was breached, and that the company’s legal team prevented efforts to accurately report the dangers to customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEnozW"&gt;It’s worth &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/"&gt;reading Krebs’ report&lt;/a&gt; to see the full allegations, but the summary is that hackers got full access to the company’s AWS servers — since Ubiquiti allegedly left root administrator logins in an LastPass account — and they could have been able to access any Ubiquiti networking gear that customers had set up to control via the company’s cloud service (now &lt;a href="https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056846954-UniFi-Set-up-a-UniFi-Dream-Machine"&gt;seemingly required&lt;/a&gt; on some of the company’s new hardware). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIPLOc"&gt;“They were able to get cryptographic secrets for single sign-on cookies and remote access, full source code control contents, and signing keys exfiltration,” the source told Krebs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvUvya"&gt;When Ubiquiti &lt;a href="https://community.ui.com/questions/Update-to-January-2021-Account-Notification/3813e6f4-b023-4d62-9e10-1035dc51ad2e"&gt;finally issued a statement this evening&lt;/a&gt;, it wasn’t a reassuring one — it’s wildly insufficient. The company reiterated its point that it had no evidence to indicate that any user data had been accessed or stolen. But &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/1377394042342756355"&gt;as Krebs points out&lt;/a&gt;, the whistleblower explicitly stated that the company doesn’t keep logs, which would act as that evidence, on who did or didn’t access the hacked servers. Ubiquiti’s statement also confirms that the hacker did try to extort it for money, but doesn’t address the allegations of a cover up. You can read the full statement below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Xhn2mt"&gt;As we informed you on January 11, we were the victim of a cybersecurity incident that involved unauthorized access to our IT systems. Given the reporting by Brian Krebs, there is newfound interest and attention in this matter, and we would like to provide our community with more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzzITH"&gt;At the outset, please note that nothing has changed with respect to our analysis of customer data and the security of our products since our notification on January 11. In response to this incident, we leveraged external incident response experts to conduct a thorough investigation to ensure the attacker was locked out of our systems.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chR2aI"&gt;These experts identified no evidence that customer information was accessed, or even targeted. The attacker, who unsuccessfully attempted to extort the company by threatening to release stolen source code and specific IT credentials, never claimed to have accessed any customer information. This, along with other evidence, is why we believe that customer data was not the target of, or otherwise accessed in connection with, the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6KYVH1"&gt;At this point, we have well-developed evidence that the perpetrator is an individual with intricate knowledge of our cloud infrastructure. As we are cooperating with law enforcement in an ongoing investigation, we cannot comment further.&lt;br&gt;All this said, as a precaution, we still encourage you to change your password if you have not already done so, including on any website where you use the same user ID or password. We also encourage you to enable two-factor authentication on your Ubiquiti accounts if you have not already done so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bp88MX"&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Team UI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLAItg"&gt;The other thing you’ll notice is that Ubiquiti is no longer pinning this on a “third party cloud provider.” The company admits that its own IT systems were accessed. But it doesn’t address much else, and the fact that the statement confirms some of what the whistleblower said while leaving the most worrying parts (e.g., the alleged cover-up, lack of logs, poor security practices, etc.) unaddressed makes me uncomfortable to be a Ubiquiti owner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRNsVI"&gt;The company’s networking gear is (or was) trusted by many techies, myself included, because it promised full control over your home or small business network, without the fears of cloud-based solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSbvE0"&gt;Throughout this process, Ubiquiti has failed to communicate properly with its customers. The fact that it’s not denying the allegations, and indicates that they could be true, suggests that the original email was, at the very least, an insufficient warning. It encouraged users to change their passwords — according to Krebs, a more appropriate response would be immediately locking all accounts and requiring a password reset. Even today, the company is simply encouraging users to change their passwords and enable two-factor authentication. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Analogue’s Pocket is the latest gadget delayed due to the ongoing global electronic components shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XHMvq2AZJa-M5r17zVTYjB058iA=/577x0:6721x4096/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69057411/3_Analogue_Pocket_All_Angles.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pDTROE"&gt;Analogue’s Pocket is the latest gadget to be negatively impacted by the global shortage of chips and electronic components. The sleek and modern device that allows you to play Game Boy cartridges will now launch in October, an additional five-month delay, the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1377375231296200704?s=20"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tjTqy"&gt;“The current global state of affairs continues to create supply chain challenges outside of our control,” Analogue said in a &lt;a href="https://support.analogue.co/hc/en-us/articles/360058718452"&gt;blog post today&lt;/a&gt;. “There have been sudden and severe electrical component shortages as well as logistical issues leading to a domino effect of challenges for nearly everyone in the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wTqdik"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Super Nt will be restocked in April. Mega Sg and DAC shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;— Analogue (@analogue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1377375464042323971?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ePA5LY"&gt;This is not the first time Analogue had to delay the Pocket. last July, the company announced it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21337403/analogue-pocket-release-date-delay-pre-order"&gt;would not hit its 2020 release window&lt;/a&gt; and pushed back the release date to May 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6rKxd"&gt;Analgoue is among many companies affected by the component shortages, which have slowed down the production of many electronics, ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358256/apple-supplier-foxconn-parts-shortages-chips-2022"&gt;smartphones&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-09/toyota-says-chip-shortage-impacting-output-of-texas-made-trucks"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt;, while also making it near-impossible to buy next-gen gaming hardware, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;including desktop graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297039/playstation-ceo-ps5-supply-2021-stock-consoles-jim-ryan"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260564/microsoft-xbox-series-x-stock-june-supply-constraints"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Errors ruin 15 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SFChronicleVirusVaccine" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrGWGKOzLaORmM32yFP12wSMx-s=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69057352/1309676838.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S6yXTn"&gt;An ingredient mix-up at a Baltimore manufacturing plant ruined 15 million doses of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/world/johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-mixup.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. That could delay future shipments of this vaccine in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HgaOnS"&gt;There are not any problems with the doses of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine that have already been delivered — those were produced in the Netherlands, the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;reported. But the tens of millions of the shots set to ship in April were supposed to come from this Baltimore plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jb6zZD"&gt;The manufacturing plant, run by Emergent BioSolutions, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/03/02/merck-johnson-and-johnson-covid-vaccine-partnership/"&gt;received $628 million from the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; last year to expand its vaccine manufacturing capacity. The plant was still awaiting Food and Drug Administration authorization of its Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine production lines, and this enormous mistake — which &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;sources attributed to human error — will likely delay that further. It’s not clear how this setback will affect the availability of this vaccine over the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqR4re"&gt;Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech are still on track to meet their vaccine commitments in the United States, which should give the country enough doses to meet the Biden administration’s target of having shots available for every adult &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/us/politics/merck-johnson-johnson-vaccine.html"&gt;by the end of May.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="394Sxc"&gt;But limited availability of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine could still hurt US efforts to vaccinate enough people for herd immunity. People who are reluctant to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrewAltman/status/1376921970072154112"&gt;say they’ll “wait and see”&lt;/a&gt; are more likely to agree to take the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine than the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna shots. The Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine only takes one dose, and is made using a more familiar technique. Only having the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna shots on offer could make it harder to convince some people to get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJCWRT"&gt;Around 30 percent of the US population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine so far. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Malware hidden in Call of Duty cheat software proves that cheaters never prosper  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ZZVrHVEgEZQe9NlNBMKBus4ymU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69057233/AGB_WZ_0309_Vehicles.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m5tKRx"&gt;Hackers have been hiding malware in cheating software for &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; and have been trying to spread it to “cheating cheaters,” as a report from Activision calls them (&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxwva/activision-reveals-malware-disguised-as-call-of-duty-warzone-cheats"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwEGGB"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://research.activision.com/publications/2021/03/cheating-cheaters-malware-delivered-as-call-of-duty-cheats"&gt;read the full report here&lt;/a&gt;, but it explains that there’s been a campaign by hackers to try to get &lt;em&gt;Warzone &lt;/em&gt;players to download a fake cheating engine. After players run it, the malware can then go on to infect the computer with whatever payload is chosen by the hacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1F6sOo"&gt;In short: cheaters never prosper. If the malware doesn’t get you, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9m5a/call-of-duty-warzone-bans-more-than-60000-cheaters"&gt;you’ll likely just get banned from the game instead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDfRw3"&gt;Players downloading cheats to help them pwn and then getting pwned themselves is nothing new. I’ll admit it: I wasted my childhood by being a serial cheater, sneaking peeks at my sister’s &lt;em&gt;Battleship&lt;/em&gt; board or slipping myself a couple extra $100s when acting as the banker in Monopoly. And when playing video games, I cheated, too. Never online (I had dial-up in the age of &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare 2&lt;/em&gt;), but I certainly downloaded my fair share of patches and mods to try to make games easier or to get better loot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSkQKS"&gt;There were absolutely times I paid for it, knocking the family computer out of commission with a nasty virus and having to spend the rest of the day fixing the computer before my mom came home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJqPh3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; isn’t alone in having hack-infested hacks: players downloading cheats for &lt;a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/valorant-fake-beta-keys-riot-games/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2018/10/fortnite-gamers-targeted-by-data-theft-malware/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/minecraft-mods-adware-kaspersky/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/13291-roblox-virus#:~:text=The%20Roblox%20virus%20is%20trojan,end%20up%20infecting%20their%20computers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have all gotten nasty surprises. It seems today’s gamers are learning the same lesson I did: if you’re cheating at the game, you’re really only cheating yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NBCUniversal might save its movies for Peacock instead of Netflix or HBO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k62B4KgcY0QA5VR4utqgt_trUeg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69057151/acastro_200714_1777_peacock_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bxt7ez"&gt;NBCUniversal is mulling whether to remove its films from HBO Max and Netflix and put new movies on its own streaming service, Peacock, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-31/comcast-weighs-pulling-universal-s-movies-from-hbo-max-netflix"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YukpxO"&gt;Right now, HBO Max has a deal to show Universal Pictures movies about nine months after their theatrical run, and Netflix has a similar one to let it show movies from Illumination Entertainment, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Both of those deals will currently expire at the end of the year, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83hzWL"&gt;However, Comcast-owned NBCUniversal reportedly hasn’t made a decision about if it should pull the movies just yet. Execs are also “open” to making new licensing deals with companies, which could mean the films stay where they are or end up somewhere else that’s not Peacock, HBO Max, or Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h.p_3foLUVsbzFq7"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGpDPg"&gt;The fact that NBCUniversal is even considering the move adds to an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21429223/fx-john-landgraf-hulu-disney-plus-hbo-max-peacock-streaming-window-brands"&gt;already extremely confusing streaming landscape&lt;/a&gt;, where it’s often a crapshoot if you’ll find a movie on the streaming service you’d expect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhY352"&gt;On the one hand, NBCUniversal bringing its own movies (which include huge franchises like &lt;em&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;How to Train Your Dragon&lt;/em&gt;) to its streaming service would lead to a certain amount of corporate synergy and would boost the value of Peacock to retain or attract new subscribers. On the other, licensing deals are lucrative, and the company has to weigh that revenue against what it might make from Peacock in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzKrXj"&gt;NBCUniversal has shown some willingness to silo popular content to Peacock. It moved &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, one of the most-watched shows on any streaming service, from Netflix to Peacock &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216867/peacock-office-subscription-streaming-ad-free-premium-plus-netflix"&gt;at the beginning of this year&lt;/a&gt;. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297077/the-office-friends-peacock-hbo-max-streaming-wars-disney-plus-star"&gt;not clear how successful that strategy has been&lt;/a&gt;, however, and based on today’s &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report, we still don’t know if NBCUniversal is willing to make a similar move for some of its biggest film franchises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFmwW0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVMuHf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is buying two Knives Out sequels to make its next big franchise</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/faA1ulwCmS8azbY1QhFSz2PzuWw=/0x0:1600x1067/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69057149/woods.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lionsgate&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m0UbhW"&gt;Netflix has acquired the rights to two &lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt; sequels, with Rian Johnson returning to direct the next whodunits and Daniel Craig reprising his starring role as Detective Benoit Blanc, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/netflix-buys-knives-out-sequels-450-million-1234941995/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; says the deal is worth $450 million, and &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/knives-out-two-sequels-netflix-400-million-plus-deal-daniel-craig-rian-johnson-ram-bergman-1234724575/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the deal would be “worth north of $400 million.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgUOJ1"&gt;The original &lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt; was a huge hit, earning $311.4 million at the box office on its $40 million budget. As Netflix looks to compete with other streaming services like Disney Plus, Amazon’s Prime Video, WarnerMedia’s HBO Max, and others, adding another franchise to its roster of IP could help Netflix keep subscribers over the long term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLnwRM"&gt;Plot details about the &lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt; sequels haven’t been revealed, and we don’t know if other actors from the first movie will be returning for the follow-ups. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood is removing its confetti celebrations ahead of its IPO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gNX-z15w76hcbOw1IrmFs34ZKRk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69057053/acastro_210129_1777_robinhood_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrations by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HSEB4h"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/3/31/a-new-way-to-celebrate-with-robinhood"&gt;Robinhood is cutting out the confetti&lt;/a&gt; from its stock trading app, following accusations that the animation helped to “gamify” investing. Instead, the company is adding new animations that will celebrate trading milestones for users in a more somber manner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pf00Aw"&gt;The celebratory digital confetti showers have been a controversial part of Robinhood’s app since 2016. In the past, Robinhood has argued that the friendly features “help investing fit easily into people’s lives.” But others — &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/massachusetts-regulators-to-file-complaint-against-robinhood-11608120003?mod=article_inline"&gt;including the Massachusetts Securities Division&lt;/a&gt; — have argued that the confetti (along with other features, like free stock promotions) help to “gamify” stock trading for amateur investors who may not understand what they’re getting into. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gplb596RVrzSv5gKKrl7D4DDKdc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411259/im_318241.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Robinhood&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The less confetti-filled milestone animation in Robinhood’s app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QejhyJ"&gt;“The confetti is getting really misconstrued, and I think it’s actually doing the opposite of what we want,” Madhu Muthukumar, senior director of product management at Robinhood, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-to-remove-controversial-digital-confetti-from-trading-app-11617195612?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;commented to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It “seems to have distracted from the goal of the app, which is to make regular people, everyday folks who have been kept out of the market, feel like they can participate and feel like they are being positively reinforced for taking steps in their financial life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bvkOi"&gt;Of course, Robinhood is still recovering from its involvement in the recent wave of “meme stocks,” which saw the company come under fire from users who were frustrated when it started restricting trades of popular stocks like GameStop and AMC when Reddit users from the r/WallStreetBets subreddit were frantically trading them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmgXGS"&gt;But Robinhood is planning to go public, with the &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/robinhood-reportedly-filed-confidentially-for-ipo-5118086"&gt;company already confidentially filing for a forthcoming IPO&lt;/a&gt;. Cleaning out any controversial aspects of the app — even ones as seemingly innocuous as confetti celebrations — is a logical move to appease future investors.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ieGdP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
