    <title>We want to see your internet bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OOFEWsVJrdkLKqootfNKmReCweU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69574700/acastro_170711_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="62mluZ"&gt;You don’t always get what you pay for in internet access. Most places only have one option, so you’re stuck picking the good plan or the bad plan from a single carrier, and if the expensive “broadband” plan turns out to be closer to dial-up speeds, there isn’t much you can do. And that’s without getting into the big swaths of the country that don’t even have a broadband option on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEklvk"&gt;So we’re joining with &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; to take a close look at the problem, collecting as many internet bills as we can to get a sense of which telecoms are holding up their end of the bargain — and which ones are falling short. The idea is to get a bird’s-eye view of the speeds people are actually getting, and what they’re paying for those speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIG77B"&gt;To get there, &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/upload/broadband/?EXTKEY=BBA17EET1F"&gt;we want to take a look at your internet bill&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; has put together a site to collect your information and do a quick speed test. The whole thing should take about seven minutes, and you’ll be doing your part to build a better internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqnNBK"&gt;A few quick notes on privacy: your bill will be encrypted as soon as you update it, and &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; has pledged to only record relevant data such as price, bundle, speed, and hidden fees, and they’ll delete bills when they’re no longer needed. The site will ask you to create a login as a way to keep the information private and safe, but you won’t have to pay for anything and no personally identifiable information will be shared with outside researchers. You can get more answers about the specifics &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/member-support/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGUVIC"&gt;We’re hoping this project will give us tens of thousands of bills to pore through, and spur on some great investigations for later on in the year. So &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/upload/broadband/?EXTKEY=BBA17EET1F"&gt;head over to the site and show us your bill&lt;/a&gt; — and in a few months, we’ll tell you what we found.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube’s TikTok competitor YouTube Shorts is rolling out globally</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/juIwLzvirtAuXeatna55CVymfTk=/0x0:3300x2200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69574531/Home.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8407lx"&gt;YouTube’s TikTok competitor, YouTube Shorts, is now rolling out globally. The service launched first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436158/youtube-starts-tiktok-competitor-short-form-video-instagram-reels-beta-test"&gt;in India last year&lt;/a&gt;, before expanding to around 26 countries including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334540/youtube-shorts-us-beta-tiktok-competition-launch"&gt;the US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22518828/youtube-shorts-audio-sample-feature-uk-launch"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt;. Now YouTube Shorts, which is still in beta, will be available “across more than 100 countries around the world where YouTube is available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x07o4W"&gt;YouTube Shorts is playing catchup to TikTok as the short-form video platform of choice, but Google’s service is pushing Shorts’ integration with the wider YouTube ecosystem as a key selling point. It recently added the ability for Shorts creators to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22518828/youtube-shorts-audio-sample-feature-uk-launch"&gt;sample audio from YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt;, and says it’s exploring ways to offer quick links from Shorts to YouTube videos they’ve taken samples from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnfBI6"&gt;Ironically, while YouTube is going to great lengths to emulate TikTok’s format, TikTok is experimenting with formats that are closer to YouTube’s traditional focus. It recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558856/tiktok-videos-three-minutes-length"&gt;tripled its maximum video length&lt;/a&gt; to three minutes for everyone, and has been slowly rolling out apps on TV platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264642/tiktok-android-tv-launch-not-working-google"&gt;Android TV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573707/tiktok-fire-tv-app-uk-france-germany-smart-tv"&gt;Fire TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PC market growth slows amid global chip shortages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GUniDEa74RZMelqP27eR9oyHxEU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69574512/akrales_190930_3689_0056.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZeTBGP"&gt;The PC market is showing early signs of its growth slowing down, after an impressive run of shipments throughout 2020. Both &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48069721"&gt;IDC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-07-12-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-grew-4-point-six-in-second-quarter-of-2021"&gt;Gartner&lt;/a&gt; conclude that growth in the second quarter of PC shipments has slowed this year. Demand for new PCs is still above what we saw before the pandemic hit, but a mixture of softer demand and the effects of the global chip shortage mean it’s not growing as quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPJ0PG"&gt;“The market faces mixed signals as far as demand is concerned,” says Neha Mahajan, a senior research analyst at IDC. “With businesses opening back up, demand potential in the commercial segment appears promising. However, there are also early indicators of consumer demand slowing down as people shift spending priorities after nearly a year of aggressive PC buying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xsfmfd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The market faces mixed signals as far as demand is concerned”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1hvCRw"&gt;IDC says more than 83 million PCs were shipped in the second quarter of 2021, while Gartner’s own figure is more than 71 million. Gartner does not include Chromebook shipments in its results, but the research firm says “Chromebook shipments were once again strong in the second quarter of 2021.” Either way, both firms agree that year-over-year growth in this latest quarter wasn’t as strong as 2020’s sudden growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49cZN5"&gt;That doesn’t mean PC sales are about to suddenly plummet, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;first big growth we saw in a decade&lt;/a&gt; could be starting to wane. Lenovo is still the top PC manufacturer worldwide, and Gartner says Apple, Acer, and Asus all grew faster than the overall market thanks to better availability of consumer PCs. “The consumer PC market was less impacted by shortages than the enterprise market, as vendors can be more flexible in the system design of consumer models, enabling workarounds for certain supply constraints,” says Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVCSsc"&gt;While there are clearly early signs of slowing growth in the PC market, Microsoft and its OEM partners will be hoping to revitalize PCs even further later this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553666/microsoft-windows-11-october-20th-release-date-hint-rumor"&gt;Windows 11 will likely arrive in October&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft’s minimum &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555371/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-hardware-requirements-tpm-response"&gt;hardware requirements&lt;/a&gt; mean many will need to upgrade PCs. A new version of Windows always comes with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/15/9544645/microsoft-intel-dell-lenovo-hp-pc-does-what"&gt;big marketing campaigns&lt;/a&gt;, and Windows 11 will be no different. With Apple’s impressive M1 MacBooks and Intel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335654/intel-mac-guy-new-ads-commercials-pc"&gt;reviving the Mac vs. PC ads&lt;/a&gt;, this year is bound to be an interesting period for the PC market.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter admits it verified several fake accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zs5WZ_F5pDJbniXyHjh6ZpG-nhk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69574450/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ydNthB"&gt;Twitter says it has permanently suspended a “small number” of fake accounts it mistakenly verified just weeks after re-launching its public verification program, the &lt;a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/twitter-verified-bot-accounts/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Dot&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The blunder came to light after data scientist Conspirador Norteño &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/1414475519609999366"&gt;discovered six verified accounts&lt;/a&gt; which had been created recently on June 16th. None of them had posted a single tweet, and two used what appeared to be stock photographs for profile pictures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3XAES"&gt;“We mistakenly approved the verification applications of a small number of inauthentic (fake) accounts,” Twitter told the &lt;em&gt;Daily Dot&lt;/em&gt; in a statement. “We have now permanently suspended the accounts in question, and removed their verified badge, under our platform manipulation and spam policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QoxCA6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Meet &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aykacmis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@aykacmis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/degismece?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@degismece&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anlamislar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@anlamislar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aykacti?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@aykacti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayitlii?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@kayitlii&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/donmedim?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@donmedim&lt;/a&gt;, a sextet of blue-check verified Twitter accounts created on June 16th, 2021. None has yet tweeted and all have roughly 1000 followers (and mostly the *same* followers). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;cc: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZellaQuixote?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ZellaQuixote&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/V82Wtu0SNr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/V82Wtu0SNr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Conspirador Norteño (@conspirator0) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/1414475519609999366?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rRztrJ"&gt;The incident suggests that Twitter’s verification process is having problems, and not catching the kinds of obviously inauthentic accounts that shouldn’t be worthy of the platform’s coveted blue badge. Twitter recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22435770/twitter-public-verification-program-launch-2021-pronouns-profile"&gt;relaunched public verification applications&lt;/a&gt; with a revamped set of eligibility criteria based around the idea that an account should be “&lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts"&gt;authentic, notable, and active&lt;/a&gt;” to be worthy of verification. Clearly, the accounts identified were none of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpG38y"&gt;As Norteño explains in a Twitter thread, the six accounts had 976 suspicious followers in common — all created between June 19th and June 20th — and large numbers of these were using AI-generated profile pictures. In total, Norteño says they were part of a botnet consisting of at least 1212 accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rOd7BW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;These 976 accounts are part of an astroturf botnet consisting of (at least) 1212 accounts. The network is split into followers, which follow the aforementioned verified accounts as well as other members of the botnet, and followees, which are followed by the other bots. &lt;a href="https://t.co/wKKfC2PRX8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wKKfC2PRX8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Conspirador Norteño (@conspirator0) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/1414475941980655617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MPWD3G"&gt;As of this writing, Twitter has suspended five out of the six verified accounts, while the sixth appears to have deactivated its own profile. The “majority” of the supporting botnet has also been taken down, Norteño says. But the incident raises questions about how the accounts were able to get verified in the first place, and why Twitter’s processes didn’t flag them before they were discovered by a third-party researcher.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Super Mario and Tag Heuer collaboration is a $2,150 Wear OS watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h5kHh__OEI1AW31aWI-hMiWW2Vs=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69574420/tagmario.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1VjkiC"&gt;A few days ago, Tag Heuer posted a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570322/tag-heuer-nintendo-super-mario-watch-tease-collaboration"&gt;teaser for a Super Mario-themed watch&lt;/a&gt;. You might have assumed that a Swiss-made mechanical timepiece was in the works, but now the news is out: it’s actually a limited edition version of Tag’s Connected Wear OS smartwatch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NduSUi"&gt;Tag Heuer seemingly hasn’t released details itself yet — its &lt;a href="https://www.tagheuer.com/us/en/announcement/coming-soon.html"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; is still counting down to a July 15th announcement — but &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/its-a-me-mario-smartwatch-by-tag-heuer-connected-060037257.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/this-limited-edition-super-mario-smartwatch-will-run-you-2150/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://en.worldtempus.com/article/watches/trends-and-style/tag-heuer-teams-up-with-pop-culture-icon-super-mario-30306.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WorldTempus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have all posted stories with the device’s key features. The hardware itself appears to be identical beyond some light cosmetic tweaks to the 45mm case, including an M-for-Mario logo on the crown, and it comes with two straps: one with perforated red rubber alongside one with red rubber and black leather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ve1tK8"&gt;The watch is said to use a “gamification rewards system” with greetings from Mario and Mushroom Kingdom-themed animations that play as you hit various steps goals throughout the day. There are four new Mario watch faces, including a “Timekeeping” face that features “retro elements from the 1985 version of Super Mario Bros. with Mario, all in pixels.” (As opposed to the physical steel that other smartwatch faces are cast from, presumably.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tqdI2OJxqATzdHAsqNvZyUOvKEA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714327/tm2.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oaS4Xz"&gt;Tag Heuer says it’s “considering making [these Mario features] available on other editions of TAG Heuer Connected at a later stage.” That may be good news for anyone who bought the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/3/12/21176639/tag-heuer-connected-third-generation-luxury-smartwatch-sensors-design-watch-style"&gt;most recent version&lt;/a&gt;, which started at $1,800 and could cost as much as $2,350. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OPuhF"&gt;The new Mario watch falls toward the high end of the Connected range, coming in at $2,150. It’s also a lot more exclusive — Tag Heuer is only making 2,000 models, which will be available through some of its own boutique stores and its website in certain regions from  July 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7B3nex_Wy7DaA0l1tS7PzDlklJA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714329/tagm3.jpeg"&gt;

    <title>Space Jam: A New Legacy launch includes a 91,000 item NFT tie-in</title>

  &lt;p id="2GpohM"&gt;On the same day we learned that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22570612/lebron-james-fortnite-skin-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;is adding a LeBron James skin to its metaverse&lt;/a&gt;, the PR machine for &lt;em&gt;Space Jam: A New Legacy&lt;/em&gt; cranked out a different batch of digital collectibles. However, instead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365635/space-jam-sequel-new-legacy-first-trailer-1996-website"&gt;directing viewers&lt;/a&gt; to a gloriously aging &lt;a href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996/"&gt;90s-era website&lt;/a&gt;, they had to use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fx4dhO"&gt;Launching July 16th &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Space Jam: A New Legacy&lt;/em&gt; follows Michael Jordan’s 1996 movie by transporting LeBron James into a digital world full of cartoons and other Warner Bros. properties, so the marketing fit makes more sense than it might appear. The difference here is that instead of merely slipping toys into fast food kids’ meals or tossing out limited edition physical cards, there’s a hope that interest in the family-friendly flick will spur the collection of non-fungible tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lHIS5x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What is an NFT, anyhow?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ajS4Le"&gt;The&lt;em&gt; Space Jam&lt;/em&gt; tie-in serves as a launch event for &lt;a href="http://Niftys.com"&gt;Niftys.com&lt;/a&gt;, a marketplace for the tokens that bills itself as “the ultimate destination for creators, collectors, and curators.” Topps, Mark Cuban, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;NBA Top Shot&lt;/a&gt; creator Dapper Labs, and Samsung Next are among its financial backers, and they all hope they own a piece of the next big collecting trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Msp7o4"&gt;The website suffered some outages when it initially launched but is back up and running, &lt;a href="https://niftys.com/events/spacejam"&gt;promising a free NFT to anyone who registers&lt;/a&gt; (you can get one more for sharing a social network post about the event). Your one-of-a-kind digital item is &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/space-jam-new-legacy-nft-lebron-james-1235016220/"&gt;one of 91,000&lt;/a&gt; that have been minted on its blockchain for the event, giving this more of a breakfast cereal prize giveaway vibe than a hunt for a golden ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OyhGi0"&gt;As a child of the ‘80s and ‘90s, I’m a bit too jaded to believe these will be worth more than most of the trading cards, pogs, and beanie babies I remember, but at least they’ll only take up hard drive space instead of clogging landfills. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;the environmental impact of blockchain technology has become controversial&lt;/a&gt;, Niftys claims its implementation uses Palm NFT Studio to reduce energy consumption by 99 percent compared to other methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSTXMR"&gt;At press time, there are still Space Jam NFTs available “while supplies last,” and the &lt;a href="https://niftys.com/events/spacejam"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; lists 57,367 / 91,980 NFTs, although it’s unclear whether that is the number available or already claimed. While snagging an NFT so it can become part of your playlist, viewable as a spinning GIF of one of the movie’s characters, is surely enticing, most people will be in it for the scarcity. Free or purchased (at $2.99 each), the cards each feature one of nine characters and come in five tiers of rarity. There are ten “legendary edition” 3D cards available, and if you’re not lucky enough to own one of them, then at least you can still see the exact same image &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRO71mTJVFw/"&gt;on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ESPN Plus is getting its second price hike of 2021 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disney Plus ESPN Plus Hulu bundle" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pdBrJqiEvkQnOePHxnYYjONej7c=/0x27:1396x958/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69573508/disney_plus.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RiSPvS"&gt;ESPN Plus monthly and annual subscription costs will go up beginning August 13th, the second price increase for the service in 2021. The new price hike has made the service’s annual plan increase by about $20 this year alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgBBD2"&gt;A spokesperson for ESPN Plus confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the service will hike from $6 to $7, while the annual cost will jump from $60 to $70. Notably, there will be no price increase to the Disney bundle, which costs $13 and includes sister services Disney+ and Hulu. There will also be no change in the cost of UFC pay-per-view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13dflw"&gt;Disney Plus and ESPN Plus have both gotten price increases in 2021. The sports streaming service’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22207151/espn-plus-annual-subscription-price-hike-disney-ufc"&gt;annual subscription cost increased&lt;/a&gt; to $60 per year from $50 in January. The company attributed the most recent price increase to increased value to consumers, specifically citing its live sports coverage, original programming, and expanded editorial analysis from industry experts. The service reported having nearly 14 million subscribers as of April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5Hyy8"&gt;Disney’s marquee streaming service, meanwhile, also got a little pricier in 2021. In March, Disney Plus increased to $8 per month or $80 annually, arguably still a fantastic value for the quality of content being produced and certainly accounting for the fact that Disney’s new releases typically arrive on the service at no additional cost a few months after their Premier Access debuts. &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, for example, will be free to stream on the service beginning October 6th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google shares transition plans for unified desktop file syncing Drive app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T0ywiaJyQPHnVKXb4ekdOMBKg_M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69573184/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xxV1mf"&gt;Google announced its plans to transition users of its consumer file syncing desktop service, Backup and Sync, onto &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/drive/drive-for-desktop/"&gt;a new unified app&lt;/a&gt; that both consumers and business clients can use called Drive for desktop. Google plans to start &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/07/google-drive-backup-and-sync-transition.html"&gt;onboarding users next week on July 19th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and encourages people who used Backup and Sync to make the switch by the end of September, before getting locked out on October 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LcKT3"&gt;Backup and Sync users will have to transition to the new app (&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/10309431#zippy=%2Csee-the-full-list-of-features%2Cwhy-are-you-making-this-change%2Ci-use-drive-file-stream-how-will-this-affect-me%2Ci-am-a-workspace-admin-and-my-organization-uses-drive-file-stream-im-concerned-about-these-new-features-what-can-i-do"&gt;a renamed version&lt;/a&gt; of Google’s enterprise file syncing software), but business clients who are already using Drive File Stream (aka Drive for desktop) should be good to go, Google says. The goal with consolidating the apps, Google says, is to create “a powerful and unified sync client” with the best features from both consumer and enterprise services that should be more straightforward to use and easier for IT teams to manage. Notably, it’s also a reversal of Google’s confusing decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/7/16267624/google-drive-desktop-app-shutdown"&gt;split up Google Drive on desktop&lt;/a&gt; into two apps in 2017.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UWxHSx37nP4tZcFbWkoEKDPlIR0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713290/image1_iF7NAcN.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s new Drive for desktop client&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dokMkN"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/drive/drive-for-desktop/"&gt;Google’s blog post&lt;/a&gt; explaining the desktop Drive client, the app should be pretty familiar to anyone who used Google’s previous services. Drive will offer easy access to files and photos stored in the cloud, and sync whatever files you choose in the background so they’re always up to date. Google says the app can sync external storage devices like flash drives to Drive, mirror files between Drive and local files on your desktop computer, and let you choose whether you store individual photos and videos in Drive or Google Photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqPSHb"&gt;Google will begin transitioning users of Backup and Sync next Monday, July 19th. Here’s the following transition timeline for users, from Google:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BqNeD8"&gt;July 19th, 2021: Backup and Sync will support a guided flow to help users transition on to Drive for desktop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BSTf2"&gt;August 18th, 2021: Any users still on Backup and Sync will start to receive in-product notifications prompting them to transition to Drive for desktop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIR1uV"&gt;October 1st, 2021:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Any users still on Backup and Sync after that point will no longer be able to sign in to Backup and Sync. To continue syncing with Drive and/or Google Photos, users will need to transition to Drive for desktop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TZPcJ2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OaYSF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon’s new filter blocks spoofed phone numbers that are too close to yours</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zmeq82VnnfNfhyIc8T3ld_6wExA=/98x0:1133x690/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572851/Call_Filter_Hero_image_0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon rolls out new Neighborhood Filter tool to help curb spoofed calls.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Verizon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PDSTGH"&gt;Verizon wants to help curb those obnoxious “spoofing” calls from similar area codes to your own with a new tool called Neighborhood Filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtWjZ6"&gt;Spoofing is the method used by spammers to make a number appear similar to your own so you’re more likely to answer the call. Verizon’s new Neighborhood Filter will allow Verizon customers to send these calls directly to voicemail, as well as any other prefix and area code combinations that the company thinks might be suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOjJ2x"&gt;The tool is available to Call Filter Free and Call Filter Plus customers through the company’s separate &lt;a href="https://myvpostpay.verizon.com/ui/acct/secure/productApps/downloads/sfo120005"&gt;Call Filter&lt;/a&gt; app. Call Filter Free costs nothing to enroll and offers basic filtering from those dreaded and persistent spam calls. Call Filter Plus, which costs an additional $3 per month per line (or $8 per month for three or more lines), comes with additional tools like access to a database of over 100 million spam numbers, a personal block list, and a spam risk meter for real-time call assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eFCXkL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The tool should help make spam calls a little less painful&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qk1jOD"&gt;To activate the Neighborhood Filter for blocking spoofed calls, head to the Call Filter app on your mobile device. (If you’re on iOS, you’ll need to toggle on filtering from your Call Blocking and Identification in your Phone settings.) From the lower navigation menu on the main screen in the app, select Management. From this menu, select Other Filters. Here, you should see the Neighborhood Filter, which will prompt you to enter a six-digit prefix and area code similar to your number. Make sure to toggle it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwHfDi"&gt;Verizon launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/28/18285643/verizon-spam-calls-robocalls-blocking-identifying-service"&gt;free version&lt;/a&gt; of its call filtering tool in 2019. Prior to that, it charged $3 per month for its call filtering tools, even while those services were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/30/15906800/verizon-anti-spam-robocall-call-blocking-att-t-mobile"&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; through some of its competitors T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWFAlX"&gt;From your Spam Filter settings in the Call Filter app — whether you’re paying for it or not — you’ll be able to determine how you want spam calls to be filtered. Blocked calls can either be terminated or sent to voicemail based on your selection. This menu will also let you determine how you want calls flagged based on a perceived level of risk. The Call Filter &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/call-filter/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;app is available&lt;/a&gt; both on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Secretly throttling is never okay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid, but has room to improve" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oqj0MakQBtEkdeVeOgoGtaFWenI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572807/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0053_Edit_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wBrVTC"&gt;Last Tuesday, &lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt; caught OnePlus doing the previously unthinkable — throttling the performance of its new flagship smartphone, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing “inexplicable” slowdown, &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16794/oneplus-9-performance-examination/"&gt;the publication discovered&lt;/a&gt; the phone was diverting a laundry list of popular apps &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from its Snapdragon 888’s high-performance cores. The company’s excuse? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568107/oneplus-9-pro-battery-life-app-throttling-benchmarks"&gt;It was all an attempt to save battery life&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORRG0g"&gt;Today, OnePlus is doubling down on that earlier statement &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/insight-into-oneplus-9-series-processor-and-app-optimization.1467338/"&gt;with a longer forum post&lt;/a&gt;, where the company’s argument sounds downright reasonable. “In recent years, the performance of smartphone SoCs has reached a point where their power is often overkill in certain scenarios,” writes OnePlus, blaming Qualcomm for essentially being &lt;em&gt;too good at its job&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuAIgh"&gt;“With this in mind, our team has shifted its attention from simply providing sheer performance to providing the performance you expect from our devices while reducing power consumption and heat dissipation,” adds OnePlus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNk5S7"&gt;That sounds good! Now, here are three problems with that seemingly cogent argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PMaSz"&gt;First, OnePlus has sold devices based on raw speed for years now, and despite the OnePlus 9 Pro’s focus on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22340406/oneplus-9-phone-price-release-date-availability"&gt;Hasselblad-branded cameras&lt;/a&gt;, it’s no exception. The company’s entire tagline is “Never Settle,” and the company promised a “flawlessly ‘Fast and Smooth’ experience” from the OnePlus 9 Pro. “You’ll be one step ahead of the curve,” the company assured users during its launch presentation, calling the phone’s Snapdragon 888 “the best there is of all the dragons in the kingdom.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IC6-rrkCrnPY-qasvzsjznDRshQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713252/oneplus_888.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro promises “ultimate performance” from its new Snapdragon chip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ktjxPR"&gt;Second, if &lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt; is right, you do appear to be settling here. The publication found the phone less responsive than a Galaxy S21 Ultra in side by side tests, despite having worse battery life, even though both use the same chips and same screen technology. The slowdown “applies to pretty much everything that has any level of popularity in the Play Store,” too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhN03b"&gt;Third and most importantly, OnePlus &lt;em&gt;didn’t tell anyone. &lt;/em&gt;And now, the company’s trying to make it sound like the practice of secretly throttling a device could somehow ever be okay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meuPOl"&gt;This is a dangerous idea. If we establish that a phonemaker can quietly throttle on a user’s behalf, what’s to keep them from doing that whenever they like? For years, conspiracy theories have swirled about how gadget makers slow down or otherwise cripple devices to force their users to upgrade, and many of them were dismissed as just that — conspiracy theories — until it was revealed that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/28/16827248/apple-iphone-battery-replacement-price-slow-down-apology"&gt;actually did something of the sort&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUVfRp"&gt;Back then, Apple also had a good excuse about how its throttling was saving your phone’s battery, but it didn’t change the fact that the company hid it from users, causing an unknown number of them to upgrade their phones earlier than they might have needed to. The company settled twice (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161271/apple-settlement-500-million-throttling-batterygate-class-action-lawsuit"&gt;once for $500 million&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573710/apple-battery-gate-throttle-iphones-settlement-amount"&gt;once for $113 million&lt;/a&gt;) and added the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/7/16984234/how-to-iphone-throttling-ios-11-3"&gt;turn off throttling&lt;/a&gt;, but Apple still largely normalized the idea that its actions were okay, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/31/18047174/iphone-x-8-plus-performance-throttling-battery-management-ios-12-1-update"&gt;brought the controversial processor throttling feature to later phones&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3p1zFV"&gt;When OnePlus realized that it wanted to shift its focus away from “simply providing sheer performance,” the time to tell us would have been on stage, before people purchased the phone, and it should have been packaged as a feature that you can turn on and off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vo1rHt"&gt;That’s the kind of relationship the company’s power-user fans expect to have with OnePlus. That’s the brand OnePlus built. Now, it’s at risk of erosion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWjTA5"&gt;Let’s not pretend this is normal or acceptable for OnePlus, or any other manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
