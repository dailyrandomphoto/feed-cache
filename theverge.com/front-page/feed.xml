    <title>Twitter is shutting down its Periscope apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YaJNggjL84ZSz6OmaLtqQbBxodE=/110x0:1291x787/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68517908/0_rNGSqodt790lkpl_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ANRjjQ"&gt;Twitter has &lt;a href="https://periscope.medium.com/farewell-periscope-164db2742b7c"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be shutting down Periscope as a service, with the company set to discontinue the Periscope applications by March 2021. Twitter will, however, continue to offer live video streaming through its integrated Twitter Live feature within the main Twitter app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLDD1o"&gt;“The Periscope app is in an unsustainable maintenance-mode state, and has been for a while,” the company explained in a blog post. “Over the past couple of years, we’ve seen declining usage and know that the cost to support the app will only continue to go up over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sdkWY"&gt;While Periscope won’t be fully shut down until March, the company is already blocking any new account sign-ups starting in the latest update to the apps, which is rolling out today. Users will have the chance to download an archive of both their Periscope videos and their data before the app is shuttered next year. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.periscope.tv/periscopeco"&gt;the Periscope website&lt;/a&gt; will remain active to serve as a “read-only archive of public broadcasts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cI4nDm"&gt;Periscope will also be “relaxing our requirements” for users to apply to become “&lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/super-broadcaster"&gt;Super Broadcasters&lt;/a&gt;,” the company’s term for select users that are given the opportunity to cash out tips given to them by followers. Broadcasters will have until April 30th, 2021 to finish cashing out their tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCGgtT"&gt;Twitter bought Periscope back in March 2015, before the service even launched, back in the heyday of live broadcasting (arguably started by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/9/8164893/meerkat-live-video-streaming-twitter-yevvo-periscope"&gt;Meerkat&lt;/a&gt;, a once-viral streaming service that has since pivoted over to developing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/28/13081014/meerkat-houseparty-video-app"&gt;Houseparty&lt;/a&gt;.) Periscope would launch later that month, with all the force of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/26/8293353/periscope-live-streaming-twitter-meerkat"&gt;Twitter’s considerable social presence&lt;/a&gt; behind it. But for all of Periscope’s popularity at the time, it wasn’t a staying force, in the same way that other live-streaming services — like the juggernaut of Twitch — would become. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QK5t28"&gt;Twitter would go on to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/14/13942840/twitter-live-video-periscope-integration"&gt;integrate live video into the main Twitter app&lt;/a&gt; in December 2016, in a feature that was described as being “powered by Periscope.” According to Twitter, the company has already since moved “most of the core capabilities of Periscope” into Twitter Live, with the shuttering of Periscope as a separate service allowing it to better focus on further building out that live-streaming functionality in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest OBS update includes support for stripping out audio from VODs on Twitch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mjo6ddAIakzjiZkBOFa8SBDwlas=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68517861/acastro_200410_1777_OBS_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hmLqEQ"&gt;The new Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) update is out, and as per usual it includes a bunch of changes and fixes that will make your streaming life just a little bit better. The biggest change in this version of OBS is support for the feature that Twitch debuted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495243/twitch-soundtrack-streaming-music-soundcloud-distrokid-facebook-gaming"&gt;Twitch Soundtrack&lt;/a&gt; — the ability to play music in a second track while you’re streaming to Twitch, so that it can be stripped out of your recorded broadcast, or VOD (video on demand). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i4i2KP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This release adds a second audio track when streaming to Twitch which will be saved to the VOD instead of the stream audio. You can enable this feature in Output settings when streaming to Twitch. Special thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Twitch&lt;/a&gt; for assisting during the development of this feature!&lt;/p&gt;— OBS (@OBSProject) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OBSProject/status/1338651935356973057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8HxOQv"&gt;For the uninitiated: it’s normal to play music in the background of live streams, but issues around copyright mean that it can be dangerous. Twitch has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562372/twitch-soundtrack-riaa-music-youtube"&gt;engaged in an extended battle with the music industry&lt;/a&gt; because streamers habitually play copyrighted music on-stream that they don’t have the rights to; it came to a head earlier this year, when streamers were flooded with copyright takedown requests from the music industry. Those requests were based on copyrighted music found in clips from streams and full recorded broadcasts — which is what Twitch Soundtrack, and by extension this feature, are meant to solve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csL5Bz"&gt;OBS pointed out that Twitch helped with the development of the feature, which is interesting because the company already has Soundtrack. I can only imagine it means that this is the latest front in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562372/twitch-soundtrack-riaa-music-youtube"&gt;Twitch’s fight with the music industry&lt;/a&gt; — because if streamers get used to stripping music from their VODs as a general practice, the problem of people broadcasting copyrighted music on Twitch might eventually solve itself. Though, personally, I believe that’s wishful thinking. Either way, OBS implementing the feature means that more streamers will use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart will have the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S available online at 3PM ET today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sCHGmghppC5OrRg1Wmu1frckflc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68517718/vpavic_4261_20201026_0197.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LCVCwa"&gt;If you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174265/ps5-xbox-series-x-s-restock-best-buy"&gt;missed the restock of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, you have another chance at Walmart. The retailer announced that at 3PM ET on December 15th, it will have both next-gen consoles available for purchase exclusively through its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hr5nsU"&gt;Visiting the retailer page for either the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X / S will display a message that reads, “Available online only, Dec 15 at 3:00 PM ET. While supplies last,” as seen in screenshots below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uy09LV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10229005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PcgsFZ"&gt;A Walmart spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that anyone successful in purchasing either a &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F443574645&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F606518560&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;S&lt;/a&gt; will have to wait until the end of the month to get their new console(s) as the items will be available for delivery only and will arrive “after December 25th.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R7H5nr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CXb0Cl"&gt;Like most retailers, Walmart has exclusively sold both consoles online. Much like Nvidia’s RTX 30-series or AMD’s Radeon RX 6000 graphics cards, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X / S are some of the most popular tech products on the market right now, and they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;are also some of the most difficult to find in stock&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0KG4uG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Fortnite can now run at 120 frames per second on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1c6Dh4NVJa3b5Td8qfyhNNDd998=/221x0:1555x889/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68517349/Fortnite.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MoAdqw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; will now be able to run at &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/day-1-ready-fortnite-arrives-next-week-on-xbox-series-x-s-and-ps5"&gt;120 frames per second on the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;. The game already received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21545910/epic-fortnite-ps5-xbox-series-x-enhancements-benefits-new-features"&gt;next-gen features like 4K at 60fps and dynamic visuals&lt;/a&gt; when the new consoles launched, but now Epic is updating the free battle royale game to take even more advantage of the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5RZDn"&gt;“120FPS Mode” can be enabled in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s video settings, but like other performance modes in console games, it does come with some caveats. Turning on 120fps will cap the resolution of the PS5 and Xbox Series X at 1440p rather than the usual 4K, while also reducing some graphical settings like shadows, post-processing, and streaming distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hrnb1q"&gt;On the slightly less powerful Series S, enabling 120fps caps resolution at 1080p and reduces graphical settings like shadows. Unlike the Series X and PS5, running at 120fps also requires disabling volumetric clouds completely. Epic does note that when 120fps is turned off, the Series S will now default to a 1200p resolution rather than 1080p for all game modes. Not that I could ever tell the difference between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FguKm"&gt;Epic most recently spruced up &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s performance with an update focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174861/fortnite-performance-mode-epic-games"&gt;getting the game running better on older PCs&lt;/a&gt;, but “120 FPS Mode” is more of a nice-to-have than anything necessary to continue enjoying the game. Epic also says that 120fps is only available on 120Hz displays, so you might not be able to enjoy it without a new TV or monitor. For those who can enable it, 120 FPS Mode is available in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Office is now updated for M1 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air is fast" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ccwbq_gLy_s8NDH890Y5RM_1ZIA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68517274/vpavic_4291_20201113_0380.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y1GLPv"&gt;If you’ve been using Microsoft Office on an M1 Mac, it’s about to get better — &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fblog%2F2020%2F12%2F15%2F4-ways-microsoft-365-is-improving-the-experience-for-mac-users%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft is announcing an update&lt;/a&gt; today that brings native support for Apple’s new custom chip architecture to the Windows productivity suite. The apps getting the updates are Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Notably absent, however, is Teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIdd2Z"&gt;The updates are making the apps universal ones — meaning these versions will run on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, so any upcoming updates or features will be coming at the same time for both platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXhJja"&gt;If you’re a heavy user of Teams, you may be disappointed to hear that it hasn’t been included in today’s rollout of updates. Microsoft promises they’re working on that platform in their blog post, but the company hasn’t announced any sort of timeline. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s main communications competitor, Slack, has native support available &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/slackeng/status/1326237727667314688"&gt;in a public beta&lt;/a&gt;. It seems like you’ll have to stick with the emulated version for now, if your team uses Teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KAl3i"&gt;Office users who have automatic updates turned on should have the new versions sometime today, and anyone else can update it through the Mac App Store or Microsoft’s AutoUpdate software (depending on if you downloaded Office through the App Store or directly from Microsoft). Outlook users will get not only native Apple Silicon support, but support for iCloud accounts as well, allowing them to sync their email, contacts, and calendars to the app if they use Apple’s service to store them. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go watch this WSJ documentary about living on digitally after you die</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Abstract waves (SHUTTERSTOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3OLYyPEFNEDEqrJFllB3QeWIZmo=/0x74:1100x807/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68517200/shutterstock_52715227_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UEWM61"&gt;How do you want to be remembered after you die? A new documentary from &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; tech reporter (and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; alum) Joanna Stern examines the idea of what it means to pass on a digital legacy, and how we think about preserving our identities after death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXCtUR"&gt;She interviews Lucy, a young woman with a medical condition who is bound to a wheelchair and needs a feeding tube. Lucy is acutely aware of creating a digital footprint that will outlive her, but her mother Kate is not so certain about what may comfort her if Lucy passes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhwJtC"&gt;Stern also spoke to James Vlahos, a man who recorded interviews with his terminally ill father and created a “Dadbot” to keep his father’s personality traits — as well as his jokes and his singing — alive after his death. Vlahos founded HereAfter AI, which uses conversational AI to record people telling their personal stories and creates a voicebot based on those conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hed1T3"&gt;And then there’s Terasem, the company that can create a “mind file” for potential download into a robot. Bina48, the robot, is based on a real person, and while it &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; a little rough around the edges, you can certainly see the potential for bringing human “consciousness” to digital avatars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4Je3au"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aRwJEiI1T2M?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WTpd2t"&gt;In the interest of disclosure: I only know Stern by reputation (I started at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; long after she had departed). But I think this is a truly remarkable piece of service journalism; she connects Lucy and her mother with Vlahos, who helps create a bot for her. I’ll admit I was a little wary of watching something that appeared to be so focused on death, but really, it’s about legacy, and helping keep our memories of our loved ones vivid and real long after they’re gone. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/eternal/how-tech-can-bring-our-loved-ones-to-life-after-they-die/9AE313CA-C2FC-45E3-B427-FEFC6B54F100"&gt;Go watch this moving, thoughtful piece&lt;/a&gt; about what it means to live on after you die. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7E2i1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spelunky is coming to the Switch along with other great-looking indies</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wSvMCN"&gt;At its latest indie showcase, Nintendo revealed a handful of intriguing titles coming to the Switch in 2021. The biggest reveal is that &lt;em&gt;Among Us,&lt;/em&gt; one of 2020’s biggest games, isn’t just coming to the Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176459/among-us-nintendo-switch-cross-play-launch"&gt;but it’ll be available later today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rx4Rq"&gt;There were plenty of other cool announcements as well. One of the most notable reveals was that classic rouguelike series &lt;em&gt;Spelunky&lt;/em&gt; is coming to the Switch next year. That includes both the original &lt;em&gt;Spelunky&lt;/em&gt; as well as &lt;em&gt;Spelunky 2&lt;/em&gt;, with local multiplayer for both (and online for the sequel) in summer 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5VCdz"&gt;Other reveals include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HGBLPO"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fisti-fluffs&lt;/em&gt;, a physics-based brawler about cats wreaking havoc in an empty house, will launch in early 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rK9l5H"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tunche&lt;/em&gt;, a hand-drawn action game about exploring a fantasy version of the Amazon rainforest, will be out in March 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HKa4H8"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Cyber-Shadow&lt;/em&gt;, a retro, pixel-art action game from Mechanical Head Studios (and published by &lt;em&gt;Shovel Knight&lt;/em&gt; studio Yacht Club Games), will launch on January 26th, 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gNTB0B"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Calico&lt;/em&gt;, another cat-themed game, this time about running an adorable cat cafe, will be available later today&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Among Us launches for the Nintendo Switch today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x4_XYawVzyLuRO3mT81m89untuc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516854/ss_eab32f16b59c005489c10f9063227ed7b54b31ec.1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7qxoMw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, Innersloth’s breakout hit of 2020, is coming to the Nintendo Switch today. The news was announced during a special indie game-focused Nintendo Direct. The game will feature crossplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xzsfn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is an online social deduction game, one in which players have to work together to complete tasks around the ship and figure out who the crew’s imposters are. Imposters, meanwhile, attempt to quietly kill as many other players as they can. Although the game first launched in 2018, it’s become a sensation, thanks to a newfound popularity on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452358/fall-guys-among-us-twitch-facebook-gaming"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, played by streamers and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21523878/aoc-twitch-stream-among-us-pokimane"&gt;Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; has become so popular, in fact, that Innersloth &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21453499/among-us-2-sequel-popular-canceled-developers-innersloth"&gt;canceled the game’s sequel&lt;/a&gt; to focus on improving the original. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lw4by3"&gt;The game picked up the award for best multiplayer title of the year during this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168243/among-us-innersloth-new-map-airship-early-2021"&gt;Game Awards&lt;/a&gt;. A new airship map is expected next year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA Play won’t come to Xbox Game Pass for PC until 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eNo788jRd4zAGdlsbzgCnMluiz0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516669/XGP_EAPlay_HERO.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EOh1g2"&gt;PC gamers subscribed to Xbox Game Pass for PC or the pricier Xbox Game Pass Ultimate tier will need to wait just a little while longer until they have access to EA Play on Windows machines. Today, Microsoft announced that EA Play would arrive on PC as part of Xbox Game Pass sometime in 2021. Originally, the partnership was supposed to &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/15/update-on-ea-play-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-2021/"&gt;go into effect today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpXa0q"&gt;“We established this partnership with Electronic Arts because they are as passionate as we are about helping people and communities discover great games, and we knew we could provide a great experience for members by working together. In order to deliver on that, we need more time to provide the Xbox Game Pass experience,” reads &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/15/update-on-ea-play-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-2021/"&gt;a Microsoft blog post published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhGcrZ"&gt;EA Play is an online video game subscription service that provides access to a library of first-party EA games — including &lt;em&gt;Battlefield V&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Sims 4 — &lt;/em&gt;plus 10-hour trials for new releases like &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 21 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;FIFA 21&lt;/em&gt;. EA Play was previously known as EA Access &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368737/ea-access-origin-subscription-rebrand-exclusives-price-drop"&gt;before the company rebranded in August&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcjL9h"&gt;EA Play is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493265/ea-play-xbox-game-pass-release-date-subscription"&gt;already part of Xbox Game Pass for consoles as of November&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Xbox One owners plus those who’ve been able to get their hands on an Xbox Series X / S console to download and play games from EA Play on Xbox hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Meet adds live captions on the web for French, German, Portuguese and Spanish</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ksQ7UT1EQC3LJGUx3Ghl2fKFCHQ=/0x171:1024x854/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516592/Google_Meet.max_2800x2800.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cBnkZL"&gt;Google Meet is adding live captions on the web in four languages to make meetings more inclusive, the &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2020/12/additional-language-support-for-live-captions.html"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Live captions in Spanish, French, German, and Portuguese will be available across all versions of Meet starting today. Meet rolled out real-time captions in English last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WJhYP"&gt;“We know from our work with teachers and parents over the years how essential caption tools can be for students with learning disabilities, as well as English-language learners in both K-12 and higher education,” Google Workspace project manager Philip Nelson wrote in a blog post announcing the update. “By expanding live captions to more languages, we can help more students feel empowered to participate, and help more teachers share a space that is both accessible and inclusive.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZZ1A3"&gt;Google has continued to add updates to Meet as the platform has seen booming growth during the coronavirus pandemic, such as providing attendance reports with viewership data for live streamed events and allowing users to “raise” their hands in larger meetings. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494189/google-meet-limit-calls-minutes-march-2021"&gt;earlier announced&lt;/a&gt; it was extending unlimited Meet calls in its free version through March 31st for Gmail accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNNkji"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21531711/google-alphabet-ad-revenue-youtube-waymo-cloud-search"&gt;Google said in October&lt;/a&gt; that Meet had 235 million daily meetings and more than 7.5 billion daily video calls in the third quarter of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
