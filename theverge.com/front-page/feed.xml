    <title>Apple reportedly developing an Apple TV with a built-in camera and speaker</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QnHWwj"&gt;Apple is reportedly developing a new TV accessory that combines elements of its Apple TV with a HomePod speaker and camera for video calls, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-working-on-combined-tv-box-speaker-to-revive-home-efforts?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside it, Apple is also said to be working on a smart speaker with a display, similar to Amazon’s Echo Show or Google’s Nest Hub. Development of both devices is said to be in its early stages, with plans subject to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekAI8e"&gt;The unannounced TV accessory would have the hardware to fulfill a variety of roles. As a TV accessory it could offer access to games and the streaming video services supported by Apple TV today; while its built-in speaker would likely be an upgrade over those found in most TV sets, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21459521/roku-streambar-soundbar-compact-streaming-bluetooth-spotify-connect-tv-audio"&gt;Roku’s soundbars&lt;/a&gt;. It would also support HomePod features like music playback and Siri voice assistant controls, much like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637225/sonos-google-assistant-how-to-set-up-one-beam-home"&gt;Sonos Beam offers&lt;/a&gt; with Alexa and Google Assistant. Finally, the camera would let it serve as a video calling device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871173/facebook-portal-camera-price-release-date-availability"&gt;like a Facebook Portal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913653/facebook-portal-10-inch-2019-review-price-specs-features-whatsapp-video-calling"&gt; TV&lt;/a&gt;. It’s potentially a lot of functionality in a single Apple device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AbEOj6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A HomePod, Apple TV, and video conferencing device in one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3JFsFd"&gt;The second device is a smart display similar to what competitors Amazon and Google already offer, combining features of an iPad and HomePod. Apple’s work on the device was previously &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/apple-homepod-mini-secret-sensor-for-smart-home-thermostats?sref=ExbtjcSG#lazy-img-370126915:~:text=It%20has%20also%20been%20developing%20new,such%20a%20launch%20isn%E2%80%99t%20imminent.%20Apple"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;. Like the TV accessory, this device would also offer video chat features, but via its built-in screen rather than a connected TV. Apple is said to have explored using a robotic arm to rotate the display and track users, similar to Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21454117/amazon-new-echo-show-10-alexa-smart-display-moving-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;2020 Echo Show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0wj9z"&gt;While Apple’s existing smart home devices have focused on one or two key areas, the functionality offered by the two rumored devices would be much broader. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that Apple merged its HomePod and Apple TV engineering groups in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BZsva"&gt;Apple’s smart home lineup could use a shot in the arm. The company hasn’t updated its Apple TV hardware lineup since 2017, and it recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini"&gt;discontinued its high-end HomePod&lt;/a&gt; to focus on the more affordable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;HomePod mini&lt;/a&gt;. A hardware update for the Apple TV has been rumored &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-22/apple-tv-is-missing-the-moment?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;for several months now&lt;/a&gt;, and recently discovered code suggests it might include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22369056/apple-tv-2021-120hz-refresh-rate-support-4k-gaming-arcade"&gt;support for 120Hz refresh rates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Facebook loophole is allowing politicians around the world to fake support and criticize opponents</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yyWw5XgJWLiqQUhyDOAT7UQGZzQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69111943/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BFYXIc"&gt;Governments and politicians around the world are using a loophole in how Facebook polices inauthentic activity to fake popular support and harass opponents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKVoQV"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/12/facebook-loophole-state-backed-manipulation"&gt;investigation from &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;based on internal documents and the testimony of a former Facebook data scientist, Sophie Zhang, shows how the company selectively chooses to take action on this activity. Facebook moves swiftly to deal with coordinated campaigns to sway politics in wealthy countries like the US, South Korea, and Taiwan, while it de-prioritizes or simply ignores reports of similar activity in poorer nations like Afghanistan, Iraq, Mexico, and much of Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyNdNe"&gt;“There is a lot of harm being done on Facebook that is not being responded to because it is not considered enough of a PR risk to Facebook,” Zhang told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. “The cost isn’t borne by Facebook. It’s borne by the broader world as a whole.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0lFEEC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The cost isn’t borne by Facebook. It’s borne by the broader world as a whole.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="98pYwc"&gt;The loophole identified by Zhang concerns the use of Pages to create fake supporters used by governments to appear popular and criticize opponents. Although Facebook bans people from operating more than one account, any individual can create multiple Pages with similar results. Pages are usually used to represent businesses, charities, nonprofits, or other organizations, but can easily be changed to look like individual accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4IYwR"&gt;One case utilizing this loophole took place in Honduras, where administrators operating the Facebook page of the country’s president, Juan Orlando Hernández, created hundreds of Pages to like their own posts and create the appearance of popular support. (The election of Hernández in 2017 was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/honduras-election-president-juan-orlando-hernandez-declared-winner-amid-unrest"&gt;widely criticized&lt;/a&gt; for fraud.) Similarly, in Azerbaijan, which has experienced years of authoritarian rule under President Ilham Aliyev, the ruling party used dummy Pages to harass opposition politicians and criticize news stories by independent outlets. The video below from &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; shows how these operations work: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CE2YFg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eYigm8R2ep8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h8YPuP"&gt;Zhang, who worked on Facebook’s integrity team to identify such fake activity, was fired by Facebook in September 2020 for poor performance. In a &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-ignore-political-manipulation-whistleblower-memo"&gt;memo she shared on her final day&lt;/a&gt;, she described how she’d found “multiple blatant attempts by foreign national governments to abuse our platform on vast scales to mislead their own citizenry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O53Eo5"&gt;When Zhang reported such networks of fake Pages to her managers, Facebook’s response was inconsistent. The company was slow in responding to some reports (it took “nearly a year” to remove the &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/07/removing-cib-thailand-russia-ukraine-honduras/"&gt;Honduras network&lt;/a&gt; and 14 months to take down the &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/removing-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-september-report/"&gt;Azerbaijan campaign&lt;/a&gt;, says &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;) and ignored others Zhang found, e.g. in Bolivia and Albania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9fIEL"&gt;As Facebook’s vice-president of integrity, Guy Rosen, told Zhang in 2019 after she complained about slow responses: “We have literally hundreds or thousands of types of abuse (job security on integrity eh!) [...] That’s why we should start from the end (top countries, top priority areas, things driving prevalence, etc) and try to somewhat work our way down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBs4Vy"&gt;In order to speak out about Facebook’s inaction, Zhang turned down a $64,000 severance package with the company. In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/szhang_ds/status/1381518093898289153"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; this morning accompanying the publication of &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;’s investigation, Zhang said: “I joined FB because I’d naively hoped to fix the company from within. I am coming forward, because I failed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bxOoez"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Facebook is not my enemy. In the end, their goal - like that of any corporation - is profit. We cannot expect them to fix the world out of the goodness of their hearts, any more than expecting Philip Morris to make cancer-free cigarettes. &lt;br&gt;Instead, we hold them responsible. (4/8)&lt;/p&gt;— Sophie Zhang（张学菲） (@szhang_ds) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/szhang_ds/status/1381518201855430657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="2L8ceR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And we also hold responsible the politicians who chose to abuse Facebook to manipulate their own populace. &lt;br&gt;I caught two national governments red-handed without any effort, knowing nothing about their country beyond Google and Wikipedia. Because they never bothered to hide. (5/8)&lt;/p&gt;— Sophie Zhang（张学菲） (@szhang_ds) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/szhang_ds/status/1381518320474615814?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="celYB3"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian, &lt;/em&gt;Facebook spokesperson Liz Bourgeois said: “We fundamentally disagree with Ms Zhang’s characterization of our priorities and efforts to root out abuse on our platform. We aggressively go after abuse around the world and have specialized teams focused on this work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9BnN7"&gt;Bourgeois says Facebook has taken down “more than 100 networks of coordinated inauthentic behavior” and that “combatting coordinated inauthentic behavior is our priority.” The company did not dispute the facts of Zhang’s time working at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cruise is bringing its driverless robotaxis to Dubai in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iHIudg_UXdeXPe5Q-Eg5gwidyrI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69111722/vpavic_200121_3874_0010.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NyNpXZ"&gt;Cruise, the autonomous vehicle company backed by General Motors and Honda, will launch its first international robotaxi service in Dubai. The company will start testing its vehicles in the kingdom in 2023, with plans to launch a commercial ride-hailing service soon after — though it hasn’t specified an actual date. The news was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HamdanMohammed/status/1381541036028125184"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; early Monday by Dubai’s crown prince, Hamdan bin Mohammed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7TS9Q"&gt;As part of the ride-hailing service, Cruise will use its fully autonomous Origin vehicles, which it first unveiled in 2019. The company does not plan on utilizing its Chevy Bolt electric vehicles that it currently uses as part of its test fleet in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqeOqo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075977/cruise-driverless-car-gm-no-steering-wheel-pedals-ev-exclusive-first-look"&gt;The Origin is designed&lt;/a&gt; to be a shared vehicle, and when it goes into production, it won’t have any controls typically associated with human driving, like a steering wheel or pedals. Cruise said the goal is to scale up to at least 4,000 vehicles in Dubai by the year 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="f55jSt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cruise still intends for San Francisco to be its first market for its commercial robotaxi service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gVcjxp"&gt;Cruise still intends for San Francisco to be its first market for its commercial robotaxi service. The company had planned to launch a commercial service in its hometown in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707242/cruise-gm-self-driving-taxi-launch-delay-2019"&gt;but failed to do so&lt;/a&gt; and has yet to announce a new date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwvKzn"&gt;The Cruise Origin will go into production at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519358/gm-factory-zero-detroit-hamtramck-electric-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;GM’s Detroit-Hamtramck plant&lt;/a&gt; starting in 2022. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic’s negative effect on shared ride-hailing, Cruise recently unveiled a new set of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527014/cruise-self-driving-origin-covid-safety-ruls-nhtsa-exemption"&gt;safety protocols&lt;/a&gt; intended to keep people socially distant during trips and the vehicle sanitized between fares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A497u2"&gt;Cruise is among the best capitalized autonomous vehicle companies in the world. Over the last three years, the company has raised over $9.25 billion from a number of investors including SoftBank, Honda, GM, T. Rowe Price Group, and Microsoft. Cruise is currently valued at $30 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bjy9id"&gt;Dubai may be a natural fit for Cruise’s fully autonomous vehicles. The kingdom has the goal of 20 percent of its trips taking place in autonomous vehicles by 2030. Dubai has also invited a number of urban air mobility companies, like Volocopter,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/26/16365614/dubai-testing-uncrewed-two-person-flying-taxis-volocopter"&gt; to test their electric aircraft&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFHa5k"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clarified the Dubai launch plans and corrected the amount invested in Cruise to date. It’s $9.25 billion, not $7.4 billion as originally stated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New ‘Heads Up’ feature nags distracted Android users to look up while walking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bgd1q9RPbx0YyxE0FAV-bXo3GL0=/0x0:1517x1011/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69111704/EyrbTZOVoAUnpai.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An illustration from the feature’s settings page.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google (via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/jay__kamat/status/1381157364791832579" target="_blank"&gt;Jay Prakash Kamat&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IsMLv0"&gt;Android’s Digital Wellbeing service is getting a new “Heads Up” feature, which will prompt users to stop staring at their phones while walking, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/digital-wellbeing-preps-heads-up-stop-you-using-phone-while-walking/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The feature appears to be rolling out to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jay__kamat/status/1381244945252581380"&gt;beta version&lt;/a&gt; of the Digital Wellbeing app, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jay__kamat/status/1381157095064539137"&gt;one Twitter user&lt;/a&gt; reports receiving the feature on their Pixel 4A device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vDfU2"&gt;“If you’re walking while using your phone, get a reminder to focus on what’s around you,” says the Heads Up setup page. The reminders include brief notifications with instructions like “Watch your step,” “Stay alert,” and “Look up,” judging by an app teardown last year &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/11/18/digital-wellbeing-heads-up-notifications-walking-distracted/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HOAIB5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/FUPMuSnwqB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/FUPMuSnwqB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jay Prakash Kamat (@jay__kamat) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jay__kamat/status/1381157364791832579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pVMomS"&gt;“Use with caution. Heads Up doesn’t replace paying attention,” says Google despite the obviousness of such advice. Nevertheless, the feature seems necessary with &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/technology/personaltech/distracted-walking-twalking.html"&gt;distracted walking becoming increasingly dangerous&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IIbT6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9346420?hl=en-GB"&gt;Digital Wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; is a service built into some Android phones to help manage your usage. It can be used to set limits on the amount of time you spend in specific apps, or set up a “Bedtime mode” to make a phone less distracting late at night, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0C3qE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers &lt;/em&gt;reports that Heads Up seems to be coming to Pixel phones first. We’ve contacted Google for more information on the rollout. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="3xqWDa"&gt;Apple’s next iPad Pro may face supply constraints at launch due to issues in production, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display"&gt;new report in Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s suppliers are said to be having trouble with low manufacturing yields for the new Mini LED display rumored to be the key feature of the new 12.9-inch model; one manufacturer has reportedly paused production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7Ae6O"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373281/chip-shortage-apple-macbook-ipad-delay-nikkei"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reported last week&lt;/a&gt; that iPad production had been delayed by a shortage of displays and display components, though the publication didn’t specify which models had been hit. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1381456421607202820"&gt;According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, the new iPad Pro lineup is still expected to be announced later this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lk6vNj"&gt;It’s possible, though, that the larger model may have a later shipping date. The smaller model reportedly won’t use the Mini LED display, but other upgrades across the line are said to include a faster processor similar in power to the M1 chip in Apple’s new Macs, as well as an upgraded USB-C port and better cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Cruella, The Woman in the Window, Loki, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HlbRlWOPBVCBvFv1ilKOTLEDfg0=/151x0:1572x947/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69110315/cruella.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Cruella | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpZrVxvG3mk&amp;amp;t=1s&amp;amp;ab_channel=WaltDisneyStudios" target="_blank"&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6ewlRu"&gt;So yesterday I watched the first episode of the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH18cKTmwZ8&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix"&gt;Netflix documentary &lt;em&gt;This is a Robbery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; about the 1990 heist at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston and the accents alone made me homesick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBVvWb"&gt;For those who did not grow up in the land of dropped R’s: two thieves dressed as cops stole 13 works from the museum, valued at a total of $500 million. The art, which included paintings by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Degas, and Manet, has never been found and no arrests have ever been made. The museum is &lt;a href="https://www.gardnermuseum.org/organization/theft"&gt;offering a $10 million reward&lt;/a&gt; for information leading to the recovery of the stolen works. I’m trying to avoid spoilers because even though I grew up in Boston and I’m familiar with the story, a few headlines about the doc have teased that it “solves” the case. Very interested to see the filmmakers’ theory of what happened!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3H7md"&gt;The trailer roundup for this week has villains, shut-ins, and Ghostbusters. You’re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hdCn9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jZIaqw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v_0GJg_Jnlo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ngEfhO"&gt;The Woman in The Window &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PjiK81"&gt;Getting strong &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m01YktiEZCw&amp;amp;ab_channel=MovieclipsClassicTrailers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rear Window&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; vibes from the second trailer for this movie, which was supposed to premiere in theaters last May. Amy Adams stars as Anna Fox, a severely agoraphobic woman who suspects she witnessed the murder of her friend (played by Julianne Moore) in the neighboring building. Some serious gaslighting ensues. &lt;em&gt;The Woman in the Window&lt;/em&gt; also stars Brian Tyree Henry, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Anthony Mackie, Tracy Letts, and Gary Oldman. It hits Netflix May 14th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bx9sVK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpZrVxvG3mk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wHepYG"&gt;Cruella&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Kaz0F7"&gt;This is the second trailer for the upcoming origin story of the villainess from &lt;em&gt;101 Dalmatians &lt;/em&gt;and it makes me think we’re supposed to be rooting for Cruella? Even though in the original movie she wanted to make a coat out of puppies? And is literally named “cruel devil”? I’m still not totally sold on the whole notion of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20899422/joker-movie-review-todd-phillips-joaquin-phoenix-incel-violence-dc-comics-batman"&gt;origin story&lt;/a&gt; for a movie villain (and more are coming), but if Emmas Stone and Thompson are involved (Thompson’s character is the Baroness von Hellman... literally has “hell” right in her name) then it’s worth a look. &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; will be in theaters and on Disney Plus (for an additional fee)  on May 28th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RE5o13"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X9eh37VDAG0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jzUgiB"&gt;Ghostbusters: Afterlife&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5uBqRG"&gt;OK so this is a character-specific teaser trailer for the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahZFCF--uRY&amp;amp;t=2s&amp;amp;ab_channel=SonyPicturesEntertainment"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sequel with Paul Rudd, introducing us to some cute? Scary? Menacing? Stay-Puft marshmallow... creatures. Mckenna Grace, Finn Wolfhard, Carrie Coon, and some of the original Ghostbusters will be in &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters: Afterlife&lt;/em&gt;, which is slated for release in theaters November 11th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z08ffA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nW948Va-l10?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eF3Tp0"&gt;Loki &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JAdHYl"&gt;The next spinoff series from Marvel is all about Loki, the trickster god of Asgard, and introduces the Time Variance Authority and Owen Wilson as Mobius. Tom Hiddleston is so good as Loki that perhaps I should retract or at least rethink my earlier statement about movie villains. &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; comes to Disney Plus on June 11th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xlr6nZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0gdgE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uKyQn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhvdlm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 2022 Mercedes-Benz EQS is a declaration of maximum electric luxury</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/71AiWnqHI83KzaaDTQAom6TyH0M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69110274/ahawkins_20210404_4511_0014.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A first drive in the automaker’s electrified S-Class sedan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZFiJTa"&gt;Driving the new Mercedes-Benz EQS — essentially, the electric version of the automaker’s esteemed S-Class — almost gave me whiplash. Not because of some driving mishap (the EQS handles wonderfully) but because of how radically different Mercedes’ new luxury EV is from the recent crop of battery-powered vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nb3ZXE"&gt;Mercedes has no interest in minimalist electric car design. The stark, button-less interiors of the Tesla Model 3 are fine for those who want to be reminded of a “completely cleared, black-washed Bauhaus living room,” as a &lt;a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/auto/elektroauto-im-fahrbericht-das-model-3-ist-teslas-neues-glanzstueck-1.3866854"&gt;German writer once appropriately described Elon Musk’s mass-market EV&lt;/a&gt;. With the EQS, Mercedes is saying auf wiedersehen to the idea of sparsely appointed EV interiors. It has the largest screen, the highest range (so far), the most features, a truly shocking number of physical touchpoints, the softest headrests… I could go on. This is an all-electric S-Class in the truest sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="aXzinO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mercedes is saying auf wiedersehen to the idea of sparsely appointed EV interiors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SXcIKP"&gt;I got a chance to test out the EQS for a few hours about a week before its official launch, and while it was delightful to drive and I truly appreciated getting to cosplay as a wealthy luxury car guy, I had to wonder what the point was of all this extra stuff. Why do I need a gazillion different colored options for ambient lighting? Why does the front passenger need their own dedicated screen embedded in the dashboard? Why was there a fingerprint scanner &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;a facial recognition scanner? How much is too much massage for a driver’s seat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puFCcl"&gt;The obvious answer is that S-Class customers expect the best. But more is not necessarily better. All of this stuff is not inherently bad, but there was a lingering sense that a lot of it was superfluous. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3j9muCo4o0"&gt;To paraphrase the good doctor Ian Malcolm&lt;/a&gt;, Mercedes’ engineers were so preoccupied with whether they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; add a shimmering water effect to the bodies of water in the EQS’s 3D map that they didn’t stop to think if they &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B_7676CRpaZbDpdJjC9iImYmMeg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22434235/ahawkins_20210404_4511_0024.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xs0-me8h-i9tjz9QJ4OqqeJOlqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22434234/ahawkins_20210404_4511_0022.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1ibnfx"&gt;Let’s get some specs out of the way first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6QzDdh"&gt;The EQS will sprint 0 to 60 mph in a little over 4 seconds and will be top speed-limited to 130 mph.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9Slps8"&gt;It will come in two battery sizes: 90kWh and 107.8kWh. By way of comparison, the most powerful Tesla, the long-range Model S, has a 100kWh battery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yVlwJZ"&gt;The 107.8kWh battery has an estimated range of up to 770 km (478.5 miles) based on the generous WLTP standard. (The EPA rated range will definitely be lower.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="H4EZSn"&gt;The 400-volt architecture is liquid-cooled through special cavities cast into the aluminum battery housing that automatically preheats or cools as needed to speed charging. This could be very useful in priming the battery before it charges, especially in winter temperatures. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XlQBk3"&gt;When plugged into a 200kWh fast charger, the EQS’s battery will add about 300 kilometers (186 miles) in 15 minutes. That’s faster than most of Mercedes’ competitors. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xZeWnZ"&gt;It will be eligible for the &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35044132/plug-and-charge-ev-charging-mustang-mach-e/"&gt;Plug and Charge system&lt;/a&gt;, a technological concept initially introduced by &lt;a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/55365.html"&gt;ISO 15118&lt;/a&gt;, the international standard for charging EVs. That means the EQS will be compatible with about 90 percent of the public charging stations in the US without the need to download an app or sign up for an individual charging service. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3UX0Vj"&gt;In electric vehicles, better aerodynamics equal improved range — so the bodywork is ultra-low drag. Mercedes claims the 0.20 drag coefficient as the best in the world. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wUdy4v"&gt;It will come in rear-wheel and all-wheel drive configurations. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZSKa0c"&gt;The single-motor configuration will get 329 horsepower with rear-wheel drive, while the dual-motor/all-wheel drive trim level will get 516 horsepower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="hvVBL1"&gt;Now let’s talk about the giant pillar-to-pillar 55-inch touchscreen, which Mercedes calls &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217267/mercedes-benz-hyperscreen-size-specs-eqs-ces-2021"&gt;the Hyperscreen&lt;/a&gt;. First teased earlier this year, the Hyperscreen is the locus of the automaker’s second-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21316700/mercedes-benz-mbux-second-generation-infotainment-system-touchscreen-hey-mercedes"&gt;MBUX infotainment system&lt;/a&gt; that eschews physical buttons in favor of a completely digital (and voice-controlled) user experience. And if you thought it looked big in pictures, I can promise you it’s even bigger in real life. This thing absolutely gobbles up the interior of the EQS.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XAHRf"&gt;But it isn’t one seamless display; it’s actually three separate screens embedded in one solid piece of curved glass. I expected some kind of graphical interplay, much like how you can share windows between a laptop and an external monitor, but the screens remained rigidly segregated from each other. It felt like a missed opportunity for Mercedes to show off its design chops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kqjvfQmEI5Q38e3PC5jgn9U1y2s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22434241/ahawkins_20210404_4511_0035.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yqR98UP9NSJAlU8RXOuHRXTxjh8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22434240/ahawkins_20210404_4511_0030.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j_gCpvKHjoxwIO_EjMgcVY922CU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22434242/ahawkins_20210404_4511_0036.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DfkCKf"&gt;That said, it’s very easy to get lost in the pixelated wilderness of the EQS’s Hyperscreen. Mercedes insists the Hyperscreen has been designed to avoid distraction. The operating system uses artificial intelligence to learn which features you use the most, then surfaces those features as individual widgets on the main screen. Ideally, you don’t have to rummage through too many sub-menus to find what you want. The company claims drivers can find “90 percent” of what they’re looking for on the first layer of the screen without having to scroll through menus or use the voice assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rb91Ko"&gt;The voice assistant was fine, but like most in-car systems, there’s a noticeable lag — at least three to five seconds — between asking the question and getting the acknowledgment from the car. It’s not a huge deal, but it did lead to some awkward cross-talk between me and the MBUX system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQ3iWv"&gt;The EQS’s map was ludicrously detailed, with the 3D option especially beautiful. But I rarely needed to look at the map for navigation, thanks to the impressive heads-up display (HUD). The HUD uses augmented reality (AR) to project 3D arrows in the driver’s field of vision for turn-by-turn navigation. The arrows stretch out in front of the car and even curve around corners to guide the driver in the right direction. Toggling through the HUD display settings, I came across an option that projects an AR green orb that would glow orange and then red as I accelerated. It was very trippy, but I’m not sure what purpose it served. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tH3Kcv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was very trippy, but I’m not sure what purpose it served&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fRxTl6"&gt;Like any good luxury EV, the EQS allows you to factor battery capacity into your route planning. If you want to show up at your destination with, say, 45 percent charge left in your battery, the EQS will suggest a charging station along your route, as well as the amount of time you would need to be plugged in in order to achieve that result. With the EV charging network still rather shambolic, a feature like this can help shave off some of that range anxiety that can accompany EV ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXK2oV"&gt;In terms of processing power, Mercedes says the Hyperscreen is powered by 8 CPU cores, 24GB of RAM, and 46.4GB-per-second RAM memory bandwidth. I didn’t really experience any lag while swiping through menus, pinching and zooming on the map, or typing in locations into the search bar. The type function had a satisfying “clack-clack” sound effect that reminded me a little bit of a Qwerty keyboard on a BlackBerry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93MF7z"&gt;I would need another week with the EQS to truly understand everything that’s going on in the instrument cluster. There is a lot! There are four different displays you can toggle through, and I found the “Understated” display most to my liking. Graphically, it’s gorgeous; the “Sport” display features glowing blue and red parentheses framing what appears to be a misty landscape overlooking a rippled jeweled star? Honestly, what were these Mercedes engineers smoking?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dictXZ"&gt;Like the graphical displays, there’s a lot of customization inherent in the ride quality of the EQS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5SZwxd"&gt;There’s regenerative braking, which Mercedes calls “intelligent recuperation” and is similar to one-pedal driving in most electric vehicles. That means you press the acceleration pedal to accelerate or cruise and release the pedal to brake. When the pedal is released, the regenerative braking kicks in, supplying some power back into the battery. The level of regenerative braking, as well as the weight and feel of the one-pedal system, can be adjusted using the plus or minus paddles behind the steering wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WIBYeU"&gt;There are also four driving modes: Eco, Comfort, Sport, and Individual. To toggle between them, you press a button located in the center console next to the start/stop button. This panel felt janky, even slightly loose, like I could pull the whole thing out of the center console if I applied enough force. The same went for the air vents embedded at either end of the Hyperscreen. They felt cheaper than they should in an electrified S-Class. The EQS I drove was a pre-production version, so there’s still a chance to tighten up some of these accessories before final production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Nr11xE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;They felt cheaper than they should in an electrified S-Class&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C9bAgV"&gt;I found Comfort to be the, well, most comfortable driving mode, while Sport certainly offered its fair share of torque-induced thrills. There was nothing jerky about the acceleration, just smooth refinement. The EQS really grips the road while you’re driving, thanks to a low center of gravity provided by the battery pack placed in the floor of the vehicle. The turning radius of the EQS is better than that of the conventional S-Class sedan due to a rear-wheel turning feature that was really amazing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqexHC"&gt;The regenerative braking was fine but took some getting used to. What’s really impressive was the amount of power it sends back into the battery. Mercedes claims the EQS is the champ here, too, able to regeneratively brake at up to 290kW with all-wheel drive version. That’s better than the 265kW record held by the Porsche Taycan Turbo S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M-8jaEb1LUSmRzk0wxCN4qVTUKI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22434236/ahawkins_20210404_4511_0025.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JnnXlK"&gt;The front and rear section of the EQS was still camouflaged when I drove it. You can probably extrapolate some of the design features of the EQS based on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20858555/mercedes-benz-vision-eqs-concept-frankfurt-motor-show-2019"&gt;Vision EQS concept car&lt;/a&gt; that was released last year. I’m intrigued to learn whether Mercedes keeps the completely digital front grille or goes with something more analog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4SfHr"&gt;The body of the vehicle was unlike any sedan I’ve ever seen before. Mercedes is really throwing down the gauntlet on aerodynamic design, with a sleek, flowing silhouette that almost erases any hint of a traditional sedan form. That will definitely help improve the vehicle’s range and also create a more quiet cabin environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWLbEC"&gt;The door handles can extend and retract, depending on whether you’re getting in or locking up. And all four doors can be opened or closed automatically using either the key fob or the touchscreen. This was probably my favorite feature. Even a small push of the door handle will trigger the automatic closing function. Robot doors! What’s not to love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rXjhsA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Automatic doors! What’s not to love?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7O1PG9"&gt;That said, if it gets too quiet, you can always turn the fake ambient motor noise to trick your brain into thinking there’s more going on underneath the hood. The EQS’s fake motor noise, which Mercedes describes as “soundscapes,” wasn’t as noticeable as the kazoo-esque sound made by the Volkswagen ID 4; it was more of a background hum that wasn’t totally annoying. Future soundscapes can be downloaded via an over-the-air software update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNQ1sS"&gt;Speaking of the hood, Mercedes did not include a front trunk, or frunk, in the EQS. Moreover, the area under the hood will be completely inaccessible to EQS owners. There was a weird side compartment right above the front-left wheel where you can refill the windshield wiper fluid, but other than that, the hood is off limits. It’s a very odd choice that I can see rubbing a lot of owners the wrong way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kenjaYsF6F4CBv7dLcV2BU0rfWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22434227/ahawkins_20210404_4511_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BiSZtg"&gt;Ultimately, I wasn’t completely seduced by the EQS. It’s a beautiful electric car with so much going on above and below the surface that I feel like I’ll need at least a month in order to sort it all out. The Hyperscreen lives up to its name, for better or worse. And while it will certainly be popular among a certain segment of monied car buyers, the EQS will not revolutionize the electric car market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFXiUg"&gt;That’s because it’s already happened. It’s been nearly a decade since the Tesla Model S was first introduced, nabbing all those early adopters with its sleek blend of technological efficiency and addictively fun driving style. Elon Musk’s company is planning on rolling out a refreshed version of the Model S this year, maybe around the same time that the EQS hits dealerships. But it’s unclear to me what the EQS offers over the Model S other than a more cluttered interior and a higher sticker price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FJRQIU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the EQS will not revolutionize the electric car market&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vXyzgN"&gt;No question the three-pointed star logo will be all it takes from some interested buyers, but it’s clear that Mercedes is still struggling with the S-Class’ reputation as an “old man car.” &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a33928077/s-class-in-the-age-of-suv/"&gt;A rich old man&lt;/a&gt;, to be sure, but definitely geriatric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="na9Y1E"&gt;The EQS is about to dive into a luxury EV segment that is already very crowded with the likes of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274376/audi-etron-gt-rs-electric-car-specs-price"&gt;Audi E-Tron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/14/13628872/jaguar-ipace-concept-electric-car-suv-unveiled-la-auto-show-2016-photos"&gt;Jaguar I-Pace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range"&gt;Porsche Taycan&lt;/a&gt;. Other vehicles will soon follow, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;Cadillac Lyriq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335807/bmw-i4-sedan-ev-m-performance-range-photos"&gt;BMW i4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357789/lexus-lf-z-electrified-concept-car-ev-toyota-electric"&gt;Lexus LF-Z&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429319/lucid-motors-air-electric-sedan-price-specs-range-reveal"&gt;Lucid Air&lt;/a&gt;. Do we really need more luxury electric cars?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pm1Na3"&gt;Obviously, no luxury electric segment would be complete without a battery-powered S-Class. Mercedes is widely seen as lagging behind other major automakers in the release of new electric vehicles. The company’s $68,000 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17818836/mercedes-benz-eqc-suv-ev-specs-photos"&gt;EQC SUV&lt;/a&gt; was supposed to start shipping in the US at the start of 2020, but that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21024073/mercedes-benz-eqc-electric-delay-us-launch-2021"&gt;pushed to 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sNUlS6"&gt;Now, it looks like the EQS will actually be Mercedes’ first EV to come to North America. That means there will be a lot riding on it when it does come out. And if the company is going to make good on its promise to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504049/mercedes-benz-eqs-electric-sedan-eqe-suv"&gt;release 10 new EVs by 2022&lt;/a&gt;, it really needs to smash that acceleration pedal — or at the very least, turn off the one-pedal driving.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says it will send a witness to Senate hearing on app stores after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vxvfy5MYV2A2o2l-kYDwt8pylbc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69109994/acstro_190902_apple_event_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jjupRR"&gt;After several senators criticized the company, Apple said on Sunday it would send its chief compliance officer to an April 21st hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the office of Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78tDaB"&gt;Leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday demanding that the company send a representative to the hearing, saying Apple was refusing to participate. &lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/6/e/6e3e8f7c-adf3-4f0a-ae4d-429ebdee5e7b/EBBA9ECB053293C7011FBA308652C607.2021.04.09-ltr-to-tcook-apple.pdf"&gt;In the letter&lt;/a&gt;, Klobuchar and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) say Apple “abruptly” decided not to provide a witness for the hearing on digital markets focused on Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3jmNZ"&gt;“Apple’s sudden change in course to refuse to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee on app store competition issues in April, when the company is clearly willing to discuss them in other public forums, is unacceptable,” the senators wrote in the letter. “We strongly urge Apple to reconsider its position and to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee in a timely manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNWqPC"&gt;But on Sunday, Apple sent a letter to the senators saying it was “surprised” by their letter and that it had intended to participate, but simply sought a change in the date. “We have a deep respect for your role and process on these matters,” the letter reads, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-11/apple-makes-top-executive-available-at-senate-app-store-hearing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company will make Kyle Andeer— who Apple says has represented the company before the US House of Representatives and several states—available on April 21st. “We look forward to sharing our perspective on our App Store,” the letter states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCfE13"&gt;Lee said in a joint statement with Klobuchar emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Sunday that he was glad Apple had “changed course and agreed to testify before the committee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3umhb"&gt;Klobuchar said in the statement the hearing will explore “whether Apple and Google are using their power as gatekeepers to charge high fees and impose restrictions that suppress competition in mobile applications and related markets, and both companies‘ participation in the hearing is necessary.” She added that the companies “have the power to control how and if mobile app developers can reach app users, and ultimately, which apps become successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZSug3"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday. Its App Store practices, including the 30 percent fees it charges developers, have been under scrutiny from lawmakers in recent months. Apple also has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;battling with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; publisher Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;, which sued the iPhone maker for what it claims are violations of antitrust law. That trial is slated to get underway May 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvbzcQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UDXOY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 11th 5:32PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds statement from Sens. Klobuchar and Lee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5010ks"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>French lawmakers vote to ban some domestic flights to reduce carbon emissions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PA5C54"&gt;French lawmakers have voted to ban domestic flights on routes that could be taken in a train ride in less than two-and-a-half hours, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-france-flights-idUSKBN2BY0AO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The vote late Saturday comes as part of France’s larger climate bill, which seeks to reduce its 1990-level carbon emissions by 40 percent over the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGgZgs"&gt;Last week, France’s government said it would contribute 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) to recapitalize airline Air France-KLM. The airline warned it is expecting an operating loss of 1.3 billion euros when it reports its first-quarter earnings next month. The airline industry is reeling with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to a sharp reduction in global travel over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7icPK"&gt;“We know that aviation is a contributor of carbon dioxide and that because of climate change we must reduce emissions,” France’s Industry Minister Agnes Pannier-Runachershe told Europe 1 radio. “Equally, we must support our companies and not let them fall by the wayside.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbVx9N"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/back-to-the-future-airline-sector-poised-for-change-post-covid-19"&gt;McKinsey &amp;amp; Co. analysts estimate&lt;/a&gt; the airline industry will continue to feel the effects of the coronavirus pandemic for several years, predicting that air traffic won’t get back to 2019 levels until 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNBO8G"&gt;The bill to cut back domestic flights goes next to France’s Senate for a vote.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse CEO says user data was not leaked, contrary to reports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Clubhouse App Photo Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1LE1u1OdUfNNDeO2YjEE2T9XWI=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69108912/1232148642.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4eTW0P"&gt;Clubhouse CEO Paul Davison said Sunday that a report claiming personal user data had been leaked was “false.”  &lt;a href="https://cybernews.com/security/clubhouse-data-leak-1-3-million-user-records-leaked-for-free-online/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber News&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; a SQL database with users’ IDs, names, usernames, Twitter and Instagram handles and follower counts were posted to an online hacker forum. According to &lt;em&gt;Cyber News, &lt;/em&gt;it did not appear that sensitive user information such as credit card numbers were among the leaked info. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzRTqg"&gt;Clubhouse did not immediately reply to a request for more information from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday. But Davison said in response to a question during a town hall that the platform had not suffered a data breach. “No, This is misleading and false, it is a clickbait article, we were not hacked. The data referred to was all public profile information from our app. So the answer to that is a definitive ‘no.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HNpFD"&gt;Last week, &lt;em&gt;Cyber News&lt;/em&gt; reported that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374464/linkedin-data-leak-500-million-accounts-scraped-microsoft"&gt;personal data for 500 million LinkedIn users&lt;/a&gt; had been scraped and posted online. The Microsoft-owned company said that no private member account data from LinkedIn was included in the leak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqEDzU"&gt;That news came just a couple of days after it was discovered that personal data for some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22366822/facebook-personal-data-533-million-leaks-online-email-phone-numbers"&gt;533 million Facebook users&lt;/a&gt; was leaked online for free. The Facebook leak reportedly included users’ phone numbers, birthdates, locations, email addresses, and full names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Z3HPp"&gt;Clubhouse had a monster first year—despite being invite-only and available only on iOS devices— seeing more than 10 million downloads. Twitter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; have all launched or are working on competing social audio platforms, and  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276645/facebook-clubhouse-social-audio-app-develop"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; reportedly has one in the works as well. &lt;/p&gt;
