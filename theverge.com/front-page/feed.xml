    <title>Samsung launches EKG support for latest Galaxy Watch devices in 31 more countries</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vr5afU"&gt;Samsung has launched support for electrocardiogram (EKG) readings and blood pressure monitoring on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20903452/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-review-fitness-tizen-apps-features-android-price"&gt;Galaxy Watch Active 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368752/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Galaxy Watch 3&lt;/a&gt; devices, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/ecg-support-for-galaxy-watch-2-galaxy-watch-3-rolling-out-to-31-markets/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The feature comes courtesy of the Samsung Health Monitor app, which is now available to download from the company’s app store in 31 additional countries. Prior to today, the features were restricted to owners of one of those two devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452541/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-active-2-ekg-ecg-electrocardiogram-update"&gt;in South Korea and the US only&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYgQdV"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251411/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-active-2-ekg-blood-pressure-health-monitor"&gt;first announced last month&lt;/a&gt; it would be adding the features to its latest Galaxy Watch devices through software updates, considering both smartwatches have the requisite sensors used for measuring heart rate and blood pressure and performing an EKG. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5IgP8dTfI_Iz4vIYnji5V5zCOPw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320177/Watch3_Three_UIs_ECG.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fDLB4N"&gt;Now, users in 31 more countries — mostly in Europe — should have access after Samsung was given the CE marking clearance for its Samsung Health Monitor app in the EU. That regulatory approval signals the software meets the health and safety standards required for distribution in the region. &lt;em&gt;SamMobile &lt;/em&gt;notes you’ll need the app downloaded and updated to the latest version on both a compatible Galaxy Watch and Samsung phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPFhQh"&gt;The full list of countries includes Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UAE, and the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Word is getting text predictions next month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-0xs5REMAS3-RrmuXalCAwJNYGY=/53x0:547x329/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68854311/1613999094_predictions_word_win32.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pU9IlG"&gt;Microsoft is planning to add text predictions to Word in March. The new feature will work similarly to Google Docs’ Smart Compose option, using machine learning to predict what words an author will need to speed up document creation. Microsoft originally announced a beta of text predictions last year, but &lt;a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-plans-to-roll-out-support-for-text-predictions-to-word-next-month/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neowin &lt;/em&gt;spotted&lt;/a&gt; it’s now on the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-gb%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Froadmap%3Ffilters%3D%26searchterms%3D80179" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft 365 roadmap&lt;/a&gt; to reach all Word users on Windows next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJ6C6R"&gt;Word will highlight grayed-out predictions when users are writing a document, and the suggestions can be accepted using the Tab key or rejected by hitting Escape. Text predictions can also be completely disabled by Word users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6hToLj5WUJocWMeng_ylLeiSwjw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320112/1613999094_predictions_word_win32.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Word text predictions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4M88Em"&gt;Microsoft also started rolling out identical text predictions in &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Froadmap%3Ffilters%3D%26searchterms%3D60340" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Outlook for Windows&lt;/a&gt; this month, allowing users to compose emails faster. These Gmail-like text predictions also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254298/microsoft-outlook-web-text-predictions-gmail-smart-compose-feature"&gt;rolled out to Outlook on the web&lt;/a&gt; last year, alongside a feature to let people schedule when emails would be sent.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon is a huge hit because it’s cooperative</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sLMDkFHI3Jef9hh1NCfDTG2zxl0=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68854286/akrales_160226_0960_0062_A.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Twenty-five years later, that’s still the case&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="H2CSpB"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; launched 25 years ago, it did so twice simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgouT2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Red &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Green&lt;/em&gt; (later made &lt;em&gt;Blue&lt;/em&gt; for its Western release) are almost identical, but each has a few exclusive monsters. The fire puppy Growlithe is only available in &lt;em&gt;Red&lt;/em&gt;, for example, while those searching for a Venus flytrap-like Bellsprout will need to pick up &lt;em&gt;Green&lt;/em&gt;. Players can also trade with a friend who has the opposing version. What began as a fairly cheap trick to encourage invested fans to purchase the game twice or to pressure their friends into picking it up, has since become a cornerstone of the entire &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; franchise: it’s meant to be shared.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anProH"&gt;Alongside trading, players could also set up battles between the pokémon they caught and trained in their games. These two features transformed the otherwise single-player roleplaying games in ways that would be constantly iterated on as the core games received sequel after sequel. But even before the release of the second set, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Gold &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Silver&lt;/em&gt;, spinoffs were increasingly focusing on multiplayer aspects. For example, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Stadium&lt;/em&gt;, released just two years after &lt;em&gt;Red &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Green&lt;/em&gt;, brought battles to the forefront. It allowed players to “rent” pokémon from an in-game library, letting friends fight friends without having to first catch and train them alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ReBxdd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Before long, the franchise was getting its hooks into an entire generation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SNLHyO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stadium &lt;/em&gt;also added a handful of competitive mini-games. Where battling and trading required some understanding of the franchise’s core mechanics, these applied cute and easily recognizable pokémon as a decorative skin for already familiar concepts. Players might have to race Rattata through obstacle courses or play quoit with Ekans, for instance. Released in the same year as &lt;em&gt;Mario Party,&lt;/em&gt; Nintendo was beginning to marry its existing properties with something approachable and family-focused, opening them up to much wider audiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYmf8w"&gt;Alongside this expansion into casual play came other forms of media, and before long, the franchise was getting its hooks into an entire generation. Kids would reenact the anime on the playground, reinforcing its themes of friendship and teamwork (and rivalry). The trading card game was necessarily communal, if in a way that got it &lt;a href="https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/article/A-Brief-History-of-Pokemon-Getting-Banned-from-Middle-Schools/c7a4cc37-0d7c-4348-a081-445493a7bf16/"&gt;banned from numerous schools&lt;/a&gt;. Spinoff games continued to cross genres, bringing in different kinds of fans, from the match-3 &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Puzzle League&lt;/em&gt; released in 2000 down to the upcoming MOBA &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;. A positive feedback loop had begun. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; was meant to be shared — and, increasingly, everyone was someone you could share it with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mvOCP-wyF6zWb-FJsI3MC-MLEBQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8899377/ddeahl_170722_1861_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dani Deahl / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BK0i7Q"&gt;No matter how much it became a global phenomenon, selling double copies of the core games remained a habit that Nintendo refused to shake. But though this may have begun as a relatively transparent cash grab, as technology improved, it became less important to buy both games or to recruit a friend to get the opposing version. (Having said that, every friendship group that I’ve been in when a new set is announced has had careful discussions about who would get which; it’s an ingrained behavior.) By the franchise’s 10th anniversary, purely online trading was possible. &lt;em&gt;Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pearl&lt;/em&gt; introduced the Global Trade Station, which allowed players to browse, search, and offer exchanges with strangers from across the world. They could also take part in battles, mini-games, and voice chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ko31T8"&gt;And while initially surely driven by a desire for profit, &lt;em&gt;Red &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Green&lt;/em&gt; had predicted (or perhaps hoped for) this kind of free and easy bartering. In-universe, it’s always been possible to upload your pokémon to a PC, and from there, send them all over the world. Nonplayable characters encourage trading as a cooperative, collaborative act. And as technology improved, Nintendo followed suit, making it increasingly easy to complete the pokédex or at least get the companions you like most. (Though its online efforts have not always run smoothly, and since 2018, it has also required a paid Nintendo Switch Online subscription.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xzfCr1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Pokémon Go’ sold collaboration as a core concept&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JIvvBh"&gt;Even once easy online trading was established, Nintendo continued to play with the formula. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; brought the Wonder Trade, allowing players to upload a random pokémon and receive one in return. Naturally, a lot of trades are bargain bin Pidgey and Bidoof, but there are always stories of exceptional generosity, with legendary pokémon, battle monsters with perfect stats, and specially colored shinies all making their way to an unsuspecting recipient. Community coordinated events have also seen experienced players releasing waves of pokémon holding expensive items on &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/the-pokemon-players-who-want-to-save-christmas-1673286147"&gt;Christmas Day&lt;/a&gt; to surprise kids playing for the first time. The latest entries, &lt;em&gt;Sword&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shield&lt;/em&gt;, introduced Max Raid pokémon, giant monsters that required cooperation with others to take down, and campsites that friends could visit to hang out in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4eBXi"&gt;And where Wonder Trade and Max Raid features leaned into the collaboration encouraged from the earliest days of the franchise, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; sold it as a core concept. Its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sj2iQyBTQs&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheOfficialPok%C3%A9monYouTubechannel"&gt;original announcement trailer&lt;/a&gt; showed families playing together, solo players meeting to trade, and huge group battles. Many of these features weren’t even in the game’s initial release or were so bare-bones as to be nonexistent — but it didn’t matter. &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/pokemon-go-review"&gt;Reviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/12/pokemon-go-review-it-may-not-be-a-good-game-but-its-a-great-experience"&gt; consistently&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/14/12183956/pokemon-go-review-ios-android-nintendo-niantic-company-mobile-game"&gt; agreed&lt;/a&gt;: the game wasn’t objectively especially good, but everyone was having a great time. The mechanics ended up being unnecessary for creating an astounding social experience. Before the pandemic, in-person festivals saw &lt;a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/gofest-dortmund-2019/?hl=en"&gt;tens&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/gofest-yokohama-2019/?hl=en"&gt;hundreds of thousands&lt;/a&gt; of players coming together to catch and trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6vd07"&gt;Over time, it became clear that this was not simply because &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; was a phenomenon among an entire generation. The &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; game &lt;em&gt;Wizards Unite&lt;/em&gt;, released three years later by the same developers, had the same if not more cultural weight. But it never took off. According to mobile analytics company &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pokemon-go-has-best-year-ever-in-2019-catching-nearly-900m-usd-in-player-spending"&gt;Sensor Tower&lt;/a&gt;, in 2019, it netted just $23 million, compared to &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;’s almost $900 million in the same year. In fact, this was an increase over &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;’s launch in 2016, indicating its longevity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEG1tf"&gt;The key thing that &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; has that &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t is two and a half decades of community building. &lt;em&gt;Harry Potte&lt;/em&gt;r certainly has a fandom, a group of the most dedicated enthusiasts, but the book and movie formats are solo activities. To engage with &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; is to share. From the trading enforced by &lt;em&gt;Red &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Green&lt;/em&gt; to the family-friendly mini-games of &lt;em&gt;Stadium&lt;/em&gt; to the swapping with strangers via Wonder Trade, it has consistently encouraged cooperation and bonding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VpmEvI"&gt;Twenty-five years later, that’s still what makes it a phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motional is now testing fully autonomous vehicles in Las Vegas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jfHnW-TOKaFrkLdDYKUm4-0ju0E=/0x1:1877x1252/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68854014/Motional1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Motional&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YF5vyI"&gt;Add Motional to the very short list of companies that have tested fully autonomous vehicles on public roads. The Hyundai-Aptiv joint venture announced that it has tested its vehicles without safety drivers behind the steering wheel on public streets in Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zndvDl"&gt;The tests, which took place in February, came less than three months after the company received the green light from the state of Nevada to test its vehicles without a human safety driver. “Multiple driverless vehicles” were tested, conducting maneuvers such as “navigating intersections, unprotected turns, and interactions with other road users, including pedestrians and cyclists,” the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dy93kU"&gt;Of course, there are some caveats. A Motional employee remained in the passenger seat during the tests, and was capable of stopping the vehicle if needed. (No interventions in vehicle operation by the passenger have been recorded yet, a Motional spokesperson said.) Motional is allowed to test anywhere in Las Vegas, but is keeping its vehicles in residential areas for now. And the company has only tested its vehicles during the daytime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lelUPz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Motional sought a safety evaluation from an independent third party&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j8vAcy"&gt;Motional is unique insofar as it sought a safety evaluation from an independent third party prior to conducting its fully autonomous testing. Germany’s &lt;a href="https://www.tuvsud.com/en-us"&gt;TÜV SÜD&lt;/a&gt; is a “world-leading independent technical service provider ... with extensive experience assessing driverless technology,” according to Motional. The firm was given access to the company’s proprietary systems, after which it endorsed Motional’s plan to operate with an empty driver’s seat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khqa53"&gt;Currently, only a small handful of AV operators have actually deployed fully driverless vehicles, also known as Level 4 autonomous vehicles, on public roads. Waymo, the self-driving unit of Alphabet, has been operating its Level 4 vehicles in the suburbs of Phoenix for several years now, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507814/waymo-driverless-cars-allow-more-customers-phoenix"&gt;recently began offering rides to paying customers&lt;/a&gt;. Cruise, a majority-owned subsidiary of General Motors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165597/cruise-driverless-test-san-francisco-self-driving-level-4"&gt;recently started operating Level 4 vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco. Yandex, the Russian tech giant, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51003224"&gt;tested its Level 4 vehicles in Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; during the Consumer Electronics Show in 2020. And Chinese tech firm Baidu started &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/fully-driverless-cars-are-being-tested-in-china-for-the-first-time.html"&gt;testing its vehicles without safety drivers&lt;/a&gt; in its home country late last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnSMyi"&gt;Motional as a joint venture was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hyundai-motor-autonomous-aptiv/hyundai-motor-group-aptiv-to-set-up-4-billion-self-driving-car-venture-idUSKBN1W80WP"&gt;first announced in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, when Hyundai said it would spend $1.6 billion to catch up to its rivals in the autonomous vehicle space. Aptiv, a self-driving technology company that is an offshoot of global auto parts supplier Delphi, owns 50 percent of the venture. The company currently tests its vehicles in Las Vegas, Singapore, and Seoul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDMqaU"&gt;Motional’s engineers were responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12637822/self-driving-taxi-first-public-trial-singapore-nutonomy"&gt;the world’s first robotaxi pilot in Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the first cross-country &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/driverless-car-road-trip-san-francisco-new-york-city/568939/"&gt;New York to San Francisco autonomous trip&lt;/a&gt;. Over the last two years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17718018/lyft-aptiv-self-driving-cars-las-vegas-5000-trips"&gt;Aptiv’s fleet of safety driver-monitored autonomous taxis in Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; (in partnership with Lyft) have completed over 100,000 trips. But the company’s Level 4 vehicles will be kept separate from its ride-hailing program with Lyft, so members of the public won’t be getting rides in fully driverless cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ns2eEO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is trying to counter misinformation about eating disorders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0UOzJXOxnONv10t6VOVQJlx8VRg=/0x16:781x537/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68854012/bOBEy_ag.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ctqnJX"&gt;TikTok is announcing today that it’s taking a couple small steps to try and help people who are affected by eating disorders. To do this, it’s partnering with the &lt;a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org"&gt;National Eating Disorder Association&lt;/a&gt; (or NEDA) to have an eating disorder awareness week, and implementing two new features that aim to provide resources and support to those who need it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="9Oz3Kb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10354938"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qzFf6W"&gt;If a user searches TikTok for terms like “proana” (short for “pro-anorexia”), or “eating disorder,” the app will now show support resources, along with NEDA’s phone number.  Currently, searching the terms only shows the support number, but the new interface will also provide users with advice on how to deal with an eating disorder. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8y6ulApq7xOOKmw9hVPalp7kwBs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22316431/Eating_Disorder_Search_experience.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instead of just allowing the user to contact NEDA, the pages will also contain a link to resources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ESD_E32CrSo74ajupEQqRX795aI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22316437/Resources___Tips___expanded.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tips aim to help those who are struggling with eating disorders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8BlZEO"&gt;The company also plans on putting a PSA on hashtag pages that could potentially contain triggering content, like the page for #WhatIEatInADay. The PSA will include a link to NEDA’s helpline, as well as a number users can text for crisis support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpyqQd"&gt;TikTok is facing the same problem as many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/21/2965449/instagram-self-harm-policy"&gt;other social media apps&lt;/a&gt;: how do you keep your users from posting or stumbling across potentially triggering and harmful content? TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/07/tiktok-investigating-videos-promoting-starvation-and-anorexia"&gt;has tried to deal with eating disorder content in the past&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/cameronwilson/tiktok-eating-disorder-videos-algorithm-for-you-page"&gt;users report that it still shows up&lt;/a&gt;. While today’s announcement doesn’t touch on actually moderating content, hopefully it can help make it easier for people who need help to get it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s Mate X2 foldable adopts Samsung’s dual-screen design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s1J-_p6smxsTD9tnRewI5aZrcjM=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68853932/image_178.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mate X2 has an 8-inch screen that folds inward.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Huawei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dVrUeQ"&gt;Huawei has announced the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fen%2Fphones%2Fmate-x2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F22%2F22294983%2Fhuawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mate X2&lt;/a&gt;, its first all-new foldable device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18238269/huawei-foldable-phone-mate-x-price-release-date-specs-mwc-2019"&gt;since 2019’s Mate X&lt;/a&gt;. The new phone has received a radical redesign compared to the original device, with a large screen that unfolds from the inside of the device rather than around the outside. For using the phone while folded, the Huawei Mate X2 has a second screen on its outside, similar to Samsung’s approach with the Galaxy Fold series. Images of the phone were leaked minutes ahead of its official announcement by &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/huawei-mate-x2-first-official-images-1613994247-1984855950"&gt;Evan Blass on &lt;em&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUTUPv"&gt;This being a Huawei device, the Mate X2 will launch without support for Google’s apps or services, which is likely to severely limit its appeal outside of China. According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fen%2Fphones%2Fmate-x2%2Fspecs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F22%2F22294983%2Fhuawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Huawei’s site&lt;/a&gt;, the phone will run on EMUI 11.0 based on Android 10. However, during its live stream, the company said it plans for the Mate X2 to be among the first phones to be updated to its own operating system, HarmonyOS, starting in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjKndz"&gt;The internal screen on the Mate X2 measures 8 inches with a resolution of 2480 x 2200, while the exterior screen is 6.45 inches with a 2700 x 1160 resolution. Both are OLED and have refresh rates of up to 90Hz. They’re also both slightly bigger than the 7.6-inch internal display and 6.2-inch external displays found on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;. Internally, the phone is powered by the company’s flagship Kirin 9000 chip, the processor that debuted in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21529915/huawei-mate-40-pro-hands-on"&gt;Mate 40 Pro&lt;/a&gt; last year. This is paired with 8GB of RAM and a battery with a rated capacity of 4,400mAh that can be fast-charged at up to 55W. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Yg-uODZq9hpnIhWL4-EpjdiE2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320067/msedge_6RvUDEI1g5.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Huawei&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mate X2 is available in four colors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GsHFfr"&gt;There are four cameras on the rear of the phone: a 50-megapixel wide-angle, a 16-megapixel ultrawide, a 12-megapixel telephoto with a 3x optical zoom, and an 8-megapixel “SuperZoom” camera with a 10x optical zoom. The selfie camera on the outside of the phone has a 16-megapixel resolution, and there doesn’t appear to be a selfie camera in or around the foldable inner screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMPOaj"&gt;The Mate X2 is technically the third phone in Huawei’s foldable lineup. Last year, it released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21145519/huawei-mate-xs-foldable-phone-news-features-quad-layer-screen-hinge-kirin-990-5g"&gt;Mate XS&lt;/a&gt;, an updated version of the original Mate X, which featured a more durable display and faster Kirin 990 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjsHSx"&gt;Huawei says the Mate X2 will be available in China with 256GB of internal storage for ¥17,999 (around $2,785) or for ¥18,999 (around $2,940) with 512GB of storage. Available colors include blue, pink, black, and white. It’ll be available to buy in China on February 25th, but it’s unclear when the phone could be released outside the country.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse promises fix after audio insecurely streamed from third-party website</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Clubhouse Photo Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t4B3hDBTRRvI6W1lV5yZ-3omvoc=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68853840/1231318832.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4GrvUE"&gt;Clubhouse has confirmed one of its users was able to siphon off audio feeds from the invitation-only app and make them accessible from a third-party website, raising security concerns about the fledgling service. A Clubhouse spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-22/clubhouse-chats-are-breached-raising-concerns-over-security?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “multiple rooms” were affected, and that the user behind the breach had been “permanently banned.” It said “safeguards” have been put in place to prevent a repeat, though it reportedly declined to provide specific details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVtye6"&gt;The incident is a reminder for Clubhouse users to be careful about sharing sensitive information in conversations held via the invite-only iOS app. This is especially important for any Chinese citizens or dissidents using the app, or any users concerned about state surveillance. Although Clubhouse is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/08/bingeing-free-expression-popularity-of-clubhouse-app-soars-in-china"&gt;blocked in China&lt;/a&gt;, users are reportedly still able to access the service via VPNs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oAW8lu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A reminder to be careful sharing sensitive information in the app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S8ELEM"&gt;This latest security incident comes a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/14/22282772/clubhouse-improve-security-stanford-researchers-china-security"&gt;Clubhouse was criticized&lt;/a&gt; for vulnerabilities in its infrastructure. A &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stanfordio/status/1360423156356325377"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the Stanford Internet Observatory found that users’ unique Clubhouse ID numbers and chatroom IDs were &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stanfordio/status/1360423163125919749"&gt;transmitted in plaintext&lt;/a&gt;, which could theoretically allow an outside observer to work out &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stanfordio/status/1360423164338008067"&gt;who’s talking to who on the app&lt;/a&gt;. Clubhouse also uses Shanghai-based Agora Inc, for its back-end infrastructure. As a Chinese company, Agora has a legal obligation to assist Chinese authorities in locating the source of audio if it’s deemed to pose a national security risk, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stanfordio/status/1360423165113946112"&gt;the SIO said.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toimK4"&gt;In response to last week’s report, Clubhouse said it plans to add additional encryption and blocks to prevent the service from pinging servers based in China, and that it would be hiring an external security firm to review the updates. Agora told the SIO that it only stores user audio or metadata when required for billing and network monitoring purposes. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Agora said it “does not have access to, share, or store personally identifiable end-user data,” and that it does not route “voice or video traffic from non-China based users” through China.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp explains what happens if you don’t accept its new privacy policy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m89s92mr5n0IM3v3lkXNpcVlhc8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68853691/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="weCQb4"&gt;WhatsApp has detailed what will happen to users who don’t accept its new privacy policy in an &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-happens-when-our-terms-and-privacy-policy-updates-take-effect/?lang=en"&gt;FAQ on its website&lt;/a&gt;. Starting May 15th, its functionality will become more limited, and users will no longer be able to send or read messages from the app. They’ll still be able to receive calls and notifications, but this will only be possible for a “short time.” &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/whatsapp-details-what-will-happen-to-users-who-dont-agree-to-privacy-changes/"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company confirmed this period will last a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Eg9fy"&gt;The new privacy policy has been controversial among some users, who worry that it allows WhatsApp to share their private messages with its parent company Facebook. However, messages between individuals on WhatsApp are end-to-end encrypted, so only their recipients can see their contents. What the new privacy policy relates to is messages sent to businesses, which may be stored on Facebook servers and whose data may be used for advertising. WhatsApp has shared some personal information, like phone numbers, with Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12638698/whatsapp-to-start-sharing-user-data-with-facebook"&gt;since 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PCccXu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’ll be able to receive calls, but not much else&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="52H7w0"&gt;In response to the outcry, WhatsApp announced it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;delay the introduction&lt;/a&gt; of the new privacy policy, which was originally due to go into effect on February 8th. Last week, WhatsApp outlined how it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289595/whatsapp-privacy-policy-app-banner-explanation-telegram"&gt;explaining the new privacy policy to its users&lt;/a&gt;, in an effort that includes a banner inside the app with its explanation of the new policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxqQE7"&gt;The Facebook-owned messaging service says that it won’t delete any accounts that haven’t accepted the new terms on May 15th, and that users will still be able to accept the new privacy policy after that date. However, it cautions that it &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/about-inactive-account-deletion"&gt;generally deletes accounts&lt;/a&gt; after they’re inactive for 120 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPVdx4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtV08j"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dozens of Boeing 777 planes grounded in US and Japan after engine failure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z8NTe4cVQ8w0cWsFAXSKhJcsjEc=/0x0:1758x1172/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68852937/plane2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PwZgKP"&gt;Airlines in Japan and the US have grounded dozens of Boeing 777 aircraft after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/20/22293208/united-airlines-ua328-denver-engine-failure"&gt;dramatic engine failure&lt;/a&gt; that United Airlines flight 328 experienced over Denver this weekend. According to the National Transportation Safety Board’s &lt;a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/MR20210221.aspx"&gt;ongoing investigation&lt;/a&gt;, two fan blades on the plane’s number 2 engine had developed fractures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMFgRb"&gt;The Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency airworthiness directive that requires “immediate or stepped-up inspections of Boeing 777 airplanes equipped with certain Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney PW4000 engines.” The administration noted that this was likely to result in aircraft being removed from service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9PFrDt"&gt;Boeing has also told airlines to stop flying planes equipped with the engine, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/faa-orders-immediate-inspections-after-united-engine-failure-11613952428"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5j5g3z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Flight 328 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/united?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@united&lt;/a&gt; engine caught fire. my parents are on this flight    everyone’s okay though! &lt;a href="https://t.co/cBt82nIkqb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cBt82nIkqb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— michaela  (@michaelagiulia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/michaelagiulia/status/1363241125495136267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uS3WaO"&gt;“We reviewed all available safety data following yesterday’s incident,” FAA administrator Steve Dickson said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FAANews/status/1363631972682248192"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Based on the initial information, we concluded that the inspection interval should be stepped up for the hollow fan blades that are unique to this model of engine, used solely on Boeing 777 airplanes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i48VBu"&gt;United Airlines &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/united/status/1363644485423497223"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it’s voluntarily grounding 24 Boeing 777 aircraft that use the 4000-series Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney engines and expects “only a small number of customers to be inconvenienced.” Japan’s Civil Aviation Bureau ordered Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways to remove their aircraft with the same engines from service; JAL operates 14 and ANA has 19, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/feb/22/boeing-777-grounded-by-airlines-after-faa-japan-issues-emergency-order"&gt;according to Reuters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YR2Lbu"&gt;No-one was injured on United flight 328, which was bound for Honolulu but safely returned to Denver after encountering the engine failure shortly after takeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0YvrN2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, February 22nd, 12:00AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added mention of &lt;/em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;em&gt;’s report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d7rqhX"&gt;You would &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; the entire world would know how the Zoom world works by now. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/2/9/22274865/zoom-hearing-cat-filter-lawyer-texas-live-court-hearing"&gt;Lawyers can be cats&lt;/a&gt;, congressmen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276998/tom-emmer-coronavirus-relief-lawyer-cat-house-financial-services"&gt;are sometimes inverted&lt;/a&gt;, but pants are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; actually &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/reporter-no-pants-good-morning-america-gma-abc-coronavrius-quarantine_n_5ea84676c5b6c3fed182cebb"&gt;optional&lt;/a&gt;. That didn’t keep the Oakley Union Elementary School District’s board of trustees from badmouthing parents during a &lt;em&gt;public &lt;/em&gt;WebEx call — suggesting that parents just “want their babysitters back,” or want to go back to ingesting marijuana (via &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/entire-california-school-board-resigns-after-chewing-ou-1846316976?rev=1613862062331&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Gizmodo&amp;amp;utm_content&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;amp;utm_source=facebook"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D6MUy1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;3) School Board Trustee Richie Masadas then appeared to link parents' frustration over close closures to drug use. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"My brother had a delivery service for medical marijuana and his clientele were parents of kids at school."&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nbcbayarea?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@nbcbayarea&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/vgAhY90lmG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/vgAhY90lmG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Bigad Shaban (@BigadShaban) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BigadShaban/status/1362547405212831753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3OCjjR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3XaJHU7QlY"&gt;The full 8-minute video&lt;/a&gt; below isn’t quite as incendiary as the play-by-play makes it sound. It seems likely the board was just airing some general frustrations, unaware they were being watched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQsZOZ"&gt;One member did ask “Are we alone?” before telling the board how she felt about criticism from parents: “Bitch, if you’re going to call me out, I’m going to fuck you up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jt1MM7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C3XaJHU7QlY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fB9YlJ"&gt;Narrator: they weren’t alone. They were being recorded, it went viral, over 7,000 people &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/registrar-of-voters-contra-costa-county-recall-oakley-union-elementary-school-district-board/u/28581187"&gt;signed a petition&lt;/a&gt; asking them to resign, and that’s exactly what they did. Every single member has now resigned, according to &lt;a href="https://ouesd-ca.schoolloop.com/file/1500178971291/1563866277263/6727833713582977629.pdf"&gt;a letter from superintendent Greg Hetrick (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; — who was part of the call, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
