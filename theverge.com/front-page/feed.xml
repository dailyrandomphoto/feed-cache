    <title>Democrats unveil bill to ban online ‘surveillance advertising’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Hearing Held On Protecting Scientific Integrity In Coronavirus Response" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wrhonqg8wd857w3gbTkSNvO9R3M=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70405137/1212981411.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VJ7lpW"&gt;On Tuesday, Democrats introduced a new bill that would ban nearly all use of digital advertising targeting on ad markets hosted by platforms like Facebook, Google, and other data brokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGm3Z2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23177323/Banning_Surveillance_Advertising_Act.pdf"&gt;The Banning Surveillance Advertising Act&lt;/a&gt; – sponsored by Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) – prohibits digital advertisers from targeting any ads to users. It makes some small exceptions, like allowing for “broad” location-based targeting. Contextual advertising, like ads that are specifically matched to online content, would be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Aq1Mv"&gt;“The ‘surveillance advertising’ business model is premised on the unseemly collection and hoarding of personal data to enable ad targeting,” Eshoo, the bill’s lead sponsor, said in a Tuesday statement. “This pernicious practice allows online platforms to chase user engagement at great cost to our society, and it fuels disinformation, discrimination, voter suppression, privacy abuses, and so many other harms. The surveillance advertising business model is broken.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S3rGSP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The surveillance advertising business model is broken”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1tmAs"&gt;If enacted, the bill would radically change Facebook and Google’s business models. For years, lawmakers have debated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;ways to regulate the tech industry&lt;/a&gt; on issues like privacy, disinformation, and content moderation. Eshoo and her co-sponsors argue that the tech industry’s current advertising models incentivize the spread of harmful content and encourage them to amplify damaging posts to keep users on their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIJSnH"&gt;The bill empowers the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general with the authority to enforce the new rules for ad targeting. It also allows individual users to sue platforms like Facebook and Google if they break the law, granting up to $5,000 in relief per violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SnQmyf"&gt;“Surveillance advertising is a predatory and invasive practice,” Sen. Booker said in a statement on Tuesday. “The hoarding of people’s personal data not only abuses privacy, but also drives the spread of misinformation, domestic extremism, racial division, and violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dviilJ"&gt;Since Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testified before Congress last year, lawmakers have put out a number of new bills to regulate social media algorithms to address the spread of harmful content. Last October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726290/malicious-algorithms-section-230-bill-eshoo-pallone-doyle-schakowsky-facebook-whistleblower"&gt;House Democrats unveiled a measure&lt;/a&gt; that would strip away a platform’s Section 230 liability protections if their algorithms were found to have recommended harmful content to users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ca0ej6"&gt;At Haugen’s first Senate hearing, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"&gt;the leaks confirm&lt;/a&gt; “that Facebook routinely puts profits ahead of kids’ online safety.” He continued, “we know it chooses the growth of its products over the well-being of our children.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube will stop making most original shows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jMj6GYhMIMN3oP8RTpPjNJAfNj8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70405082/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8sHbJe"&gt;YouTube will scale back a significant portion of YouTube Originals, which produced original content including scripted series, educational videos, and music and celebrity programming. Chief business officer for YouTube Robert Kyncl announced the changes today in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rkyncl/status/1483502275804872704"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sc50hg"&gt;Going forward, the company will only fund originals in the YouTube Kids Fund and the Black Voices Fund, a program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288066/youtube-black-creator-amplify-fund-initiative-ceo"&gt;created in 2020&lt;/a&gt; that committed $100 million to “amplify” Black creators on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZEM8e"&gt;“With rapid growth comes new opportunities and now our investments can make a greater impact on even more creators when applied towards other initiatives, like our Creator Shorts Fund, Black Voices Fund, and Live Shopping programming to name a few,” the statement reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RD7Xdb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Over six years, YouTube made few titles that looked like breakout hits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EKtGYt"&gt;YouTube Originals has changed approaches throughout the years. Created in 2016 and led by Susanne Daniels, it began with scripted shows and movies focused on creators, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/3/10905654/youtube-red-originals-premiere-date-scare-pewdiepie"&gt;comedy-thriller series &lt;em&gt;Scare PewDiePie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/22/15855570/youtube-red-originals-250-million-views"&gt;YouTube said&lt;/a&gt; the subscriber-only first season of originals racked up 250 million views. The company began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/29/18116154/youtube-premium-free-ads-subscription-red"&gt;pivoting&lt;/a&gt; toward ad-supported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/4/15552204/youtube-original-tv-shows-kevin-hart-ellen-degeneres"&gt;content featuring celebrities&lt;/a&gt; like Katy Perry and Kevin Hart, free for users to access without a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EL2Ecm"&gt;But over six years, YouTube made few titles that looked like breakout hits. And by the end, it was unclear what the original programming provided strategically to a service that’s already one of the most popular video destinations in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyiSgW"&gt;Today’s statement also announced Daniels will depart the company in March, which also contributed to the decision to scale back the division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IR8TK9"&gt;New original programs were being announced as recently as last year, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419244/youtube-will-smith-alicia-keys-new-originals"&gt;series featuring&lt;/a&gt; Will Smith and Alicia Keys. YouTube says it will honor existing commitments for shows in progress and will contact creators in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3z2W38"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDReOk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla owner is the first to face felony charges for deadly Autopilot crash</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F8weZ8ndkC8rz5_VnK1zwbYU38Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70405072/tesla_model_y_3543.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wFp41e"&gt;California prosecutors filed two felony charges against the owner of Tesla Model S for a deadly crash in 2019 that involved the vehicle’s Autopilot system, marking the first time that a Tesla owner has been criminally charged in the US in a case involving the automaker’s advanced driver assist system. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-only-on-ap-california-united-states-91b4a0341e07244f3f03051b5c2462ae"&gt;The charges were first reported by the &lt;em&gt;AP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5VbQx"&gt;According to the LA County District Attorney, the incident took place in Gardena, a suburb of LA, on December 29, 2019. Kevin George Aziz Riad, 27, was exiting a highway in his black Model S when he ran through a red light, slamming into a Honda Civic and killing two people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMblfk"&gt;Riad, a limousine service driver, will now face two charges of vehicular manslaughter, according to charges filed with the California Superior Court. He is currently free on bail while the case is pending, according to the AP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6C37Yc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Autopilot has come under increased scrutiny from federal regulators&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xkmofu"&gt;Autopilot, which can control steering and braking functions as well as perform automatic lane changes while on certain highways, has come under increased scrutiny from federal regulators. Last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into over a dozen incidents involving Tesla vehicles using Autopilot that have crashed into stationary emergency vehicles. Autopilot has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20849499/tesla-autopilot-crash-culver-city-2018-ntsb-report"&gt;contributed to a number of fatal crashes&lt;/a&gt; in the past, and the families of deceased drivers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750715/tesla-autopilot-crash-lawsuit-wrongful-death"&gt;have sued Tesla&lt;/a&gt; for wrongful death.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORVgoq"&gt;Tesla warns that drivers need to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel at all times, though the automaker has declined to include a more robust driver-monitoring system (like infrared eye tracking, for example) to ensure its customers are following safety protocols. Autopilot is considered a Level 2 “partially automated” system by the Society of Automotive Engineers’ standards, which requires that drivers keep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcsqqC"&gt;Some Tesla drivers have been caught misusing Autopilot, and some have even publicized the results themselves. Drivers have been found sleeping in the passenger seat or backseat of their vehicles while speeding down a crowded highway. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445168/tesla-driver-sleeping-police-charged-canada-autopilot"&gt;Canadian man was charged with reckless driving&lt;/a&gt; after being pulled over for sleeping while traveling at speeds of 93mph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SclivX"&gt;The criminal charges document does not mention Autopilot. But NHTSA, which dispatched a team to investigate the crash in 2019, confirmed that the driver assist feature was active at the time of the incident. The agency plans on publishing its findings from the investigation soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zb3wkt"&gt;“NHTSA reminds the public that no commercially available motor vehicle today can drive itself,” a spokesperson said. “Whether a L2 automated driving system is engaged or not, every available vehicle requires the human driver to be in control at all times, and all State laws hold the human driver responsible for the operation of their vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T and Verizon are limiting C-band 5G expansion around airports even more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-AVIATION-TELECOMMUNICATION" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T4iAQgSV6HjP97Cu82K0kGdmOqU=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70404653/1237809011.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;AT&amp;amp;T says airlines “have not utilized the two years they’ve had to responsibly plan for this deployment.” | Photo by STEFANI REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4xeFnP"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have announced that they will push back plans to activate some 5G towers around airports after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;airline operators warned&lt;/a&gt; that the deployment could cause “catastrophic disruption” to travel and shipping. While both carriers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/8/22873765/faa-verizon-att-airport-5g-carriers-buffer-zone"&gt;have an agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt; to create buffer zones around 50 airports, AT&amp;amp;T has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s halting the rollout of even more towers than originally planned, and that the decision applies to a “limited number of towers around certain airport runways.” Verizon responded to an email asking if it was planning on doing more than the agreement requires with &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-goes-ultra-wednesday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; that says it’s “voluntarily decided to limit our 5G network around airports.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVXv6n"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is clearly unhappy with the situation. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; it said that it will “continue to work with the aviation industry and the FAA to provide further information about our 5G deployment, since they have not utilized the two years they’ve had to responsibly plan for this deployment.” The statement also said that the company is “frustrated by the FAA’s inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services, and we urge it do so in a timely manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8wKv8"&gt;Verizon expressed similar frustration, saying: “The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and our nation’s airlines have not been able to fully resolve navigating 5G around airports, despite it being safe and fully operational in more than 40 other countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="r2GsBH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Airlines claim that C-Band 5G could disrupt sensitive equipment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e6kKSH"&gt;Both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have clashed with airline operators, who claim that their new C-Band 5G towers could disrupt sensitive equipment, making it difficult to land in low-visibility conditions. We have a great explainer that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;breaks down the whole situation&lt;/a&gt;, but the TL;DR is that this is just the latest in a series of delays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kgCgnx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are feuding with the US government over a last-minute delay to 5G","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="V5HccX"&gt;In an attempt to finally get the rollout started, AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/8/22873765/faa-verizon-att-airport-5g-carriers-buffer-zone"&gt;made an agreement with the FAA&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, which would allow them to activate their towers on January 19th, except for in select areas around 50 airports. On Monday, however, several airlines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;reportedly signed a letter sent to government officials&lt;/a&gt;, again warning about the rollout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7V5CS"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, United Airlines said on Monday that the 5G expansion would “result in not only hundreds of thousands of flight cancellations and disruptions for customers across the industry in 2022, but also the suspension of cargo flights into these locations, causing a negative ripple-effect on an already fragile supply chain.” The airline also said that it “implore[s] the Biden administration to act quickly and apply the same common sense solutions here that have clearly worked so well around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NM6nDi"&gt;For his part, President Biden thanked the carriers “for agreeing to delay 5G deployment around key airports and to continue working with the Department of Transportation on safe 5G deployment at this limited set of locations” in &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/18/statement-by-president-biden-on-5g-agreement/"&gt;a statement on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. He said that his team “has been engaging non-stop with the wireless carriers, airlines, and aviation equipment manufacturers to chart a path forward for 5G deployment and aviation to safely co-exist,” and that work would continue until they found “a permanent, workable solution around these key airports.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLhcJG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 18th, 2:53PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add statement from President Biden.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ux39cX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 18th, 2:22PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that Verizon has also stated that it’ll be limiting rollout around airports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moon Knight’s English accent is its first villain</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6vthh4l2yJiUdJaCjv9Ry6zgrIw=/194x0:1970x1184/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70404970/Screen_Shot_2022_01_18_at_1.51.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GAH7me"&gt;As you watch the first trailer for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/23/20830548/she-hulk-moon-knight-disney-plus-streaming-kevin-feige-marvel-cinematic-universe"&gt;Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Moon Knight &lt;/em&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, a few things quickly become clear about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457292/oscar-isaac-moon-knight-disney-plus-casting-marvel"&gt;Oscar Isaac’s take on the titular hero&lt;/a&gt;. The first: like his comics counterpart, this Moon Knight will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/25/14385948/split-movie-m-night-shyamalan-james-mcavoy-horror-psycho-hitchcock"&gt;grapple with having multiple personalities&lt;/a&gt;. The second: one of those personalities is meant to be believably British, despite his having one of the most ludicrous British accents recently captured on camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUO63V"&gt;In Marvel’s comics, Moon Knight — created by Doug Moench and Don Perlin — is both a codename and one of the alternate personalities coexisting within Marc Spector, a former Marine turned mercenary who appears to gain otherworldly abilities after dying and seemingly being resurrected by an Egyptian moon deity known as Khonshu. Though the specific details of Marc’s mental health and how it factors into his life as a costumed hero have shifted over the years, many &lt;em&gt;Moon Knight&lt;/em&gt; stories, including the new show, have revolved around the complications that arise when Marc’s other alters begin to surface and assert dominance over their shared existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwllWw"&gt;After alluding to the issues that Isaac’s character has been having with sleeping, the &lt;em&gt;Moon Knight &lt;/em&gt;trailer makes sure to highlight how he takes one of London’s iconic, red double-decker buses to work and that he very much prefers to be called “Steven” by his colleagues at the British Museum. It all &lt;em&gt;almost &lt;/em&gt;works, even as the trailer smoothly shifts into &lt;em&gt;Moon Knight&lt;/em&gt;’s more supernatural elements, but the Marvel magic of it all never manages to come together because of how gobsmackingly &lt;em&gt;weird &lt;/em&gt;Isaac’s choice of accent is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MGv1f3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Steven” has somehow built a life where actual British people believe he’s one of them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XSrH0z"&gt;What’s strange about the way that the &lt;em&gt;Moon Knight &lt;/em&gt;trailer alludes to Steven and Marc being the same person is the implication that “Steven” has somehow managed to build a life in Britain where actual British people believe he’s one of them, despite his sounding as if he’d wandered off the stage of a &lt;em&gt;Pygmalion &lt;/em&gt;revival. The offness of Steven’s English accent is likely meant to be an unsubtle hint at the fractured nature of Marc Spector’s mind, but Marvel’s history with iffy accents makes it so that those kinds of details are easy to interpret as straight-up bad decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JmB8cx"&gt;In the years after Wanda Maximoff first hexed her way onto the Avengers in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/22/8464479/avengers-age-of-ultron-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with her Sokovian accent fully intact, the vaguely Eastern European lilt in her voice faded much in the same way that she gradually became a redhead. Though those choices initially felt somewhat inexplicable and arbitrary, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22233625/wandavision-marvel-avengers-mcu-disney-plus-episode-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;partially retconned them to have much more emotional significance than they appeared to, and &lt;em&gt;Moon Knight &lt;/em&gt;could very well do something similar with Steven / Marc. What might also be the case, though, is that &lt;em&gt;Moon Knight &lt;/em&gt;is about to join &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange &lt;/em&gt;in the pantheon of MCU projects that should have just stuck with their leads’ actual speaking voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYg81T"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moon Knight &lt;/em&gt;hits Disney Plus on March 30th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>God of War for PC just got its first discount</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vn3IXOolOj0PI3VraU-aEOFw4RQ=/197x0:1366x779/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70404919/God_of_War.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XcY4gr"&gt;The PlayStation epic &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; was released to PC a mere four days ago but is &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGodOfWarPC011822&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fsteam-god-of-war-pc-steam-key-global%2Fgames-federation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently discounted to just $37.76 at Eneba&lt;/a&gt;, an excellent break on the regular $49.99 price tag. This amazing reboot of the classic Sony franchise brings back Kratos in his role as the iconic God of War in a sweeping narrative bedded in the lore of Norse mythology. The RPG-inspired gameplay is made even stronger with the help of an amazing story that adds some much-needed depth to the otherwise one-dimensional diety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mRVluj"&gt;It may not share the same specs as the vaunted G15, but the Asus Zephyrus G14 remains a solid option for anyone in the market for a gaming-focused, 14-inch ultrabook. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf8cMzdkvIY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Currently, the G14 is discounted to $1,299.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and while this isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen for this laptop, it is still a solid value for a laptop that normally retails for $1,549.99.

Besides the Ryzen CPU, the G14 also comes equipped with a 1TB SSD, 16GB of RAM, and an RTX 3060 graphics card. The 14-inch display might feel a bit crowded but features excellent fidelity with a 1440p resolution and 120Hz refresh rate.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PdzOjp"&gt;With the rise of the Omicron variant, we’ve been urged to use COVID-19 rapid antigen tests to make sure that we don’t spread the virus to friends and family. However, it’s been very difficult to follow that suggestion, what with long lines at COVID testing stations and high prices for home kits — when you can find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euZO1K"&gt;To try to alleviate this situation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889571/free-covid-19-tests-usps-website"&gt;the US federal government has created a website&lt;/a&gt; where you can order four free rapid test kits per month per household. While the site was scheduled to officially open Wednesday, January 19th, it started taking names and addresses a day early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRPiGo"&gt;It’s extremely simple to put in your order. You will not need to submit a credit card or any other financial information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HeKtVl"&gt;Go to &lt;a href="http://covidtests.gov/"&gt;COVIDTests.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KSN8FP"&gt;Tap on the button reading “Order Free At-Home Tests.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1XuoG7"&gt;If you don’t see the button for any reason, you can go directly to the USPS site (which is where the button would send you anyway) at &lt;a href="https://special.usps.com/testkits"&gt;special.usps.com/testkits&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DLzP1J"&gt;Fill in your name, email address (if you want to receive notifications), and shipping address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="egN7Sd"&gt;Click on the green “Check Out Now” button — and you’re done!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The USPS form for ordering free rapid tests is very simple." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vWK2i6OSwH_RhFwxKvSiPp2A0Gs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23177189/Screen_Shot_2022_01_18_at_1.34.45_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USPS form for ordering free rapid tests is very simple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MNKDCC"&gt;So far, we haven’t had any reports of problems with the site itself although (as can be imagined), it’s highly popular. (According to the site &lt;a href="http://analytics.usa.gov"&gt;analytics.usa.gov&lt;/a&gt;, as of 2pm on Tuesday, January 18th, over 700,000 people had already visited the website.) There will also be a call line for those who cannot access the website for any reason, but as of this writing, the number hadn’t been announced yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQEAia"&gt;The kits are supposed to ship within 7-12 days, starting in late January. Until then, as far as rapid tests are concerned, we’re still on our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQTbBP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: &lt;/strong&gt;Some apartment dwellers are reporting problems with putting in an order if somebody else in their building already did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BLXfsZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Houston, we have a problem!  People at same street address but different apartment numbers are being refused free COVID test kits at &lt;a href="https://t.co/Rm7vj6zgKS"&gt;https://t.co/Rm7vj6zgKS&lt;/a&gt; if another apartment dweller ordered first.  This happened to me and I’m not the only one. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/USPS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#USPS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CovidTesting?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CovidTesting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZllXT7m6jq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZllXT7m6jq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nicky Sundt (@NickySundt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NickySundt/status/1483521702315405315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KBv29U"&gt;There have been a number of solutions suggested if this happens to you, including putting your apartment number on the same line as your street address, putting your apartment number on the second address line, or using a word (such as “suite” or “apartment”) rather than a hash sign. None of these have been verified; we’ll let you know if we hear anything further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gid8Jy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 18th, 2:45PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add info about possible issues with ordering from an apartment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Activision acquisition would instantly make it a force in mobile gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activision Blizzard Acquires Candy Crush Saga Maker King Digital Entertainment For $5.9 Billion" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xWVpKu22UDeA_Ezpe84nXzFj4lA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70404825/495476474.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ufd0Ii"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;its pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft could soon add the likes of &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; to its lineup of big-name franchises, which already includes everything from &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt;. That’s sure to move more Xbox consoles and bring more subscribers into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22406059/xbox-game-pass-subscribers-25-million-microsoft-activision"&gt;the increasingly tempting Game Pass ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;. But there’s another, less obvious, part of the deal that could be just as important: it instantly gives Microsoft a huge audience in the mobile space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mzgvox"&gt;The biggest video games in the world are largely found on smartphones, and for the last few years, major publishers have been spending lots of money to get into the space. Just this month, Take-Two — the company behind the likes of &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt; — spent nearly $13 billion to acquire &lt;em&gt;FarmVille&lt;/em&gt; developer Zynga. Before that, EA scooped up the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273187/ea-glu-mobile-acquisition-kim-kardashian-hollywood"&gt;Glu Mobile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547324/ea-golf-clash-playdemic-acquisition-warner-brothers-games-mobile"&gt;Playdemic&lt;/a&gt; for smaller, but still massive, sums. Years earlier, when Activision Blizzard wanted to get a leg up in mobile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/2/9662214/actvision-blizzard-buys-candy-crush-king-5-9-billion"&gt;it spent $5.9 billion on &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; creator King&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pdn8rC"&gt;Provided the Microsoft acquisition goes through — the deal isn’t expected to close until “fiscal year 2023,” and a lot could happen in that time — &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; would become yet another integral piece of the company’s portfolio. And the franchise has proven to be an enduring hit. Analyst firm Sensor Tower estimates that, since January 2014, &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush Saga&lt;/em&gt; has generated around $7.1 billion, while its spinoff &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush Soda Saga&lt;/em&gt; has taken in $2.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x8vIYD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft has largely struggled in the space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XA4jLm"&gt;Since the King acquisition, mobile has become an increasingly important part of Activision’s portfolio; &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, created in partnership with Tencent, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22367089/tencent-timi-studios-call-of-duty-mobile-10-billion-2020"&gt;is a massive game&lt;/a&gt;, and Blizzard is also planning to launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22180377/diablo-immortal-iphone-android-technical-alpha-preview"&gt;a smartphone version of &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/static-files/d2672611-fbed-4ad8-8b4c-4d529d4d2668"&gt;its most recent quarterly earnings statement&lt;/a&gt;, Activision revealed that King was its highest-grossing division, raking in $652 million in net revenue during the third quarter of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9ALEN"&gt;Microsoft, meanwhile, has largely struggled in the space. &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; remains a big hit — that same Sensor Tower report estimates that the mobile version has been downloaded more than 237 million times on both iOS and Android since January 2014 — and is one of the few premium mobile games to reach a massive audience. Elsewhere, though, Microsoft’s efforts haven’t had the same impact. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215253/minecraft-earth-closing-down-june-2021-microsoft"&gt;Last year Microsoft shut down &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a real-world game similar to &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, and earlier this month, it announced &lt;a href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/4414396291731-Forza-Street-Developer-Blog-Update-January-10th-2022"&gt;plans to close smartphone racer &lt;em&gt;Forza Street&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Outside of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, Microsoft’s most notable mobile game at the moment is probably &lt;em&gt;Fallout Shelter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;which came with its acquisition of Bethesda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwd0AK"&gt;For the most part, it seems, Microsoft’s efforts in mobile have been focused on making it possible to play Xbox games on your phone through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554267/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-pass-ios-iphone-ipad-pc"&gt;xCloud&lt;/a&gt;. But with the addition of King, it now has a big opportunity to expand when it comes to smartphone-native experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jtw1iP"&gt;Mobile might not be as flashy as a new next-gen blockbuster, but it’s a necessary part of the modern gaming landscape. Companies across all of entertainment, whether it’s Netflix or Disney or Microsoft, are acquiring intellectual property and then attempting to leverage them across as many platforms as possible. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;Netflix is buying game studios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22763818/netflix-league-of-legends-arcane-review"&gt;while &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Riot Games is launching TV shows&lt;/a&gt;. Given how pervasive smartphones are, mobile gaming has naturally become a key cog in this — and a lucrative one. There’s a reason &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; has two different mobile spinoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfzpUa"&gt;Given all of the popular franchises that Microsoft now owns, and the many more that will join them if the Activision deal goes through, it only makes sense that the company is looking to solidify its efforts on mobile. And the easiest way to do that is by utilizing proven talent like King. That doesn’t mean you’ll see spartans showing up &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; any time soon — but it’s likely that Master Chief will be on your phone in some form in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best laptop you can buy in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best laptops for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="iKoE9g"&gt;The best laptop of 2021 can come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Here, we’ve got the rest of the best laptops, Windows 10 business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, laptops for school, and 2-in-1 convertibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfv5g0"&gt;Our current pick for the best laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptop of 2021 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2021 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Spectre x360 14. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below or our roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re looking for a powerful machine that doesn’t sacrifice portability.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qIDMjX"&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYCzY0"&gt;Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDDWFN"&gt;But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACwNY3"&gt;And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZkaRR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8eGPnz"&gt;Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjPO8F"&gt;Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Pro is an excellent laptop for video editing and intensive work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ip0i0W"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QRlaQ5"&gt;The best creator laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LyoNCb"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the most powerful laptop Apple has ever made. If you’re willing to pay the price (and it’s a steep price), you’ll almost certainly be satisfied with what this machine can do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svZAry"&gt;In our benchmarks, which test a variety of creative tasks including encoding, playback, and export time, the MacBook Pro 16 did better than any laptop we’ve ever used — the only other machines that have come close to matching this thing in some of our benchmarks are high-end desktop PCs. The battery life is also record-shattering. The 16-inch configuration with the M1 Pro processor lasted 16 hours in my testing — making it the longest-lasting laptop we’ve ever reviewed. (The M1 Max configuration doesn’t last quite as long, but still got us through a work day.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imgWnf"&gt;Elsewhere, we have basically no complaints about the newest MacBook Pro. It has a gorgeous display that can reach 1,000 nits when playing HDR content. It pairs that with the best set of speakers we’ve ever heard from a laptop. If you’re looking for a machine that can accommodate a demanding workload while also serving as an excellent multimedia device when you’re off the clock, the MacBook Pro 16 is the best device for you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 14-inch MacBook Pro is another great creator laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Wh6FfM"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;MacBook Pro (14-inch, 2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7399sH"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="u8MTQ2"&gt;If you’re a creative professional who doesn’t quite want to pay the price of the MacBook Pro 16, or you’re looking for something more compact, you’re probably better suited to the 14-inch MacBook Pro. This device is thinner, lighter, and less expensive than its 16-inch counterpart, but it comes with the same monstrous processor options and the same stellar screen, albeit at a smaller size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3aJPr"&gt;We didn’t see much of a difference in benchmark scores between the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBooks with the same processors — the 14-incher actually outperformed the 16-inchers in some of our tests. The primary difference to consider, apart from the sizes of these devices, is battery life. The 16-inch chassis allows for a significantly bigger battery, and the 16-inch M1 Pro model lasted several hours longer than the 14-inch M1 Pro model did in our testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8RJE4"&gt;On the outside, Apple has fixed many of the issues that reviewers had with previous MacBook Pro models. There are ports galore on this device, including an HDMI, an SD slot, and multiple Thunderbolt 4 ports. The much-maligned Touchbar is also no more. While you can get plenty of great 14-inch laptops for half the price of this MacBook, it’s the one to buy if money is no object.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Spectre x360 14 is one of the best convertible laptops you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O7mXrt"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre x360 14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best Windows laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwIVn"&gt;It’s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14. It’s a drop-dead gorgeous machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xL3xF1"&gt;But the Spectre x360 14 isn’t just pretty to look at: it’s also a pleasure to use as a daily work driver. Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out of the device — one of the best results we’ve ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfMa1S"&gt;On the outside, the Spectre includes a roomy 3:2 display, and if FHD resolution doesn’t suit your fancy, there are OLED and 1,000-nit options available. There’s even a packaged stylus, which attaches magnetically to the side of the Spectre — handy if you’re using the device as a tablet. Pretty much every other aspect of this laptop, from its comfortable keyboard and smooth touchpad to its bass-heavy audio and practical port selection, rivals or exceeds the best convertibles on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxTNW9"&gt;Such an exceptional package of features doesn’t come cheap, and many customers will find everything they need in a less expensive product. But the Spectre x360 14 is the new gold standard of Windows convertibles. Overall, it’s the best Windows laptop you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Asus Zephyrus G15 is the best gaming laptop you can buy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3P30go"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best gaming laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2eqQM4"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not compromising performance for that portability. The G15 is powered by the top mobile chips AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and pairs thim with a fast 165Hz QHD display. In our testing, the system was able to handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxthwN"&gt;Almost everything else about the G15 is great too: the audio sounds good, the keyboard and touchpad are some of the best on the market, the port selection has just about everything you’d need, and the battery can last over eight and a half hours to a charge. If you’re looking for a high-powered gaming machine that also works great as a daily driver, the Zephyrus G15 should be at the top of your list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3W3TFs"&gt;The best 15-inch Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wVrlpW"&gt;Asus surprised us this year with its Chromebook Flip CX5, a gorgeous $800 laptop that happens to run Chrome OS. It’s as sturdy and well-built as all kinds of Windows laptops at higher price points, and sports a unique smooth texture. It includes fully-fledged laptop specs, including Intel’s 11th-Gen processors and a 57Wh battery, which provide speedy performance, long battery life, and quick charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tt9eBq"&gt;You get all kinds of ports, including an HDMI and a microSD slot. The speakers sound great, and the keyboard is comfortable. Asus hasn’t skimped on CX5’s chassis or its performance — it’s absolutely the product to buy if you’re looking for a Chromebook with a big screen.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Gram 17 is the lightweight 17-inch laptop to buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SoHxJX"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364183/lg-gram-17-2021-intel-11th-gen-iris-xe-graphics-performance-battery-review"&gt;LG Gram 17 (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best laptop in 2021 for big-screen fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ovDneV"&gt;Even if you’ve used a light laptop before, it’s difficult to explain how light the LG Gram 17 is. It has a massive 17-inch display, but it’s somehow only three pounds. Picking it up messes with your mind; you feel like you’re not holding anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbftFc"&gt;But the Gram 17’s weight isn’t the only standout feature. It also has some of the best battery life you can get, lasting over 12 hours in our testing. Add a great keyboard, a solid port selection, quiet fans, and a fast processor, and there’s very little not to like about this device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvoTCC"&gt;Not everyone needs a 17-inch display, and many folks who do are looking for a heavier-duty workstation that probably doesn’t get moved very often. But if you’d just really like a large screen for your daily office work and Netflixing, you’re the target demographic for this machine. It’s a niche, but truly impressive device without much real competition in today’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Envy x360 is the best laptop you can buy for under $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vvpAoT"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best budget laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6ONzJr"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;A great 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iLNMXR"&gt;If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dghfZI"&gt;The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEAGgI"&gt;Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and even managed 36fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izx3w7"&gt;Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best laptop for college&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6xPrkB"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik0URk"&gt;This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCO5H"&gt;My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uN3gSr"&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price"&gt;OLED model&lt;/a&gt; of the XPS 13 as well, which costs $300 more than the FHD model. This model has worse battery life, but does deliver a stunning picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;The best laptop for business travel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XTubRZ"&gt;In many ways, the ThinkPad X1 Nano is a run-of-the-mill ThinkPad. It’s got a solid sturdy chassis, discrete clickers, a physical privacy shutter, a red TrackPoint in the middle of the keyboard, and all kinds of business-specific security and management features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdGWMd"&gt;But the Nano is special because it’s the lightest ThinkPad Lenovo has ever made. It’s also one of the lightest laptops you can buy, at just 1.99 pounds. You’re not sacrificing performance to get that mindblowing weight: The Nano kept up with our heavy testing workloads without any fan noise or noticeable heat. If you’re looking for a reliable business laptop that will feel like nothing in your briefcase, this is the one for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;The best laptop for students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;A stylish, powerful productivity laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1AVfKp"&gt;Razer is best known for its gaming laptops, but the company is making a big splash in the business and productivity space with its new Razer Book 13. At 0.6 inches thick and 3.09 pounds, the Book 13 is a portable workstation with a gorgeous and sturdy aluminum build. It features a good port selection including Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, HDMI 2.0 and a microSD slot, and it’s one of very few non-gaming laptops out there to come with a per-key RGB keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAI01n"&gt;On the inside, this laptop is even more impressive. Its powerful chip did better than any other Windows laptop of its size on our Premiere Pro media export test. And while the Book 13 isn’t a gaming laptop, it delivers some of the best gaming performance I’ve ever seen from integrated graphics — it can even run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; over 30fps. While the Razer Book 13’s high price means it won’t be ideal for everyone, it’s still an outstanding laptop all around, combining a high-quality chassis with powerful productivity performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DdByBe"&gt;The best multimedia laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3TMlQz"&gt;Most thin and light laptops share one significant weakness — thin, tinny audio. That’s not the case with the Lenovo Yoga 9i. This 14-inch convertible has a rotating soundbar in its hinge, meaning that no matter how it’s positioned, the speakers face outwards. You can expect clear, booming sound whether you’re using the 9i in tablet, tent, or clamshell mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bd1MYR"&gt;There’s a lot more to like as well. You get an excellent 1080p touch display and a built-in stylus for easy artwork and note-taking. The 11th-Gen processors deliver satisfactory performance and all-day battery life. The audio quality, screen, and convertible form factor all add up to an unbeatable machine for multimedia entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PNezb4"&gt;A great choice for gamers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="il4fnj"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 is a super powerful gaming laptop for a high price. It pairs Intel’s 11th-Gen Core processors (a Core i7 or a Core i9) with Nvidia’s RTX 3000 series and a display with up to a 360Hz refresh rate. It’s quite portable for such a powerful gaming laptop, at just 0.8 inches thick. And it only requires one charging brick, so you can carry it around in a backpack or briefcase without compromising on power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="965k9S"&gt;There are other things to like, too. It has a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, which adds a touch of color to the Pro’s design without it being too obnoxious for the office. You can also elect for a 165Hz QHD configuration, if you prefer to game at a higher resolution. While the Blade Pro 17 isn’t cheap, it’s the laptop to buy if you want the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google might’ve accidentally approved an ad for a Target gift card scam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Brs29KvSur0yTml2BcI3Zdjax0g=/0x0:4245x2830/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70395232/1288098838.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michael Loccisano / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CKqHbu"&gt;Most of us check our gift card balances online (because who actually keeps those receipts that tell us how much money we have left on them?), making an apparent oversight by Google all the worse. It appears that Google inadvertently approved a prominent ad for a phony Target gift card balance checker that’s meant to steal your funds, although it has since removed the ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mg9E3y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/s4m8ou/i_googled_target_gift_card_balance_to_check_gift/"&gt;A Reddit user&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/"&gt;r/assholedesign&lt;/a&gt; discovered the slip-up when searching Google for “Target gift card balance” on mobile and found that the very first result is an ad, titled “Check Gift Card Balance - Target.” Only, the site isn’t Target — it’s actually a site called “bristolhirevan.” The ad’s description says it will let you check your gift card balance “immediately” and that it also offers “all van sizes to fit your needs” — how can you get more legit than that? My colleague Sean Hollister and I found the same phony ad when searching for the exact phrase ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V1vAjQ"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created='"2022-01-15T22:45:40.362882+00:00"'&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/s4m8ou/i_googled_target_gift_card_balance_to_check_gift/?ref_source=embed&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;I googled target gift card balance to check gift card balances. An ad appears above the actual target website that copies the target website. I'm imagining it steals card numbers from people that don't check. I reported the ad to Google a few days ago and nothing has happened to it.&lt;/a&gt; from
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/"&gt;assholedesign&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;script async="" src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PNNXPF"&gt;Okay, while the name of the site doesn’t sound convincing at all, its interface sure looks like the real thing, although the actual Target site requires you to sign in to check your gift card balance, while this fake site doesn’t. Besides that, the only things that are off about the webpage are the URL, which still has the “bristolhirevan” domain and the fact that every single link on the page leads to the real Target homepage, despite promising to link to a weekly ad or a gift registry. If you were really in a rush (and were somehow distracted enough to ignore the mention of vans), you just might accidentally enter your gift card’s number and security code here, resulting in it getting stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OimIvf"&gt;“This behavior directly violates our policies against phishing, and we immediately suspended the account and removed the ads,” Google spokesperson Christa Muldoon told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We are continuously adjusting our enforcement mechanisms to prevent this type of abuse.” Muldoon also noted that Google typically suspends or bans the bad actor’s account, and in this case, the Target scammer was suspended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d78ics"&gt;Fortunately, the ad has been taken down, which I’ve confirmed after doing another search for “Target gift card balance” — the real Target balance checker has taken the ad’s place. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Target spokesperson Brian Harper-Tibaldo also noted that the company “reported the activity to Google” and is “working to get the fraudulent website taken down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbNs8c"&gt;Gift card scams appear to be on the rise. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-data-show-major-increase-gift-cards-scam-payment-method"&gt;the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported that victims of gift card scams lost a total of $148 million&lt;/a&gt; within the first nine months of 2021 — more than all of 2020. Target gift cards are apparently scammers’ cards of choice, as FTC data shows people were scammed out of $35 million worth of Target gift cards last year, more than double the amount of any other gift card brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61J1Xr"&gt;As pointed out by the FTC, &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/gift-card-scams"&gt;gift card scams&lt;/a&gt; often take place over the phone, with the scammer pretending to be an employee of a company like Google or Amazon (or even someone from a federal agency) who demands the victim make a payment in the form of a gift card. However, fake balance checker sites like these often hide in plain sight — apparently even as ads on Google. A 2020 report from &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/scammers-spoof-targets-gift-card-balance-checking-page/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; draws attention to sites that impersonate Target gift card balance checker pages, noting that Target is actually one of the most popular sites for scammers to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzFJ2h"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 18th 11:33AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to add statements from Google and Target spokespersons and noted that the ad has since been removed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
