    <title>Walmart is expanding its robot-powered fulfillment centers to ‘dozens of locations’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Walmart Black Friday" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VkNTb5poc0lAkJcPqm-FWovmVhA=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727898/walmart.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pRvyI6"&gt;Walmart is planning to increase the number of local fulfillment centers across the United States, it &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/01/27/from-ground-breaking-to-breaking-ground-walmart-begins-to-scale-local-fulfillment-centers"&gt;announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. Walmart’s approach of more localized fulfillment centers is a direct parallel to Amazon’s strategy, as both companies continue to face off amid an increasing demand for online orders. The new fulfillment centers are warehouses that will either be built within or adjacent to its existing retail locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tn87P"&gt;Walmart’s &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/01/08/how-walmarts-alphabot-is-helping-to-revolutionize-online-grocery-pickup-and-delivery"&gt;first fulfillment center opened in 2019&lt;/a&gt; in Salem, New Hampshire, when the retail giant started piloting the concept. These warehouses use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18302356/walmart-robots-labor-costs-replacing-human-tasks-floors-scanning-inventory"&gt;wheeled robots&lt;/a&gt; — called Alphabots — to pick items from the shelves and prepare orders placed online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1YhVht"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Walmart is piloting new technologies for some of its fulfillment centers, such as an automated curbside pickup feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fPBHrX"&gt;Alphabots will retrieve items ordered online such as boxed or frozen items. However, the company said that its human employees would still be tasked with grabbing fresh items like meat and produce in addition to larger items. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kxAJwQo8vDMEknoEFWouWmi-0XE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22263048/walmart_pickup.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Walmart&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some Walmart stores will add automated pickup points for seamless curbside pickup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NDDj4g"&gt;Walmart is piloting new technologies for some of its fulfillment centers, such as an automated curbside pickup feature, which will allow buyers or delivery drivers to drive up to a specific location, scan a code, grab their order, and go, all without leaving their vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIIct0"&gt;Walmart hasn’t said which locations will receive fulfillment center add-ons, but the company announced in its &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/01/27/from-ground-breaking-to-breaking-ground-walmart-begins-to-scale-local-fulfillment-centers"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it's already planning “dozens of locations, with many more to come.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spin is testing remote-controlled electric scooters to prevent blocked sidewalks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hu5TV33C3vXyGoWZKHkh5Px0SOA=/47x0:554x338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727502/1_ptsDYzC_wGU5l2FCzpaCGg.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uvtbgD"&gt;Spin, the scooter company owned by Ford, is testing a new scooter that can be controlled by a remote operator. The scooters, Segway’s T60 model, look different than Spin’s regular fleet with the addition of a third wheel in the front. They’re also outfitted with sensors and other technology provided by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20910083/tortoise-autonomous-electric-scooters-self-driving-robotics"&gt;a startup called Tortoise&lt;/a&gt;, which has been testing how teleoperation could potentially make fleets of shared electric scooters easier to manage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjb5vw"&gt;Starting this spring, Spin plans to start testing 250 remote-operated scooters in Boise, Idaho, before deciding whether to expand the pilot to additional markets. Tortoise’s software — which uses the scooters’ front- and rear-facing built-in cameras — makes it possible for remote operators to move the scooters when they happen to be blocking sidewalks or street traffic. It will also eventually make it possible for an e-scooter to travel several blocks to riders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAKCEc"&gt;“There has been a lot of fanfare around the potential of teleoperated e-scooters, but this partnership marks a turning point in tangible operational plans to bring them to city streets,” Ben Bear, chief business officer at Spin, said in a statement. “In addition to providing reliability to consumers and more order to city streets, this could significantly improve unit economics, reducing the operational work required to maintain and reposition fleets, while cutting down on mileage spent traveling to rebalance vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OVRfT6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The problem this pilot aims to solve is one that has plagued the shared scooter industry since its inception&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j4yJId"&gt;The problem this pilot aims to solve is one that has plagued the shared scooter industry since its inception. Right now, scooters are gathered up every night by teams of independent contractors for charging and rebalancing. These freelance scooter hunters get paid based on how many scooters they can collect each night, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20696405/dockless-scooters-share-repo-men-repossessor-lawsuit-tow-yard-lime-bird-lyft-uber-razor"&gt;which has led to arguments, fights&lt;/a&gt;, and the occasional weapon being flashed. Scooters get damaged, diminishing their lifespan. Fraud and hoarding are rampant. It’s a massive logistical challenge that can be dangerous for the freelancers involved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rkH4SgQpRrMb3oqJ6FGt_Lj4Gb4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22262917/1_5BC2KQ_HTjEr__VJV_bXTQ.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="spxbYJ"&gt;Meanwhile, riders have a difficult time tracking down available scooters when they want one. They block sidewalks, obstructing the path for people in wheelchairs and other pedestrians with mobility concerns. They all end up cluttered in a handful of places, rather than spread evenly around a city. And cities have complained about the companies failing to place enough scooters in low-income and minority communities to ensure equal distribution across economic lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1p06vN"&gt;Tortoise has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21263728/tortoise-gox-remote-control-electric-scooter-peachtree-corners"&gt;previously tested out its remote-operating technology&lt;/a&gt; in a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia. The scooters, which were owned by a shared service operator called Go X, didn’t have three wheels. Rather, they had two extra smaller wheels in the middle of the deck that could pop out like training wheels to help balance the scooter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaQMqN"&gt;The Segway T60, which was first introduced by the Chinese scooter manufacturer a year ago, is supposed to be a more stable model built specifically for this type of application. When it was released, Segway called it a “roboscooter,” with a “reverse tricycle chassis” made for global scooter-sharing service providers. Spin noted that the T60 has enhanced suspension, three independent braking systems (regenerative rear brake, front and rear drum brakes), and turn signals (on handlebars and near the rear wheel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNSYF4"&gt;So how will it work? After a ride is completed, Tortoise’s teleoperators (who are located over a thousand miles away in Mexico City) may reposition the scooter if it’s parked somewhere where it’s unlikely to get another trip or if the scooter is blocking the sidewalk, crosswalk, or a handicapped-accessible space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKM7lI"&gt;Later this year, Spin says it will offer in-app “scooter hailing” that allows customers to request an e-scooter in advance or in real time. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How r/WallStreetBets gamed the stock of GameStop </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="gamestop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NLcResB8cEQAYWpCneh_Hk_9heA=/0x32:1100x765/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727484/GameStop_Store_Front_0.1419980119.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;gamestop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The Reddit meme that bludgeoned a hedge fund&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="96E7uo"&gt;There are three things to remember as you watch the chaos unfolding with GameStop’s stock price. First, Wall Street is just what happens when you mix money with feelings. Second, the internet is real life. And third, the Street always wins, especially if you’re trading with Robinhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XOCzE"&gt;If you haven’t been paying attention, GameStop’s stock has been soaring in a remarkably volatile fashion; on January 22nd, GameStop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244900/game-stop-stock-halted-trading-volatility"&gt;zoomed upward 69 percent&lt;/a&gt; (nice) before it triggered a circuit breaker halt. The following Monday, January 25th, GameStop trading was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-shares-surge-toward-fresh-record-ahead-of-opening-bell-11611579224"&gt;halted &lt;em&gt;nine times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cHz861"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The idea was to punish short-sellers, and for the little guys to pummel Wall Street&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mAWDdv"&gt;On the surface, this doesn’t make sense. GameStop, founded a year before Blockbuster, is part of a dwindling cohort of IRL businesses that are being starved by online marketplaces. These days, you can just buy video games over the internet instead of going to a soul-killing strip mall in Iowa City to buy a physical copy of the game. GameStop’s business has been suffering as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fk2MFO"&gt;Currently, many people are at home and bored, and consequently, interest in day trading has shot through the roof. There is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-15/big-investors-are-dying-to-know-what-the-little-guys-are-doing"&gt;a Reddit forum for this&lt;/a&gt;, r/WallStreetBets, which describes itself as being “like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal.” A year ago, a user called &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b4zlkt/gamestop_investment_thesis/"&gt;delaneydi argued that GameStop&lt;/a&gt; was underpriced by the market. For a while, the idea that r/WallStreetBets would take over GameStop was a joke — but then it turned serious, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/how-wallstreetbets-pushed-gamestop-shares-to-the-moon?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The idea was to punish short-sellers, and for the little guys to pummel Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7VxL3"&gt;If you think GameStop will fail and the stock will go down, or even that the company will go bankrupt, there’s a way to make money on that. Typically, this is done by short selling — a practice where you borrow shares for a fee and sell them for (ideally) a high price, then buy them back at (ideally) a lower price to return them. This can make you a lot of money, especially if the company goes bankrupt and you don’t have to return the stock!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MjbT1"&gt;The thing about short selling, though, is that you lose money if the stock goes &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt;, and your losses are potentially infinite if the stock &lt;em&gt;keeps&lt;/em&gt; going up. There are several other bad things that can also happen, such as an increase in fees or the original investor wanting their stock back. This means some shorts will be forced to “cover,” or buy the stock back at a high price, which sends the price even higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SnYvSm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For retail investors, this process has gotten easier and cheaper&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lAwWDx"&gt;Right now, more people are betting against GameStop than betting it will succeed. “Short interest is 71.2 million shares, while GameStop has only 69.7 million &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638020000134/gme-20201031.htm"&gt;shares outstanding&lt;/a&gt;,” Matt Levine of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-25/the-game-never-stops"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;. Some people will notice that kind of thing and think, &lt;em&gt;Hm, this stock is prime for a short squeeze!&lt;/em&gt; Basically, because so many people are short, it may be possible to trigger a chain reaction where you buy enough stock to send the price up, forcing some shorts to cover, sending the price up further, forcing more shorts to cover, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEMmpm"&gt;For retail investors, this process has gotten easier and cheaper because of apps such as Robinhood. In addition to letting you buy and sell stock, you can easily buy an &lt;em&gt;option&lt;/em&gt; for stock, instead of the stock itself. If you are feeling confident in a stock, you can buy a &lt;em&gt;call option&lt;/em&gt; — which lets you buy a stock at a specific price on a specific date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLEEOl"&gt;Let’s say my fake investing firm wants to buy a call option on Company X. Currently, shares of Company X are trading at $10. I feel confident in Company X, so I buy options that let me buy 100 shares of Company X stock for $25 a share on March 1st. This contract is usually cheaper than the share price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHF6jH"&gt;So let’s say Company X goes on an epic run in February, and by February 15th, it’s up to $50 a share. I can sell my options for more than I paid for them, if I want. Or I can continue to hold onto them until March 1st, when I take delivery of the 100 shares, which are now trading at $55 a share, and immediately sell them. As a result, I make a profit of $30 per share, minus whatever fees I paid for the options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="AnhZ9o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stocks are memes now, and you trade them to show off to your friends&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SS4Es8"&gt;On the other hand, maybe I bet badly and Company X only gets up to $20. In that case, my losses are limited to whatever fees I paid for my options — I just never buy the shares. This makes options a riskier bet than just buying Company X stock directly, because I might just lose all the money I spent on the options, instead of at least getting to own the stock. But it means there’s a lot more upside as well, because I didn’t have to spend all the money on the stock upfront. If risk is your idea of fun, options are great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrILUl"&gt;Now, someone has to be on the other end of my trade. The outfit that sold me the options is going to try to reduce the risk that my options will hurt them, and they will do this by buying stock in Company X. That makes the stock go up, and the further up the stock goes, the more stock my counterparty will have to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhSwve"&gt;Options were once a fairly sophisticated thing to trade — something ordinary people didn’t really do. But Robinhood makes the option trades easy and free. Plus, there’s a social aspect to the trades — which is where r/WallStreetBets come in. Stocks are memes now, and you trade them to show off to your friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BrrCx"&gt;Day traders, such as the ones on r/WallStreetBets, are typically held in contempt by professional traders, and they are &lt;em&gt;acutely&lt;/em&gt; aware of this. The professional short-sellers who created the possibility of a short squeeze underestimated the day traders’ sophistication, and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/gamestop-tug-of-war-gives-reddit-army-a-win-on-record-volatility"&gt;r/WallStreetBets pounced&lt;/a&gt;. Time to troll Wall Street out of a fuckload of money! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="S9xjJ1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GameStop’s short-sellers have been trolled out of about $5 billion in 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UG9032"&gt;The fine people of r/WallStreetBets decided GameStop was undervalued, and the stock would go up, so they put up a bunch of posts about how they were buying GameStop options. This drove up the stock price for GameStop, as their counterparties had to load up on stock to balance, and then more stock as more people bought options and so on. The soaring stock meant some shorts had to cover, sending the stock up further. As of January 26th, short-sellers have been trolled out of &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-short-sellers-squeezed-losses-reddit-traders-army-cohen-palihapitiya-2021-1-1030006226"&gt;about $5 billion&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, just from their GameStop positions alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GhNvql"&gt;What does Robinhood have to do with this? Well, it makes options trading much more accessible to retail investors — but there’s something else. Trades on Robinhood are &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;! But Robinhood isn’t offering free trades to be nice; the company &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/13/how-robinhood-makes-money-on-customer-trades-despite-making-it-free.html"&gt;gets paid by some big-time investors&lt;/a&gt; such as Citadel Securities to see what retail investors are doing. This phenomenon, which other brokerages are engaged in as well, is called payment for order flow. Citadel Securities makes its money on these orders by “automatically taking the other side of the order, then returning to the market to flip the trade. It pockets the difference between the price to buy and sell, known as the spread,” according &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b"&gt;to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gv6wUR"&gt;The argument in favor of this practice is, essentially, retail investors get better prices than they would on the open market, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-10-16/carl-icahn-wants-to-fight-dell-again"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Levine writes&lt;/a&gt;. The practice is controversial, though, because some critics say it harms investors. It’s theoretically possible to “‘front run’ orders by, for example, jumping ahead of a customer’s stock purchase to buy it themselves, making a small gain if the share price increases,” the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;explains. “There is no suggestion that Citadel Securities engages in such activity, which is prohibited by SEC.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORMAjh"&gt;Robinhood &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321"&gt;got in trouble with the SEC&lt;/a&gt; for “misleading statements and omissions” about how it made its money by selling the orders its traders made to other firms. According to the SEC, Robinhood investors got second-rate prices, which cost them a collective $34.1 million. The company paid a $65 million fine in December to settle charges, and the practices the SEC objected to “do not reflect Robinhood today,” Dan Gallagher, the brokerage’s chief legal officer, &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/robinhood-65-million-settlement-sec-probe-misleading-statements-order-flow-2020-12-1029902927"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UrhGZm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wall Street can &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; get in on screwing Wall Street&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="45pVyd"&gt;When asked for comment, Robinhood referred to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/robinhood-ceo-becoming-an-investor-is-the-new-american-dream-just-like-home-ownership-was-before.html"&gt;an op-ed published by Vlad Tenev&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s CEO and co-founder. The company says its customers are mostly “buy and hold”  investors, not reckless ones. The op-ed said nothing about payment for order flow, and Robinhood declined to comment on the practice in a follow-up email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wyFvh"&gt;Citadel Securities is winning on this, though! Last June, the company was responsible for 40 percent of shares traded by retail investors, the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;wrote, citing Piper Sandler. It doesn’t just get Robinhood’s orders either — TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab also work with Citadel Securities. “Not only are retail market makers getting increased trading volume, they are likely getting increased profitability per trade,” Tyler Gellasch, executive director of Healthy Markets Association, told the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1RbaG"&gt;Which means that Wall Street can &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; get in on screwing Wall Street. And it’s not just Citadel Securities. I’d be very surprised if high-frequency trading algorithms weren’t also getting in on the fun. Plus, Chamath Palihapitiya, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;Silicon Valley SPAC&lt;/a&gt; icon, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354089928313823232"&gt;has decided to yolo along&lt;/a&gt; with the Redditors. (“Yolo” as a verb appears to be part of the r/WallStreetBets peculiar parlance.) Elon Musk, a man who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/20/18509371/skabooshka-twitter-elon-musk-tesla-short-seller-tslaq"&gt;notoriously hates short-sellers&lt;/a&gt;, is also observing the chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oTDAAd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Gamestonk!! &lt;a href="https://t.co/RZtkDzAewJ"&gt;https://t.co/RZtkDzAewJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354174279894642703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0U6UPM"&gt;At least one Wall Street firm has taken heavy losses — Melvin Capital Management, which was shorting GameStop, among other bets. It’s been &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340"&gt;bailed out by Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, which, confusingly, is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;the same thing as Citadel Securities. (Citadel is a hedge fund, not a market maker.) Both firms were founded by the same guy, though: Ken Griffin. And by bailing out Melvin, Griffin got “a rare opportunity to invest in a talented manager on the cheap,” &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/bros-on-reddit-bludgeon-melvin-capital-in-warning-to-wall-street"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ljqf1g"&gt;What does this have to do with GameStop itself? Absolutely nothing — this is a weird game now. And the market’s frothy, too; in July, I joined Robinhood to see how it works. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;ethics policy forbids us from directly trading stock in companies we cover, so for research purposes I picked six stocks that belong to companies I don’t cover because their earnings were next on the calendar. (I actually don’t know what several of them do.) I am a buy-and-hold investor because I am a bore, but as of today I’m a bore who’s up 30 percent. One more time: &lt;em&gt;I know nothing about these companies except that I won’t have to write about them.&lt;/em&gt; It’s easy to feel like a genius in a bull market, and a lot of first-time day traders are probably very bullish on their investing sense right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfCvs7"&gt;At this point you may be wondering whether what r/WallStreetBets is doing is illegal — after all, it’s a group of people trying to artificially drive up a stock price in order to sell for outsized profits. And the answer is: well, maybe? It definitely seems like a pump-and-dump scheme, but — this part is crucial — no one’s &lt;em&gt;lying&lt;/em&gt;, as &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-26/will-wallstreetbets-face-sec-scrutiny-after-gamestop-rally"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Levine points out&lt;/a&gt;. Theoretically, the SEC could chase down the r/WallStreetBets investors, since no one’s really anonymous on the internet, but this seems like a lot of effort for what is not actually a slam-dunk case. It is “an enforcement nightmare,” James Cox, a professor at Duke University School of Law, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/reddit-fueled-rallies-like-gamestop-s-defy-easy-crackdown-by-sec"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="c4ftf1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s not just GameStop anymore&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m94g7Q"&gt;Also, GameStop’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/gamestop-short-sellers-reload-bearish-bets-after-6-billion-loss?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;shorts seem undeterred&lt;/a&gt; — as some older shorts are getting out of the market, they’re being replaced by new ones. Perhaps this is because they are anticipating the “dump” portion of the pump-and-dump scheme; perhaps this is because they’re awaiting quarterly earnings, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/gamestop-shares-almost-always-plunge-following-earnings-report"&gt;which usually tanks GameStop’s stock&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe they’re just having fun, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qw4GZn"&gt;But: it’s not just GameStop anymore. r/WallStreetBets &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackberry-amc-and-other-reddit-yolo-favorites-that-arent-gamestop-11611681716"&gt;is yoloing its way&lt;/a&gt; into electric carmaker Nio, OG tech company Blackberry, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"&gt;AMC, the movie theater chain&lt;/a&gt;. And if those day traders are doing it, then the market makers that buy the order flow from Robinhood are yoloing along for the ride. And one thing &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; clear: what Citadel Securities is doing &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="lx9Mso"&gt;So what happens next? I don’t know — but I suspect that someone on Wall Street will find a way to make money on it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring’s new $60 video doorbell is its smallest and cheapest yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3zd66-ZE5tPjDGckjk7Al76at30=/5x0:1148x762/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727371/rings.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AkINbc"&gt;Amazon’s Ring has debuted its latest video doorbell, the (blandly named) Ring Video Doorbell Wired which, at $59.99, is the cheapest and smallest doorbell that the company has ever offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQzw8A"&gt;As the name implies, there is one major limitation of the new Ring Video Doorbell Wired — unlike its pricier siblings, it can only be used as a hardwired doorbell, instead of the battery-powered option offered by products like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21174876/amazon-ring-new-video-doorbell-3-plus-chime-pro-pre-roll"&gt;Ring Doorbell 3&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249028/ring-video-doorbell-specs-price-date"&gt;$99.99 Ring Video Doorbell&lt;/a&gt; that the company refreshed last year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0noJtzDBqFSHpdKTnNvYAlDukj8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22262876/ring_video_doorbell_wired_intro_tablet_696x522_2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BTjRMR"&gt;Assuming you’ve got your home wired already, though, the rest of the Video Doorbell Wired checks all the boxes for a Ring doorbell: 1080p video, night vision, custom motion detection zones, and support for other Ring products and services like the optional Ring Protect subscription. And, of course, given that it’s an Amazon product, the new Video Doorbell Wired is also fully compatible with Amazon’s Echo products, which can be used to see who’s at your door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PE3rQg"&gt;It’s effectively a wired version of the previous entry-level Ring, the aforementioned Video Doorbell, just without the integrated battery and a sleeker design (likely because it ditches the rechargeable battery). But at $40 less, it seems like a good option for anyone looking to start out a Ring home security setup — assuming you’ve got the wired setup or home improvement knowhow to get it installed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLK5On"&gt;The Ring Video Doorbell Wired is available now to preorder for $59.99 from Ring and Amazon, ahead of a February 24th release date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max hits subscriber goal two years ahead of schedule</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rnQTElUJv70QGRqsUDLl6LKOMME=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727318/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hlcq53"&gt;&lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeSubscriberGoal012721&amp;amp;source=Verge"&gt;HBO Max &lt;/a&gt;has nearly 40 million US subscribers, AT&amp;amp;T disclosed in its first quarter earnings report on Wednesday. Combined with traditional HBO subscribers, the platform has surpassed a 41 million subscriber milestone the company says it didn’t expect to hit for two more years. Globally, AT&amp;amp;T says HBO now has more than 60 million subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buQRlu"&gt;There are a few caveats worth mentioning. For one, AT&amp;amp;T has different metrics for different levels of its subscriber base. Total subscribers includes not only people who pay for a standalone subscription, but also those with access to HBO Max either through an existing HBO subscription through a cable company or through a promotion via AT&amp;amp;T’s cell carrier business, regardless of whether they’ve even downloaded the app. That total subscriber number for the US market is the more than 41 million figure AT&amp;amp;T is touting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ah5BTD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AT&amp;amp;T says the growth is due to ‘Wonder Woman 1984’ and its big streaming bet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UOVC0E"&gt;But of the 37.7 million HBO Max domestic subscribers out there (the remaining few million being pay TV subscribers), about 17.2 million subscribers are considered “activated,” AT&amp;amp;T’s term for someone who has downloaded the app and either signed up independently or upgraded an existing subscription (or claimed a free one via promotion). Still, it’s a strong number compared with the end of September, when HBO Max boasted 28.7 million subscribers, of which only 8.6 million had been activated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwDFLZ"&gt;For context, Disney Plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165579/disney-plus-86-million-subscribers-netflix-hbo-max-streaming"&gt;hit more than 86 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; in a little over a year, though it costs less per month than a standalone HBO Max subscription and released without a bogged-down rebrand of an existing, cable-driven service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpEKdo"&gt;In unsurprising fashion, AT&amp;amp;T is crediting the growth to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;controversial decision&lt;/a&gt; to release the films of its subsidiary, Warner Bros., on HBO Max on the same day they release in theaters. “The release of &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; helped drive our domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers to more than 41 million, a full two years faster than our initial forecast,” said AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqerB3"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman &lt;/em&gt;sequel is just the first of many planned film releases on HBO Max that were once scheduled for exclusive theatrical windows — until the coronavirus pandemic upended Hollywood. High-profile film directors, including of Warner Bros. releases like the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; adaptation and &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;, have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168881/denis-villeneuve-christopher-nolan-anger-hbo-max-streaming-att"&gt;voiced their extreme disapproval of the decision&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgWXd3"&gt;But AT&amp;amp;T, which owns parent company WarnerMedia that oversees both HBO and Warner Bros., claims this strategy is paying off, for now. There’s no telling yet how the huge investment in streaming will affect Warner Bros.’ relationship with directors like Denis Villeneuve and Christopher Nolan going forward, and whether the HBO Max subscriber growth AT&amp;amp;T is attributing to &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; will continue onward through the rest of this year’s release slate. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit’s GameStop traders turn their attention to AMC stock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Businesses Close Stores Nationwide In Response To Coronavirus Pandemic" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0qt6NaBgoMIvifFWYpNFlsNxipU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727283/1207531287.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Victor J. Blue/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="77wj4a"&gt;Reddit traders who have successfully profited off GameStop (GME) stock are now turning their attention to struggling movie theater chain AMC. Reddit board r/wallstreetbets has helped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244900/game-stop-stock-halted-trading-volatility"&gt;push GameStop stock to record levels&lt;/a&gt; in recent days, with the stock closing up 92 percent yesterday alone. It’s part of a chaotic, meme-fueled effort to create an organized short squeeze, and force traditional hedge funds into losing millions of dollars on their bets against struggling companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MOkAu"&gt;AMC appears to be next on the list. Overnight, online traders at r/wallstreetbets’ Discord server spent hours creating memes and spamming AMC emoji in an effort to convince thousands of people to buy AMC stock. Hundreds swarmed rapper Soulja Boy’s live &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/889801623?t=03h20m00s"&gt;Twitch stream&lt;/a&gt; in a failed endeavor to get him to tweet about AMC. At one point in an ongoing Discord call — with dozens of participants shouting profanity and racial slurs — traders thought Elon Musk was on the call. After many called for quiet and to “let Elon speak,” everyone soon realized it was just a prankster using a fake Elon Musk sound board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2aCBA"&gt;It was a surreal moment in what has become the hottest online game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HiEuvFjMDEUUeUpB5QifBejVIBc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22262813/V5axbEb.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMC stock up more than 400 percent in pre-market trading.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9MNxis"&gt;The AMC memes appear to be working, though. During pre-market trading, AMC was up more than 400 percent at one point before opening up more than 250 percent. The movie theater chain has struggled with pandemic-related losses, but it did &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/amc-theatres-boosts-liquidity-saying-it-has-financial-runway-deep-into-2021"&gt;raise more than $400 million&lt;/a&gt; in financing on Monday to help it stay afloat through 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2m3mp"&gt;The mob of investors are taking part in this incredibly high-risk game in an attempt to punish hedge funds and professional financiers and make some quick cash. Thousands are buying into the idea of pummeling Wall Street professionals, and they’re using Reddit, Discord, Twitter, and Twitch to sell more people on gaming the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpnMMj"&gt;It works by targeting stocks that have a high amount of short selling attached to them, which is why GameStop and AMC are great targets after struggling through the pandemic. Short selling is a process that lets traders borrow shares for a fee and then sell them for a high price, and buy them back at a lower price to return them. Reddit is trying to force the price up so that investors, and especially hedge funds, that are short selling will lose lots of money as the stock rises. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;Read our full explainer on how Redditors are gaming GameStop stock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QHixRB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a high-risk online game for many&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BgOrzR"&gt;It’s a risky game that highlights a bigger battle over the future of finance, and the idea that you can do anything online. The vast majority of Reddit investors are young and see hedge funds as the old school controlling stocks and shares and bullying companies into administration through their positions. As &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5krk7/this_is_personal_for_all_of_us/"&gt;one poster on r/wallstreetbets put it&lt;/a&gt;, it’s “a tug of war between tradition and the future” that has gotten really personal. “We need to take the wealth back from these boomers,” said one member of the Discord call encouraging investment in AMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UL2gq0"&gt;Investing and trading has also become incredibly easy for amateurs, thanks to apps like Robinhood. Millions have used Robinhood to make commission-free trades, and it’s a practice that has become popular during the pandemic with millions stuck at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwkaIZ"&gt;This online trade game also has real life consequences. One big hedge fund, Melvin Capital, has been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1354386200157675521"&gt;forced to close out&lt;/a&gt; of its GameStop position today with a huge loss expected, likely in the millions of dollars. It’s not clear if we’ll see the same sequence of events with AMC, but Reddit is trying to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Staples’ Easy Button is a cheap toy that envisions a perfect button</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1jsXcXQOlCuez_N6APiE8deNAQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727058/akrales_210125_4362_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d115uY"&gt;As buttons go, there are few as well-known as Staples’ “Easy Button” — a bright, Staples-red button that was featured in a series of ad campaigns beginning in 2005. The ads were so popular that Staples ended up actually selling real replica versions of the Easy Button shortly after they debuted — and it’s since sold millions of the desk toys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LPlfNS"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFRKHOQ4WJE"&gt;fictitious Easy Buttons&lt;/a&gt; featured in the commercials possess magical qualities that allow the user to sorcerously solve their (usually office supply-related) issues with the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NojiCsZQSr8"&gt;press of a button&lt;/a&gt;. The sad irony, of course, is that the real-life version of the product is significantly more disappointing. Pressing it doesn’t summon a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzCJP5P0wZU"&gt;rain of printer ink&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8fMF9M67SI&amp;amp;list=PLyDQGD1hoIWdSL1gCH4GPIjv-5WCh8irY&amp;amp;index=11"&gt;raise the Great Wall to defend against an invading army&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it just plays a recording of the company’s “That was easy” slogan when you press down the (satisfyingly clicky) button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o1LHMN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Easy Button aims to be the perfect button&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f8NWPx"&gt;Outside of the metafictional context of Staples commercials, though, the idea of a magical big red button that you can press to solve a problem is one that resonates with the entire concept of hardware design. Sure, the real-world Easy Button is just a cute toy to leave on your desk or annoy your co-workers with. But nearly every hardware button that exists is born out of the same ethos as the more magical version from the commercial: it’s a physical object that’s designed for users to press, push, switch, or spin in order to solve a specific problem or accomplish a task. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wg2fDYeQOcy9dOlhwShYaS-NI78=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260028/akrales_210125_4362_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4amfjB"&gt;The Easy Button just imagines a world in which our buttons have been elevated to an even higher plane. One where the things that buttons can do or the issues they can alleviate aren’t bounded by petty things like electricity, programming, or the laws of physics. One where no problem is too big or complicated that it can’t be solved with a single push of a button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVmabk"&gt;But the Easy Button’s journey from marketing gimmick to actual product doesn’t end with a wacky cubicle accessory — because the internet took the initial idea of the Easy Button and ran with it, with any number of tutorials available on how to hack &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2FStaples-Easy-Button%2Fproduct_606396&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22250485%2Fstaples-easy-button-toy-commercial-design-user-interface-hack#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $9 toy&lt;/a&gt;. Most common hacks revolve around modding the hardware with a microphone to record your own catchphrases &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/scott/the-easiest-easy-button-hack"&gt;for the Easy Button’s&lt;/a&gt; tinny speaker to spout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PCZc0w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A button that can do anything with just a push&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U6b3zn"&gt;Other hacks go further, like &lt;a href="https://www.partsnotincluded.com/repurposing-the-staples-easy-button/"&gt;installing an Arduino microcontroller&lt;/a&gt; that allows the once-useless button to be hooked up to a computer or custom hardware setup. And with that kind of hardware and some programming chops, the sky’s the limit for what you can have your Easy Button do, like boot up your computer, quit a Zoom call, or even order some more paper from Staples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89PAzX"&gt;It’s still not quite the level of literal magic that Staples promises in its commercials, but after years, the converging forces of a marketing campaign turned into an office toy turned into a DIY tool have come full circle: an infinitely programmable button that can, in theory, do almost anything with just a push. And really, what else could you ask for from a button beyond that?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bowser’s Fury is a heavy metal remix of Super Mario 3D World</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j-66w1dUg6qbEdvUGVSLbLX4z0k=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727035/Switch_SM3DWBowsersFury_screenshot_31_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bVVMAS"&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt; for the Switch, Nintendo is once again giving a great Wii U game a second chance on a more successful platform. But it’s also more than just a straight port. In addition to the main game, this rerelease also includes a separate experience — the titular &lt;em&gt;Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;It’s essentially a built-in expansion pack with a strong heavy metal vibe to remix the classic gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9w5rR"&gt;For starters, you don’t actually have to play &lt;em&gt;3D World&lt;/em&gt; to access &lt;em&gt;Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;. Both titles are accessible right from the main menu, and you can swap between them at will. Progress in one doesn’t appear to impact the other. Fundamentally, the two games are the same: &lt;em&gt;Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt; still plays and controls just like &lt;em&gt;3D World&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which means, yes, you’ll spend lots of time in a cat costume. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/22/5133098/super-mario-3d-world-review"&gt;The Wii U classic&lt;/a&gt; is best-known for its inventive level design and for finding a nice balance between the open spaces of 3D &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; games and the structure of the original side-scrollers, and that’s largely true of &lt;em&gt;Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nPW9Gj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Super Mario 3D World is the best reason to own a Wii U","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/22/5133098/super-mario-3d-world-review"},{"title":"Super Mario 3D All-Stars is a wonderful history lesson ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21438499/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-nintendo-switch"},{"title":"Super Mario Odyssey is an absolute delight","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tK6W4H"&gt;The new expansion is more of a bite-sized take on the formula. It’s set in a world made up of a series of islands, though the main goal is the same as ever, with lots of shiny objects to collect to open up new areas. I’ve only played the first section, which is a sort of island paradise overrun with cats; seriously, everything from the bushes to the birds has adorable cat ears. It’s a little disarming how cute everything is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aROor7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ppkX8epoD9g?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="79EtVt"&gt;If you’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226787/super-mario-3d-world-release-date-price-new-color-switch"&gt;watched the trailers&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll know that the big change this year really is big: a kaiju-sized Bowser rampaging across the land. In order to get his attention, you have to collect coins and unlock lighthouses littered across the level. (Evil Bowser, naturally, hates light.) When this happens, Mario will similarly grow to epic proportions for a large-scale tilt. I can’t say much about these massive battles just yet — stay tuned to our full review for more on that next month — but they definitely add a new dynamic to an otherwise familiar experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irzv5i"&gt;Aside from boss battles, the other thing Bowser adds is unpredictability. Every so often you’ll start to notice a heavy rain, which precipitates an attack: the world will be covered with dark clouds, and Bowser will let out a barrage of fireballs for a short period. What’s interesting about this is that it doesn’t just add challenge but provides a different way to interact with the world. Some puzzles and secret areas are only accessible — or at least are easier to reach — during one of these brief attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKg2pI"&gt;From what I’ve played, &lt;em&gt;Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt; feels like just the thing for those picking up &lt;em&gt;3D World &lt;/em&gt;for a second time. It’s essentially a remix of a beloved game, adding in a few fresh ideas while retaining the same core. There are still a handful of questions — like how big it actually is and whether those awe-inspiring battles are any fun — but it at least has the basics down. And alongside the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438499/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;3D All-Stars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it’s helping turn the Switch into the ideal &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rjplK4"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launches on February 12th for the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>General Motors, after flubbing its deal with Nikola, eyes a new hydrogen truck project</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVYQ3CMWf5ukUoAV49HOpuQklBg=/319x0:3777x2305/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727075/Navistar_Truck_1_with_background5_FINAL.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PWywLv"&gt;General Motors, which only a few months ago was forced to ditch its plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427009/gm-nikola-acquisition-electric-hydrogen-truck"&gt;acquire an equity stake&lt;/a&gt; in troubled hydrogen truck startup Nikola, is ready to move on. Today, the automaker announced it was teaming up with Illinois-based trucking firm Navistar and OneH2, a North Carolina-based hydrogen fuel cell company, to put more hydrogen-powered long-haul trucks on the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXSzAd"&gt;The three companies, along with JB Hunt Transport Services, are planning to roll out “a complete solution” for a fleet of heavy-duty, zero-emission, hydrogen fuel cell trucks. The move is &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/13/15257576/hydrogen-fuel-cell-honda-clarity-self-driving-ny-auto-show-2017"&gt;further evidence&lt;/a&gt; that automakers are continuing to place huge bets on hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, despite major fueling limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AJugvY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As part of the deal, Navistar will introduce a new fuel cell vehicle in 2024&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3jFK4c"&gt;As part of the deal, Navistar will introduce a new fuel cell vehicle in 2024, called the International RH Series truck. Test versions of the truck will roll out prior to that in 2022. The companies are aiming for a fuel cell vehicle with a powertrain capable of “500+ miles” of range and a refueling time of less than 15 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qElysV"&gt;(Tesla has promised that its battery electric Semi truck would be capable of traveling up to 500 miles on a single charge — though that vehicle has yet to enter production.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBo16w"&gt;Here’s how Navistar is describing the International RH Series truck’s propulsion system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LLdt69"&gt;The International RH Series FCEV [fuel cell electric vehicle] will get its energy from two GM Hydrotec fuel cell power cubes. Each Hydrotec power cube contains 300-plus hydrogen fuel cells along with thermal and power management systems. They are compact and easy to package into many different applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MUjnU"&gt;The combined propulsion system within the International RH Series FCEV will feature better power density for short-range travel, better short-burst kW output and a per-mile cost expected to be comparable to diesel in certain market segments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0cvT4Q"&gt;Hydrogen fuel cells — which use compressed hydrogen as their fuel and release only water vapor as an emission — have been in development for decades, but only recently have they attained performance and range numbers good enough to replace an average driver’s gasoline-powered car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFzXuR"&gt;That said, hydrogen as a popular fuel source has been stymied by an almost complete lack of a fueling infrastructure. There are currently 39 public hydrogen fueling stations in California (with another 25 in development), along with a couple in Hawaii. The East Coast is trying to get in on the action. A &lt;a href="http://chfcc.org/existing-and-planned-hydrogen-fueling-stations-northeast-us/"&gt;handful of stations&lt;/a&gt; are up and running, and more are in the works in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcuX84"&gt;Experts predict that commercial vehicles, like trucks and forklifts, could benefit more from hydrogen thanks to access to centralized, industrial fueling stations. Other automakers have expressed interest in hydrogen-powered trucks, too. In 2019, Toyota unveiled a fuel cell truck concept as part of a feasibility study by the Port of Los Angeles, which figures in to the port’s efforts to reduce harmful emissions. But the Japanese carmaker has yet to commit to making that concept a reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c07OKs"&gt;Nikola has been the biggest example of hydrogen’s promises — and pitfalls. The startup claimed its H2-powered truck will have an operational range of as much as 1,200 miles when it was released in 2020. That never happened, though the company did spend most of last year watching its valuation soar to new heights thanks to the meteoric rise in Tesla’s stock price. As the hype grew, GM announced it would acquire an 11 percent stake in the buzzy company, while also lending a hand with Nikola’s battery-electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131754/nikola-badger-hydrogen-electric-pickup-truck-specs-photos-battery-range"&gt;the Badger pickup truck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmdJiY"&gt;That all collapsed when short-selling firm Hindenburg Research &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436126/nikola-fraud-allegation-hindenburg-short-seller-electric-truck"&gt;published a bombshell report &lt;/a&gt;accusing Nikola of fraud in showcasing its electric vehicle technology. Nikola founder Trevor Milton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448729/nikola-electric-hydrogen-truck-fraud-allegations-executive-chairman-founder-trevor-milton"&gt;stepped down as board chairman&lt;/a&gt;, and later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726594/gm-nikola-deal-equity-badger-truck-hydrogen"&gt;GM ended its equity arrangement&lt;/a&gt; with the company. The two companies still plan on collaborating on fuel cell Class 7 and Class 8 trucks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9wF0g"&gt;Navistar is a less risky bet for GM. The company &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2016/09/06/navistar-steps-off-the-bankruptcy-brink-with-volkswagen-partnership/#59e13df1787f"&gt;was on the brink of bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, having squandered billions of dollars on a diesel engine that failed to win the approval of the Environmental Protections Agency. After US regulators &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/17/12510610/fuel-efficiency-standards-large-trucks-epa"&gt;announced new rules to reduce carbon emissions from big trucks&lt;/a&gt;, putting pressure on Navistar to find a technology partner, Volkswagen swooped in to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/6/12815174/volkswagen-buys-stake-navistar-trucking-emissions-scandal"&gt;buy a minority stake in the company&lt;/a&gt;. Navistar has since been on more stable footing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3nmQJ"&gt;Navistar doesn’t only make trucks — the Lisle, Illinois-based company also owns International Trucks, which encompasses a variety of medium-duty trucks, and IC Bus, which makes buses and commercial vehicles. Last year, the company took an equity stake in TuSimple, a leading autonomous vehicle startup, and announced plans to build a self-driving semi truck that can operate without a human driver on highways and local roads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6h6Be"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fejhH8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fujifilm announces slimmed-down X-E4 mirrorless camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FYUc9on5qrpNKZbaL3x79fF-Ug0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727063/16673938_PT01_X_E4_diagonal_left_XF27mm_silver.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NIENK6"&gt;Fujifilm has announced the X-E4, which it describes as the most compact interchangeable-lens camera in its X-series lineup. At 121.3mm x 72.9mm x 32.7mm, it’s more than a centimeter thinner than its predecessor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/7/16265570/fuji-x-e3-announced-specs-price-features"&gt;X-E3&lt;/a&gt; from 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YnETJl"&gt;The X-E series slots into Fujifilm’s lineup as an option for enthusiast photographers who prefer a rangefinder-style design to DSLR-like cameras like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21151718/fujifilm-xt4-announced-specs-pricing-ibis-stabilization-vlogging"&gt;X-T4&lt;/a&gt; but don’t need the optical viewfinder of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20927225/fujifilm-x-pro3-mirrorless-camera-specs-features-hands-on-demo-test-price-availability"&gt;X-Pro3&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, it could be viewed as an interchangeable-lens, EVF-only version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21122295/fujifilm-x100v-mirrorless-camera-lcd-announced-features-pricing"&gt;X100V&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWMdLa"&gt;Like the X100V, there’s a 26.1-megapixel X-Trans sensor, dedicated dials for shutter speed and exposure compensation, and a new tilting screen that sits flush against the body. The shutter dial now also has a “P” setting for a fully automatic program mode. The grip on the front of the X-E3 has been completely removed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pZkhNfsdA7G3D9TAhDX_Zy1pW9o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22262639/16673885_PT04_X_E4_top_XF27mm_black.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8S59Ca"&gt;For video, the X-E4 can capture 4K/30fps 4:2:0 8-bit video downsampled from 6K and store it on internal media, or output 4K/30fps 4:2:2 10-bit video over its HDMI port. It’s also capable of 1080p footage at 240fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uG0mYg"&gt;The X-E4 will be released in March for $849.95 body-only in black and silver. There’s also a $1,049.95 kit that includes a new version of Fujifilm’s 27mm f/2.8 pancake lens (pictured above); unlike its predecessor, this one is weather-resistant and has an aperture ring. It’ll be available separately in March for $399.95, as will a new $799.99 70-300mm f/4-5.6 zoom lens. &lt;/p&gt;
