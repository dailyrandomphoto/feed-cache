    <title>Victims of $200 million hack of BitMart crypto exchange still waiting to get their money back</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JOF1Hz"&gt;Cryptocurrency exchange BitMart promised a full reimbursement to the victims of the platform-wide $200 million hack, but some users still haven’t gotten their money back, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/07/cryptocurrency-theft-bitmart-still-owes-victims-of-200-million-hack.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Hackers &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/05/hackers-take-196-million-from-crypto-exchange-bitmart-in-large-breach.html"&gt;made off with a variety of tokens on December 4th&lt;/a&gt; after using a stolen privacy key to gain access to one of BitMart’s hot wallets, otherwise known as a crypto wallet that’s connected to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2At94"&gt;Shortly after the incident, &lt;a href="https://support.bmx.fund/hc/en-us/articles/4411998987419-BitMart-Security-Breach-Update"&gt;BitMart announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would use its own funding “to cover the incident and compensate affected users.” However, as &lt;em&gt;CNBC &lt;/em&gt;reports, there are still several frustrated users who have yet to see their funds returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTgPrS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;’s report details the experience of an Iranian refugee who says he stored $53,000 worth of SafeMoon on BitMart, $40,000 of which is from a loan. The outlet also got in touch with a Kansas-based investor who has $35,000 in limbo — he claims that he and 6,800 other investors may file a class-action lawsuit against BitMart if nothing’s done to resolve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0WZJv2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;WE AINT SLOWING DOWN   KEEP TWEETING &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WENBITMART?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WENBITMART&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— SAFEMOON SQUAD (@SAFEMOONSQUAD) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SAFEMOONSQUAD/status/1478393134602149891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 4, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ut2uWp"&gt;Of all the tokens stolen in the BitMart hack, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1467310381073047552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1467310381073047552%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fbitmart-hacked-for-200m-following-ethereum-binance-smart-chain-exploit"&gt;data from blockchain security company, PeckShield&lt;/a&gt;, shows that SafeMoon was hit hardest. As pointed out by &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;, SafeMoon holders are fighting back on Twitter, and have been flooding the site with the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WenBitMart"&gt;#WenBitMart&lt;/a&gt; hashtag to demand the return of their funds. This may be the only way users feel they can call attention to the issue, as &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; reports some users are met with vague responses when contacting BitMart to check on the status of their lost funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SV27NX"&gt;It remains unclear just how BitMart plans on reimbursing all affected users. &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; notes that while the exchange could buy back all of the tokens lost, it may be doing so when those tokens are at a much higher value. Other users question whether BitMart will be using some form of insurance to pay users back. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to BitMart with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox shuts down Chinese mobile app to work on a new version</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration Roblox logo seen displayed on a..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YKb-evzGcrJDIU6tk8luPu5WFy0=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70364749/1232033982.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hvajok"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; shut down the Chinese version of its iOS and Android app, also known as &lt;em&gt;LuoBuLeSi&lt;/em&gt;, just five months after its release in China, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/roblox-transition-china-luobulesi-tencent/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The app, which was rolled out as a test in &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/apps-social/article/3112379/us-gaming-platform-roblox-licensed-release-china-company-plans-go"&gt;partnership with Chinese game company Tencent&lt;/a&gt;, will be rebuilt and potentially re-released in the country at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D04Q1J"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; was officially taken off app stores on December 8th of last year, as announced on a translated version of &lt;a href="https://roblox.qq.com/web202106/news-detail.shtml?newsid=15359110"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; China’s website&lt;/a&gt;. The post thanks players for testing out the app, and says that developers will “continue to optimize the product.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NuKUQh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A number of important transitory actions are necessary” as devs rebuild the app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pWGOfn"&gt;“Last year, we launched &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; China also known as &lt;em&gt;LuoBuLeSi&lt;/em&gt; with a vision to build an immersive virtual universe of 3D experiences in China that we have been testing and iterating on along the way,” &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; spokesperson James Kay said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It is critical that we now make the necessary investments, including investments in our data architecture, in order to realize our long-term vision for &lt;em&gt;LuoBuLeSi&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BTCh2b"&gt;As for why the &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; app was removed, Kay told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “a number of important transitory actions are necessary” as the platform prepares to build another version of the app. Kay also didn’t share any additional details about when the new version will be released, noting that the company will make the information public when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZehvBs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;’s brief debut in China hasn’t been free of challenges — the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8542ddf7-0962-4019-9450-10f2ec7b9d07"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that the platform appeared to struggle against Chinese competitors, like the &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3130476/tiktok-owner-bytedance-boosts-investment-roblox-video-game"&gt;similar ByteDance-owned Reworld&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from that, &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; encountered an even bigger challenge: China itself. &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; notes that &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; was subject to China’s regulatory standards, despite marketing itself as an educational game, resulting in the censorship of some of its features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9DM3Ia"&gt;The shutdown of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; China, albeit temporary, marks the sudden cessation of yet another popular game in the country. In November, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22758154/china-fortnite-shut-down-november"&gt;Epic Games closed out a test of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in China without much of an explanation, despite the game having heavy modifications to comply with China’s strict content rules. Even more surprising, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/25/22853520/steam-global-china-banned"&gt;global version of Steam appears to be banned in China&lt;/a&gt; as of late December, perhaps to replace the service with the much more limited Chinese version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKlSTx"&gt;Ahead of all these gaming-related shutdowns, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22648107/china-curbs-gaming-addiction-3-hours-each-week-spiritual-opium"&gt;Chinese regulators compared video games to “spiritual opium”&lt;/a&gt; and began limiting kids’ screen time to just three hours per week. This is in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-50315960"&gt;a curfew that prohibits children from gaming&lt;/a&gt; between 10PM and 8AM, which is supposed to fight video game addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FAA lists 50 airports that will have 5G buffer zones ahead of C-band expansion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cell Tower" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0DUnadgi6Re0qcDz56wmLp5nbTk=/104x0:3967x2575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70364482/1234861974.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8YJChP"&gt;With AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon set to bring their 5G expansion live on January 19th, &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statements-5g"&gt;the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has chosen&lt;/a&gt; 50 airports (&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/2022-01/50%20Airports%20with%205G%20Buffer.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) that will have buffer zones to help prevent flight disruptions (via &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-faa-details-50-airports-that-will-have-5g-buffer-zones-2022-01-08/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/faa-selects-airports-for-5g-buffer-zones-11641609361"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Safety regulators picked airports based on location, traffic volume, and the likelihood of low visibility — all factors that may increase cancelations, delays, and diversions as both carriers roll out 5G C-band service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOd3oM"&gt;As pointed out by the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, notably busy airports like Chicago O’Hare, Orlando International, Los Angeles International, and Dallas / Fort Worth International are included on the list, along with airports in locations that are often impacted by foggy conditions, such as Seattle / Tacoma International and San Francisco International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e2kesa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon will turn off 5G transmitters at buffer zones for six months&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4QT6vg"&gt;The FAA notes that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have agreed to turn off their 5G transmitters at these specific buffer zones for six months, which should “minimize potential 5G interference with sensitive aircraft instruments used in low-visibility landings.” Some airports — including major hubs like Hartsfield / Jackson International and Denver International — didn’t make the list, either because they aren’t in locations where 5G C-Band deployment will take place, or they can’t permit low-visibility landings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cX0Ttp"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have been itching to deploy their improved 5G service ever since they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;spent a combined $70 billion last year&lt;/a&gt; on securing chunks of the C-band spectrum, which should provide a middle ground in terms of 5G speed and coverage — something that both carriers’ 5G service is currently lacking. The two currently offer 5G service using super fast high-band millimeter wave technology that only covers small areas, as well as the low-band spectrum, which provides a lot of coverage with slow service akin to 4G LTE. T-Mobile already offers mid-band 5G service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746708/att-5g-plus-expansion-tmobile"&gt;but it isn’t in the C-band range&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BZJsj"&gt;Both Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T were originally set to switch on their 5G expansions on December 5th, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;air safety fears delayed the launch&lt;/a&gt; twice. The carriers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863964/faa-fcc-verizon-att-c-band-5g-airports-proposal-rejected"&gt;ended up rejecting the FAA’s request&lt;/a&gt; to delay the rollout until January 5th but later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;came to an agreement&lt;/a&gt; to turn on service on January 19th, giving the FAA additional time to account for potential flight disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QcGBwX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why AT&amp;amp;amp;T and Verizon are feuding with the US government over a last-minute delay to 5G","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>The James Webb Space Telescope finishes unfolding its primary mirror, concluding major deployments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TbIaA1G_sBMWcn0nX8GCmwnYB6k=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70363978/webb_telescope_2020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Northrop Grumman&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0vJExP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-webb-telescope-reaches-major-milestone-as-mirror-unfolds"&gt;The James Webb Telescope (JWST) has finished unfolding&lt;/a&gt; its primary mirror, ending a series of major deployments that took place over the span of two weeks. All of those deployments needed to go perfectly in order for the massive space telescope, which was decades in the making, to function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fVe4b"&gt;The JWST has two primary mirror panels on either side that it will use to collect infrared light from the distant Universe. Each of them consists of three gold-plated hexagonal mirrors. Today, the rightmost wing was successfully unfurled, just one day after &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/01/07/first-of-two-primary-mirror-wings-unfolds/"&gt;the leftmost wing was deployed&lt;/a&gt;. Now that both sides have been locked into place, this completes the array of 18 mirrors that makes up the 21-foot-wide JWST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Mx89W4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Congratulations, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAWebb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NASAWebb&lt;/a&gt;! You are fully deployed!  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stay tuned over the coming months as the space telescope reaches its destination of Lagrange point 2 and prepares to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UnfoldTheUniverse?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#UnfoldTheUniverse&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="https://t.co/qg6jmVRCsH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qg6jmVRCsH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA (@NASA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1479880428878245901?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J2gL7H"&gt;The JWST &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/25/22850167/james-webb-space-telescope-jwst-launch-mission-success"&gt;launched into space&lt;/a&gt; on Christmas Day, and since the full-size mirror was too large to fit on a rocket, scientists designed it in a way that allows its components to fold, something that has never been done before. Once the JWST reached space, it began the precarious unfolding process. Earlier this week, the spacecraft pulled off its most complex hurdle: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22857571/nasa-jwst-space-telescope-sunshield-deployment-success"&gt;the deployment of a sunshield&lt;/a&gt; JWST uses to block light from the Sun and keep its instruments cold. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22816310/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-jwst-deployment-sequence"&gt;JWST now in its final form&lt;/a&gt;, scientists will have to toy with the mirrors a bit more to ensure that they’re aligned, as well as continue to calibrate its instruments to get it ready to reveal the Universe’s secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5rohz"&gt;In about two more weeks, the JWST will reach its final destination in deep space. We’re going to have to wait until summer to get some of the first images from the JWST, but it will likely be worth the wait.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Older Honda and Acura models hit by Y2K22 bug that resets clocks 20 years in the past</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kuXGxa"&gt;Owners of older Honda and Acura models started up their cars on New Year’s Day, only to find that their vehicles turned into time machines, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/honda-clocks-are-stuck-20-years-in-the-past-and-this-mi-1848306970"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jalopnik&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of seamlessly transitioning to the year 2022, cars’ clocks jumped 20 years back in time, and Honda says a fix could be months away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="QgbxUj"&gt;As spotted by &lt;em&gt;Jalopnik&lt;/em&gt;, reports of digital clock issues have been popping up in &lt;a href="https://www.ridgelineownersclub.com/threads/time-date-issues-beginning-january-1-2022-latest-update-in-first-post.230330/"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://acurazine.com/forums/3g-tl-audio-bluetooth-electronics-navigation-94/navigation-system-doesnt-know-day-wont-allow-clock-adjustment-991736/"&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Acura/comments/rv4cj1/digital_clock_issue/"&gt;Acura&lt;/a&gt; forums all over the internet, with the issue only affecting older vehicles with navigation. It’s not clear exactly which years are affected, but judging by user reports, it looks like the issue is prevalent in models released from 2006 to 2014 in the US, Canada, and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPqqV7"&gt;No matter the year or model, the Y2K22 problem manifests itself in the same way — the date shown on the navigation system has been reverted to the year 2002 and displays a time that’s several hours off. Some users mention that the separate radio clock shows an incorrect time as well, and even if they attempt to manually tweak the time and date, the system doesn’t appear to save those changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPK4z9"&gt;“American Honda is aware of a potential concern related to the clock display on certain older Acura and Honda models equipped with navigation systems,” Honda spokesperson Chris Naughton told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We are currently investigating this issue to determine possible countermeasures and have no additional details to share at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FGqkCq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The problem might be related to a coding oversight&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5Cg5uU"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.crvownersclub.com/threads/2022-clock-fault-official-honda-responses-all-models.224397/"&gt;post on the CR-V Owners forum&lt;/a&gt; shows a more detailed response from both Honda in the US and the UK, with the US representative noting that drivers could experience the issue from January to August 2022 and that the system will “auto-correct” itself after this period. Meanwhile, the UK spokesperson doesn’t provide an exact timeline for the fix, but says that the “Honda technical department are currently working on this” and that “a service bulletin will be issued to our dealers from Honda UK on how to fix this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71uGmn"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Jalopnik&lt;/em&gt;, it’s possible that the issue could be caused by a coding complication. Jacalar, a user on the &lt;a href="https://www.driveaccord.net/threads/clock-issue-beginning-january-1-2022.561541/post-6865514"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drive Accord&lt;/em&gt; forum&lt;/a&gt;, says that after diving into their navigation system’s diagnostic menu, they noticed that the date on the GPS was set to May 19th, 2002, which is 1,024 weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfLljt"&gt;As explained by &lt;em&gt;Jalopnik&lt;/em&gt;, a GPS uses a starting point, otherwise known as an epoch, to determine the date and time. This information is sent out to GPS devices in a string of 10 binary digits that represents the current week, which starts at zero and ends at 1,023 — the number is supposed to return to zero on week 1,024. Ever since the &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/oe/articles/april-2019-global-positioning-system-gps-week-number-rollover"&gt;first week zero was set on January 6th, 1980&lt;/a&gt;, we &lt;a href="https://www.gps.gov/support/user/rollover/"&gt;experience a widescale GPS week number rollover every 19.7 years&lt;/a&gt;, with the first occurring in August 1999, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/8/18255847/gps-week-rollover-issue-2019-garmin-tomtom-devices-affected"&gt;most recent on April 6th, 2019&lt;/a&gt;. It’s possible that Honda’s navigation software didn’t account for a rollover to happen on New Year’s Day, potentially due to a coding oversight, causing navigation systems to return to the beginning of the set calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TImlWE"&gt;Apparently, this isn’t the first time that the clocks in Hondas and Acuras have been affected by such a strange problem. On August 16th, 2017, a day that coincides with the 40th anniversary of Elvis Presley’s death, &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/hondas-and-acuras-from-1999-2004-had-their-clocks-fail-1798427017"&gt;the navigation systems on older Honda and Acura models failed&lt;/a&gt; completely and were mysteriously stuck on 0:00.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford doesn’t want the F-150 Lightning’s launch to be plagued by scalpers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qTEoorPx69nMBIdDv5I-J-FlEI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70363645/akrales_20210526_4595_0284.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PLZ6zy"&gt;Ford is fighting to keep the 2022 F-150 Lightning from being scalped — the company has sent a notice offering to help dealers prevent 2022 F-150 Lightning buyers from reselling their trucks, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ford-f-150-lightning-customers-reselling-trucks-scalpers/"&gt;according to a report from CNET&lt;/a&gt;. If a dealer chooses to add a no-sale provision provided by Ford to its contracts, the buyer will have to agree to “not sell, offer to sell or otherwise transfer ownership interest in the Vehicle prior to the first anniversary of the date hereof.” The notice also warns dealers against trying to raise the prices of the trucks themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHjmAE"&gt;While the move could help stop people trying to turn their reservation for the electric pickup into a payday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZacksJerryRig/status/1479616762538651649?s=20"&gt;some have criticized the move&lt;/a&gt; as Ford trying to control what people do with their property. The Lightning, though, is releasing at a time when cars can be hard to get a hold of — &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/prices-used-autos-soars-average-30000/"&gt;the value of used cars has been skyrocketing&lt;/a&gt; as auto manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/43774/yes-the-chip-shortage-will-still-screw-the-auto-industry-in-2022"&gt;struggle to keep up with the demand&lt;/a&gt; for new vehicles. Some dealers have even been adding their own markups, with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/austinnotduncan/status/1476000409420328967?s=20"&gt;potential buyers reporting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jon4Lakers/status/1475999511927398400"&gt;tens of thousands of dollars in extra fees&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tlNR0T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's a story.  I was originally going to get a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MercedesBenzUSA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@MercedesBenzUSA&lt;/a&gt; EQS 580. Even had one reserved and ready for pickup.  The dealer called to inform me there was a $50k (not a typo) markup on the car.  I passed.  Infer what you will about the dealer model protecting consumers. &lt;a href="https://t.co/XIbzdzB5CX"&gt;https://t.co/XIbzdzB5CX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Rettinger (@Jon4Lakers) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jon4Lakers/status/1475999511927398400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3EarKs"&gt;CNET and &lt;a href="https://www.teslarati.com/ford-f150-lightning-no-markups-dealerships/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teslarati&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; note that Ford’s message to dealerships also warns dealers that they might not receive any Lightnings in 2022 if they ask customers for extra deposits or payments, which the memo says is seen as “threatening customers by withholding their opportunity to convert reservations to orders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8Rd1M"&gt;Ford’s not being as strict with its customers — whether they have to agree to the no-sale provision is up to the dealer. A Ford spokesperson told CNET that the “requirement is between a dealer and their customer,” and said that it was the dealer’s choice whether to include the provision if it’s legally allowed in their state. In &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/559386/ford-threatens-dealers-f150-lightning/"&gt;a screenshot&lt;/a&gt; (originally posted on the &lt;a href="https://www.f150gen14.com/forum/threads/%E2%9A%A0%EF%B8%8F-ford-warns-dealers-against-additional-deposit-reservation-requirements-for-lightning-orders-supports-no-resale-provisions-in-purchase-contracts.7961/"&gt;F150 Gen14 forum&lt;/a&gt;) reporting to show the message sent to dealers, it is clear that it’s optional — but it also says that Ford is “offering support” for the provision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o3z8Cu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford says it’s gotten around 200,000 deposits for the electric pickup&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RwMcDf"&gt;Ford’s upcoming electric pickup seems to be hotly anticipated — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826469/ford-f150-lightning-ev-deposits-reservations-closed"&gt;the company said&lt;/a&gt; that around 200,000 people had put down $100 deposits for it between May and December 2021. The company has also stopped taking reservations for the truck, which is meant to start shipping in the first half of this year. Ford &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865664/ford-f150-lightning-double-production-150000-annual"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s aiming to make 150,000 F-150 Lightnings by mid-2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDOTDA"&gt;Scalping has been a major frustration for consumers, as manufacturers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867285/gm-toyota-us-top-selling-automaker-chip-shortage"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22775829/sony-ps5-supply-chip-shortage-forecast-cut"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;, and others have wrangled with production slowdowns caused by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping"&gt;the ongoing chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;. Some retailers have tried to slow down resellers by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"&gt;only making stock available to paid subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s still difficult to get your hands on gaming tech like the PS5, Xbox Series X, or graphics cards (unless you’re willing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22797788/price-ps5-xbox-nvidia-amd-rtx-gpu-scalpers-ebay-update"&gt;pay scalpers’ exorbitant prices&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMtwUP"&gt;It’s possible that demand for Ford’s EV could remain high throughout the next year, due to scarce competition. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22863648/chevy-silverado-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;electric Silverado announced at CES this year&lt;/a&gt; isn’t set to start production until spring 2023 (and Chevy says the first trucks to roll off the line will be its $105,000 RST First Edition). Rivian, which is still working through its pre-orders, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22857344/rivian-r1t-max-battery-pack-delay-2023-electric-truck-manufacturing-amazon"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; that models with the expanded battery were delayed until 2023, and Tesla’s Cybertruck still doesn’t have a solid release date (though it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828220/tesla-cybertruck-prototype-drone-shot-windshield-wiper-elon-musk"&gt;was recently spotted on a test track&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s high-end Surface Pro 8 is $300 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user types on the Surface Pro 8 from behind.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9goddc"&gt;After a string of big shopping holidays, we landed on the first big tech event of 2022. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22870203/ces-2022-best-of-gadgets-concepts-tech"&gt;I’m talking about CES 2022&lt;/a&gt;, for which &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; produced dozens of articles. All sorts of new, exciting products were announced, and hopefully, some of them may show up in this deals newsletter once they launch later in the year. As for this weekend’s deals, we’re focusing on some hot products that we think will make your life a little better. Stay warm out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="osVjbv"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zyMlHe"&gt;A specced-out Surface Pro 8 costs $1,599.99 at Best Buy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xBrEB9"&gt;Look, it’s never affordable to get the most high-end version of a sought-after tablet. That’s why most people choose to get the most affordable one and call it a day. However, if you are after a Windows tablet that can offer big performance, a 120Hz refresh rate display, and other fine qualities highlighted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review"&gt;in our Surface Pro 8 review by Monica Chin&lt;/a&gt;, check out Best Buy’s current deal. Normally $1,899.99, Microsoft’s Surface Pro 8 with 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and Intel’s Core i7-1185G7 processor &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgnoBPoYOfv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is just $1,599.99&lt;/a&gt;. Note: you’ll need to supply &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgnoCODEP6M" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Type Cover&lt;/a&gt; if you want an accessory that can provide a keyboard and a screen cover, which usually costs about $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vRbMcG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10771697"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="qF40gQ"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z4oC78"&gt;For something cheaper, Lenovo’s Chrome OS 10e tablet is just $100&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uldiB3"&gt;There are people who are ready to pay $1,599.99 on a tablet, and those who aren’t. Whether you need a tablet for entertainment, or just one to pass off to your kid, Lenovo’s 10e might be a better fit. First off, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Flaptops%2Flenovo%2Flenovo-edu-chromebooks%2Flenovo-10e-chromebook-tablet%2F22ed10e10e1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F8%2F22872077%2Fmicrosoft-surface-pro-8-windows-oneplus-9-nintendo-switch-chrome-tablet-airpods-apple-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s on sale at Lenovo for $99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $334 (discount applies at checkout), which is about 6 percent of the Surface Pro 8’s total cost. The 10e isn’t trying to compete with the best of them, though, it’s a better deal than most 10-inch tablets offer these days (especially if you’re trying to avoid Amazon’s Fire tablets). It has a glossy, 1920 x 1200 IPS touchscreen that can get plenty bright with 400-nit peak brightness, as well as 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. It can also handle video calls and photos with its front- and rear-facing cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aoSNcp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10966390"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xOXyz8"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Fire Emblem: Three Houses" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I8mLpFQ-n3BvHEUu0gHAxjQ8V-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16343458/SW_FireEmblemThreeHouses_ND0213_SCRN_10.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UJVr9O"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/em&gt; (a real gem of a Switch game) is $40 at Walmart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OZ9FZl"&gt;If you’re striking out on ideas for your next game, I’ll go to bat for &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/em&gt; to anyone who will listen. It’s a turn-based strategy game that never gets so deep that its mechanics become entangled, and outside of battles, its gripping stories takes place at a university where, as their teacher, you’ll befriend many of your fellow soldiers as you strengthen them for battle. The writing is stellar, as is the music. Normally $59.99, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FFire-Emblem-Three-House-Switch-Nintendo-Digital-Download%2F301066340&amp;amp;sharedid=vergedeals01082022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart has digital copies of this game for $39.99&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726336/fire-emblem-three-houses-review-nintendo-switch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oGWzkL"&gt;The OnePlus 9 is $599.99 through January 22nd&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="raIA5f"&gt;The OnePlus 9 is a fine phone if you value having some of the most capable specs — including a Snapdragon 888, a 120Hz refresh rate screen, and a great ultrawide camera —without spending flagship-level prices. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our reviewer Allison Johnson thinks&lt;/a&gt; most people should be happy with the OnePlus 9 over the 9 Pro, though it won’t please photographers who crave main camera stabilization and a telephoto lens. Otherwise, this phone can give the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google’s Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;, which normally starts at $599, a run for its money. Right now, you can pick up an unlocked, 128GB model with 8GB of RAM at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf17Og6sSZa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad-Wireless/dp/B08Y73NTXY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $599.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DZ6TLp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10454529"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ffVPXA"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MyMl4W"&gt;Apple’s latest AirPods Pro are 26 percent off at Woot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3tvn7"&gt;It’s possible that you may have missed out on the many great deals happening on Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds that support active noise cancellation and MagSafe charging. If that’s the case, check out Woot’s deal that knocks the price &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=vergedeals01082022&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fnew-apple-airpods-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;all the way down to $184.99&lt;/a&gt;, a 26 percent discount off their original $250 price. You may recall better prices than this on the AirPods Pro, but that was likely the previous-gen model that omitted the MagSafe feature. All AirPods Pro models support spatial audio, and they can easily pair with Apple devices with their H1 wireless chip.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Computer monitors were inventive and interesting at CES 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-0ZNZVbyi87YE0nsyM2mPNv257Q=/93x0:1085x661/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70363336/LG_DualUp_Lifestyle_00.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cR05b2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22871243/ces-2022-recap-biggest-news"&gt;CES had a pretty good year&lt;/a&gt;, and that extends to computer monitors, which thankfully were about more than mere ports. What’s better is that this year’s interesting, feature-packed monitors are for more than just gamers. Monitors play an even more important role during the pandemic as the centerpiece of the home office, and manufacturers have responded to that demand with designs that suit a larger audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eIdlKi"&gt;We got a quirky-looking, nearly-square creative- and productivity-focused monitor from LG that some people will find useful. Samsung debuted its Odyssey Ark, a 55-inch curved 4K gaming monitor that I’d feel safe floating on when the waters come. Speaking of Samsung, the company’s display division found a suitable monitor to debut its new QD-OLED screen tech in: Alienware’s 34-inch curved gaming monitor. This is just the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzJuzc"&gt;Last year’s CES show was mostly about HDMI 2.1, since the new wave of consoles, the PS5 and Xbox Series X, had recently arrived with the promise of displaying games in 4K at up to 120 frames per second (ironically, few games can achieve this a year later). We still love seeing that port popping up in new monitors and TVs since higher-bandwidth HDMI ports will futureproof your big investment and make your content look the best that it possibly can. But, at the end of the day, it’s just a port. And thankfully, many of CES 2022’s best monitors come with it in tow, in addition to some more unique talking points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRRM0V"&gt;Here are the most interesting monitors to come out of CES this year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AlwL_oQcjdP17xFJe9jfsu7I1UE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128704/cwelch_211209_4929_0027.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s new 42-inch OLED TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="miZrD1"&gt;One model that’s sure to be popular isn’t technically a gaming monitor but a TV. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features"&gt;LG’s 42-inch C2 OLED&lt;/a&gt;, and that size is the smallest TV panel that LG has produced yet — a far more reasonably-sized desk mate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv"&gt;than its 48-inch C1 model&lt;/a&gt; from 2021. Even though it’s a TV, it has all of the most important gaming monitor specs, like HDMI 2.1 ports, variable refresh rate, auto low latency mode, a 120Hz refresh rate, and a near-instant response time. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus PG42UQ gaming monitor" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Alv_hpbpCwVN6K70RpEKMHJGig=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145180/pg42uqdisplay.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s Asus’ take on the 42-inch OLED in its upcoming monitor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yW4EFp"&gt;Given its gaming credentials, several brands will likely utilize LG’s 42-inch OLED panel in their monitors. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6yZXFDWTD19IBSZOaUAG2Ouu-Us=/0x0:2040x1360/920x613/filters:focal(857x517:1183x843):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347297/pg42uqdisplay.0.jpg"&gt;Asus is the first&lt;/a&gt;, announcing a 42-inch OLED gaming display at CES 2022, with a design and stand that looks different from LG’s TV design. It seems similar in most ways, though it has the all-important DisplayPort for more connectivity options, in addition to its HDMI 2.1 and HDMI 2.0 ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GrBn6s"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Alienware CES 2022|105442" data-volume-uuid="a7605bbcb" data-volume-id="105442" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-237" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h6uWR3"&gt;There are still burn-in concerns among those who want to use an OLED for productivity or gaming. The verdict’s not yet out on some of these newer models until either they release and people have a chance to test them or until manufacturers make assurances. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855531/alienware-curved-34-inch-qd-oled-samsung-gaming-monitor-specs"&gt;Alienware’s 34-inch QD-OLED gaming monitor&lt;/a&gt;, coming out in March 2022, is setting a high bar for those assurances, coming with “improved OLED reliability” and a three-year premium warranty that covers OLED burn-in. Importantly, we don’t know the price of this model, but perhaps its warranty will balloon the price a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lXQdqs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here is a first look at the INSANE Odyssey Ark from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Samsung?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Samsung&lt;/a&gt;! This is a curved 55" 4K Monitor with a 16:9 aspect ratio... Can do some serious gaming/multitasking on this! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ces?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ces&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/samsung?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#samsung&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Y82hbeY9gg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Y82hbeY9gg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Schofield (@qbking77) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/qbking77/status/1478555909068505088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QmWdkK"&gt;I touched on it earlier, but I can’t talk about gaming without again &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867790/samsung-odyssey-arc-curved-gaming-monitor"&gt;mentioning Samsung’s gargantuan Odyssey Ark monitor&lt;/a&gt;. It has Samsung’s signature 1000R curve, which is as curvy as mainstream monitors come these days, but it brings that curvature in a 55-inch screen — the biggest it has produced yet — with a 16:9 aspect ratio that makes it look like a big, curved TV right in front of your face. It won’t be a surprise if the Ark can provide an unmatched gaming experience, but its form factor seems like a boon for multitasking productivity, too. The Ark’s stand allows the screen to rotate vertically, allowing you to stack applications as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ug78HV"&gt;There’s a lot that Samsung hasn’t shared about the Ark yet, but it apparently features quantum dot color and Mini LED backlighting. The Ark seemed like a good monitor for Samsung to debut its QD-OLED tech in, but alas. That honor goes to the aforementioned Alienware’s 34-inch curved (1800R) QD-OLED gaming monitor coming out in March. The Ark, on the other hand, is coming out in the second half of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="moMngn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung announced a smaller 4K version of its curviest, best-looking gaming monitor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22860012/samsung-odyssey-neo-g8-4k-240hz-refresh-rate-monitor-mini-led-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="E7c9po"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10960910"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dWijZn"&gt;CES 2022 also saw the debut of Asus’ ROG Swift PG27AQN, the world’s first 27-inch QHD display that has a 360Hz refresh rate (that speed was previously limited to 1080p). So, now gamers don’t need to sacrifice visual quality to see titles running at the fast speeds necessary to remain on the top of their game. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866475/nvidia-g-sync-esports-monitors-1080p-1440p-support"&gt;Nvidia also had some cool display announcements that were geared toward competitive gamers&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these QHD 360Hz gaming monitors from AOC, MSI, and ViewSonic have Mini LED panels for more vibrance and more accurate colors and lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yV32kV"&gt;And with Nvidia software, they support what the company’s calling dual-format resolution (illustrated above), letting gamers take full advantage of these 27-inch displays in QHD if they want, with the option to shrink the screen real estate to see games running in 1080p, which is still a popular resolution for pro gamers. The latter option emulates the experience of playing on a 25-inch 1080p monitor without worrying about having the image stretched on a QHD screen, which can reduce the image quality. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung Smart Monitor M8" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g6MKWL4bOX__PWSkVGsWhP-jsz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23139309/m82.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SlimFit camera can be magnetically attached for video calls, then detached afterward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ilLp80"&gt;CES 2022’s monitors weren’t all about gaming, though. Samsung’s smart monitor lineup got a new model, the 32-inch 4K M8, which touts new features that look useful. Despite being a monitor, it requires no extra hardware to stream TV shows and movies, as most TVs are equipped to do these days. What’s new for this model is the included SlimFit camera that can attach to it magnetically for video calls. The M8 can serve as a SmartThings hub for your connected IoT devices at home. Samsung is also debuting Game Home, a feature that essentially turns the M8 into a could game streaming monitor, capable of connecting to various services and to various controllers. Samsung hasn’t nailed down those final details yet, but it could be exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3hm-icD2LZYwj9YPX5IGVnLxIKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23118778/dualup.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s DualUp monitor rocks a 16:18 aspect ratio, which is a rarity in the industry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7xZjZx"&gt;Swinging back to the monitor that I mentioned first in this post, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848957/lg-dualup-32-inch-4k-ultra-fine-monitors-announced-specs"&gt;LG’s squarish 16:18 aspect ratio monitor called the DualUp&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of our readers excited. LG says that it offers “the same screen real estate as two 21.5-inch displays and has a vertical split view function that lets users see more in one glance.” This one isn’t for me, but it’s still easy to see how it could benefit people who need a tall display that’s also high-res with a 2560 x 2880 resolution. LG says that its form factor has ergonomic benefits since you don’t need to move your neck from side to side. It looks similar to the monitor featured in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750729/teenage-engineering-computer-1-mini-itx-case-features-price"&gt;Teenage Engineering’s marketing for its Computer-1 DIY PC case&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoS5z6"&gt;The best thing about monitors that debuted at CES 2022 is that there was something for everyone, creatives, gamers, or those who just appreciate big, beautiful, and capable displays that they want to hook up to a PC, macOS computer, or a console. Thinking about all of these announcements has put me in a good mood, and I’ll probably exist in this delightful honeymoon bubble until manufacturers share prices (&lt;em&gt;none &lt;/em&gt;of them will be cheap). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why clean energy advocates are divided over California’s plan to slash solar incentives</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Solar panels are installed on the roofs of zero energy model homes, as seen on Thurs. May 17, 2018 in Clovis, Ca. The EnVision planned community, by De Young properties is the first of it’s kind in Central California and largest in the State of California" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ymzyowfeCTida7D5gqohgR54GmQ=/279x0:5481x3468/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70363281/1321809330.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e7a9vz"&gt;California could soon end the perks it has been giving to residents with rooftop solar on their homes, even as it pledges to move entirely to &lt;a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/news/2021-03/california-releases-report-charting-path-100-percent-clean-electricity"&gt;clean electricity&lt;/a&gt;. While the move might seem counterintuitive, environmental advocates are divided on whether the changes will help the state meet its climate goals and benefit lower-income residents or harm both efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaMBgs"&gt;They’re split on a &lt;a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/news-and-updates/all-news/cpuc-proposal-aims-to-modernize-state-decarbonization-incentive-efforts"&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; made last month by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) that would slash solar incentives for customers of investor-owned utilities, implement a new monthly fee to connect solar customers to the grid, and create a $600 million fund to help underrepresented communities gain access to solar panels and batteries. Industry and some conservation groups say the changes would end California’s solar boom. Tesla recently went so far as to send its employees &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2022/01/03/tesla-asks-employees-fight-back-against-new-proposal-destroy-solar-market/"&gt;talking points&lt;/a&gt; on how to fight back against the proposal. But other environmental and consumer advocates support the proposal and say California needs to do things differently to help lower-income residents who haven’t received as many benefits from rooftop solar to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpT4Dt"&gt;California has more homes with rooftop PV panels than any other state. That’s thanks in part to a history of generous incentives for people with home solar systems. If someone doesn’t use up all the solar energy their panels collect, they can sell it back to the grid. Under the state’s “net metering” program, they can sell it at the same retail rate at which they would buy electricity. The program is supposed to help people recoup the costs of installing their solar system. But if the CPUC ultimately votes to approve its new proposal, the selling price would drop dramatically to better reflect the commission’s estimates of what that energy is actually worth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Lwg42x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People are almost in tears”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KSYPXV"&gt;That has solar industry folks freaking out. “People are almost in tears, you know, like grown men that built their whole life around their business and their company,” says Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar &amp;amp; Storage Association. Her group is one out of about &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eB85J3qRSeFn6dz5mPG_un34s7Q5IJ4c/edit"&gt;600 organizations&lt;/a&gt; that have put together a coalition to stop the CPUC’s proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsESLM"&gt;Opponents of the proposal worry that if people don’t earn as much by selling energy back to the grid, they won’t be able to recoup the tens of thousands of dollars they might have spent installing the system. While the CPUC thinks solar customers could recoup those costs within ten years, critics say the new proposal would greatly stretch out the amount of time it would take to do so. On top of that, the CPUC wants to impose a new monthly “grid participation charge” of $8 per kW that could come out to several hundred dollars a year, to go toward maintaining the grid. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Solar panels demonstration in California" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_rMvTIfDA06VNd-Newiyk8LXMBY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23153217/1237104239.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Aníbal Martel / Anadolu Agency via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;People take part in an event to hand-deliver 100,000 public comments from Californians throughout the state calling on Governor Newsom to reject proposals that slash solar incentives for consumers outside the California State Capitol Museum in Sacramento, California, United States on December 8th, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qrpEZA"&gt;Cost is already a big barrier for middle and lower-income people who might otherwise be interested in solar panels. And critics of the CPUC’s proposal say their plan makes things much worse — putting solar even more out of reach for middle and lower-income households. “It would devastate any efforts to increase equity and inclusion that would make solar for everybody,” says Del Chiaro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IZtUp"&gt;The CPUC, on the other hand, says that the net metering program “disproportionately harms low-income ratepayers” and “negatively impacts” customers without rooftop solar. It, and proponents of its new proposal, say the policy shift will keep electricity rates lower for people without home solar systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4brAK1"&gt;Today, utilities are charging more for electricity across the board to pay for net metering. That’s because the rates that early solar adopters earned from selling energy back to the grid are up to six times higher than its actual value, according to the CPUC and environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). They &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/mohit-chhabra/rooftop-solar-california-ready-take-next-step"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; that the actual value to the grid is about 5 cents per kW. But someone with a home solar system might earn 30 cents per kW because they’re selling it at the retail rate, which is higher because &lt;a href="https://energyathaas.wordpress.com/2021/06/01/rooftop-solar-inequity/"&gt;it includes costs&lt;/a&gt; like maintaining the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uhLIN6"&gt;To make that money back, utilities drive up electricity rates, including for people who don’t own solar panels. Non-solar customers pay between $60 to $200 more on their bills each year as a result, according to one &lt;a href="https://www.next10.org/sites/default/files/2021-02/Next10-electricity-rates-v2.pdf"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="aPO0ak"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Greening the grid should not be cutting off vulnerable communities because the bills are too damn high.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3LLfAn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37072"&gt;One in three&lt;/a&gt; Americans already struggles to pay their electricity bills. And consumer advocates who support the CPUC proposal don’t want the net metering program to exacerbate the problem. “Greening the grid should not be cutting off vulnerable communities because the bills are too damn high,” says Mark Toney, executive director of the consumer advocacy group The Utility Reform Network (TURN). “Our thing is we want the most green for the least green.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkzLGx"&gt;The NRDC supports the CPUC’s decision to slash net metering payouts because it says keeping electricity as cheap as possible is crucial to transitioning the economy over to renewable energy. Experts see electrification as key to weaning cars and homes off oil and gas. But that’ll only happen if electricity is affordable in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRsK7Q"&gt;“The first priority really is clean, affordable power for everyone,” says Mohit Chhabra, a senior scientist at NRDC. Home solar systems aren’t the only way to achieve that, he points out. It might come from more utility-scale solar and wind farms. “Everybody needs to be able to pay their bills, meet their energy needs — it needs to be clean and pollution free [energy] — and then figure out where rooftop solar belongs in that mix,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y9MQc"&gt;Del Chiaro’s coalition of opponents &lt;a href="https://calssa.org/blog/2021/6/5/debunking-the-cost-shift-debate"&gt;disputes&lt;/a&gt; the CPUC’s estimates of how much utilities are overpaying solar customers through net metering. These groups say that utilities are already charging customers too much for things like wildfire liability and building out more power lines, and that the CPUC’s proposal reflects another money grab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="526VrF"&gt;All the stakeholders — even though they disagree on what should happen to net metering — say they want to see more equitable access to home solar systems, especially for neighborhoods that have been disproportionately saddled with the pollution from fossil fuels. Net metering as it’s currently structured “has not enabled rooftop solar to adequately penetrate” those communities, the California Environmental Justice Alliance, a key group that represents those communities, said in a &lt;a href="https://caleja.org/2021/09/california-ej-organizations-issue-statement-on-rooftop-solar-and-distributed-generation-in-california/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1Svjw"&gt;A small percentage of low income households that qualify for assistance on their bill have rooftop solar and participate in net metering. But Toney says that they got an unfair deal under the old program. Since they qualify for up to a 35 percent discount on their electricity bills, and net metering pays people based on how much they pay for electricity, they also earned 35 percent less than other households in the program. That’s no longer a problem under the CPUC’s new proposal. Del Chiaro agrees that it was a problem that needed to be fixed, but says that it can be addressed without making the other drastic changes CPUC has proposed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrfsuI"&gt;The California Environmental Justice Alliance has yet to weigh in on the CPUC’s new proposal, but some of its recommendations for improving equity seemingly make it into the CPUC’s proposal. For one, the monthly grid participation charge won’t apply to low-income and tribal households. Low-income households and buildings under &lt;a href="https://www.pge.com/en_US/small-medium-business/energy-alternatives/private-solar/understand-the-solar-process/multifamily-affordable-solar-housing-program.page"&gt;certain affordable housing programs&lt;/a&gt; would also be able to stay on their current net metering program for now, while the program would be phased out for other existing customers in 15 years. To make the shift easier for new solar customers, the proposal includes a Market Transition Credit of up to $5.25 per kW for people who sign up within four years, which would then be applied for the next ten years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bq9sY3"&gt;Del Chiaro says the exemptions still don’t cover everyone who might struggle more to pay for rooftop solar under the CPUC’s new plan. That includes low and moderate income households and apartment buildings that don’t qualify for financial assistance.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The CPUC says that if its proposal is implemented, it will evaluate the program’s impact on equity over five years and determine if it needs to broaden eligibility requirements for financial assistance or make other changes.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bt47Zg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The up-front installation cost of solar panels also presents a major barrier&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P6AFzz"&gt;For low-income residents, the up-front installation cost of solar panels also presents a major barrier. The CPUC’s proposal creates a $600 million fund to improve access to solar panels and batteries in low-income communities, which could help them get over that hurdle. Details of how the fund will be set up are still in the works, but that money could potentially come from adding an extra charge to solar customers who are not enrolled in financial assistance programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cB0ozM"&gt;The CPUC proposal also includes rebates for existing solar customers who pair their panels with batteries and transition off the old net metering program over the next four years.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Encouraging solar customers to buy batteries is supposed to help reduce pressure on the grid whenever it’s at peak demand — which is usually in the evenings when people come home from work and when the sun is no longer shining. Batteries can also help keep the lights on at home if people lose power due to bad weather, which has been happening more often in California because of the risk of power lines sparking wildfires when conditions are hot, dry, and windy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDx5TT"&gt;But the California Solar and Storage Association, which represents businesses that sell solar panels and batteries, thinks the CPUC’s plan will backfire. Making it more expensive to have a solar system at home will only be a disincentive for people wanting to install panels or batteries, Del Chiaro says. Still, not all future homeowners will have a choice: in 2020, a state &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/9/17335832/california-solar-panel-housing-politics-renewable-energy"&gt;mandate&lt;/a&gt; kicked in that requires newly constructed homes to include solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjnfZ6"&gt;While there’s still a long way to go to close disparities in solar access, Del Chiaro points to &lt;a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/solar-demographics-tool"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; showing that in recent years, solar adoption has grown more quickly in lower income brackets than in higher income brackets. That’s the trend she wants to keep going, which might lead to a legal battle if the CPUC ultimately votes to approve its proposal. That vote could happen as soon as January 27th, after a period for the public to give their comments — which are flowing into the &lt;a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/news-and-updates/all-news/cpuc-proposal-aims-to-modernize-state-decarbonization-incentive-efforts"&gt;CPUC website&lt;/a&gt; with fervor from nervous solar customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matter was a major star at CES 2022, but can it maintain its shine?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EBXir3kjq9I1d6ytDmFpibP4X-g=/70x14:1825x1184/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70363131/Matter_Samsung.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung touted its plans for Matter compatibility in its pre-show keynote at CES 2022.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6lClSD"&gt;Two years ago, on the floor of CES 2020, there was a lot of buzz about a chip — not the latest AMD or Intel announcement, but a new alliance of major tech companies that called itself Project Connected Home over IP, or CHIP for short. Its promise was to develop an open-source smart home standard that would make every connected home device work together, simply and securely, regardless of who made them. The buzz was: “That’s never gonna happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wa3xPc"&gt;Fast forward to CES 2022 (yeah, we all skipped 2021) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt; — as CHIP is now called — was the darling of the show, with a full dance card and a line of admirers that stretched to the virtual Starbucks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHlrak"&gt;Practically every smart home device announcement this week had the tagline “and we announce our support for Matter.” Plus, the infrastructure gained significant support. There were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865815/nxp-tri-radio-chip-wi-fi-6-bluetooth-5-2-thread-smart-home-gadgets-ces-2022"&gt;new chips designed for Matter&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon announced device makers can now add &lt;a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2022/01/ces-amazon-announces-new-matter-support-device-makers.html"&gt;Frustration-Free Setup on their Matter-certified devices&lt;/a&gt; with just the Matter SDK— no Amazon-specific SDK required. And Google showed off its own version of a simplified setup, &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/android/CES2022-bettertogether/"&gt;Fast Pair&lt;/a&gt; with built-in support for Matter. Both these announcements mean that as developers build new smart home products, all you’ll have to do once you get them home is plug them in and they’ll be ready to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nN2Fd"&gt;“The wave of Matter news at CES from our CSA members is a testament to the hard work that has gone into the development and testing of Matter in 2021,” Tobin Richardson, president of the Connectivity Standards Alliance that oversees Matter, told me during the show. “Hundreds of companies and thousands of engineers are at the heart of this global solution, creating a more open and innovative IoT, and I’m really excited by what is to come in 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="k6m8A0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Matter’s plan to save the smart home ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tXGQyS"&gt;The other interesting announcement was confirmation from Amazon that Alexa will share your smart home with other voice assistants. The main promise of Matter has been cross-platform compatibility, that you will be able to control your smart devices with the app or voice assistant of your choice. Now we’re seeing exactly how that will be done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9BgVq"&gt;Amazon introduced &lt;a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2022/01/ces-amazon-announces-new-matter-support-device-makers.html"&gt;new tools for developers&lt;/a&gt; that let them add Alexa as an additional way to control a device already set up in another system. While today you can control, say, a Philips Hue lightbulb with multiple apps and voice assistants, you currently have to set it up with each one individually. With Matter, it’ll be one and done. As a nice bonus, this new capability also adds local connectivity to the device, allowing for quicker response times and the chance to use your devices even if the internet is down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="FPnLz9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We want smart home products to work together. Now make it happen.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6wok4m"&gt;In all, close to 30 companies showcased their involvement and / or pledged their support for the new smart home standard backed by Apple, Google, Amazon, Samsung, and others. Many of whom represent a broader slice of the industry — &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tuya-officially-announces-support-for-matter-smart-home-standard-301456017.html"&gt;Tuya Smart&lt;/a&gt;, an IoT development platform service provider based in China that supports over 446,000 developers with over 1,100 smart home products, said it will support Matter. We also saw a number of new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22870187/smart-home-gadget-ces-2022-roundup-samsung-wemo-eve"&gt;products debut with Thread&lt;/a&gt;, one of the main protocols of Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KOGnkK_kkDT3_uSTqNPGdKOLscM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23153148/nxp_advances_iot_connectivity_with_industrys_first_secure_tr.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NXP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NXP’s new tri-radio chip (Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, and Thread) is designed for Matter hub devices —Matter Controllers (such as smart speakers) and Thread Border Routers (such as smart displays).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LGPzDp"&gt;All of this gives us a much better feel for what Matter will bring with it when it finally arrives, it’s currently scheduled for June 2022. But let’s take a step back and assess now that CES is over and we’re faced with a bleak mid-winter before Matter gets here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIL21L"&gt;It seems like there is significant momentum, minimal in-fighting (that we’ve seen), and a clear directive from the consumer and direction for the manufacturers and platforms: We want smart home products to work together. Now make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="Bxhpcb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s imperative that Matter doesn’t leave existing smart homes in the dark. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Fr5p9"&gt;The momentum is big enough that it appears to have convinced the major appliance companies of the world to do the same thing. They went off and created their own alliance aimed at making sure your Samsung dishwasher can talk to your GE Appliances fridge. &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-joins-home-connectivity-alliance-to-drive-the-future-of-connected-home-experiences"&gt;The Home Connectivity Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, announced at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865808/samsung-smartthings-smart-home-hub-dashboard-ces2022"&gt;Samsung’s CES keynote&lt;/a&gt;, was specifically formed to make sure legacy home appliances can move into the IoT future, Yoon Ho Choi of Samsung and president of the HCA told me at CES. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umR8eR"&gt;This issue of upgradability of existing devices is still an area Matter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22832127/matter-smart-home-products-thread-wifi-explainer#mEr5qU"&gt;has largely skirted&lt;/a&gt; and one that it really needs to address. There’s been talk about firmware updates for existing hubs and bridges, and we know that the newer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761340/amazon-matter-smart-home-standard"&gt;Amazon Echo smart speakers&lt;/a&gt; and Google Nest Hub devices have an upgrade path. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sy5VEKRo5Q3ojyVWy45l45YLya8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23154560/matter_echo.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon has committed to bringing its existing smart speakers and displays into Matter when it arrives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GPxWcn"&gt;But, based on many of the announcements coming out of CES this week, it is looking increasingly like creating a Matter smart home is going to require users buying a fair number of new gadgets. As Mitch Klein of the Z-Wave Alliance told me late last year, “We can’t leave devices behind, or this whole program won’t work. The idea that everyone has to throw everything out and start again is just not going to work.” It remains imperative that Matter doesn’t leave existing smart homes in the dark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="2zRbNm"&gt;More Matter announcements from CES &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="imNXll"&gt;Which will be the lucky lock?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2SkAG8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21255026/august-wifi-smart-lock-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;August&lt;/a&gt; and Yale committed to making their smart locks work with Matter. Jason Williams, president of August and Yale Real Living, told me they plan to bring the first Matter lock to market when the standard launches in 2022. The company already has one Thread-enabled lock, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17312166/nest-hello-yale-lock-smart-home-review"&gt;aging Nest x Yale smart lock&lt;/a&gt;, and is looking at other ways to introduce the technology, says Williams. While he said its Wi-Fi powered August locks won’t be among the first to be updated (Matter over Wi-Fi is only for hard line-powered devices currently, not battery-powered devices), they are actively looking at ways to bring their existing products into the new smart home standard. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YD3dSQ4Uz9LPTjih9zwaBsqJ8bU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23153222/Encode_Plus_CEN_Satin_Nickel_Front_Door__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Schlage&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Schlage Encode Plus smart lock is the company’s first Thread-enabled lock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RSZDNK"&gt;Schlage may beat Yale to the punch with its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22860197/apple-home-key-schlage-encode-plus-smart-door-lock-thread-ces2022"&gt;Schlage Encode Plus lock&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s first Thread-enabled product. While the Thread radio supports HomeKit over Thread specifically, Donald Beene of Schlage told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the hardware is there for Matter. “This will be the first [lock] product with the hardware on board to support something like that, but we still don’t know where those tech specs will land,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FEaWyW"&gt;All the lights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jHzhV5"&gt;If you make smart lights, switches, and plugs, Matter was on your mind this week. Belkin Wemo announced its working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2022/1/4/22865546/wemo-homekit-video-doorbell-price-specs"&gt;Thread versions of the Wemo Smart Plug,&lt;/a&gt; Wemo Smart Light Switch, and Wemo Smart Dimmer that will support Matter over Thread. Cync, the GE Lighting company, told me that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22860472/cync-gelighting-smart-bulbs-thermostat-camera-ces2022"&gt;its color A19 bulb and light strip will be Matter-compatible&lt;/a&gt; over Wi-Fi, and smart lighting company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22864783/sengled-smart-health-monitoring-smart-bulb-ces2022"&gt;Sengled said&lt;/a&gt; that it will have its first Wi-Fi A19 bulb ready to go when the standard launches. Nanoleaf, which has been all-in on Thread for over a year now, confirmed at CES that its mains-powered lighting panels, the Nanoleaf Shapes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466594/nanoleaf-elements-light-panel-smart-home-price-release"&gt;Elements&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22758017/nanoleaf-lines-review-smart-light-bars"&gt;Lines&lt;/a&gt;, will become Thread border routers, initially for Thread over HomeKit but with an eye to Matter-compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WEqu5i"&gt;Smart home hubs are still here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DTyUeX"&gt;While Matter should mitigate the whole multiple hub / gateway / bridge issue down to one teeny little box that’s hopefully also your router, that is going to take a while. In the meantime, we’ve still got hubs galore, and going forward, we will need Matter Controllers to act as remote controls for your home (think Google Nest Hub smart displays, but hopefully better). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pk7pn6"&gt;There were a few new hubs announced this week, including the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865808/samsung-smartthings-smart-home-hub-dashboard-ces2022"&gt;Samsung Home Hub&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung has committed to adopt Matter across Samsung devices, so when this smart home controller makes it to the US (it’s launching in Korean in March), it’s likely to be part of that. Aqara, makers of inexpensive Zigbee sensors and decent HomeKit cameras that double as hubs, said it will update its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523877/aqara-smart-home-review-m2-hub-homekit-alexa-google-assistant"&gt;M2 and the M1S hubs&lt;/a&gt;, making all compatible connected sensors move over to Matter. It also announced it’s developing Thread versions of its popular motion and contact sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWOEtD"&gt;Smart home security camera company Arlo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22865040/arlo-smart-home-security-system-price-availability-ces2022"&gt;announced its home security system&lt;/a&gt;, which is based around its “modular hub.” The word modular has us intrigued, as does the company’s decision to finally join Matter. While we’d love to think this is a sign of cameras coming into Matter sooner (they’re currently not part of the Matter spec), the first product of Arlo’s to get Matter support is more likely to be those spiffy new all-in-one sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SqAjG2"&gt;Speaking of modular, edge-computing company &lt;a href="https://www.veea.com/stax-and-bolt"&gt;Veea&lt;/a&gt; showed off an intriguing smart home hub that it announced will be Matter compatible. The Veea STAX Smart Hub is a Wi-Fi 6 Mesh router and smart home hub in one, with the option of adding LTE or 5G cellular connection through stackable modules. A smart speaker module with directional mics is in the works, and STAX modules also feature Lutron and Philips Hue bridge tech (among others), along with HomeKit and Alexa compatibility. While the initial launch is targeted at communications companies as a white label SHaaS (Smart Home as a service) solution, the company says it will soon be available directly to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXXAva"&gt;		&lt;/p&gt;
