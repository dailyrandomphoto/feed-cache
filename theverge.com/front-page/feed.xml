    <title>Microsoft turned its sustainability report into a Minecraft map</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5eui9zu7Gs_80HFpdIHS40rOYMc=/9x0:1458x966/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68733501/Sustainability_City_Map_A.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TFuzuS"&gt;Microsoft released its annual sustainability report today, and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; developer Mojang decided to turn it into something interactive. Called simply “&lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/01/28/minecraft-releases-free-sustainability-city-map/"&gt;Sustainable City&lt;/a&gt;,” the new &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; map is available as a free download in the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; marketplace, and it’s also been added to the game’s educational offshoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yrlyjl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Minecraft Education is perfectly suited for this surreal back-to-school moment","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21377192/minecraft-education-edition-back-to-school-pandemic"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C0SLNI"&gt;The map features six included lessons, which Mojang says are “designed to give students a sense of stewardship for the planet.” The lessons cover topics like sustainable food production, water outflow and treatment, and responsible forestry. One lesson tasks players with exploring a home built entirely from sustainable materials; another has them venture to a landfill to learn what happens to non-recyclable materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWUTe3"&gt;The educational version of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; has been around since 2016, but it has become especially popular of late &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21377192/minecraft-education-edition-back-to-school-pandemic"&gt;due to the rise in remote learning&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, Microsoft says more than 35 million students and educators are licensed to use the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood blocks purchase of GameStop, AMC, and BlackBerry stock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="nyse-stockexchange" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jbwuQFGWKBD9PRAt2Rpb5xisSD4=/0x8:1024x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68733493/nyse_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xx89ZX"&gt;Robinhood &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/keeping-customers-informed-through-market-volatility"&gt;has added new limits&lt;/a&gt; to its app to restrict users from buying or trading any of the popular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;Reddit r/WallStreetBets stocks&lt;/a&gt;, including GameStop ($GME), AMC ($AMC), BlackBerry ($BB), Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond ($BBBY), Nokia ($NOK), and more. Users will still be allowed to close out existing positions but won’t be able to buy more of the stocks. The company is citing “recent volatility” in the market as the reasoning behind the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1611842701391_195"&gt;We continuously monitor the markets and make changes where necessary. In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AMC, $BB, $BBBY, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD and $NOK. We also raised margin requirements for certain securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="zBGr3V"&gt;The development is the latest in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;an ongoing saga&lt;/a&gt; that has seen a group of Reddit users from the WallStreetBets subreddit band together in an effort to drive up the stock prices of companies like GameStop and BlackBerry, in defiance of traditional hedge funds that had shorted those firms. Robinhood — a popular stock market application that allows amateur day traders to purchase those stocks without fees — has been a key tool in the Reddit group’s ability to push prices up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ahr9Bt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How r/WallStreetBets gamed the stock of GameStop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"},{"title":"Memes have broken the brokerages","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252864/wallstreetbets-stocks-memes-broker-outages-limits-amc-gamestop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GWccmk"&gt;Robinhood isn’t the only major company to stop accepting new trades for GameStop and AMC — more traditional brokerages like Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252864/wallstreetbets-stocks-memes-broker-outages-limits-amc-gamestop"&gt;restricted trading&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, citing unprecedented trading activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptwyu8"&gt;The move has infuriated members of the WallStreetBets subreddit. A top post on the subreddit this morning &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6w4uo/robinhood_will_not_let_new_options_or_shares_be/"&gt;calls the decision&lt;/a&gt; “market manipulation,” with angry comments calling for users to “&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6w4uo/robinhood_will_not_let_new_options_or_shares_be/gl31cfs/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;dump robinhood for good&lt;/a&gt;” and lamenting the ensuring fall in stock prices that shortly followed the announcement. The group’s official moderator account has also protested the decision by Robinhood, highlighting the unfairness of the fact that day traders cannot make new investments in the stocks when traditional firms still can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b0uZ4Z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Individual investors are being stripped of their ability to trade on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@RobinhoodApp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile hedge funds and institutional investors can continue to trade as normal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you call a market that removes retail investors ability to buy to save institutional investors shorts? &lt;a href="https://t.co/G0hQFJDaG4"&gt;https://t.co/G0hQFJDaG4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— wsb mod (@wsbmod) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wsbmod/status/1354783317908971520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hjBm4r"&gt;A sticked post on the thread from moderators also implores users “No witch hunts on Robinhood please.” It’s a reflection on the recent turmoil that has hit the /r/WallStreetBets community as part of its nearly overnight success, which has seen the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server"&gt;group’s Discord server banned&lt;/a&gt; for “hateful and discriminatory content” and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253339/reddit-wallstreetbets-subreddit-private-gamestop"&gt;subreddit itself temporarily made private&lt;/a&gt; as the group struggles to moderate the massive influx of new users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord has turned into a virtual trade floor with memes, stonks, and chaos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RlNyMtuwfdK-kP4ZfK5OqmJdgfQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68733480/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An online casino&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GCcYqX"&gt;A real-life trading floor is noisy. You can find traders shouting at each other, especially when the markets are volatile and stock is moving fast. That same environment has been replicated online this week, thanks to Discord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEs2zv"&gt;Getting inside offers a surreal look at an emerging virtual trade floor where people are yelling at each other to invest into GameStop or AMC stocks. Dozens of people join the server every second, and one channel has a stream of memes that looks like pure chaos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COEHTm"&gt;Welcome to the world of r/WallStreetBets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZAWYo8JLZhzWC1qkh3mZPCXod-o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22265272/wallstreetbetsdiscord.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The r/WallStreetBets Discord server.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="agjcNz"&gt;Discord is usually the tool of choice for gamers to communicate with friends, Twitch streamers to grow a community, or just small groups of people to share similar interests. It’s a hugely popular app, with more than 100 million monthly active users. The Reddit community r/WallStreetBets has turned to Discord in recent weeks to organize and communicate in real time, as it seeks to force hedge funds into losing millions of dollars on their bets against struggling retail companies like GameStop and AMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dD4Q2Q"&gt;Amateur traders are flocking to the Discord server to discuss stock movements, share memes, and participate in what feels like an online game. Every post is littered with emoji reactions that fly off the page within seconds, and the calls are full of people shouting “buy GameStop” or “hold GMC” as stock prices go up and down throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjqJsm"&gt;At times it feels like it only takes one person to shout something on a call or spam a meme enough times for it to catch on and everyone to run with it. I witnessed hundreds of people hit Twitch yesterday to spam “save AMC” in a variety of live streams. Rapper Soulja Boy’s Twitch stream was swarmed with the messages, after calls to visit his stream. But the group failed to convince him to tweet about the struggling theater chain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vveDKR"&gt;The Discord calls and many of the memes are often full of profanity or racial slurs, leading Discord to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server"&gt;ban the r/WallStreetBets server last night&lt;/a&gt;. It quickly came back to life a few hours later, though, and has already amassed 200,000 members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="Ys2SK7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;the wallstreetbets discord needs to be heard to be believed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;it’s the modern day version of being on floor of NYSE. &lt;a href="https://t.co/QqKIz94yvU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QqKIz94yvU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— jpa (@josephpalbanese) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/josephpalbanese/status/1354213030087675906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="how27c"&gt;“Can we just get one minute of therapeutic silence,” asked someone on the main Discord call yesterday. A few seconds of silence passed before the ask was met with fart sounds, high-pitched music, and sound boards. The members often joke about the FBI or SEC listening in, which prompts many to spam the “FBI, open up!” audio meme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mX4D8e"&gt;After last night’s Discord server ban, r/WallStreetBets is rebuilding its Discord community, but a split has emerged. There are now two Discord servers, with an unofficial one at 88,000 members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SjFWk"&gt;Misinformation is common throughout these Discord servers. In the official one, a discussion broke out about the potential for a US-led war to impact stock markets. “There is going to be a war, 100 percent,” claimed one Discord user. “I’m going to bring my gaming chair into the war,” joked another. Fake Elon Musk memes are also as popular as the man himself among this group. “The only thing I want in life is for Elon Musk to tell me I’m beautiful,” said one Discord user praising the Tesla CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5OZuaR"&gt;Among all the chaos and fake Elon Musk memes, there is some relative organization on the server with calmer heads providing tips to amateur traders. “Only put money in that you can afford to lose,” is a common piece of advice. New members often join and want to know what stock to invest in, but are quickly met with “we are not financial advisors” or “buy what you feel like buying” responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vqxrz"&gt;I’ve also witnessed what sound like day traders teaching people the basics of options, market retracements, and how to create charts with technical indicators and overlays. Robinhood has made buying and selling stocks as easy as posting a photo to Instagram, and those new to this experiment are eager to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;aside id="dWTozB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How r/WallStreetBets gamed the stock of GameStop ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"},{"title":"Reddit’s GameStop traders turn their attention to AMC stock ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w1yojX"&gt;Others, who have clearly been part of the r/WallStreetBets community for more than a few days, are also quick to advise new members not to try trial broker accounts with fake money for too long. “You need to get used to the emotional reality of a market open,” said one Discord member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLCz0O"&gt;The advice is often interrupted by excitement as GameStop or AMC shares reach new highs. At one point this morning GameStop hit $420 a share in premarket trading, which was met by cheers and surprise on the Discord call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLUBXn"&gt;I personally spend large parts of my day on Discord, but I’ve still never seen anything quite like the r/WallStreetBets server — even in groups with 300,000 members. Dozens of people join every second, and at times it has forced Discord to crash on my high-end gaming PC or take up lots of CPU resources. Even on my iPhone it kills my battery and makes my phone hot to touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgErN0"&gt;The question now is how long this mass organized movement can continue on Discord, and the amount of time left in the grand GameStop stock price game. After a ban for “hateful and discriminatory content,” the official r/WallStreetBets Discord server seems less chaotic. But r/WallStreetBets describes itself as “like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal,” and a lot of the Reddit comments contain offensive language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcUoTa"&gt;r/WallStreetBets feels like &lt;em&gt;The Button&lt;/em&gt;, an online meta-game that first appeared on Reddit for April Fools’ Day in 2015. Redditors rushed to push a button on a 60-second timer that would reset every time it was clicked. It inspired devotion and obsession much like this GameStop stock rally, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/9/8749897/reddit-april-fools-the-button-experiment-end"&gt;even spawned religions and cults&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="mzA4zI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Button&lt;/em&gt; ended more than two months after its introduction when the timer finally hit zero with no attempts to reset it. There’s no timer here on this Discord and Reddit trade floor experiment, and nobody really knows exactly how and when it’s going to end.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Olija is a dark, haunting action game without all the stress</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6GsWMRRyQO8IU6Cit-zED2LefVg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68733230/ss_7835fecca4421e855cdc11fae66ccde73388b9d4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XXxh8m"&gt;There are plenty of great 2D action games about exploring dark, mysterious worlds. Think &lt;em&gt;Hollow Knight&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/6/17655322/dead-cells-review-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-castlevania"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dead Cells&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102612/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-review-switch-ps4-xbox-pc-castlevania"&gt;anything inspired by &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from similar themes, these games have something else in common: they’re almost always incredibly hard. &lt;em&gt;Olija&lt;/em&gt; goes in a different direction. It still takes place in a world full of terrors to fight and secrets to uncover, and it features fast-paced action with lots of interesting weapons. But it’s also much more approachable. I wouldn’t call it easy, but it’s satisfying without being frustrating. You get the same haunting vibe without all of the stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfTFyt"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Olija,&lt;/em&gt; you play as a man named Faraday whose ship crashes in an incredibly cursed part of the world called Terraphage. He has two main goals: rescue his fellow castaways and get the hell back home. Terraphage is made up of a series of islands, and the game mostly involves traveling to each one to find survivors and gather up maps and keys that let you explore more islands. You’ll even build a small town, which grows as you rescue more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXmLO5"&gt;The main twist on &lt;em&gt;Olija&lt;/em&gt;’s action is a magic harpoon that lets you zip around; you simply throw it at something, and you can teleport to its location. You can use this to warp across broken bridges or land a devastating attack on a faraway enemy. The side-scrolling action is fluid but has a nice weight to it, with every jab of the spear resulting in an upsetting spurt of blood. You can also mix things up as you unlock secondary weapons like throwing knives and a shotgun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kmDu6q"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cLlpTx5shhM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EEuNVt"&gt;Most of the regular enemies aren’t particularly tough, so I never really had much trouble slashing my way through hordes of undead workers or one-eyed monstrosities. But the fast-paced action and satisfying weapon meant that it was still fun. That level of challenge rises considerably when you hit the bosses, however; sometimes it can feel like a sharp difficulty spike. But once I learned the patterns — which took a few deaths in most cases — I was able to get by no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzOQxN"&gt;This all may make &lt;em&gt;Olija&lt;/em&gt; sound like a fairly standard action game, but part of what makes it work is the vibe. The world is like a cross between Lovecraft-style ancient terrors and Japanese folklore, and — despite the fact that dialogue is minimal — it’s full of interesting characters. My favorite is a musician who seems to appear at random, doing things like playing music for a “lonely tree,” but I also love the boatman who silently takes you where you need to go. The one trade-off is that &lt;em&gt;Olija&lt;/em&gt; is smaller in scale compared to similar games; it won’t take as long to beat as something like &lt;em&gt;Dead Cells&lt;/em&gt;, nor does it have the same kind of replayability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2VCIfu"&gt;The developers were able to use the familiar side-scrolling format to create some truly incredible scenes. There’s a terrifying escape when you’re charging out of a cave while zombie-like creatures latch on to you, and another sequence where you have to fight screaming horrors in complete darkness. Perhaps my favorite is a stealth mission where the end goal is to deliver a flower to the region’s queen. Despite being a game about exploring darkness, &lt;em&gt;Olija&lt;/em&gt; also has plenty of warmth. I loved the comfort of returning to town after fighting through a dungeon so that I could talk to the townsfolk or slurp down some health-replenishing stew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZG1gmZ"&gt;Really, &lt;em&gt;Olija&lt;/em&gt; is proof that you can have a tense and satisfying action game without a punishing level of difficulty. Its harsh world made me feel uncomfortable — but it never made me mad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8GXMn"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Olija &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available today on the Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox One, and PS4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peacock hit 33 million signups before The Office even arrived</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;comcast&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nj4bUu"&gt;NBC Universal’s Peacock streaming service hit 33 million signups in the fourth quarter, parent company Comcast reported Thursday, an addition of 11 million signups from the third quarter. While the company’s overall revenues beat Wall Street’s expectations, Comcast continued to see the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on its filmed entertainment and theme park divisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXu0xP"&gt;It’s still early to tell whether &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216867/peacock-office-subscription-streaming-ad-free-premium-plus-netflix"&gt;having &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; on Peacock&lt;/a&gt; will deliver a surge of new subscribers, since it only became exclusive as of January 1st. Peacock launched in July and is already on par with other, newer streamers like HBO Max, which had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252069/hbo-max-subscribers-wonder-woman-1984-att-earnings"&gt;almost 40 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; as of the most recent quarter and launched around the same time as Peacock. Disney Plus, which is about a year old, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165579/disney-plus-86-million-subscribers-netflix-hbo-max-streaming"&gt;86 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. Since Peacock has a free tier, however, there’s no way to tell how many of the 33 million signups are paying subscribers or will be converted to paid subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdPQxE"&gt;Comcast &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128005561/en/Comcast-Reports-4th-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results"&gt;posted revenue&lt;/a&gt; of $27.71 billion for the quarter, a 2.4 percent decline year over year, and net income of $3.3 billion, a 7 percent increase from the year-ago quarter. Its cable networks had revenue of $2.7 billion, down about 6.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tg9lQ5"&gt;The company added 538,000 broadband subscribers in the fourth quarter, up from 442,000 a year ago, and cable revenues rose 6 percent, to $15.7 billion. It lost 248,000 video subscribers in the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0flk8I"&gt;Revenue for its filmed entertainment division decreased by about 8 percent to $1.4 billion. Comcast said revenue for its theme parks division fell 63 percent from the year-ago quarter to $579 million. Its Orlando and Osaka, Japan theme parks, however, reached breakeven for the quarter, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ci5Bf"&gt;(Disclosure: Comcast and NBCUniversal are investors in Vox Media, parent company of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udt3ig"&gt;“With the vaccines rolling out throughout the world, we are optimistic that the parts of our business that had been most impacted will soon be back on a path towards growth,” Comcast chairman and CEO Brian Roberts said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Faraday Future is going public and raising $1 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NMV7fs7kQyHuJoTYcXmcUwfdFag=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68733036/faraday_future_ff91_5274.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kgbKUD"&gt;Faraday Future is going to become a publicly traded company on the Nasdaq stock exchange and is raising around $1 billion in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEvr52"&gt;The troubled EV startup &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128005488/en/Faraday-Future-to-List-on-NASDAQ-Through-Merger-With-Property-Solutions-Acquisition-Corp.-With-Estimated-1-Billion-in-Proceeds"&gt;announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that it is indeed merging with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition corporation&lt;/a&gt; (or SPAC) Property Solutions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/19/22229493/faraday-future-spac-merger-psac-public-ipo-stock"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wKoen"&gt;About $230 million will come from the money that Property Solutions raised in its SPAC. The other $775 million will come from a new funding round happening concurrently with the merger. Geely, China’s biggest privately owned automaker, is contributing “less than 10 percent” of that new investment, and $175 million is coming from an unnamed “Tier 1 Chinese City,” meaning that the Chinese government is involved in the deal. Faraday Future will have around $748 million of cash to play with when all is said and done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESSqTn"&gt;Faraday Future expects to be able to finish building out its factory in Hanford, California with the new funds and launch its FF91 luxury SUV “within 12 months” of the finalization of the merger, which is expected to happen in the second quarter of this year. Smaller models, as well as a delivery vehicle, will follow. Faraday Future is targeting the US, China, and European markets and has an agreement with South Korean manufacturer Myoung Shin to make cars there. A joint venture with Geely and the Tier 1 city is also being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="O0itDm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FF91 luxury SUV will launch 12 months after the deal closes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SDhaoN"&gt;Property Solutions CEO Jordan Vogel said in a call Thursday that his SPAC reviewed “roughly” 65 different companies to merge with. “Faraday Future is by far the most compelling company we’ve seen,” he said. Vogel specifically called out Faraday Future CEO Carsten Breitfeld, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/10/30/20879811/faraday-future-ceo-founder-jia-yueting-carsten-breitfeld-bankruptcy"&gt;former BMW executive who took the helm in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, as “one of the most compelling parts of their story.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2bgL5"&gt;While it’s just the latest EV startup to announce that it’s going public via SPAC in the last seven months (joining the likes of Nikola, Canoo, Fisker, Arrival, and others), Faraday Future is perhaps the most notorious considering its history of financial troubles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgQsv3"&gt;Going public has long been a goal for Faraday Future, which was founded in 2014 and started to emerge from stealth mode in 2015. But it’s a goal that’s seemed increasingly out of reach as the startup struggled over the years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEDjfj"&gt;After debuting its electric luxury SUV, the FF91, at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show, Faraday Future spiraled. It was facing a major cash crunch after already spending hundreds of millions of dollars of founder Jia Yueting’s own money. At the same time, Jia self-exiled himself to the US as he tried to escape massive mounting debts in his home country, China, following the collapse of his tech conglomerate LeEco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LkqhPu"&gt;Faraday Future brought in two former BMW executives to help straighten things out, including the former chief financial officer of the German automaker (and Deutsche Bank), Stefan Krause. The startup abandoned plans to build a $1 billion factory in the desert in favor of taking over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/6/16102758/faraday-future-new-factory-hanford-california"&gt;a smaller, dormant plant in Central California&lt;/a&gt;. Krause pushed for other cost-cutting measures, too, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/31/16236054/faraday-future-formula-e-electric-racing"&gt;exiting the Formula E electric racing series&lt;/a&gt;, ending &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;LeEco’s technical partnership with Aston Martin&lt;/a&gt;, and scrapping a product placement in the &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;/em&gt; movie franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v0pDF0"&gt;But when Jia ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;rejected Krause’s larger pitch to restructure the startup through bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;, the chief financial officer and his BMW counterpart resigned. (They went on to found the startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;that is now Canoo&lt;/a&gt;.) A wave of other resignations followed. Weeks away from running out of cash, Jia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17242406/faraday-future-china-investment"&gt;put everything on the line to sign a deal at the end of 2017 with Chinese real estate conglomerate Evergrande&lt;/a&gt; worth up to $2 billion in exchange for 45 percent of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="y02htF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data="{&amp;quot;stories&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Inside Faraday Future's financial house of cards&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting&amp;quot;}]}"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="UoYXZO"&gt;Buoyed by new cash, Faraday Future started off 2018 by renovating the factory in Central California and continuing work on the SUV. But the relationship with Evergrande soured across that year as Jia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/7/17930524/faraday-future-evergrande-investment-jia-yueting-fire"&gt;quickly spent through the conglomerate’s first $800 million installment&lt;/a&gt;. When Jia asked for more, Evergrande used the opportunity to try to sideline him. Ultimately, it wasn’t satisfied that Jia actually relinquished control, and the two sides started a months-long legal battle before an arbitrator in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSbSCu"&gt;While this was happening, Faraday Future was down to just a few million dollars in the bank. It laid off hundreds and furloughed hundreds more, and cut salaries across the board. Top executives who had stuck it out, including co-founder Nick Sampson, relented and left the startup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XalLKF"&gt;Faraday Future reached a truce with Evergrande on the final day of 2018. The Chinese conglomerate was released from the remaining $1.2 billion and reduced its stake to 32 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7pHKdD"&gt;Faraday Future has been treading water ever since, staying alive by borrowing from an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18524108/faraday-future-bankruptcy-expert-birch-lake-loan"&gt;investment firm run by a “bankruptcy legend.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="G6NkKK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Faraday Future’s still haunted by the past of its billionaire founder","url":"https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/10/30/20879811/faraday-future-ceo-founder-jia-yueting-carsten-breitfeld-bankruptcy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="IBlNjh"&gt;Through all this, Faraday Future racked up hundreds of millions of dollars in debt to suppliers and vendors. The startup placated most of them by promising a slice of a future IPO. Jia declared bankruptcy in late 2019 in an effort to settle some $3 billion of his own debts in China. The result of that process was that Jia put his controlling shares in Faraday Future in a trust of which his creditors now all own pieces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ESQu7"&gt;The makeup of Faraday Future’s ownership is changing with the deal. When it closes, shareholders of the SPAC will own 6.8 percent of the company. The entities doing the $775 million raise will own 23 percent. Creditors that Faraday Future and Jia owe money to will own 17.2 percent. Existing shareholders in Faraday Future will collectively own 51.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Global Privacy Control wants to succeed where Do Not Track failed </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iL2yRw2r4nEo3HSh36__pE7MvuA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732954/acastro_190703_1777_pixel_tracking_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new web standard is playing off of California’s powerful privacy law&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="qKPGWk"&gt;On today’s internet, information is nearly impossible to control. It’s become commonplace for a single website visit to spill over into targeted ads (often for something you’ve already bought) or unexpectedly canny spam emails. It’s assumed that information from your browsing history will be available to target your Instagram ads, and despite nominal commitments to privacy, tech companies have mostly given up trying to stop those data flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cg2nIJ"&gt;Privacy groups are hoping that a new standard, called &lt;a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org"&gt;Global Privacy Control&lt;/a&gt;, will change that. It’s designed as a global opt out, a general signal that users want as little data collection and sharing as possible. In particular, the GPC standard will let users signal that they don’t want services to share their data with third-party data brokers, something that is outside the reach of most modern privacy tools. The team hopes that this new signal will give users a way to protect their data after it’s been collected and ensure personal information doesn’t travel too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="G77OFz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You don’t know if they’re selling data on the back end”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GCoard"&gt;“When you go to a website right now, you don’t know if they’re selling data on the back end,” says DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg, a central player in the project. “But we’re hoping that this signal will stop them from doing that, because it will be legally binding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8DyGS"&gt;The GPC standard sprang from &lt;a href="https://insights.truyo.com/ccpa-hidden-game-changer"&gt;a powerful but little-noticed provision&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/31/21039228/california-ccpa-facebook-microsoft-gdpr-privacy-law-consumer-data-regulation"&gt;California Consumer Privacy Act&lt;/a&gt; (CCPA), which was strengthened further with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549514/california-prop-24-data-privacy-2020-election-andrew-yang"&gt;the passage of the California Privacy Rights Act in November&lt;/a&gt;. A provision in the law gives Californians the right to opt out of having their personal information sold by the sites they visit. Crucially, the law interprets “sell” as including any exchange of value, which could include being read broadly enough to go beyond outright data broker sales and into the endemic tracking pixels that power much of the advertising you see online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BjDWFz"&gt;“The right is supposed to prevent any third-party tracking,” says Ashkan Soltani, who worked on drafting the CCPA and CPRA and has been a pivotal force in drafting the new standard. “There hasn’t been too much enforcement yet but more importantly, people don’t know about it and can’t find the button, so not many people opt out…But the CCPA also has in it the right for users to opt-out through a global privacy control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvDrX"&gt;Global Privacy Control is meant to automate that opt out, letting users click a single button on their browser instead of hunting for the opt out on every website they visit. &lt;a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/press-release/20210128"&gt;Starting today&lt;/a&gt;, browsers from Brave and DuckDuckGo will send the GPC signal by default, and DuckDuckGo plugins will let you bring the same signal to Firefox and Chrome. Privacy Badger, Abine, and Disconnect.me have made similar moves to build the standard into their products. All told, project organizers estimate that 40 million users worldwide will be sending out the GPC signal through one product or another, giving them surprising political muscle when future privacy rules are written. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kmXV7q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;40 million users worldwide&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UOvfKq"&gt;Site partners like &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post, &lt;/em&gt;and Meredith Corp have also agreed to respect the signal, and Automattic (the company that owns WordPress) will honor GPC in its self-hosted sites and internal ad network, spanning hundreds of thousands of sites. It’s a small group compared to the billions of Chrome and Safari users out there, but it will provide a proof-of-concept for the more private web the GPC team is trying to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IPWaI"&gt;There is still a long way to go before GPC is available outside the cloistered world of web privacy tools. None of the major browsers currently support GPC as a native privacy option, although Mozilla said it supports the effort. The team says they’ve submitted the standard to the W3C, but it will be a long road before it gets approved — with lots of opportunity for ad-friendly tech companies to throw a wrench in the works. The last time privacy advocates tried to build an opt-out system, this is where it fell apart, resulting in the short-lived Do Not Track standard of the mid-‘00s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AzRHSe"&gt;But GPC boosters like Weinberg say the CCPA and other pending privacy laws make things different this time. There’s a lot that still needs to happen before GPC has the force of law — in particular, the California attorney general will need to definitively state that the GPC counts as an opt out — but it would give the standard a power that Do Not Track never had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqNXm4"&gt;“The CCPA has passed and the GDPR has provisions that we think map to this signal. So there’s a real case that those laws apply to Global Privacy Control, but it hasn’t been legally proven in the courts,” says Weinberg. “Ultimately, there will probably have to be court cases to fully establish what ‘sale’ means under CCPA and what ‘opt-out’ means under GDPR.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9Cd8Z"&gt;The California attorney general declined to comment for this piece, although AG Becerra &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/47115516-3540-4AB8-8676-57882CF6B9E0"&gt;had expressed enthusiasm for the project&lt;/a&gt; before being nominated for a post in the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpdc0l"&gt;The biggest lingering question is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/1/22/21075270/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-nytimes-federal-privacy-law-surveillance"&gt;the long-simmering push for a federal privacy law&lt;/a&gt;, which privacy advocates have been fighting to get through Congress since 2016. As long as GPC relies on California privacy law, it will only matter to California residents — but a federal privacy law could open the standard up to the entire country and potentially strengthen GPC’s protections further. There’s also increasing ambition to expand the opt-out signal beyond the web to apps and the Internet of Things, although such a move would be years away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8MZdv"&gt;Even if GPC gets full backing from legislators and courts, it won’t mean an end to targeted advertising or even data sharing. There’s still a lot of targeting that can be done within a single site, and the online ad world will surely get creative in finding loopholes that let them share data further. But establishing a robust opt-out system on the web would still mean a powerful shift in the way personal data works online — and potentially a start to cleaning up the bewildering tangle of data-sharing agreements online. As partners roll out and momentum builds, Weinberg thinks time is on his side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="86alro"&gt;“Our view is that websites really have to respect it,” says Weinberg. “It’s only a matter of time.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 gets new patch to fix old patch that introduced a game-breaking bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cyberpunk game discs for PlayStation and XBox consoles. The..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DeSWfAPbY3Jv0qGIiAqabHTeais=/0x141:3350x2374/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732936/1230147373.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ki014w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s big new 1.1 patch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248682/cyberpunk-2077-update-bug-workaround-cd-projekt-red"&gt;introduced a game-breaking bug earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, and now Developer CD Projekt Red is fixing it. A new 1.11 hotfix is available across PC, Stadia, and Xbox / PlayStation consoles today. While it also restores item randomization to a previous state, the primary purpose is to fix the game-breaking part of the “Down on the Street” quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SuIkj"&gt;The quest includes a holocall that’s supposed to trigger progress through the main part of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s storyline, but some players found the call was silent and blocked progress of the game. CD Projekt Red published a workaround after a few hours, and has now followed up with a hotfix after the problem was spotted earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0sdwws"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hotfix 1.11 is available on PC, consoles and Stadia!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This update restores item randomization and fixes a bug which affected some users’ holocall with Takemura in Down on the Street quest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Details: &lt;a href="https://t.co/SsVYRGfdha"&gt;https://t.co/SsVYRGfdha&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/TAQmRilNxq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TAQmRilNxq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1354769450726285312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WY5uAK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; has been plagued by bugs since its release on December 10th, and this marks the fourth hotfix release to quickly fix problems. Most of the bugs and issues haven’t been game-breaking like this one, and it’s encouraging to see CD Projekt Red fix the problem after just a few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOgnoI"&gt;CD Projekt Red is &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/37298/our-commitment"&gt;also planning&lt;/a&gt; another major 1.2 patch that is supposed to be a “larger, more significant update” that will arrive in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telegram can now import your WhatsApp chat history on iOS</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GpU8TD2Rop8Nn9W0BB1dKs-dp4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732802/acastro_180417_1777_telegram_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eBGFBy"&gt;Telegram has added the ability to import your chat history from WhatsApp, meaning you won’t lose past conversations if you want to switch messaging services. On iOS the feature arrived with &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807"&gt;version 7.4&lt;/a&gt;, released yesterday and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/27/amid-whatsapp-privacy-backlash-telegram-building-new-tool-for-importing-chats-from-other-apps/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the update doesn’t appear to be live yet on Android. Alongside WhatsApp, chat histories from Line and KakaoTalk can also be imported, according to Telegram’s changelog. We’ve verified that you can import chats from WhatsApp into the latest version (7.4.1) of Telegram and continue the conversation, so long as each WhatsApp user has a Telegram account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcEJby"&gt;The addition of the feature comes as Telegram is reporting huge increases in user numbers, with the service now boasting over 500 million active users worldwide. The cause appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;WhatsApp’s new privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;, which prompted privacy concerns about the Facebook-owned messaging app (WhatsApp later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;delayed the introduction&lt;/a&gt; of the new policy, and insists it won’t affect the security of consumer chats or profile data). For users jumping ship from WhatsApp to Telegram, being able to take their chat histories with them means one fewer barrier to switching. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h0xoUSfoeX5T4exuoOpGR8lvO9w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22265199/IMG_0372.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imports work on a chat-by-chat basis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4MEQ0g"&gt;The import process works on a chat-by-chat basis, but appears to work for both individual and group conversations, at least with WhatsApp. To import a chat from Facebook’s messaging service, open the relevant conversation, and tap the group or contact name from the top of the chat to open its info screen. From there, the “Export Chat” option opens the iOS Share Sheet, where you’ll see the option to select Telegram. Then, just pick a Telegram chat to import the messages into. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSOgud"&gt;Any messages imported into chats have a small “Imported” label on them noting when they were originally sent, and when they were brought into Telegram, and messages are visible to all chat participants. You have the option of importing WhatsApp chat histories with or without their images. Imported messages appear in the order in which they are imported, rather than in the order they were originally sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKgxG9"&gt;Telegram’s support for imported chat histories arrives alongside a handful of other quality of life improvements for the messaging service, like being able to adjust volumes for individual voice chat participants, or reporting “fake groups or channels” that are attempting to impersonate famous people or organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Just look at this amazing Pac-Man history book</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W3tzbq6BnMi4WvcIurATOZNkvCA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732711/12_PACMAN_CE_overview.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJNUOg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; celebrated its 40th anniversary last year, and to commemorate the occasion, Cook and Becker is releasing a history book later this year — and it looks incredible. While there’s a standard hardcover version of the book for $39, which is called &lt;a href="https://www.cookandbecker.com/en/artwork/3012/pac-man-birth-of-an-icon-pac-man-bandai-namco.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man: Birth of an Icon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you can also buy a $99 special edition that comes with an ingenious Pac-Man-shaped slipcase. There’s even a vinyl pressing of the single “Pac-Man Fever” included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5K1v9H"&gt;The book is described as “the first-ever official history book” for the iconic video games series, and it’s written by Arjan Terpstra and Tim Lapetino. Here’s the official description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bs0b3k"&gt;This new non-fiction narrative volume will journey from creator Toru Iwatani’s “pizza slice” inspiration to the game’s incredible success in arcades and beyond. The book also dives into Pac-Man’s unprecedented impact on pop culture, with more than 40 new interviews from key players around the world, behind-the-scenes stories, documents, images, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UZvSv"&gt;With untold stories, new details, and archival imagery, &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man: Birth of an Icon&lt;/em&gt; showcases the franchise’s complex history from Tokyo to Chicago to Boston, unpacking the stories of video game industry stalwarts Namco and Midway Manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wCiUwA"&gt;If the name Cook and Becker sounds familiar, it’s probably because of the company’s work releasing high-end art prints for games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974054/last-of-us-part-2-ps4-fine-art-prints-cook-and-becker"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21551618/ghost-of-tsushima-concept-art-prints-sale-pricing-sucker-punch-playstation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, along with art books like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/11/16762996/final-fantasy-15-art-design-book-cook-becker"&gt;a giant tome on &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV’&lt;/em&gt;s creation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MjTnS7"&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; book is expected to release this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
