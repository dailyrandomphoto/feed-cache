    <title>You can buy Wemo’s new HomeKit video doorbell right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zMBxWbucHBklViMmAun38NTIodA=/0x0:9000x6000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348381/Wemo_Doorbell_environmental_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;WeMo’s first video doorbell supports HomeKit and HomeKit Secure Video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cVcCym"&gt;And then there were three... At CES 2022 this week, Wemo announced the immediate availability of the Wemo &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2Fp-wdc010%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865546%2Fwemo-homekit-video-doorbell-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Smart Video Doorbell&lt;/a&gt;, a HomeKit video doorbell that works with HomeKit Secure Video. It joins the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22318478/logitech-circle-view-doorbell-homekit-review-test-price"&gt;Logitech Circle View&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18168357/netatmos-smart-doorbell-apple-homekit-compatible-ces-2019"&gt;Netatmo Smart Video Doorbell camera&lt;/a&gt; as the only currently available residential HomeKit video doorbells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oLWjV"&gt;The $250 wired doorbell from the Belkin smart home brand is a short, chunky black device measuring 4.9 inches high. It has a 178-degree vertical field of view, 4MP high-resolution camera with “enhanced night vision and optimal zoom clarity,” according to the press release. It also features IP55 weatherproofing and works on 2.4 and 5 GHz Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tZbmc4rEwRXR8oIcwWPXs_sBrAo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142947/Wemo_Doorbell_environmental_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wemo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wemo Smart Video Doorbell is a chunky little fellow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9q4GDx"&gt;The buzzer is HomeKit only, working with the Home app on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, rather than through the Wemo app, the same as the Logitech doorbell. Only the Netatmo doorbell works with its own app, too. HomeKit Secure Video requires an Apple Home hub such as a HomePod Mini, which processes video recordings locally and uses on-device intelligence to spot people, pets, or vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y67Vaq"&gt;Any recordings are stored in iCloud, so an iCloud plus plan is required for viewing recorded footage. HKSV also offers a facial recognition feature, which users train with photos from their Photos app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cpn73Y"&gt;The Wemo Smart Video Doorbell joins the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/6/21048434/wemo-wifi-smart-plug-small-price-stage-scene-control-home-ces-2020"&gt;Wemo Stage and Wemo Smart Plug&lt;/a&gt; as Wemo products that don’t require Wemo’s own app. It’s available to buy now at Belkin.com.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oDhNqmD5nu91eD0pD1fmFYHB44o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142954/Wemo_Doorbell_product_pieces.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wemo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wemo video doorbell is hardwired only and requires a wired doorbell system (16-24V AC).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CAV3oB"&gt;Wemo also announced it is working on Thread versions of the Wemo Smart Plug, Wemo Smart Light Switch, and Wemo Smart Dimmer to be released later this year. This will enable support for Matter over Thread. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter is the new smart home standard&lt;/a&gt; launching later this year that will allow smart home devices to communicate with any Matter-enabled accessory regardless of manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIK9D5"&gt;Matter over Thread should make Wemo’s devices more reliable and easier to set up — two things I have found to be a major pain point with this brand. Thread offers faster response times than other protocols, and since it’s a mesh network, the more Thread devices in your home, the better range and connectivity you’ll have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ps8Xqc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iC3ucy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Belkin’s Soundform Immerse noise-canceling earbuds are designed with music lovers in mind</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YYbpQsSgeyo2WG8RvPn5WuXObLo=/0x1000:6000x5000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348847/SOUNDFORM_Immerse_Noise_Cancelling_Earbuds_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Belkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TAuziV"&gt;Belkin is adding the Immerse earbuds to its existing Soundform true wireless lineup. The earbuds come with hybrid active noise cancellation (ANC) technology, which should deliver audio free of background noise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7GTYm727VyiJLybIKH_oG1uBrkk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144207/belkin_immerse_soundform_buds.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cuy0TW"&gt;In case you haven’t heard of the “hybrid” form of ANC, &lt;a href="https://www.soundguys.com/noise-canceling-anc-explained-28344/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SoundGuys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describes it as two microphones located on the inside and outside of each earbud, which detect and cancel out sound coming from your environment. The other forms of ANC put the mic on the inside &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; outside of the earbud, which isn’t always as efficient for filtering out noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b54fXg"&gt;The Immerse earbuds have a pretty long battery life as well. Each earbud is supposed to get eight hours of play time on a single charge, and when combined with the charging case, that rises to up to 36 hours. They also support aptX HD — a Bluetooth codec that transmits hi-resolution audio — along with Multipoint technology, which should let you pair the earbuds to two different devices at once. In addition, the earbuds come with 12mm drivers and are compatible with the Apple Find My app to track their location if you misplace them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9HGe8"&gt;The last time Belkin added to its True Wireless collection was in June of last year, when it released its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fspeakers-headphones%2Fheadphones%2Fsoundform-move-true-wireless-earbuds%2Fp%2Fp-pac001%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22866535%2Fbelkin-soundform-immerse-noise-canceling-earbuds-ces-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;budget-friendly Move buds&lt;/a&gt;. Belkin also launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219529/belkin-magsafe-dock-charging-wireless-ces-2021-earbuds"&gt;first Find My-compatible Soundform Freedom earbuds last January&lt;/a&gt;. The Soundform Immerse noise-canceling earbuds will launch in the second quarter of 2022, but no pricing information has been made available yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s tiny Freestyle projector is fun so get over it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FQXMA_LFZ4u8NcypK0IT_7cnvbg=/46x0:555x339/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348778/freestyle_clip.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V0zWvu"&gt;Samsung’s new barrel-shaped Freestyle projector was just announced at CES. The 1080p projector goes up for preorder today for $899. What matters more than its spec sheet, according to Samsung, is that this highly portable and swiveling visual lightshow with integrated speaker and voice control is coming to support your carefree “lifestyle” and nomadic “experiences.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGv09I"&gt;Olds, in other words, need not apply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ryOf6O"&gt;How can I be certain of this? Because when I, a curmudgeonly old, showed the Freestyle to my 13-year-old daughter under strict embargo, her first reaction was, and I quote: “I want that. A fake window on my wall would be so pretty.” A sampling of one teen is surely correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kVg1gn1sb0X0sqc1L29p-oX86g8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142934/Samsung_The_Freestyle_Product_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Freestyle (front).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0v-es_PsSUX93HlasmAgNcO3UFg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142938/Samsung_The_Freestyle_Product_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Freestyle (back).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DR5m75"&gt;The 1.83 pound (0.83kg) projector is capable of producing an auto-focused, auto-leveled, and auto-keystoned image (of unknown brightness) at sizes from 30 to 100 inches. The translucent lens cap can be used to create “mood lighting” that can be synced with whatever audio is playing. It also features a 360-degree firing speaker, and a far-field mic array for voice control that looks like it can be toggled on and off via a switch. If you look closely at the images you’ll also see one HDMI and one USB-C jack, and what looks like touch controls for power, volume, and something else encircling the lens. The Freestyle also runs the same software experience as Samsung’s smart TVs, so you’ll be pretty well set on app selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EY25xu"&gt;Optional accessories include a waterproof case, USB-C battery pack, and a base that allows the projector to be screwed into a standard E26 lightbulb socket for power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpyOyL"&gt;Freestyle seems like an ideal companion to TikTok videos, and not so much your Blu-ray collection. If you care about banalities such as lumens, supported streaming protocols, and other such minutia then this projector clearly isn’t meant for you. But for its $900 price, there’s definitely &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; expectation of good picture quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XOAgK"&gt;Samsung says preorders for the projector will open in the US as of January 4th, with the Freestyle making its way to other markets “in the following months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVH05s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 4th, 10:05PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The article has been updated to reflect that The Freestyle offers the same software experience as Samsung’s TVs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung made a dedicated smart home dashboard, but it’s only coming to Korea</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t_5zQKR7lVaH2S8FF_vIDG-2fqU=/21x0:2190x1446/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348775/Samsung_Home_Hub.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Home Hub is a one stop shop for your SmartThings home.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sbmkzd"&gt;Samsung introduced its first standalone SmartThings smart home controller at CES 2022. The Samsung Home Hub is designed to be a central place for a household to control and monitor their smart home without having to buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22856937/samsung-family-hub-smart-fridge-bespoke-ces-2022"&gt;$4,000 smart fridge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Rfp5s"&gt;While there are precious few details about this new device, other than it’s not coming to the US yet and will launch in Korea in the first half of 2022, from the one picture we’ve got, it looks good. Honestly, it looks like the smart home controller we wish Apple, Amazon, or Google would make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnhiRA"&gt;The transition from smartphone control of the smart home to voice control has not been a seamless one. There are many times when it’s easier to tap on a screen to turn on the lights or lock the back door than it is to raise your voice, and a simple, easily accessible interface to do this is something the smart home still needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y4ftuv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If we’re going to drag members of our households into the smart home, it’s got to be easier for them to control it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CzgDIw"&gt;Smart displays from Google and Amazon have largely failed to provide a usable dashboard for this type of control, instead requiring multiple swipes and taps to get to what you need. These displays also try to be multitaskers in the home, part calendar, part radio, part TV, part smart home device, partly failing to do well most of what they attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVtKPp"&gt;Case in point, Amazon’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22839220/amazon-echo-show-15-review-wall-mounted-alexa-tablet-kitchen-tv"&gt;Echo Show 15&lt;/a&gt;, which I thought would be the solution I’d been looking for to control my smart home, since I took down the aging iPad Mini I had installed in my wall. (Its screen finally gave up the ghost — turns out being permanently plugged in and sitting vertically on my wall for four years was not good for it.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Fv9VmS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Show 15 review: Alexa’s on your wall","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22839220/amazon-echo-show-15-review-wall-mounted-alexa-tablet-kitchen-tv"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iiybzk"&gt;Sadly, the software on the Show 15 doesn’t live up to the promise of the hardware and while it looks fantastic, its limited smart home controller interface means it just won’t work for my home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1K1tn"&gt;What I, and many like me, want is a dedicated smart home dashboard, something that has shortcuts to control devices, trigger scenes, and view live camera feeds. That’s not to say there isn’t room for Echo Shows and Google Nest Hubs that do part of what they’re supposed to do really well. But a dedicated smart home interface mounted on a wall or set up on a counter is what is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INsKYD"&gt;There are a few attempts at solving this problem out there — the &lt;a href="https://www.brilliant.tech/home"&gt;touchscreen Brilliant Control Panel&lt;/a&gt; that replaces your existing light switches is an innovative solution that takes advantage of a house’s existing wiring. But installing that system in every room will set you back a pretty penny and the screen is much smaller than a tablet, making it less intuitive for all users.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XTNxLts8ZSJtwi8Oh8e9PjnyrMQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145171/2021_0611_Samsung_4D_Flex_Family_Hub_Menus_scaled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Family Hub refrigerator features a built-in tablet that acts as a smart home controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cqcOVG"&gt;What I like about Samsung’s Home Hub so far is its size, its orientation, and its potential portability. A vertical screen is actually more useful for smart home control than a horizontal one, as you can fit more icons on the screen that way and ideally have quick access to more controls. The stand for the Samsung Home Hub looks like it could also hold the screen horizontally if you preferred that, and it all looks easy enough to pick up and move into a different room when required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9UEFQ"&gt;I’ve used the Samsung Family Hub smart fridge, and the Home Hub interface looks similar. It also largely resembles a blown-up version of Samsung’s SmartThings smartphone app. There’s a Favorites home screen with your favorite devices on it and shortcuts to screens to access services such as SmartThings Cooking, a Devices page, a Life page where you’ll find Samsung’s connected services — such as Cooking, Clothing Care, Energy, Pet, and Air, and an Automations page, plus and intriguing More tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IiMBt"&gt;It’s not the smart home dashboard of my dreams, but it is a step in the right direction: a dedicated device for controlling the many aspects of your smart home that doesn’t attempt to do unnecessary party tricks but gives you and your household an easy way to turn the home on and off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="bphjZn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Smart displays from Google and Amazon have failed to provide a usable smart home interface&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zhIHQW"&gt;Speaking of Samsung’s connected services, the SmartThings Energy Service, which monitors the power usage of all compatible connected devices and recommends ways for you to save energy based on usage patterns, is being expanded to include more products and services. &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-smartthings-expands-smartthings-energy-service-for-eco-friendly-home-solutions/"&gt;Samsung also announced partnerships earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that enable real-time monitoring of whole-home energy consumption in the SmartThings App. This type of integration should allow homeowners to set up automations based on energy costs or demand response events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtNybN"&gt;During its CES keynote, Samsung also announced that it’s a founding member of the newly minted Home Connectivity Alliance (HCA). Founded in September 2021, the HCA’s main goal is creating “&lt;a href="https://homeconnectivityalliance.org/news-events/"&gt;Cloud to cloud interoperability across brands&lt;/a&gt;,” according to its website. Samsung’s press release stated the Alliance will help “ensure that having devices across multiple brands doesn’t require you to compromise your smart home experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VbFUi"&gt;Samsung is also part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter, a new smart home standard&lt;/a&gt; with similar goals. How this initiative will fit in with Matter is unclear at this stage. Matter is a local protocol, with devices communicating primarily over a local network while still allowing IP access to connect to the internet. This new Alliance appears to be focused on expanding connectivity between cloud-based services. This is something Samsung has been pursing more aggressively since it started to transition its SmartThings platform from a hardware-based smart home hub to a software-based service. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="qKUqvu"&gt;Samsung now makes the biggest, curviest, you-have-to-see-it-to-believe-it PC monitors out there; two &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editors recently replaced their multi-monitor setups with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;single 49-inch Samsung Odyssey G9&lt;/a&gt; when it went on sale &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/12/23/22850641/odyssey-g9-gaming-monitor-razer-keyboard-smart-frames-epic-games-deal-sale"&gt;for $999&lt;/a&gt; the other week. But the company’s not satisfied simply filling your &lt;em&gt;horizontal&lt;/em&gt; field of view with 49 inches of real estate — today at CES, it’s revealing an even bigger 55-inch curved screen with a special stand that lets you flip the gigantic monitor vertically, so the screen curves right over your head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qqw9ZM"&gt;It’s called the Samsung Odyssey Ark, and the company is pitching it as a real product that it’s planning to bring to the United States in the second half of the year. We don’t have a price, release date, or specs, though. It’s not even clear if it’s aimed at gaming, productivity, or just being a fashion statement. Details are so light that I’m going to share the entirety of what Samsung sent us with you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ibVMNF"&gt;Odyssey Ark is a next-generation flexible monitor perfect for people doing everything from editing to gaming at home. The Ark is the new industry-leading gaming display with a curved 55-inch display and 16:9 aspect ratio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7reYJ"&gt;The HAS (Height Adjustable Stand), pivot and tilt functionality, in addition to advanced ergonomic design, offers every gamer optimal comfort. This new vertical cockpit-style rotating display provides a new gaming experience and allows portrait or landscape orientation for multi-tasking and multi-window setup.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="or3Ptz"&gt;Multiview options allow users to adjust Odyssey Ark exactly how they want it with a totally adaptable screen size to fit the game or the program without compromising its 4K display and bright, colorful images. The monitor also features a wireless, dial controller to manage lighting and the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TR3Fa4"&gt;With a 16:9 aspect ratio, it wouldn’t be quite the same as those earlier super-ultrawide 32:9 monitors, even though the curve looks much the same from here. (Does that mean it’s just a very curved TV? Not quite, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv#comments"&gt;TVs and monitors are getting WAY closer these days&lt;/a&gt;.) The traditional aspect ratio could help with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;the stretching effect I saw in games&lt;/a&gt; and less wasted space around movies and shows. But having reviewed a pair of these super curved monitors now, I’m struggling to think of a reason why I’d want to turn one vertically. Let me know if a reason occurs to you? (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850959/lg-display-media-chair-virtual-ride-concepts-ces-2022"&gt;LG Display’s curved OLED throne&lt;/a&gt; could also use some vertical screen ideas.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyfHpy"&gt;Here’s a picture of the Odyssey Ark’s dial controller and the huge horizontal curve, by the way:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KCGQKXnTXsJtn2ul1IeZMn0S2V4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146140/Odyssey_Ark_above.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vjfJQ2"&gt;Samsung also introduced a smaller 4K version of its Odyssey Neo G9 this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22860012/samsung-odyssey-neo-g8-4k-240hz-refresh-rate-monitor-mini-led-specs"&gt;a 32-inch version called the Odyssey Neo G8&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll let you know when the Ark has more details.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony pivots into cars with Sony Mobility and a Vision-S SUV prototype at CES 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sony Mobility" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/afULrmfuNFNqAlPdCAzjxEHZqV0=/117x0:807x460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348653/sony_mobility.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dS1bnG"&gt;During Sony’s keynote presentation at CES 2022, the company rolled out the &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/vision-s/"&gt;Vision-S EV&lt;/a&gt; we saw last year, along with a new concept SUV dubbed Vision-S 02. But the big surprise (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/8/21056404/sony-vision-s-electric-concept-prototype-first-look-ces-2020"&gt;this time&lt;/a&gt;) is &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202201/22-002E/"&gt;the launch of Sony Mobility&lt;/a&gt;, a new company it’s starting that will focus on electric cars. While the tech industry has been focused for several years on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/19/8072851/apple-car-news-rumors"&gt;whether or not Apple might produce a vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, Sony already showed us a working prototype packed full of its technology, and now it’s going a step further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="xtzsK7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sony will establish an operating company “Sony Mobility Inc.” in the spring of 2022, through which the company intends to explore entry into the EV market.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="VAaH68"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3jZmLIe_vEA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eF5G4L"&gt;Sony posted several demo videos on YouTube featuring both Vision-S prototype EVs. Some, like the two-minute Concept Movie above, give hints of the picture-perfect lifestyle these cars could be a part of. Others show off the design of the user interface or feature a test of remote driving via a 5G connection linking Tokyo and Germany in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vPdGdOgJO8w48pzfC9ewnCyMoNc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146234/vision_s_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;
&lt;aside id="MDl3MV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony surprises with an electric concept car called the Vision-S ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/8/21056404/sony-vision-s-electric-concept-prototype-first-look-ces-2020"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aOynDkZ4hfoNjufq5mjDxQb1pf8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146166/sony.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kODjC9"&gt;We don’t know if this all leads to actually taking a Sony-brand car for a spin someday, but clearly, it has a vision for the autonomous, electric future that it’s pursuing.  “We are exploring a commercial launch of Sony’s EV,” said Kenichiro Yoshida, the company’s chairman, president, and CEO. That exploration will apparently find out how a “creative entertainment company” can “redefine mobility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YO0qdx"&gt;During last year’s reveal of the Vision-S, Sony talked a lot about its capabilities with sensors, and we’ll see how it uses that technological advantage in the car industry. In 2021, it already shared some pain with automakers in dealing with the chip shortage, whether it intends to join the party as a full-fledged competitor or some form of supplier or partner is what we, and possibly Sony, don’t know yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now watch the Uncharted movie’s entire plane fight scene </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJEKTwg3RcErGVO6p9oWpcuuxOo=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348751/maxresdefault__3_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IjUl9N"&gt;You &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22851876/uncharted-new-movie-trailer-tom-holland-mark-wahlberg-playstation"&gt;what kind of video game movie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; will be. You know it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738187/uncharted-movie-trailer-tom-holland-nathan-drake-mark-wahlberg"&gt;in your heart&lt;/a&gt;. But just in case you don’t know that you know it, you can now watch PlayStation Pictures’ entire live-action recreation of &lt;em&gt;the infamous scene&lt;/em&gt; from that one &lt;em&gt;Uncharted &lt;/em&gt;video game where Nathan Drake gets dragged out of an airplane by a rope ladder consisting of gigantic pieces of cargo and somehow manages to survive, without any cuts or annoying plot to get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcFwLb"&gt;There is a lot of green screen. Lots of baddies go down. Very young actors appear to do acrobatic things. &lt;em&gt;Action abounds&lt;/em&gt;, just as Sony promised it would in the company’s CES 2022 presentation this evening, where it also revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867818/sony-mobility-cars-vision-prototype-ces-2022"&gt;it’s pivoting into electric cars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISRpge"&gt;I am now adequately prepared to watch this movie. Are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54AMFr"&gt;If not, here are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738187/uncharted-movie-trailer-tom-holland-nathan-drake-mark-wahlberg"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22851876/uncharted-new-movie-trailer-tom-holland-mark-wahlberg-playstation"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; trailers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shure’s new Aonic 40 are a slightly cheaper pair of noise-canceling wireless headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BUlgSWwvmaxeMqBZocHhozkyTqU=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348677/SBH1DYBK1_AONIC40_Black_StillLife_YogaMat.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Aonic 40 is made of aluminum alloy and glass-filled nylon.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Shure&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="auklSM"&gt;Shure has expanded its headphone lineup with the release of the new Aonic 40. The Aonic 40 are a set of wireless over-ear headphones with adjustable active noise cancellation, Environment Mode, 40mm composite drivers, USB-C quick charging, and an estimated 25 hours of battery life with ANC turned on. Priced at $249, this new model sits below the current $299 &lt;a href="https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/headphones/aonic50"&gt;Aonic 50&lt;/a&gt; in Shure’s lineup — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;earned a nod in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s best noise-canceling headphones of 2021&lt;/a&gt; — and shares some features like a user-customizable EQ through the ShurePlus Play app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7hOhjp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Aonic 40 are available now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="msWzAv"&gt;While the Aonic 40 have a slightly revised look taken from their older sibling, with an aluminum build and a collapsible design, 2020’s Aonic 50 remain at the top of Shure’s wireless headphone line with larger 50mm drivers and 32-bit audio with LDAC support. The cheaper Aonic 40 have three levels of noise cancellation, with an Environment Mode to let in ambient sound — all accessible via physical controls. Shure’s claim of up to 25 hours of battery life is more than the Aonic 50’s estimated 20, putting them closer to popular competitors like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; headphones and their estimated 30 hours of battery. The new headphones can also be used for phone calls and videoconferencing, utilizing dual beamforming microphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75Heg5"&gt;The Aonic 40 are available now in black and white / tan colorways and come with a carrying case, 3.5mm cable, USB-C cable, and a two-year manufacturer’s warranty.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony confirms PlayStation VR2 name and Horizon game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bQw32w6yeHJdKURZC61oV6VsdCM=/0x1:1200x801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348643/slack_imgs.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hKW0XC"&gt;Sony has confirmed the name of its next VR headset: unsurprisingly, it’s going to be called PlayStation VR2. Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Jim Ryan announced the name as part of Sony’s CES 2022 presentation, in a move reminiscent of two years ago when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21019829/sony-playstation-5-ps5-logo-reveal-ps4-users-numbers-ces-2020"&gt;PS5 logo was first revealed&lt;/a&gt; on stage in Vegas amid much fanfare. (It looked like the PS3 and PS4 logos but with a 5.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iooj85"&gt;Sony still hasn’t shown off what the headset itself will look like, but we know quite a bit about its technical specs already. PS VR2 will work with the PS5, of course, and Sony also detailed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337700/sony-new-ps5-playstation-5-vr-controllers-features"&gt;controllers&lt;/a&gt; — now officially named Sense controllers — all the way back in March. The headset supports haptic feedback, eye tracking, 4K HDR, 90/120Hz frame rates, foveated rendering, and a field of view of 110 degrees, and it connects to the PS5 with a single USB-C cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vsoy1"&gt;Ryan also announced the first big new exclusive title for PSVR2: &lt;em&gt;Horizon Call of the Mountain&lt;/em&gt;. It’ll follow next month’s &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;, one of Sony’s tentpole releases for 2022, though there’s no indication of a release date for either the game or the headset just yet. You can watch a brief teaser trailer below. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ROG Strix Flare II Animate puts a tiny dot-matrix display on a keyboard  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SvgZDJON9iKBYaZfS0HOSSuAFMw=/0x0:2560x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348641/kt3J8vZY.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A built-in display can show animation, system info, and more.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u7I1T2"&gt;ROG, one of Asus’s gaming brands, &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/keyboards/keyboards/aura-rgb/rog-strix-flare-ii-animate-model/"&gt;has announced the Strix Flare II Animate&lt;/a&gt;, a mechanical keyboard that gets its name from the LED display built into it, which can play animations or display logos, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21052249/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-amd-ryzen-4000-dot-matrix-display-lid-ces-2020"&gt;dot-matrix displays ROG’s built into the lids of some laptops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhmXNQ"&gt;Asus calls this tech the AniMe Matrix LED display, and says you can use it to show all sorts of things; custom images and animations, system info like battery life, time, and date, and even audio visualizations. It’s blingy, to say the least, and more eye-catching than an illuminated logo. That could be a good thing though — this keyboard will cost $220, so it has to justify that price somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, ROG’s all-caps font does make it look like it’s called Anime Matrix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m0MMrm"&gt;As if the Strix Flare II Animate didn’t have enough lighting with the 312 mini-LEDs display, Asus also added an RGB strip on the bottom. “But wait,” I can hear my hands protesting. “Won’t adding a wrist rest cover up all that lighting?” And indeed, yes it would — if the wrist rest included with this keyboard didn’t include a diffuser that gives it a colorful underglow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/agLhMKlBsugjU01Blj2Ks5-z1Dg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146043/msnnkdJE.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who doesn’t love some nice, diffused RGBs?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WoIb6Uv4HDmhwfSWXbnZm7VWO3g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146052/3D_7_US_ABS_02_FA.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wrist rest even has a place to hold the diffuser that’s usually on the keyboard, which you have to take off when installing the rest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PylFBS"&gt;The Flare II Animate also has a laundry list of non-screen and RGB-related features, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZnV8Vk"&gt;8000Hz polling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dKojl3"&gt;Media controls, which take the shape of a knob, scroll wheel, and button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MEc0AX"&gt;USB 2.0 passthrough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="frPJLt"&gt;PBT Double-shot keycaps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BodmSM"&gt;Sound-dampening foam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FHqiv2"&gt;Finally, and somewhat importantly when it comes to a keyboard, are the actual key switches. The Animate comes with either Cherry MX Blue, Brown, or Red switches. You can also get it with Asus’s own ROG NX switches, also in three different flavors. It even has swappable switches, so you can switch out switches depending on your preference — for example, you could make it harder to press the space bar, and easier to press the WASD.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xZ8LFqldC-s-Q3JvzgXf_JGWdVU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146121/p.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the key caps and key switches can be swapped on the Animate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AWFK4S"&gt;If you’re not into the heavy bling (and price) of the Animate, Asus will also sell a standard Strix Flare II for $180. There are more caveats though. It doesn’t have as many switch choices, as they’re not easily swappable, and it can’t be equipped with Cherry switches.  You also, obviously, miss out on the AniMe screen — it’s replaced by an RGB ROG logo (the lights on the bottom are gone too). Other than that it’s similar; it still has most of the Animate’s features, like N-key rollover, a 2-meter braided cable, and macro support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRML1v"&gt;The Strix Flare II non-animated will be available late this month, and Asus says the Animate’s “tentative” availability is around late January as well. &lt;/p&gt;
