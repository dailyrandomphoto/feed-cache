    <title>You’ll see even more Roku TV Ready soundbars in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YRJpkubQvB1JrTYkRrpfHKQGBHs=/0x62:2040x1422/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70326354/TCL_Roku_TV_Wireless_Soundbar_Lifestyle.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;TCL’s Roku Wireless Soundbar with Roku TV Ready certification from this past October. | Image: Roku / TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gyi5I0"&gt;Roku today announced the expansion of its “Roku TV Ready” certification program, bringing in newcomer brands Polk Audio and Westinghouse early next year (and joining recent manufacturers Philips, JVC, and Element).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epDTrE"&gt;First &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21051499/roku-tv-ready-program-announced-tcl-denon-ces-2020"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, Roku TV Ready lets audio products (like soundbars) easily link up with a Roku TV set. Customers with supported soundbars get full integration of the audio settings and volume control within the Roku TV’s interface — all while using a single remote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHq34Z"&gt;Owners of some early Roku TV Ready audio devices (like the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.roku.com/blog/bose-introduces-first-soundbar-with-roku-tv-ready-certification" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose TV Speaker&lt;/a&gt;) needed only to connect the speaker hardware to a Roku TV via HDMI — but more recent devices like the TCL Roku TV wireless soundbar can simply work &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22748527/tcl-roku-tv-ready-wireless-soundbar"&gt;without the cable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FoKhid"&gt;Roku reiterates some of the benefits of the program in today’s announcement — including what the company describes as an “easy to implement” SDK plus hardware reference designs to easily build a wireless soundbar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/niAiRAIRiH-P_twFtAuKuYxLdlI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131132/RTV_Ready_2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An early Roku TV Ready setup screen for the Bose TV Speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0Rosvc"&gt;Roku’s ecosystem of smart TVs and easy-to-setup soundbars can be attractive to people looking for a simple home theater and streaming solution — so manufacturers are certainly taking notice and coming aboard. It’s common to see a homogenous display wall of cheap Roku TV sets at big-box retailers, making them a real grab-and-go solution as a gift or for a spare bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6geTi"&gt;Despite some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22797659/roku-10-5-update-tv-ultra-devices-streaming-issues-fix-youtube-tv"&gt;short-lived&lt;/a&gt; software bugs, Roku continues to provide a good platform for Smart TV and soundbar makers targeting the low to midrange home audio / video market. TCL recently launched a Google TV version of its 6-series and 5-series TVs that were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826619/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-best-buy-removal-os-bugs-slow"&gt;taken off-market&lt;/a&gt; due to sluggish software (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849334/tcl-google-tv-6-5-series-available-again-bug-fixes"&gt;later fixed&lt;/a&gt;) from which the Roku versions didn’t suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>10 Apple Arcade games for your new 2021 iPhone or iPad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jZGq8g2Z3smGeIleo1ZAmJ62yGU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70326376/RoundUpArt_iOSGames.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to play on Apple’s game subscription service&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OPLfSJ"&gt;Apple Arcade is a gaming subscription service that offers a wealth of great titles with no ads &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-arcade/?itscg=10000&amp;amp;itsct=arc-0-apl_hp-lrn_tle-apl-ref-210507"&gt;for $4.99 per month&lt;/a&gt;. Some great new games were released for it this year, but there are also many Apple Arcade-exclusive versions of some of the biggest App Store hits, and they’re just as fun as when they first came out. We’ve compiled a mix of new and classic games you might want to check out if you’re a new subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6P2Ixz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Arcade finally got the boost it needed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="PgPTGw"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8EzPyj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cffbqBWccOfLMSkMDwcvBM2eJhw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080432/battle4_Additional.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Fantasian&lt;em&gt; features handcrafted dioramas that create a distinctive style.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A6pmHU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; is a mobile JRPG from Hironobu Sakaguchi, the creator of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy. &lt;/em&gt;It takes cues from many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"&gt;classic JRPGs&lt;/a&gt;, features a soundtrack from another recognizable name to &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; fans, Nobuo Uematsu, and takes place in a game world built from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;handcrafted dioramas&lt;/a&gt;. The game first released in April and got a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616888/fantasian-part-2-apple-arcade-release-date"&gt;part two update in August&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wyEU5k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10918005" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LTnDsw"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1R4idG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clap Hanz Golf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TgnvUpuzb64HhlqyxdzcKVSAoAo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080444/IMG_1524.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Clap Hanz&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fore!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="b2zIHX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clap Hanz Golf&lt;/em&gt; is a spiritual successor to the &lt;em&gt;Hot Shots Golf&lt;/em&gt; games (or &lt;em&gt;Everybody’s Golf&lt;/em&gt; outside of North America), so if you’ve played that series, you should feel right at home with &lt;em&gt;Clap Hanz Golf&lt;/em&gt;’s arcade-y take on the sport. &lt;em&gt;Clap Hanz&lt;/em&gt; is actually the developer for all of the &lt;em&gt;Hot Shots Golf&lt;/em&gt; titles except for the first, and the studio brings all of their expertise on the virtual greens to translate the sport to Apple’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jdFCWZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10918007" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kgVYIF"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Y2g2Su"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiny Wings Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tiny Wings Plus" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aBTA28IIgWNp_iopNi6wE4e3WgQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060149/IMG_1415.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Andreas Illiger&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiny Wings Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HFw0mZ"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Tiny Wings Plus&lt;/em&gt;, you play as a tiny bird with the goal of building momentum between sloping hills. If you hit the curve of the hills just right, you pick up speed and fly through the air — which is made even more fun by the bird’s charming chirps of joy. The game is accompanied by a wonderfully peaceful song that you’ll be humming happily long after you’ve stopped playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TFbS84"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911831" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="dCbHOu"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="amswqS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Threes Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NMnt-xuA9_w2gg08LS-IBNPZ2Fs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060142/IMG_1411.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sirvo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look how happy the tiles are!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="j6utxH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Threes Plus&lt;/em&gt; is a puzzle game where you swipe tiles with numbers to match them together. It’s a bit more complex than I’m making it sound, but the game does a great job explaining its rules. You have as much time as you need to make a move, which makes it more relaxing than some other puzzle games, and it’s all elevated by a delightful presentation — the tiles are full of personality, with silly faces and cute voices, and the music is excellent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x5tNV9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911834" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="6KFRre"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Htm68t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sayonara Wild Hearts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7_P0jJle2UbCj44dXbx8QDXMyxM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080427/03_SWH_Screenshot_4K_16_9_NO_UI.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Simogo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Sayonara Wild Hearts&lt;em&gt; is filled with vibrant worlds.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TbxKKD"&gt;My colleague Andrew Webster described &lt;em&gt;Sayonara Wild Hearts&lt;/em&gt; as “an electrifying ride through a world made of pop culture,” and I think that’s pretty apt. Stages are short, too,  which means that you should be able to make progress whether you only have a few minutes to play or a little bit longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Pfx6Je"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sayonara Wild Hearts is an electrifying ride through a world made of pop culture","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882183/sayonara-wild-hearts-interview-switch-ps4-apple-arcade-simogo"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="W6dexR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10918024" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="D91kbL"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="faLRDt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/evYFhSM16zGn_YdABwKbRq5mmRQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060097/Screen_Shot_2021_12_02_at_9.41.39_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Jump through beautiful landscapes in &lt;/em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="68tpe0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City&lt;/em&gt; is a relaxing sidescroller where you jump off rolling hills. The goal is to go as far as you can without crashing into rocks or falling on your head while trying to do a flip. The excellent mechanics are complemented by a gorgeous art style, and you’ll find ample opportunities to use the built-in photo mode for snapping pictures of flips across beautiful landscapes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VZyrxp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911848" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="eFlm80"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hMg9v7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Reader&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tfJFOCTKoRzeQfRRxe3EJlbnIHI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080421/Dear_Reader_8plus_05.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A &lt;/em&gt;Dear Reader&lt;em&gt; puzzle.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x5BulC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Reader&lt;/em&gt; makes puzzles out of pages of classic books. In this relaxing game, you’re tasked with putting mixed-up passages back in order by filling in blanks, swapping words around, and more. The game offers a clever way to work through a puzzle while simultaneously absorbing some classic literature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fyRLno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10918038" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="wQA52b"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tM1JQi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jetpack Joyride Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1x-S-JfoaV1QAlK3eWGhFpeWJso=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060112/IMG_1404.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Halfbrick Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You’ll collect a lot of coins in &lt;/em&gt;Jetpack Joyride Plus&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wc7m4L"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jetpack Joyride Plus&lt;/em&gt; is an action-oriented infinite runner where you collect coins, dodge missiles and obstacles, and pick up items (including ridiculous vehicles like a giant robot dragon) to make it easier to get as far as you can. There are also fun missions that add some structure to each run, and completing them gives you more coins you can spend on upgrades and items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ok5HMu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911839" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="XVKa0N"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1vBUrw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reigns Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JqENuB4Msn0eDEkVXe_Zq4c4KXo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060135/IMG_1407.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Devolver&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swipe to learn more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSIsno"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Reigns Plus&lt;/em&gt;, a clever card-based monarchy simulator, you swipe right or left on requests brought to you to keep your reign in place for as long as possible. Each decision affects the balance of your kingdom, and some have adverse consequences that may lead to your eventual demise. The simple gameplay and excellent writing make for an engaging game where you’re constantly creating your own story, and it is satisfying to play for just a bit or for a long while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5JtErl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10918052" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="tpUhRX"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="U3r6H7"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Crossy Road Plus &lt;/em&gt;                                                                                                 &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hipster Whale&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You’ll dodge many obstacles in &lt;/em&gt;Crossy Road Plus&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eXUF0D"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Crossy Road Plus&lt;/em&gt;, you play a tiny voxel animal trying to navigate through busy streets, logs floating down rivers, and other types of perilous terrain, one tiny hop at a time. It’s kind of like a modern-day version of the classic &lt;em&gt;Frogger&lt;/em&gt;, but with more cute digital animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oJAWml"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Crossy Road Plus","description":"Hop to get as far as you can.","label":"Download now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crossy-road/id1559490508"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ySsixC"&gt;

    <title>You must never press the original Razr’s forbidden internet button</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dbzC0E04AWwrYmOE_Jroax2CbPY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70326288/akrales_211228_4946_0050.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qOql5C"&gt;The first phone I ever owned was a Motorola Razr. The Razr’s buttons are some of the finest ever to grace a mobile device. The keypad is laser-etched out of a sheet of shimmering aluminum, and when pressed, ignites in a lambent blue glow that &lt;em&gt;looked&lt;/em&gt; like the sci-fi future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dUVDH"&gt;But there was one button that I was terrified to press. In all my years of owning a Razr, I can’t say I tapped it more than once or twice, and never on purpose: the internet button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82NzrE"&gt;Located on the upper left side of the keypad, the internet button was emblazoned with a blue globe and would open the Razr’s built-in internet browser. The problem, of course, was that in the heady days of 2007, when I first got a cellphone, I didn’t pay for data. Which meant that pressing the button was a recipe for getting hit with dreaded overage fees. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3lhixRM8fvfBnN_UPMEAQc43CtI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130619/akrales_211228_4946_0047.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yj08oM"&gt;Now, would AT&amp;amp;T actually have charged me (and by extension, my family’s shared cellphone plan) hundreds of dollars for the crime of utilizing precious kilobytes of data to accidentally load Google’s rudimentary mobile site? I honestly have no idea. But with things like text messages and call minutes already heavily regulated by the carrier — leading to steep charges for overages — I wasn’t taking any chances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1IzJVh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I wasn’t taking any chances&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KV5moz"&gt;Unfortunately, the basic design of the Razr meant that those intentions were often moot. The internet button was &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;conveniently located, placed right next to the green “answer call button” and directly adjacent to the directional pad. It was far too easy to press simply by accident, launching over to the bare-bones web browser and its looming fees. My memories of the internet button are ones of accidental brushes, followed by frantic mashing of the hang up or menu buttons in a desperate attempt to exit out before I used up any data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8DulP"&gt;The Razr’s internet button was aspirational. It’s hard to remember it now, when the Razr is viewed as the ultimate expression of the feature phone. It was the final, soaring high of the era before smartphones would take over, with the iPhone and Android phones debuting just a few years later. At the time &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2004-12-06-hands-on-with-motorolas-razr-v3-for-cingular.html"&gt;it was released in 2004&lt;/a&gt;, it cost $500 &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; a two-year contract; the same price that the “entry-level” model of the original iPhone would charge when it debuted in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bllUzbFsoOu9lW2hF4v3ASb-4G4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130615/akrales_211228_4946_0026.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="diuJQ6"&gt;The Razr was a luxury phone ripped right out of the future, so it &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to offer features like email and internet, even if the cellular and technological infrastructure we had then wasn’t ready for the Razr’s ambitions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQUFvt"&gt;Looking back from the lofty vantage of 2021, where internet-connected devices are table stakes and having cellular data on a smartphone is a given, where even devices that aim to avoid “smartphone” status offer some sort of mobile data, it seems almost funny. But in Razr’s heyday of the early 2000s, the lethargic 2G internet that the flip phone offered was cutting-edge technology — and it demanded a hefty toll on the data plans of whomever dared to press it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="199axG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Razr’s internet button was aspirational&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uoKJLH"&gt;Motorola seemed to eventually realize that internet and email — despite its best intentions — weren’t really the main draws of the Razr, either. And later versions of the device (like the V3m) would ditch those buttons entirely in favor of a dedicated camera shortcut and a clear button, neither of which cost any money to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXspJ8"&gt;And Motorola may have had the last laugh after all: when the company resurrected the Razr brand in 2020, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/11/13/20963297/motorola-razr-2019-secret-retro-razr-mode-easter-egg-foldable"&gt;added an Easter egg&lt;/a&gt; that allowed users to emulate the original neon-hued interface of the 2004 flip phone. And on it was an internet button, which, when tapped, would open Google Chrome — with all the benefits of LTE and Wi-Fi that we have today. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo plans fleet of self-driving, all-electric robotaxis with Chinese automaker Geely</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O_5a0BBsHgobCyHwwUXp0YGCqVE=/240x0:2832x1728/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70326005/Waymo_Geely_Exterior_Studio.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flat floors, low entry, and B-pillarless design — Waymo’s concept art of the coming cars. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Waymo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qOdwy"&gt;Alphabet’s self-driving car company Waymo is &lt;a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/12/expanding-our-waymo-one-fleet-with.html"&gt;partnering with Chinese automaker Geely&lt;/a&gt; to create a fleet of all-electric, self-driving robotaxis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4M5cL"&gt;The cars will be designed in Sweden (where Geely owns Swedish carmaker Volvo) and will be adapted from Geely’s all-electric five-door Zeekr. Waymo will then outfit the cars with the hardware and software necessary for autonomous driving. Waymo &lt;a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/12/expanding-our-waymo-one-fleet-with.html"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it plans to deploy the vehicles in the US as part of its existing fleet of self-driving robotaxis some time “in the years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfppvz"&gt;Concept images of finished vehicle shared by Waymo show a car that is designed specifically for autonomous ride-hailing trips. It has a flat floor, low step-in height, and B-pillarless design for easy entry and exit, as well as sliding doors, reclining seats, and plenty of headroom. Waymo says future models will have an interior without steering wheel or pedals — just a screen (presumably to let riders check on the progress of their journey). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YOjbZv2nea9QR1pwNF3S1bHXgIk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131845/Waymo_Geely_SF_Exterior.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Waymo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concept images show a minivan-like vehicle designed for riders, not drivers. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0GMWWHpsgWALDAifN8JqPjiQxNs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131846/_For_blog_only__Waymo_Geely_Interior_No_Disclaimer.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Waymo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The car’s interiors will have no steering wheel or pedals — just a screen. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0DfS42"&gt;These are just concept images, though, and might not necessarily reflect the finished vehicles Geely and Waymo will eventually put on the roads. It’s notable that Waymo’s concepts make the car look much more like a minivan, while &lt;a href="https://www.topgear.com/car-news/electric/zeekr-001-has-gone-production"&gt;Geely’s Zeekr 001&lt;/a&gt; has a design that’s more like a cross between a station wagon, a shooting brake, and an SUV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHnEXZ"&gt;News of the deal between Geely and Waymo is another demonstration of just how busy the auto world is with partnerships and collaborations as self-driving and electric tech shakes up old incumbents. Waymo has partnered with Stellantis and Jaguar Land Rover to deploy and develop its autonomous capabilities, while Geely plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708804/volvo-ipo-value-geely-polestar-electric-cars"&gt;take Volvo public&lt;/a&gt; as an all-electric company, after doing the same with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696139/polestar-spac-public-value-ev-startup-volvo-geely"&gt;new Polestar brand&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG says next-generation OLED EX technology delivers improved brightness and accuracy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwv4wrbtv7o9YyVNA2djqHalcto=/17x0:944x618/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70325922/110411_57576_1754.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG will be incorporating OLED EX technology into its TVs from the second quarter of 2022. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG Display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6xamTz"&gt;LG is the maker of some of our favorite OLED TVs, so when the company says it’s improved on its basic panel technology, it’s worth paying attention. Today it did just that, with LG Display announcing its next-generation OLED technology — &lt;a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/global/2021/12/lg-display-unveils-next-generation-oled-tv-display-oled-ex/"&gt;dubbed OLED EX&lt;/a&gt; — which the company says will increase brightness by up to 30 percent, boost picture accuracy, and allow for smaller bezels in finished products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6WiRzw"&gt;These improvements are due to two key changes. The first is the use of an element known as deuterium in the chemical make-up of LG’s OLED panels, and the second is the incorporation of algorithmic image processing. LG says the latter will predict the usage of each individual light emitting diode in your TV based on your personal viewing habits to “precisely [control] the display’s energy input to more accurately express the details and colors of the video content being played.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TdnLN2CqwRlww76nbTz30BEe0XI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131833/110411_57577_1754.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG Display&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OLED EX panels use new chemical design and predictive algorithms to improve picture quality. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3rnbQ4"&gt;This all sounds well and good, but we’ll have to wait until we see these new panels in person to really judge whether OLED EX is a significant improvement or just an incremental advance with some enthusiastic branding. (On that note, LG helpfully explains that the “EX” in OLED EX comes from the words “evolution” and “experience.” Very ‘90s, I thought.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BV49OZ"&gt;LG’s claims about reduced bezel sizes with OLED EX are a little more concrete at least. The company says that based on calculations involving a 65-inch OLED display, it will be able to reduce bezel thickness from 6mm to 4mm. It’s not a huge change on paper, but given how optimized this technology already is, every little improvement has to be fought for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zLQ3x"&gt;LG says it plans to start incorporating OLED EX technology into all its OLED panels starting in the second quarter of 2022, though it’s not clear how much longer it might then take for this technology to reach consumers. As well as improving its OLED tech, LG has also been playing with some wilder concepts at this year’s CES conference, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/26/22854293/lg-display-oled-shelf-show-smart-window-transparent"&gt;showing off new transparent displays&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850959/lg-display-media-chair-virtual-ride-concepts-ces-2022"&gt;reclining, curved OLED thrones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s new recipe service uses Walmart and Amazon Fresh to deliver ingredients</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_lrR_s4ZXV9g8WmxPuWuXZgSVzA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70325844/New_Kitchen_Duo_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG ThinQ Recipe app features 10,000 one-click shoppable recipes.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D1IACE"&gt;LG just announced its latest lineup of smart kitchen appliances. Fine, but what’s notable this time is a &lt;em&gt;service&lt;/em&gt; that could make life just a little bit easier. LG says the &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/12/new-kitchen-duo-from-lg-featuring-thinq-recipe-service-upgrades-the-cooking-experience/"&gt;ThinQ Recipe app and service&lt;/a&gt; is “new for 2022” and will let users seamlessly select from thousands of recipes for delivery directly from Walmart or Amazon Fresh without ever leaving the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kN2o1d"&gt;The LG ThinQ Recipe app is powered by SideChef, which LG has been partnering with since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/18/18229232/lg-smart-oven-tovala-partnership-launch"&gt;at least 2019&lt;/a&gt;. According to an LG press release, ThinQ Recipe offers “10,000 one-click shoppable recipes” that can be added to a shopping list within the app for delivery by Walmart or Amazon Fresh. If it’s as seamless as it sounds, the service could take some of the pain out of the weekly grocery shopping experience, especially for large families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KGO2SoFcvPQCHhwJOL5l077qZUg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131792/New_Kitchen_Duo_7.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Delivery via Amazon Fresh or Walmart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7_4A9V3QBzZ8dxkFZrsAxM_tzmc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131791/New_Kitchen_Duo_9.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scan and Cook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kAyulf"&gt;ThinQ Recipe also integrates the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9L3yeWRBQE"&gt;Scan and Cook feature&lt;/a&gt; developed by Boston-based Foodspace Technology. It works by scanning the UPC bar code on (some) frozen and ready-to-cook meals to automatically send cooking instructions to compatible LG ThinQ ovens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMyyem"&gt;LG notes in the fine print that the LG ThinQ Recipe app “is applicable for models featuring Scan to Cook.” Applicable, but not &lt;em&gt;restricted&lt;/em&gt;, is how I read that, so hopefully the app and service will be available for owners of any old appliance to try.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LastPass says no passwords were compromised following breach scare</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9UzWr5puJcklk41VehGf4VrPw8c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70324985/acastro_170629_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wP2WR0"&gt;LastPass says there’s no evidence of a data breach following users’ reports that they were notified of unauthorized login attempts, as reported by &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/12/28/lastpass-master-passwords-may-have-been-compromised"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The password manager maintains that it was never compromised, and users’ accounts haven’t been accessed by bad actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOm8Gi"&gt;Nikolett Bacso-Albaum, the senior director of LogMeIn Global PR initially told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the alerts users received were related “to fairly common bot-related activity,” involving malicious attempts to log in to LastPass accounts using email addresses and passwords that bad actors sourced from past breaches of third-party services (i.e. not LastPass).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwdDiB"&gt;“It’s important to note that we do not have any indication that accounts were successfully accessed or that the LastPass service was otherwise compromised by an unauthorized party,” Basco-Albaum said. “We regularly monitor for this type of activity and will continue to take steps designed to ensure that LastPass, its users, and their data remain protected and secure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0vJju"&gt;However, late Tuesday night LastPass vice president of product management Dan DeMichele released a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;with a more detailed explanation, that says at least some of the alerts were “likely triggered in error,” due to an issue that LastPass has now resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OfqXBh"&gt;As previously stated, LastPass is aware of and has been investigating recent reports of users receiving e-mails alerting them to blocked login attempts.&lt;br&gt;We quickly worked to investigate this activity and at this time we have no indication that any LastPass accounts were compromised by an unauthorized third-party as a result of this credential stuffing, nor have we found any indication that user’s LastPass credentials were harvested by malware, rogue browser extensions or phishing campaigns. &lt;br&gt;However, out of an abundance of caution, we continued to investigate in an effort to determine what was causing the automated security alert e-mails to be triggered from our systems. &lt;br&gt;Our investigation has since found that some of these security alerts, which were sent to a limited subset of LastPass users, were likely triggered in error. As a result, we have adjusted our security alert systems and this issue has since been resolved. &lt;br&gt;These alerts were triggered due to LastPass’s ongoing efforts to defend its customers from bad actors and credential stuffing attempts. It is also important to reiterate that LastPass’ zero-knowledge security model means that at no time does LastPass store, have knowledge of, or have access to a users’ Master Password(s).   &lt;br&gt;We will continue to regularly monitor for unusual or malicious activity and will, as necessary, continue to take steps designed to ensure that LastPass, its users and their data remain protected and secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="tpWln3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Something very strange and bad is happening to a lot of people's &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LastPass?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@LastPass&lt;/a&gt; accounts. I posted this to Hacker News and it gathered 192 comments, including 7 separate reports of master password breaches &amp;amp; login attempts from the same Brazil IP range. Uhh. &lt;a href="https://t.co/tcM0aFdavv"&gt;https://t.co/tcM0aFdavv&lt;/a&gt;`&lt;/p&gt;— Greg Technology (@technology_greg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/technology_greg/status/1475600580521381889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fWXLR8"&gt;Reports started cropping up on the &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29705957"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hacker News&lt;/em&gt; forum&lt;/a&gt; after a LastPass user created a post to highlight the issue. He claims that LastPass warned him of a login attempt from Brazil using his master password. Other users quickly responded to the post, noting that they experienced something similar. As the original poster (@technology_greg) points out in a tweet, some were also alerted of an attempt from Brazil, while other attempts were traced back to different countries. This, understandably, raised concerns that a breach took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FL8wk"&gt;Even if LastPass wasn’t actually compromised, it’s still a good idea to fortify your account with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lastpass.com%2Fproducts%2Fmultifactor-authentication&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F28%2F22857485%2Flastpass-compromised-breach-scare" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;multifactor authentication&lt;/a&gt;, which uses outside sources to verify your identity before you log in to your account.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC win clears the way for a massive Wi-Fi 6E upgrade</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-JwJhJQ39rrF6yczVUtfK-PduFs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70325565/acastro__171016_1777_0001_v6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrator by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vFk4dU"&gt;A ruling (&lt;a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/7658F4CE919568A7852587B900589344/%24file/20-1190-1928330.pdf"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;) on Tuesday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has backed up an &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-opens-6-ghz-band-wi-fi-and-other-unlicensed-uses"&gt;April 2020 decision&lt;/a&gt; by the FCC to open up 1,200MHz of spectrum in the 6GHz band for unlicensed use. Unlicensed means anyone can use it, as long as they do so responsibly, covering uses like your future Wi-Fi 6E home network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSMctO"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18232026/wi-fi-6-speed-explained-router-wifi-how-does-work"&gt;Wi-Fi 6 connections make more reliable and efficient use of the same spectrum&lt;/a&gt; that’s been in use for the last couple of decades, especially when multiple devices are connected, Wi-Fi 6E routers will work at 2.4GHz and 5GHz plus the new 6GHz band. That has enough room for up to seven maximum capacity Wi-Fi streams to broadcast in the same area at once without interfering with each other or using any existing spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;
&lt;aside id="SU5GQZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Wi-Fi is getting its biggest upgrade in 20 years ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="vkbMZI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:3630921"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FedYPO"&gt;Beyond that, there’s already work on a future standard, known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11be"&gt;IEEE 802.11be&lt;/a&gt; or Wi-Fi 7. That could further optimize the use of the new band with even larger 320MHz channels, 46 Gbps maximum transfer rates, and more, but it’s not scheduled to be complete until 2024 (&lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/pdf/wi-fi-7-and-beyond.pdf"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HwbN4"&gt;In the immediate future, while 6GHz Wi-Fi has the same theoretical top speed as 5GHz Wi-Fi, the extra space means that instead of getting so much interference from other devices and nearby networks, you’ll have a faster, more consistent connection. Last year a representative for the Wi-Fi Alliance told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that this should enable 1–2 Gbps connections over Wi-Fi, similar to what you see now with mmWave 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BfK2w"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T argued against the FCC’s plan, saying the commission failed to identify and address possible interference with “tens of thousands of microwave links critical to maintaining network infrastructure,” talking about the &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/atandt-takes-fcc-to-court-over-5g-backhaul/d/d-id/772166"&gt;wireless tech that keeps many cell sites connected to the wider internet&lt;/a&gt;. In one filing spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/atandt-takes-fcc-to-court-over-5g-backhaul/d/d-id/772166"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T said, “The 6GHz FS [fixed service] band is the only band suitable for long distance transmission, routinely supporting paths between 10-50 miles and, in cases, even longer distances.” Mobile carriers preferred a plan where the FCC would auction off a chunk of the 6GHz bandwidth for use solely by their 5G networks. The FCC said that low-power indoor use protects licensed 6GHz tech like AT&amp;amp;T’s microwave links and TV broadcasts from interference, while “standard power” devices used indoors and outdoors could include automated frequency control to prevent interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="C7xt62"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FCC’s 6GHz decision could help your 5G connections too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JUAm3P"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T did not have a comment today on the outcome. However, at the same time this case is being decided, a similar objection by the FAA is being used against the FCC to pause its ability to start using C-Band spectrum for 5G. As an FAA spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “Landings during periods of low visibility could be limited due to concerns that the 5G signal could interfere with the accuracy of an airplane’s radio altimeter, without other mitigations in place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="L2E9sG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FCC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FCC&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t have to show no potential for harmful interference ever. FCC does not need to protect against wildly unlikely scenarios. Instead, FCC balances all factors to conclude whether harmful interference is unlikely enough to be negligible risk. /3&lt;/p&gt;— (((haroldfeld))) (@haroldfeld) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/haroldfeld/status/1475906524807634955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YsJ4sJ"&gt;Harold Feld, senior vice president of the advocacy group &lt;a href="https://publicknowledge.org/public-knowledge-applauds-d-c-circuit-court-ruling-affirming-fcc-rules-for-gigabit-wi-fi/"&gt;Public Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; says, “the D.C. Circuit reaffirmed that it will not second-guess the technical expertise of the FCC when the agency balances the needs of both legacy licensed users and new innovations in Wi-Fi.” FCC commissioner Brendan Carr agrees, as his statement mentioned, “Today’s opinion also underscores the FCC’s role as the nation’s lead spectrum regulator. It does so by once again affirming the FCC’s assessment of the risks of harmful interference to existing operations. U.S. leadership in wireless depends on stakeholders continuing to abide by Congress’s long-standing decision to place these determinations squarely within the FCC’s expertise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCmgG9"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;as we noted in our Wi-Fi 6E explainer last year&lt;/a&gt; when the FCC made this decision, opening up the spectrum for unlicensed use doesn’t reserve it exclusively for Wi-Fi. It could be used by other devices and connections, like 5G. Sometimes mobile carriers use unlicensed spectrum to augment their licensed spectrum with technology that helps speed up connections, and it could come into play again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Wqmceh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Big news! Today the DC Circuit unanimously upheld the FCC's decision to free up the 6 GHz band for more unlicensed use. This decision = more Wi-Fi in more places and it matters because it comes at a time when being connected is more important than ever. &lt;a href="https://t.co/jjN4G8ALzA"&gt;https://t.co/jjN4G8ALzA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jessica Rosenworcel (@JRosenworcel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1475915000862715916?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaOi6B"&gt;New FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has continued to back this measure that was decided under her predecessor, Trump appointee Ajit Pai. She &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairwoman-rosenworcel-court-victory-dc-circuit"&gt;says in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that “Today’s decision is an important step in clearing the way for next generation Wi-Fi access at a time when it is needed most. In this pandemic so much of modern life has migrated online. 6GHz Wi-Fi will help us address this challenge by offering more access in more places, faster speeds, and better performance from our Wi-Fi networks. It will also help us in our mission to connect everyone, everywhere...It is encouraging to read the Court’s strong approval of this work and we look forward to addressing on remand the narrow issue that the court identified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgcSrS"&gt;That narrow issue she mentions is a concern raised by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) about interference in the 2.4GHz spectrum that the FCC didn’t directly address, but backers of the plan appear confident it will be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etTQAh"&gt;WifiForward, an industry group representing companies like Amazon, Google, Comcast, and Arris, &lt;a href="http://wififorward.org/news/wififorward-statement-dc-circuit-court-affirms-fccs-6-ghz-order/"&gt;praised today’s decision&lt;/a&gt;, saying, “The Commission’s decision was smart, well-researched, unanimous and bipartisan. We look forward to consumers getting faster, lower latency Wi-Fi operations in the band, which will include Wi-Fi 6E and eventually next-generation Wi-Fi 7.” The Wi-Fi Alliance that helps establish and roll out the new standards had a similar reaction, &lt;a href="https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-statement-on-us-court-of-appeals-for-the-dc-circuit-decision"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt;, “Today’s court decision removes the regulatory uncertainty surrounding use of the 6 GHz band, allowing Wi-Fi Alliance and our members to expedite delivery of urgently needed Wi-Fi 6E broadband connectivity solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another T-Mobile cyberattack reportedly exposed customer info and SIMs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QSH0QlUPFQHvbkGa28e81UPZDZ8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70325030/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pj5stH"&gt;T-Mobile has suffered another cyberattack after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22646439/t-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg"&gt;being rocked by a massive data breach in August&lt;/a&gt;. This time around, attackers accessed “a small number of” customers’ accounts,  according to &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2021/12/t-mobile-has-suffered-yet-another-data-breach/"&gt;documents posted by &lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggOMKY"&gt;According to the report, customers either fell victim to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702544/fcc-rules-sim-swapping-port-out-fraud-cell-phone-carrier"&gt;SIM swapping attack&lt;/a&gt; (which could allow someone to bypass SMS-powered two-factor authentication), had personal plan information exposed, or both. The document shows that the customer proprietary network information that was viewed could’ve included customers’ billing account name, phone and account number, and info about their plan, including how many lines were attached to their account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fIswvB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The person who took credit for the summer hack called T-Mobile’s security “awful”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ystDXu"&gt;This summer, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii"&gt;carrier confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that a data breach exposed almost 50 million customers’ data, with the attacker accessing social security numbers, names, and dates of birth. (A person who claimed to be the hacker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643277/t-mobile-hacker-data-leak-claims-responsibility-criticizes-security"&gt;went on to call the company’s security practices “awful.”&lt;/a&gt;) The information reportedly exposed in December’s breach is less sensitive (and the documents say the customers who had their SIMs swapped have regained access), and is likely not as large in scope. We weren’t able to find widespread reports from customers that said they’d received notification letters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GxbXdL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;T-Mobile is taking immediate steps to help protect all individuals who may be at risk from this cyberattack. If you have any questions, send us a DM and we can discuss steps to increase your account security. ^KenStone&lt;/p&gt;— T-Mobile Help (@TMobileHelp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TMobileHelp/status/1475869083111284736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HwR6Pa"&gt;T-Mobile’s support account has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TMobileHelp/status/1475857262480539648?s=20"&gt;seemingly confirmed that there was a breach&lt;/a&gt;, responding to people on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TMobileHelp/status/1475869083111284736"&gt;to say&lt;/a&gt; that it’s taking “immediate action” to help individuals who were put at risk by the attack. The company didn’t immediately reply to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES 2022 in-person exhibitor list continues to shrink as AMD and MSI drop out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CES-2016-stock-verge-10" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzy-55ovp8FaapQCSdd_t8_Ar7M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70304211/CES-2016-stock-verge-10.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zjBRnX"&gt;CES, the world’s largest technology show, is pressing on, but with fewer major exhibitors appearing in-person than expected due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United States. On December 22nd, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lenovonews/status/1473824084018360321?s=21"&gt;exhibitor Lenovo announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would “suspend all on-site activity in Las Vegas,” following announcements from T-Mobile, Amazon, Meta, and others that they’d be ditching as well and despite CES organizers’ statements that the show would go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="CFpmOw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel says it will move to a “digital-first” experience with minimal on-site staff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NgTirG"&gt;T-Mobile was the most prominent exhibitor to bail early that week. CEO Mike Sievert, one of the Consumer Electronics Show’s featured speakers, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065"&gt;publicly announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that he would no longer be doing a keynote and would “significantly limit our in-person participation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jiJmu"&gt;Amazon decided not to attend the show in-person entirely, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1473486307657539584?s=21"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, and AT&amp;amp;T also dropped out on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inafried/status/1473755300092002304"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Axios’ &lt;/em&gt;Ina Fried&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL1S9o"&gt;Hisense typically has a large press conference and significant presence in the LVCC’s central hall, but on Thursday morning, Hisense announced it decided to make its January 4th press conference fully virtual “to ensure the health and safety of our team.” The company still plans to have a booth at the show, with in-person walkthroughs for those attending and virtual ones for those covering it from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixYeKu"&gt;It was followed closely later in the day by Waymo, as Alphabet’s self-driving car company &lt;a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/12/meet-waymo-at-ces-2022.html"&gt;updated its blog post&lt;/a&gt; to explain the decision. “Based on quickly rising COVID-19 infection rates, Waymo has made the difficult decision not to participate in person at CES 2022. We are aiming to still virtually participate in some CES-related events. In particular, as part of our Self-Driven Women series, our co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana and our Global Head of Public Policy Michelle Peacock will speak at several virtual panel discussions with the Female Quotient, the official equality partner of CES 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="txgm6L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google: “we have decided to withhold from having a presence on the show floor of CES 2022.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lEQ22e"&gt;Chipmaking giant Intel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22852045/ces-2022-intel-skipping-show-covid-19'"&gt;said on Thursday afternoon&lt;/a&gt; that “[after] consulting with health officials and in the spirit of Intel’s safety policy, our plans for CES will move to a digital-first, live experience, with minimal on-site staff.” Gaming accessory maker HyperX also said it’s pivoting away from in-person plans and will support conversations and activities virtually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GlLye"&gt;The dominoes continued to fall on Thursday, as General Motors announced its presence will be all-digital. Less than a day ago, GM confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it still planned to attend CES, where CEO Mary Barra &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712710/general-motors-investor-day-chevy-silverado-ev-2022-consumer-electronics-show"&gt;was scheduled as a keynote speaker, and it planned to debut an electric version of the Chevrolet Silverado&lt;/a&gt;, but now that has changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xr5Yi4"&gt;A statement from the company says, “We have decided to move to an all-digital approach with our activation at CES 2022 in January. CES is an important technology platform, and we are continuing with our plans on January 5 to share our significant company news including the reveal of the Chevrolet Silverado EV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHR3zT"&gt;GM was closely followed out the door by Google, which has frequently used CES to host larger and more extravagant showcases for its new hardware. It had planned to have a booth at the event, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reporter Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1474130973923033117"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday that, like its corporate sibling Waymo, it is backing out of the in-person event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyortL"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Google communications manager Ivy Hunt says, “After careful consideration we have decided to withhold from having a presence on the show floor of CES 2022. We’ve been closely monitoring the development of the Omicron variant, and have decided that this is the best choice for the health and safety of our teams. We will continue to collaborate closely with both CTA and our partners to identify and support virtual opportunities, and we look forward to sharing the latest Google innovations with you all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUKJbt"&gt;With just a few days left before the show begins, the list of dropouts continues to grow. AMD had previously said it was still planning to appear, but on December 28th (via &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/msi-cancels-ces-2022-attendance"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) it issued the following statement: “AMD has decided to cancel our in-person presence at CES 2022 in Las Vegas and will instead transition to a virtual experience. While the AMD 2022 Product Premiere was always planned as a digital-only livestream, our in-person engagements will now transition to virtual in the best interest of the health and safety of our employees, partners and communities. We look forward to sharing all our exciting news as scheduled on January 4th.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDsNQ3"&gt;Another late scratch is MSI. The computer maker &lt;a href="https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-Canceled-the-Physical-Presence-at-2022-CES122948"&gt;says in a post on its website&lt;/a&gt; that “Since December, the rapidly spreading Omicron variant has brought the USA a surge of COVID-19 cases. The health and well-being of our employees, customers and fans are our top priority. Hence, we have decided not to participate in-person at CES 2022 and will join the show virtually with our online product launch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgEruz"&gt;OnePlus was not an official exhibitor at the show, but it says it has canceled an event that was planned to coincide with it in Las Vegas. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/28/more-companies-bow-out-of-in-person-ces-presence/?"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes that Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble, the parent company of Gillette and Oral-B, which have used CES to debut new technology, is also skipping the in-person event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;CES UPDATE: After closely monitoring the current trends surrounding COVID, it is in the best interest of the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners, and our communities to suspend all on-site activity in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;— Lenovo Stories &amp;amp; News (@LenovoNews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LenovoNews/status/1473824084018360321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gHrSsq"&gt;Meta, Twitter, Pinterest, and iHeartRadio also all announced that they won’t attend this version of the annual Las Vegas expo in light of a new wave of COVID-19 cases in the US, as have major tech publications including &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/makejdm/status/1473092737457176577"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanaWollman/status/1473336456932470798"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dewalt/status/1473694554322784263"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bheater/status/1473365588672225286"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LanceUlanoff/status/1473376084582445069"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mspoonauer/status/1473379627380977665"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Guide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7H53V"&gt;“T-Mobile will continue to serve as a CES sponsor and title sponsor of the DRL Championship Race but the vast majority of our team will not be traveling to Las Vegas,” reads &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness%2Ft-mobile-announcement-about-ces-2022&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F21%2F22849223%2Fces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company’s press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Additionally, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert will no longer be offering a keynote in-person or virtually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="jLod2S"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m sorry we’ll miss seeing everyone at CES this year, but we are prioritizing the safety of our team and other attendees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our statement here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7"&gt;https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Sievert (@MikeSievert) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yqsd2L"&gt;Lenovo typically has a medium-sized presence at CES, typically making an array of announcements, though most of its activity generally happens on the Las Vegas Strip and in private meeting rooms rather than a public booth on the show floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmVmpc"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, by comparison, had a seemingly tiny presence at this year’s show. While the company’s “AT&amp;amp;T Business” division is listed as a featured exhibitor, the company was not expected to have a keynote. AT&amp;amp;T Business also only appears &lt;a href="https://ces22.mapyourshow.com/8_0/floorplan/?st=keyword&amp;amp;sv=at%26t&amp;amp;hallID=A"&gt;to have one very small booth&lt;/a&gt; in the Health and Wellness section of the Las Vegas Convention Center’s North Hall, with no booths for AT&amp;amp;T in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eq0giq"&gt;Other companies that might make a sizable impact if they ditched CES 2022 include Samsung, which has a featured keynote like T-Mobile, and companies that generally rent a lot of prominent space on the show floor, like LG, Panasonic, and Sony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4jdF50"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies like Samsung, GM, Intel, LG, Panasonic, Sony, Nikon, Canon are the likely tipping point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MwuYQr"&gt;We’ve asked some key companies if they’re still committed; a Sony rep suggested to us that the company still plans to attend, and LG said that “Unless CTA says otherwise,” it’s “still on board.” CES maps show that LG has a very large booth at CES, but the company’s said it’s taking a hybrid approach, making use of QR codes and AR to show off its wares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHHS0K"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-21/meta-twitter-scrap-plans-for-ces-in-las-vegas-after-covid-surge?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last week that AMD (now out) and Samsung were still planning a limited presence, Nvidia will have a virtual-only keynote, and that Qualcomm, OnePlus, and HTC still plan to attend. Sony and Samsung have said they are “monitoring local conditions,” which could be read as a meaningless platitude but also gives those companies an easy out if they decide the conditions have changed (as it has already been for companies like Google and GM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWcwdj"&gt;On December 21st, the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES, stated that it still plans to host an in-person show. “At this point, we’re very much focused on having this show and doing it safely and putting the right protocols in place to ensure that people feel comfortable with it,” &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/ces-plans-to-push-forward-with-an-in-person-conference-despite-omicron-concerns/"&gt;a CTA exec told &lt;em&gt;Adweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRyNeA"&gt;The day after that, the CTA said it’s received 42 exhibitor cancellations but has also added 60 new exhibitors in that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnjIMB"&gt;Here is the CTA’s full statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; from Jean Foster, head of marketing and communications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X8c2Bw"&gt;CES will be in person on January 5-8 in Las Vegas with strong safety measures in place, and our digital access is also available for people that don’t wish to, or can’t travel to Las Vegas. Our mission remains to convene the industry and give those who cannot attend in person the ability to experience the magic of CES digitally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLnfPt"&gt;While we recently received 42 exhibitor cancellations (less than 7% of our exhibit floor), since last Thursday, we’ve added 60 new exhibitors for our in person event. Registrations for both our digital access and our Las Vegas event are continuing to show strong momentum, with thousands more registrations in the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1X0BM"&gt;CES 2022 will go forward as important innovation for world health and safety, mobility and solving problems will be exhibited. Furthermore&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt; thousands of smaller and medium sized companies rely on CES for their business. We have increased our official count to over 2200 exhibitors and as &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.ces.tech_News_Press-2DReleases_CES-2DPress-2DRelease.aspx-3FNodeID-3D5c6782e3-2D7c62-2D4028-2D8e2a-2D827a1c58cba6&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=XbPQjtdhJg1hC5-IccTkDxSrqhL0VWnmU2huSyK6TFc&amp;amp;m=dQ0shU35BhNLRgThHTf0QckcsMkcwMRMPdLqg7ETJTibsQxGxH9RNCOVK5RsfJwX&amp;amp;s=J4H1QKA0t9EvNmzUV1I4ySVKFQ2D9X0nI2yoJ60Bq0I&amp;amp;e="&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; many of our top elected officials from both political parties will be at CES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tctO7m"&gt;Given CES’ comprehensive health measures — vaccination requirement, masking and availability of COVID-19 tests — coupled with lower attendance and social distancing measures, we are confident that attendees and exhibitors can have a socially distanced but worthwhile and productive event in Las Vegas, as well as a rewarding experience on our digital access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4Y3xVw"&gt;In the recent past, we’ve seen the question of “will they or won’t they cancel due to COVID” take a while to resolve. Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the first big tech show to go on after the COVID-19 pandemic initially hit, held out for quite some time even as partners continued to cancel. Eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21127754/mwc-2020-canceled-coronavirus-trade-show-phone-mobile-world-congress-gsma-statement"&gt;organizers did have to cancel MWC 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Major tech companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430649/samsung-mobile-world-congress-mwc-barcelona-remote-covid"&gt;ditched the in-person version of MWC 2021&lt;/a&gt; as well. CES 2021, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344977/ces-2021-online-cta-las-vegas-conference-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;was all virtual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykL0Nr"&gt;As far as why “CES will and must go on,” CTA president and CEO Gary Shapiro &lt;a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-ces-will-and-must-go-on-in-las-vegas-2502202/"&gt;published a Christmas Day op-ed in the&lt;em&gt; Las Vegas Review-Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that says, among other things, “ CES 2022 will kick off 2022 in messy fashion, but it will be chock full of innovation and full of entrepreneurs and businesses. We will all be taking risks. But without risk there is no innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDMUvY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:41 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional company replies via Bloomberg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="RVBWcH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 22nd, 9:57PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information about Lenovo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c33chn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 23rd, 9:56AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Hisense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8vEK5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 23rd, 2:09PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statements from Waymo and Intel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
