    <title>Balan Wonderworld gets day one patch to fix ‘potential flashing bug’ posing an epilepsy risk</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qoiUP13MnqpwRuL2fV_ddnasEdQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69032590/ss_0f4ee1f6a189e1cac9db44a8c981564fbfb47823.1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x1onyQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Balan Wonderworld&lt;/em&gt;, a new game from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335755/balan-wonderworld-xbox-series-x-sonic-creators-gameplay-trailer"&gt;two of the original creators of &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is out today. But before you jump into the game, make sure you’ve installed its day one patch. It fixes sequences in a “potential flashing bug” that could present a seizure risk. On Thursday, a video of the game’s final boss fight was uploaded to YouTube, and in it, there are occasional moments where the entire screen is taken over by rapid white flashes without warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLXNye"&gt;“We have received reports of a photo-sensitive epilepsy risk from a potential flashing bug if playing the game un-patched,” the &lt;em&gt;Balan Wonderworld&lt;/em&gt; account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/balanwworld/status/1375399583346524162"&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. “The Day 1 Patch prevents this issue as well as enhances the overall play experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvvgP7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Please ensure that you install the Day 1 Patch before playing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have received reports of a photo-sensitive epilepsy risk from a potential flashing bug if playing the game un-patched. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Day 1 Patch prevents this issue as well as enhances the overall play experience.&lt;/p&gt;— Balan Wonderworld (@balanwworld) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/balanwworld/status/1375399583346524162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fgDWoJ"&gt;The patch comes after &lt;em&gt;Game Informer&lt;/em&gt; editor Liana Ruppert &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/03/25/epileptic-psa-balan-wonderworld-update"&gt;wrote about the dangerous video&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. You might recognize Ruppert as the person who wrote about experiencing a grand mal seizure &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/12/07/cyberpunk-2077-epileptic-psa"&gt;while playing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;ahead of its release, which led developer CD Projekt Red to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22170547/cyberpunk-2077-update-hotfix-cd-projekt-red-epilepsy-risk-braindance"&gt;release a patch&lt;/a&gt; a day after the game’s launch making changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7jQVP"&gt;Ruppert said people informed her of the &lt;em&gt;Balan Wonderworld&lt;/em&gt; video on Thursday, and when she began watching it, “I immediately had to shut it off. Instantly, my right side dropped, and I could feel the onset of an episode.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RU5ebH"&gt;She then made a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DirtyEffinHippy/status/1375226743733293058"&gt;PSA on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;about the video and heard some scary stories from others who watched it — even from people with no prior history of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="K8rw9T"&gt;Since that tweet went live, I’ve had numerous people reach out, including developers and other QA devs, saying that they aren’t even epileptic, but they felt “odd” after watching. My husband, who had no prior issues with epilepsy or neurological triggers, complained of feeling dizzy before he threw up. Several others reported the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6rZYWQ"&gt;I also watched the video in question yesterday and again while writing this article. My eyes have hurt for nearly an hour, and my stomach is a little upset even after just watching it in a small window on YouTube. I can see how &lt;a href="https://www.brainfacts.org/diseases-and-disorders/epilepsy/2021/how-do-flashing-lights-trigger-epileptic-seizures-012821"&gt;someone at risk of seizures&lt;/a&gt; might be particularly vulnerable if they were playing the game on their TV at home and this bug happened. (I am not linking to the video because, in my opinion, it is just that bad.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dz9Vk7"&gt;Typically, there are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; opportunities to catch this kind of bug, such as in QA testing or through the platform certification process. Somehow, though, this seemingly&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;dangerous bug seems to have slipped by all of those potential checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6DIek"&gt;I will give the &lt;em&gt;Balan Wonderworld&lt;/em&gt; developers and publisher Square Enix some credit since they’ve already addressed the issue with the day one patch. And CD Projekt Red also acted swiftly to fix &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. But these shouldn’t have been issues in the first place, and developers, publishers, and platform holders need more stringent processes to ensure that their games don’t present health risks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volkswagen offers new details about its adorable ID Buzz electric microbus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KJL7Z6wMzjx9ba5regrjDjatfrw=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69032386/id_buzz_concept_7416.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZxX9g"&gt;Volkswagen clarified some new details about the release of the ID Buzz, the electric microbus that we first saw in concept form &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/10/14215476/volkswagen-microbus-concept-id-buzz-emissions-scandal"&gt;way back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXOGXX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35940134/vw-id-buzz-us-on-sale-date/"&gt;In an interview with &lt;em&gt;Car and Driver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;VW’s head of commercial vehicles, Carsten Intra, confirmed previous reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/19/16173938/volkswagen-microbus-i-d-buzz-concept-production-nostalgia"&gt;the ID Buzz’s release in the US&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35217494/vw-id-buzz-electric-microbus-delayed-2023/"&gt;delayed from 2022 to 2023&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, only the passenger version of the ID Buzz was getting a US-release, while Europe would be seeing both a commercial and passenger version of the van. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mrlbf6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The commercial version will be VW’s first autonomous vehicle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OZ0mtJ"&gt;The entry-level version of the ID Buzz will likely have rear-wheel drive and 200 horsepower, while a more powerful trim level would get all-wheel drive and around 300 horsepower, &lt;em&gt;Car and Driver&lt;/em&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDajyH"&gt;In Europe, the commercial version of the ID Buzz — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882400/vw-volkswagen-id-buzz-cargo-van-concept-electric"&gt;first introduced as the Buzz Cargo&lt;/a&gt; — would have sensors and software that would enable autonomous capabilities. But a self-driving version of the Buzz won’t be available until after the regular version is released. The VW Group, which also owns Audi, Skoda, and Porsche, expects it to be its first autonomous vehicle ever released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJPwdm"&gt;The ID Buzz is meant to be a clear homage to the iconic vehicle that the company sold in North America between 1950 and 1980. The production versions are expected to deviate little from the blunt-faced original. (All of the batteries will be mounted under the floor.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCeCAX"&gt;When it’s released, the ID Buzz will join &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20857217/volkswagen-vw-id3-electric-price-specs-mile-range-frankfurt-motor-show-2019"&gt;the ID 3 hatchback&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22302883/vw-id4-review-volkswagen-ev-specs-range-photos-video"&gt;the ID 4 compact SUV&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291294/vw-id5-ev-electric-suv-coupe-production-volkswagen-2021"&gt;soon-to-be-released ID 5 coupe&lt;/a&gt;, as the newest member of VW’s fast-growing lineup of electric vehicles. China will also be getting an elongated ID 6 at some point in the future. VW’s ID electric lineup also includes concept versions of a large SUV (&lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-volkswagen-i-d-roomzz-concept-has-room-for-days-an-1834048772"&gt;ID Roomzz&lt;/a&gt;) and a dune buggy (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254329/volkswagen-id-buggy-electric-concept-car-geneva-motor-show-2019"&gt;ID Buggy&lt;/a&gt;). All are being built on Volkswagen’s modular electric vehicle platform known as MEB.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Second voting machine company sues Fox News over disinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Visits “Lou Dobbs Tonight”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N4OPvfnf0MGPxa4AnmRsXKXrNYU=/0x0:5437x3625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69032382/1176681622.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by John Lamparski/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2FR08R"&gt;Dominion Voting Systems has become the second voting tech company to sue Fox News for airing conspiracy theories about its products. The company &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22400231/Dominion_v._Fox_News_Complaint.pdf"&gt;sued Fox News&lt;/a&gt; for defamation in Delaware state court today, saying the network “endorsed, repeated, and broadcast a series of verifiably false yet devastating lies” claiming Dominion manipulated votes and rigged the election against former President Donald Trump. It’s requesting $1.6 billion in damages alongside expenses for security and combating a “disinformation campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8trNlH"&gt;Dominion’s suit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266731/smartmatic-fox-news-lawsuit-rudy-giuliani-defamation-election-disinformation"&gt;follows a February complaint against Fox&lt;/a&gt; from competing company Smartmatic. Both companies allege that, in the months following the 2020 presidential election, several Fox News hosts pushed a false narrative about them. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-55090145"&gt;The conspiracy&lt;/a&gt; — promoted by Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell — claimed Dominion was owned by Smartmatic, and both companies flipped votes to President Joe Biden. However, proponents never produced evidence supporting these claims, and they conflicted with the results of official audits that found no significant election fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JgYpBT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Fox’s pandering ... paid off big time. Its victim, however, was Dominion.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3bhI0v"&gt;Like Smartmatic, Dominion says these false claims damaged its reputation and incited harassment against its employees, while boosting Fox’s ratings. “Fox’s pandering to the baseless narrative that Dominion rigged the election paid off big time. Its victim, however, was Dominion, not to mention the truth,” the complaint says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPckyA"&gt;Fox News contested the allegations in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Fox News Media is proud of our 2020 election coverage, which stands in the highest tradition of American journalism, and will vigorously defend against this baseless lawsuit in court,” a spokesperson said. The spokesperson also referenced its motions to dismiss the Smartmatic lawsuit — &lt;a href="http://press.foxnews.com/2021/02/fox-news-media-moves-to-dismiss-smartmatic-lawsuit/"&gt;which it said&lt;/a&gt; “strikes at the heart of the First Amendment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvhoUK"&gt;Fox News isn’t Dominion’s only target. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220553/dominion-conspiracy-theory-lawsuit-former-trump-lawyer-voting-machine"&gt;sued Powell in January&lt;/a&gt; and followed with &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/25/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-dominion-trump.html"&gt;a suit against Giuliani&lt;/a&gt; — as well as &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dominion-sues-mypillow-ceo-mike-lindell-over-election-claims-11613996104"&gt;MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell&lt;/a&gt;, a staunch conspiracy promoter — last month. Powell &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/3/23/22346333/sidney-powell-dominion-defamation-lawsuit-trump"&gt;responded to the suit against her&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, arguing that her statements couldn’t be considered defamatory because “no reasonable person” would conclude they were factual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnCi2Y"&gt;Disinformation has become a focal point for critics of social media, with Congress &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22351192/tech-ceo-hearing-mark-zuckerberg-jack-dorsey-sundar-pichai-facebook-google-twitter"&gt;dedicating a hearing&lt;/a&gt; to the topic yesterday. While lawmakers have had trouble pinpointing a solution for online disinformation, companies like Dominion and Smartmatic are testing the effects of existing laws — and Fox News has become one of their biggest targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xuxd1U"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 4:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Fox News.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: I am once again asking you to update your iPhone for security reasons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VxHQW4uDxVQcEAoXw-3eYmmxcXo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69032360/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iOeUCn"&gt;Putting off iOS updates for a week or two is generally fine, but it’s probably a good idea to download the latest one, iOS 14.4.2, as soon as you can. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212256"&gt;It fixes a security flaw&lt;/a&gt; that Apple says may have been exploited out in the wild (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/26/apple-releases-ios-14-4-2-with-security-fixes/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The update also applies to iPadOS, so take a couple of minutes out of your day to go to Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Software Update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zVXoA"&gt;According to Apple’s update notes, the security flaw allowed for &lt;a href="https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/universal-cross-site-scripting-uxss/"&gt;universal cross-site scripting&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, a malicious website or script could gain access to information from other webpages you have open, which isn’t great, especially since Apple says that some sites may be doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WaCaFS"&gt;As I said back in January &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251149/iphone-update-14-4-fixes-exploited-security-vulnerabilities"&gt;when Apple released a similar update&lt;/a&gt;, this doesn’t mean it’s time to completely lock down your phone and treat it like it’s radioactive until you can get it updated. Just stay clear of sketchy websites (which is good advice in general), and update your phone sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OneWeb and SpaceX are racing to beam internet to the Arctic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_2i_HMgc1COF9f0Z2hooNVbsGwo=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69032340/iss061e138167.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A view from the International Space Station of an aurora blanketing the northern night sky.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sMmpG0"&gt;Rival satellite internet companies OneWeb and SpaceX are vying to snag lucrative deals to provide broadband internet to Earth’s northernmost latitudes. OneWeb’s launch of 36 satellites this week inched it closer to its goal of beaming internet into the region by year’s end. SpaceX’s Starlink, which is already providing internet to thousands of consumers through a beta program, is eyeing the same area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAv1Mq"&gt;Billions of dollars in government funds are on the line for companies that can connect the region. The Arctic is a nearly broadband desert for the US military, and the UK is willing to spend big to connect rural areas to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="86IQj5"&gt;SpaceX is &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/elon-musks-starlink-in-talks-with-uk-to-solve-broadband-problems-12250541"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; eying a chunk of the UK’s new $6.9 billion Project Gigabit program, which aims to provide “lightning-fast” broadband internet to areas with little to no internet access. OneWeb is also in talks with the program, the company’s government affairs chief Chris McLaughlin told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;OneWeb, a UK-based firm, which was rescued from bankruptcy last year by the British government and Indian telecom giant Bharti Global, thinks it has an advantage in that race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QIVcS"&gt;McLaughlin brushed off SpaceX founder Elon Musk’s foray into the UK’s rural internet program as “a classic piece of Mr. Musk fluff.” Musk’s bid for the subsidies, McLaughlin said, “tries to suggest that there is a huge pot of gold waiting in English fields that he can pick up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AG8f13"&gt;“We’ve also had conversations with [UK Minister for Digital Infrastructure Matt Warman], and indeed with his boss, and indeed with his boss’s boss, on what could be done with OneWeb,” McLaughlin said in an interview, predicting the Gigabit awards would go to numerous telecom providers that will work together. OneWeb hopes it can “repay the confidence in the UK government” in its bid for rural internet subsidies, he said, reciprocating the government’s help in pulling OneWeb out of bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YgmaT6mX0YzPP47mH8Ryugw-DOU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22400288/ExT_bv5WUAI_1VH.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Soyuz rocket launches 36 OneWeb satellites to orbit from the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia’s Far East.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a2UFel"&gt;“5 to 50”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RqCu2F"&gt;Wednesday night’s launch of 36 internet satellites put OneWeb’s total constellation at 146. The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20849142/oneweb-arctic-internet-coverage-space-2020"&gt;initial plans&lt;/a&gt; to cover the Arctic with internet by 2020 were derailed by bankruptcy. Now, it has a new “5 to 50” goal: a countdown of five launches to enable coverage everywhere north of “50” degrees latitude. A December launch marked the first, Wednesday’s launch was the second, and the company aims to hit the fifth launch in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pjOf8X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Less is more”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FV1g4a"&gt;Unlike SpaceX’s constellation, which orbits the planet closer along equatorial lines, OneWeb’s orbits from pole to pole, meaning Earth’s traditionally internet-quiet northern and southernmost regions will soon be a bustling satellite intersection for the company’s network. McLaughlin said the next generation of OneWeb satellites will probably have optical links, which enables the satellites to talk to one another in space. That could reduce the need for pricy ground stations in hard-to-reach areas in the Arctic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPWBFj"&gt;OneWeb hasn’t released designs for user terminals or monthly pricing plans, and its planned constellation of 648 satellites is much smaller than SpaceX’s. But “less is more,” McLaughlin says. Satellites in higher altitudes can beam to wider swaths of the Earth (imagine shining a flashlight on a table, and the cone of light gets wider the farther you pull it away). The downside to satellites in higher altitudes is greater latency, or the time it takes data to transfer between the satellite and its destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GuaGlJ"&gt;SpaceX’s Arctic goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BzY0e8"&gt;SpaceX, on the other hand, is further ahead with its satellite network, propelled by lofty funding rounds and cash from its billionaire founder. It has launched over 1,300 Starlink satellites into a lower orbit than OneWeb’s constellation, and that’s just a fraction of its planned 30,000-large constellation. The company this year rolled out an open beta phase for consumers in the US, UK, Canada, Germany, and New Zealand, offering a Starlink terminal kit for $499 and $99 per month thereafter to at least 10,000 users, with many elated by the network’s speeds of 120 megabits per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FyZkP"&gt;SpaceX got last-minute regulatory approval to launch its first 10 polar-orbiting Starlink satellites in January, and it’s lobbying the Federal Communications Commission for permission to loft dozens more satellites in polar orbits, where it can “bring the same high-quality broadband service to the most remote areas of Alaska,” it said in a filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z59tqp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SpaceX hired a retired general who pushed for potential SpaceX subsidies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GKm7I4"&gt;SpaceX sees that area as particularly valuable for the US military, and the company has been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/USNorthernCmd/status/1207005105007943680?s=20"&gt;courting&lt;/a&gt; the Pentagon in recent years. As the US Northern Command eyes commercial options to bring faster internet to the Arctic, an increasingly contested domain between the US and Russia, Pentagon officials have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/USNorthernCmd/status/1207005105007943680?s=20"&gt;visited&lt;/a&gt; SpaceX (and OneWeb) facilities along the way. And the Air Force’s Global Lightning program, which, in 2018, awarded SpaceX $28 million to test &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spacex-starlink-airforce/musks-satellite-project-testing-encrypted-internet-with-military-planes-idUSKBN1X12KM"&gt;Starlink on military planes&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2021/03/afrl-northcom-eye-commercial-internet-sats-for-arctic/"&gt;nearing&lt;/a&gt; a new phase to dole out contracts for satellite internet in Arctic regions. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ok3nXt"&gt;The military interest for better Arctic internet was clear last year, when Gen. Terrence O’Shaughnessy, the former commander of US Northern Command, &lt;a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/battlefield-tech/c2-comms/2020/02/24/will-spacex-and-oneweb-help-the-military-stay-connected-in-the-arctic/"&gt;asked Congress&lt;/a&gt; for $130 million for a polar communications program that would leverage Starlink and OneWeb. Months later, Gen. O’Shaughnessy retired to privately consult SpaceX, according to two people familiar with the move, speaking under anonymity to discuss personnel matters. As &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-once-a-washington-outsider-courts-military-business-11604517046"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported last year&lt;/a&gt;, it’s unclear whether O’Shaughnessy is fully employed by SpaceX or is a paid contractor. SpaceX didn’t return requests for comment. O’Shaughnessy, through a spokesperson, could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m4Mcwm"&gt;An increasingly important Arctic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YYN6sZ"&gt;In recent years, the US military has scrambled to rethink its strategy in the Arctic as a rapidly changing climate melts the region’s ice caps, redrawing key shipping routes and opening up new ones for naval vessels and submarines. The push for Arctic broadband is part of that shift in strategy. Commanders need better communications and internet access for ships and planes now that the region’s barriers to movement are literally melting away, shaping a new stage of competition between the US, Russia, and China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ye40T0"&gt;“It’s been an important region for a while, but is growing in importance,” says Chris Quilty, a partner and satellite industry analyst at Quilty Analytics. “Most of the communications satellites that exist today are flying over the equator, and they can’t see the polar region — it’s just too high of an altitude with the curvature of the Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPu9ni"&gt;Some existing satellites in higher orbits provide data services to the polar regions, but those are limited, especially for the military’s growing demand for data. OneWeb and longtime satellite operator Telesat’s proposed satellite network, which will partially orbit Earth from pole to pole, are aiming to fill the Arctic data gap. SpaceX is awaiting FCC approval to send 348 more satellites into polar orbit, realizing the demand from “Federal broadband users for which there could be significant national security benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZO9HZ"&gt;While SpaceX’s Starlink wades into polar orbit, the orbital design already approved for OneWeb’s constellation gives it an Arctic advantage. For OneWeb, “all the satellites cross over the polar region, so the highest concentration of their capacity is in the polar regions,” Quilty says. “So that opens up the opportunity of going from being in a position where there’s a shortage of data, where there’ll be a massive amount of data available.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volkswagen wraps multiyear investigation into Dieselgate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HtEgfJeWrtzqXnsaFafNlRw-xnI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69032199/acastro_200406_1777_volkswagen_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6ukqhJ"&gt;The Volkswagen Group has wrapped a multiyear internal investigation into Dieselgate, and it says it will try to &lt;a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagens-supervisory-board-asserts-claims-for-damages-against-prof-martin-winterkorn-and-rupert-stadler-6916"&gt;pry compensation from&lt;/a&gt; former CEO Martin Winterkorn and former Audi CEO Rupert Stadler to make up for some of the massive financial damages that resulted from the emissions cheating scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wvMV9"&gt;The law firm Volkswagen hired to perform the investigation covered more than 65 petabytes of data, including some 480 million documents. About 1.6 million of those files were “identified as relevant, screened and reviewed,” the German automaker says. The law firm also performed 1,550 interviews and reviewed files from prosecutorial and judicial proceedings around the world that came as a result of the company’s actions. The internal probe was “by far the most comprehensive and complex investigation carried out in a company in German economic history,” Volkswagen writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npMWHt"&gt;Winterkorn resigned from running Volkswagen back in September 2015, almost immediately after news broke of the scandal. He was later arrested in Germany and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18369528/vw-ceo-martin-winterkorn-dieselgate-germany-volkswagen-emissions-scandal"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; of not just knowing the company’s diesel cars had software that fooled regulators, but for sitting on the Environmental Protection Agency’s discovery of the cheat for a year. Winterkorn has also been charged in the US but is unlikely to ever be extradited. He remains on trial in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LhG285"&gt;Stadler was arrested in 2018 by German authorities, which caused Audi to push back the reveal of its first all-electric car, the E-Tron. Stadler was later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/2/17928314/audi-ceo-rupert-stadler-fired-volkswagen-dieselgate"&gt;forced out of his role by Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEbbnG"&gt;Volkswagen said Friday that it’s also seeking damages from four other former board members: Ulrich Hackenberg and Stefan Knirsch (Audi), Wolfgang Hatz (Porsche), and Heinz-Jakob Neusser (Volkswagen) — the latter of whom has been &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/sff/cases-corporate/volkswagen-ag/heinz-jakob-neusser"&gt;criminally charged by the Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1rzRb"&gt;The investigation’s end is something Volkswagen will undoubtedly point to moving forward any time Dieselgate is brought up. The company has spent the last five-plus years since the scandal broke trying to distance itself from its deceptive and harmful actions, and at many points, has tried to pin it on individual actors. (The former CEO of its American division once testified &lt;em&gt;to Congress&lt;/em&gt; in 2015 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/8/9481651/volkswagen-congressional-hearing-diesel-scandal-fault"&gt;that it was the work of&lt;/a&gt; “a couple software engineers who [did it] for whatever reasons.” He &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/9/11188348/volkswagen-usa-ceo-michael-horn-resigns"&gt;resigned five months later&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3D15DU"&gt;At the very least, Volkswagen is now the biggest legacy automaker making the most concerted push into electric vehicles, and it recently &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-strategy/vw-boosts-investment-in-electric-and-autonomous-car-technology-to-86-billon-idUSKBN27T24O"&gt;increased its investment in the space to $86 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nerf is hiring a chief TikTok officer, and my inner teen is drooling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LwqMsUagAJIqx-zljI6K3jANIpU=/0x0:1922x1281/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69032119/nerf_cto_tiktok.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gb1ttp"&gt;As a ‘90s kid, I used to dream of winning the &lt;a href="https://supermarketsweep.fandom.com/wiki/Nickelodeon_Super_Toy_Run"&gt;Nickelodeon Super Toy Run&lt;/a&gt; — five minutes to fill a Toys R Us shopping cart with anything I liked. I had my route all planned out: stacks of video games, a few choice Lego sets, and then a fill-up at the Nerf aisle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0zi6k"&gt;The world is very different right now, of course, but Nerf may have just announced a modern, grown-up version of the dream: it’s hiring a chief TikTok officer to dream up the company’s marketing for three months, giving one lucky influencer $30,000 and “a massive amount of Nerf products” in exchange for helping Hasbro figure out how to entice Gen Z. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cpyf8i"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B72-s3WKft8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c6ytkm"&gt;Oh yeah, this is &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; a marketing stunt. But it’s also &lt;a href="https://career4.successfactors.com/sfcareer/jobreqcareerpvt?jobId=41110&amp;amp;company=Hasbro&amp;amp;st=24C251E32CBD5E8C43873FDD4671FA248DCF11E0"&gt;a real job on the company’s real career site&lt;/a&gt;, and you’ll have to submit a real job application and interview for the role if Hasbro likes what you’ve got. You’ll be expected to create 10–12 TikTok videos per month, meet weekly with Nerf’s marketing team, and — sadly — be 18 or older to get hired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tj3W9l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The engineers building ridiculous dart blasters that Nerf won’t touch","url":"https://t.co/wTkR20p6e9?amp=1"},{"title":"Fry’s Electronics is shutting its doors for good","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/24/22298616/frys-electronics-going-out-of-business"},{"title":"Nerf reveals Hyper, its next-gen high capacity blasters with the fastest reloads ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22299490/nerf-hyper-announcement-first-blasters-rush-siege-mach"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Flr5Ai"&gt;It’s also completely remote, so you’ll be interfacing through Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or what have you instead of getting a tour of the Nerf labs or archives. Not as fun as could be! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w19hvT"&gt;But still, pretty fun. Here’s hoping this goes to a new face, not an established influencer! If you’re chosen, we’d &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to hear what it was like afterward. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258"&gt;My DMs are open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>H&amp;M and other Western brands gone from Apple Maps and other apps in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CHINA-ECONOMY-POLITICS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsXUfMrPeIxm-BQGV1upW_8G1LM=/6x0:6042x4024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69031683/1231944072.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eH7Nbo"&gt;Locations for H&amp;amp;M clothing stores in China were not showing up on Apple Maps searches in China on Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/h-m-is-erased-from-chinese-e-commerce-over-xinjiang-stance-11616695377?st=j58swhl0vn8ankj&amp;amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, amid growing anger among Chinese consumers at the company’s decision to stop sourcing from the Xinjiang region. The company has more than 400 stores in China, but all H&amp;amp;M locations are now missing from maps, ride-hailing, and e-commerce applications, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; found. Apple relies on Chinese mapping company &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-CJB-16541"&gt;AutoNavi for its Apple Maps in China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1zxjE"&gt;It was the latest of several Western brands, which also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/25/business/hm-nike-xinjiang-cotton-boycott-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;includes Nike and Adidas&lt;/a&gt;, that are facing calls for boycotts in China. The US &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/citing-uighur-mistreatment-u-s-restricts-imports-china-s-xinjiang-n1240039"&gt;announced last year&lt;/a&gt; it would stop imports of cotton and other goods from Xinjiang, over allegations the Chinese government uses forced labor in its production. Earlier this week, the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/biden-admin-announces-sanctions-against-chinese-officials-over-human-rights-n1261745"&gt;Biden administration announced&lt;/a&gt; it was imposing sanctions against two Chinese officials over what it says are ongoing human rights abuses against China’s Uyghur Muslim population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jhuk49"&gt;In response, the Chinese government and state-run media have urged boycotts of Western brands. On Wednesday, The Communist Party’s Youth League in China pointed to H&amp;amp;M’s &lt;a href="https://hmgroup.com/sustainability/fair-and-equal/human-rights/h-m-group-statement-on-due-diligence-/"&gt;statement from last year&lt;/a&gt;, in which the company said it was “deeply concerned by reports from civil society organizations and media that include accusations of forced labor and discrimination of ethnoreligious minorities in Xinjiang.” H&amp;amp;M said it would not source cotton from the Xinjiang region as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyGhiT"&gt;In a statement &lt;a href="https://share.api.weibo.cn/share/211447276.html?weibo_id=4618372530047437"&gt;posted to its Weibo page&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, H&amp;amp;M China said the company did not “represent any political position” and that the company “continues to respect the Chinese consumer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FXNxT"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported that searches for H&amp;amp;M in Apple Maps on an iPhone, or China-based Baidu Maps, did not return any results, while other retailers appeared as normal. H&amp;amp;M was removed from the Alibaba e-commerce platform this week, according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgJAcX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 26th 1:45PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds detail about Apple Maps in China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Suicide Squad’s first trailer steals all the color from the Snyder Cut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ldtm1mDpsyoVIoUx2A5JVVI3HBs=/203x0:1714x1007/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69031527/Screen_Shot_2021_03_26_at_9.40.35_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warner Bros.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QERtK2"&gt;Warner Bros. has released &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Z1EbSXxrZ34"&gt;the first trailer&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;, the sequel to 2016’s &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt; (no The). Unlike the extremely grimdark &lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League&lt;/em&gt; (and the potentially even more grimdark black-and-white version of the film, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22351394/zack-snyder-justice-league-black-and-white-hbo-max"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League: Justice is Gray&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;em&gt; The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt; looks to be filled with color and humor, at least based on this first trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yeIUt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Z1EbSXxrZ34"&gt;Here’s the trailer&lt;/a&gt;, which you may have to watch on YouTube because it is age-restricted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9xF5yQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z1EbSXxrZ34?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6EBcTA"&gt;I’m getting some serious &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; vibes from &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;’s trailer — which makes sense, given that both movies are directed by James Gunn. I love the first &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; movie, so I’m hoping Gunn brings some of the humor and heart from that film to &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrRCdv"&gt;The movie features a huge cast, including Margot Robbie reprising her role as Harley Quinn, Idris Elba as Bloodsport, and John Cena as Peacemaker. Sylvester Stallone &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/1375485609460965376"&gt;also stars as King Shark&lt;/a&gt;, a giant, walking, talking shark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjTsGX"&gt;The movie hits theaters and HBO Max on August 6th.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ivqFA7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 26th, 2021 2:52PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Best Buy has sold all of its PS5 stock for the day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrDumG"&gt;Best Buy has another round of restocks for Sony’s next-generation console, the PS5. You can buy both the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736009393525459812#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a disc drive right now, while supplies last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmwcSE"&gt;Due to the high demand for these gadgets, Best Buy is curbing the demand by releasing small waves of stock every few minutes. If you don’t see it in stock immediately, it’s smart to check back every few minutes to see if more show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9jxWc9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="igu8hA"&gt;Once your new console is secured, you might want to start looking into which games you want to add to your collection. The PS5 is home to some of the most popular titles right now, such as &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0001-PPSA01487_00-ORWFULLGAME00000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs Legion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736000564545537000#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The console also has some highly anticipated titles arriving for the system in the next few months, such as &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736000586852610719#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736000532729976668#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q9bLmP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568461"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yurQ39"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A subscription to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt; is a good purchase. But you’re not just paying to play most games (excluding free-to-play titles) online, as PS5 users with an active PS Plus subscription also have access to a digital library called the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, which features various first- and third-party titles released during the PS4’s life span. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sPmYRp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J4iHcU"&gt;If you want a TV that will take full advantage of your new hardware, there are a few TV options available. Including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736001367696964763#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TCL’s new 6-series line of TVs&lt;/a&gt;. These 4K TVs support 120Hz gaming thanks to their HDMI 2.1 ports. &lt;/p&gt;
