    <title>Nissan follows GM in ditching Trump’s effort to overturn California’s pollution rules</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lJa2Xy"&gt;President Donald Trump’s effort to overturn California’s ability to set fuel efficiency rules just lost another automaker. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-emissions-trump/nissan-joins-gm-in-exiting-auto-group-backing-trump-idUSL1N2IK2E3"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Nissan said it was joining General Motors in abandoning the group of car companies that were previously supporting Trump’s fight with California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2udgXj"&gt;On November 23rd, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611607/gm-trump-california-car-emission-pollution-biden-fuel-efficiency-standards"&gt;GM announced it would leave the group&lt;/a&gt; of automakers that included Nissan, Fiat Chrysler, and several others, that were supporting Trump’s legal efforts to overturn pollution-fighting powers. Under the Clean Air Act, the state has historically been allowed to set its own emissions standards. And as the largest auto market in the US and one of the biggest in the world, California has a lot of influence over the auto industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HvBa8b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;California has a lot of influence over the auto industry&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5FDgRX"&gt;Nissan, which along with its coalition partners Renault and Mitsubishi, is one of the largest automakers in the world. Notably, neither Nissan nor GM have said whether they would join an opposing group of automakers that includes Ford, BMW, Honda, and Volkswagen, which have agreed to abide by California’s fuel efficiency standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVfHdA"&gt;The pro-California group of car companies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20727261/trump-emissions-rollback-ford-volkswagon-honda-bmw-california-deal"&gt;which first announced their intentions in July 2019&lt;/a&gt;, struck a deal with the state that roughly matches the cleaner car plan put in place by the Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency — a plan that the Trump administration has been working feverishly to undo since the president took office in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBbdyl"&gt;President-elect Joe Biden has stated his support for the Obama-era rules (and by extension, California’s standards) and has vowed to push for the rapid adoption of zero-emission vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Warner Bros. had to move its 2021 films to HBO Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lpgAoCfoCI0dhcriLTe8-x69k1I=/182x0:3394x2141/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68459418/dune_image.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JCehZF"&gt;WarnerMedia is making a clear bet for 2021: its slate of movies won’t generate the revenue its studio division needs, but it can help boost HBO Max’s long-term success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usALiO"&gt;The company announced yesterday that every one of its 2021 movies will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;debut on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; in the United States at the same time they play in theaters. They’ll be available for one month, at no extra charge, and available to stream in 4K HDR. It feels like an inevitable shift; COVID-19 cases &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/02/world/covid-19-coronavirus"&gt;are surging&lt;/a&gt; around the world again, new content on streaming services is drying up, and WarnerMedia needs to figure out a way to keep revenue coming in. Looking at a year where cinemas might not open beyond 25 percent capacity in the United States and where people may not want to sit in a room full of strangers until a vaccine is released, it makes a lot of sense that Warner Bros. is using the opportunity to see how a simultaneous release could benefit HBO Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHrto7"&gt;It’s still not a great answer for anyone involved. It’s a loss for Warner Bros., it’s a loss for AT&amp;amp;T (which owns WarnerMedia), and it’s a loss for theaters. Warner Bros. is not going to make the revenue per-film it may have through theatrical release in a pre-COVID era. AT&amp;amp;T may lose $1.2 billion, according to analytical firm MoffettNathanson, at a time when the company is saddled with &lt;a href="https://www.slashgear.com/atts-price-increases-the-result-of-billion-dollar-merger-debt-03564479/"&gt;$160 billion of debt&lt;/a&gt; that it’s trying to quickly reduce and its pay-TV business &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/pay-tv-fears-bigger-subscriber-losses-virus-crisis-1288159"&gt;is crumbling&lt;/a&gt;. Theater chains need big blockbuster and tentpole &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514822/amc-theaters-cash-movies-delays-closing-pandemic-debt-regal"&gt;films to bring people in&lt;/a&gt;, but now many of those movies are available for people at home — where’s the incentive to go out when a virus is raging? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WrDqkF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s still not a great answer for anyone involved&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HCBTKd"&gt;But the shift to HBO Max is a bet on long-term growth in streaming offsetting the immediate loss from theatrical and other revenue streams. It’s part of a long-term play at making streaming a primary business for WarnerMedia that’s been accelerated by the effects of the pandemic. This does come with some downfalls that are impossible to ignore: In 2019, Warner Bros. was the top earner for WarnerMedia, bringing in $14.4 billion — just under 50 percent of all revenues within the division. Some of it was from the box office, but a lot of it came from home video purchases and syndication. Since HBO Max is paying Warner Bros. for the rights to the films, it’s not additional revenue but shifting catalogs between one WarnerMedia property to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwrBPa"&gt;WarnerMedia has been having problems growing its streaming service as fast as competitors like Disney. Part of that is that HBO Max is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324139/peacock-roku-amazon-fire-tv-hbo-max-streaming-warnermedia-nbcuniversal-disney-apple"&gt;not available on Roku&lt;/a&gt; (something the team is working on), but part of it is a lack of event-type films to bring people in. By moving titles to HBO Max at the same time they’re in theaters, WarnerMedia gives current subscribers a reason to stay, and it’s hoping large swaths of new customers will sign up and keep paying $15 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lc8APG"&gt;“We’re going to have some really good content here that’s spoiling and can be used for other purposes,” AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey said in an interview &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/12/att-john-stankey-warner-bros-hbo-max-streaming-windows-1234650649/"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPJWNe"&gt;Disney saw similar success with &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;, a movie that brought in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318731/disney-hamilton-streaming-numbers-parks-world-reopening-bob-chapek-meeting"&gt;large number of Disney Plus subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, and the number of people canceling their subscriptions remained relatively low even months after. If WarnerMedia can recreate that success — signing up millions of people every month with a big title, without seeing them later unsubscribe — could the long-term recurring revenue offset initial losses and put HBO Max in a truly competitive spot with other streaming platforms? That seems to be part of the bet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToTBfg"&gt;2021 is going to be a rough year for studios regardless of the pandemic. There are currently 55 major features scheduled to open in 2021. Between May 28th and July 16th — a period of seven weeks that features big releases from every major studio — there are several blockbusters competing for people’s attention and money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="731mse"&gt;Warner Bros.’ &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong &lt;/em&gt;will take on Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;in early May, and then there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21176895/fast-and-furious-f9-delay-universal-coronavirus-vin-diesel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; In the Heights&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Venom: Let There be Carnage&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21437889/black-widow-delayed-release-date-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-streaming-mulan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528606/tom-holland-nathan-drake-first-photo-uncharted-movie-sony"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to name a few more. Warner Bros. has 17 movies in 2021 — not all of those were going to be $800 million to $1 billion successes. Some may have actually lost money. This helps build a streaming business, even if it means sacrificing a few that may have done very well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lMgx1y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;2021 is going to be a rough year for studios regardless of the pandemic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HRKxPt"&gt;As 2021 currently stands, most movies are going to lose out because the competition is too big in a tight space. Plus, theaters may still be operating at far less capacity (&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/movie-theater-chains-limiting-salescoronavirus-1203534095/"&gt;as recommended by the CDC&lt;/a&gt;) in COVID-19 times, locations could remain closed in prime markets like New York City and Los Angeles, and people still might not feel comfortable returning to theaters. Add in that attendance was dwindling before the pandemic: in 2019, movie theater attendance per capita was at a century low, the number of young people going to theaters throughout the year is declining (despite this being the bracket that consumes the most content), and more than half of “frequent” moviegoers have stopped going as much, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ballmatthew/status/1334906762030444544"&gt;analyst Matthew Ball&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoB6Ld"&gt;WarnerMedia and AT&amp;amp;T were likely planning for losses regardless of skipping theaters, but it seems like they’re trying to reposition some of that loss into potential impactful growth for HBO Max. Christopher Nolan’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/20/21330990/christopher-nolan-tenet-warner-bros-online-release-streaming-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; showed&lt;/a&gt; that there’s room for studios to take different approaches internationally and in the US. Internationally, where more theaters were open and coronavirus cases weren’t as large, the movie performed well, &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1442940417/weekend/"&gt;generating $300.4 million&lt;/a&gt;, but in the United States the film only amassed $57 million. Growing HBO Max in the United States and exploring more traditional revenue options internationally is a combination executives seem willing to take a bet on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJ9zwd"&gt;No one really knows if this is going to work. Shareholders don’t, executives don’t, industry insiders don’t — but people know &lt;em&gt;something &lt;/em&gt;has to happen. WarnerMedia isn’t in a position to hope for the best with its movies while also trying to figure out how to grow HBO Max. The simplest thing to do — not the easiest, and not necessarily the most immediately beneficial — is to take a year of likely losses theatrically and use it to scale HBO Max as quickly as possible in 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31Q5P3"&gt;Don’t be surprised when Disney announces it’s doing something similar next week. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome OS 87 adds tab search and Bluetooth device battery levels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XSyh4Gp5-A_DOZHumUroFm37Hg0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68459084/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kFp7dl"&gt;Chrome OS 87 is &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/thread/86837545?hl=en"&gt;rolling out now&lt;/a&gt;, and it adds a few nice features to help you while browsing the web and when using Bluetooth accessories (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/04/chrome-os-87/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrW2LZ"&gt;One new addition in Chrome OS 87 is tab search. I typically have dozens of tabs open at any given time, so I could see how tab search might be a really handy way to find something I’ve lost in the process. Google is also adding tab search to the desktop version of Chrome, though the company said &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/faster-chrome/"&gt;in mid-November&lt;/a&gt; that the feature would be coming first to Chromebooks and to other desktop platforms “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/owkKL_SidDuZmsFxcVkCuw47EFM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22145633/USE_Chrome_TabSearch_Still.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what tab search looks like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B1gFrF"&gt;Chrome OS 87 can also now show you the battery levels of Bluetooth devices that you have connected to your computer (such as wireless headphones) in the Settings and Quick Settings menus. I often use a similar feature on my Mac to know when I might need to charge up my AirPods, so I think this could be really useful on Chrome OS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mJqF4"&gt;Google has also added 36 new wallpapers from four different artists to Chrome OS 87.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon to face federal lawsuit over firing of warehouse worker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-LABOUR-PROTEST-AMAZON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/akZX3RIhcGYwsh7QepoPKTZVu1Q=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68458945/1073347704.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;KEREM YUCEL/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RyuTbi"&gt;Amazon’s decision to fire warehouse worker Courtney Bowden violated labor laws, according to charges filed by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) last month &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-worker-retaliation-coronavirus"&gt;and obtained by &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Bowden was advocating for better working when the company abruptly let her go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdSKf8"&gt;Bowden was one of many workers fighting for paid time off at Amazon warehouses as the coronavirus pandemic intensified. While the company said it was rolling out increased safety measures, workers continued to get sick and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dm8bx/leaked-amazon-memo-details-plan-to-smear-fired-warehouse-organizer-hes-not-smart-or-articulate"&gt;executives became increasingly hostile to employee organizing efforts &lt;/a&gt;. In March, Bowden was fired over an alleged incident with her supervisor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zii6l"&gt;Bowden’s termination came at a time of unprecedented demand for Amazon services. Throughout the spring, the company struggled to keep up with rising orders, even as coronavirus outbreaks swept across its own warehouses. Chris Smalls, a warehouse worker on Staten Island, organized a major walkout to protest the lack of personal protective equipment for employees. Amazon fired Smalls &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dm8bx/leaked-amazon-memo-details-plan-to-smear-fired-warehouse-organizer-hes-not-smart-or-articulate"&gt;and coordinated a campaign to label him as “not smart or articulate”&lt;/a&gt; in the press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="173Woa"&gt;In May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259474/amazon-warehouse-worker-death-indiana"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported that seven warehouse workers had died from COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XWQeH"&gt;Bowden argued that Amazon terminated her because she’d been speaking to co-workers about “pay and other workplace issues,” &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;reports. The NLRB found the allegations credible enough to pursue charges, alleging that Amazon “has been interfering with, restraining, and coercing employees” as they exercised their protected rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJHmFQ"&gt;If Amazon loses the case, it could have to pay Bowden back wages for the period since she was fired. But Bowden said her goal is more than just financial. She told &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; she wants “coworkers to see that speaking up about bad working conditions and work benefits is not wrong, and to not be fearful for speaking up for what’s right, because they have a right by law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X4SiBJ"&gt;Bowden’s complaint is one of many legal actions currently being brought against the tech giant. In November, a judge dismissed a lawsuit from four former workers at a distribution center in New York. It argued the company had created unsafe working conditions during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcGQwh"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Multidose COVID-19 vaccines will test state tracking systems  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Trial Underway in DeLand, Florida" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OS4LP4ySFZP6VAi7JUTxAy2FfEo=/47x0:4153x2737/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68458545/1227915938.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kG5Rbh"&gt;When the COVID-19 vaccine becomes available in the United States, officials’ first challenge is getting the people in the door for their shots. Then, they’ll have a second problem: making sure they come back again to get a second dose of the same vaccine. With two two-dose vaccines headed for authorization, the logistical challenges of a vaccination program are only magnified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eF5Nme"&gt;“You don’t want to have someone get the first dose of one brand of vaccine, and a second dose of another,” says Ben Moscovitch, project director of health information technology at The Pew Charitable Trusts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMNwZe"&gt;Assuming the Food and Drug Administration authorizes the vaccines after they review the data later this month, states will &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/01/health/first-pfizer-vaccine-shipments/index.html"&gt;start to receive&lt;/a&gt; shipments of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine on December 15th, and the Moderna vaccine on December 22nd. From there, it’s up to states to distribute the vaccines. Both take two doses, given a few weeks apart, and both could be circulating at the same time. And that’s just the two front-runners. Other multidose vaccines are still in the development pipeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RanOtZ"&gt;There are a few ways states, doctors, and patients could keep the dosages straight, says Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers. In the simplest solution, everyone who gets a COVID-19 vaccine will also get a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/02/health/covid-19-vaccination-kit-record-card/index.html?utm_source=twCNN&amp;amp;utm_term=image&amp;amp;utm_content=2020-12-03T13%3A47%3A58&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;card&lt;/a&gt; that tells them which vaccine they had and when their next dose should be. But that’s the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benmoscovitch/status/1334623827347845127"&gt;last line of defense&lt;/a&gt; in a complex vaccine tracking system. “As the backup to the backup to the backup, they’ll hand out cards,” Hannan says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVTjYl"&gt;Ideally, the cards won’t be necessary because patients and doctors will be able to rely on electronic records and digital registry systems to keep track of who got which vaccine and when they got it. Through the pandemic, states have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/upshot/coronavirus-response-fax-machines.html"&gt;struggled&lt;/a&gt; with digital systems for other key areas, like COVID-19 testing — sometimes relying on fax machines and incomplete, handwritten forms to send information from testing sites to local health departments. But Hannan says the US immunization data collection systems at the state level are prepared to manage the expected crush of information from an unprecedented mass vaccination campaign like the one the country is about to start. Most tools were in place even before the pandemic hit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="OhUV1a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are not at a point where all of our state systems are connected, but we’re also not at a point where we’re using paper.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="No3wIl"&gt;“We are not at a point where all of our state systems are connected, but we’re also not at a point where we’re using paper,” Hannan says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZyTn6"&gt;When someone gets their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, the information could be collected in a few different ways. Some places might use specialized vaccination clinic software in the early stages: a hospital might use a program that sends a link out to eligible employees who could register for a vaccination appointment, and then it sends them a reminder when they’re supposed to come in for their second dose. Other health systems, particularly if they’re administering shots in-house, might use their patient electronic health records for the same function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbsY5P"&gt;Big health systems with robust electronic health record management will likely have an easier time with this process than smaller clinics, says Howard Forman, a professor of public health, management, and economics at Yale University. “They’re used to keeping track of whether patients have had their followup appointments,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eb4Z1i"&gt;The health systems and clinics will then need to report their vaccine data back to the state. Each state has its own Immunization Information System (IIS), a centralized registry that keeps track of every vaccine each person vaccinated in that state has received. Vaccination clinic software and electronic health records systems feed into those registries, which help doctors keep track of the vaccination records for individual patients, and also give each state big-picture data on vaccination rates in individual communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEyrmq"&gt;A state-level IIS can also notify doctors and patients when people are due for a second dose of a vaccine. They already use them to keep track of doses for the meningitis B vaccine, Hannan says. “That requires multiple doses, and there’s two different brands, and they’re not interchangeable,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xae7xK"&gt;Beyond just tracking doses for individual patients, digital registries are a way for states — and the federal government — to see how many people have been vaccinated and if any groups or areas are lagging behind on vaccine coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5mlQM"&gt;Management of vaccine dosage information will vary state by state, and jurisdiction by jurisdiction, Moscovitch says. Some are likely more prepared than others, and not every place will have the same amount of experience using these systems to track vaccinations. There may be some areas where vaccine registries are regularly used for children, but not used as frequently for adults. “That can be a challenge with COVID-19, where we want to be collecting information on adult immunization,” he says. &lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/we-can-t-defeat-covid-19-without-vaccinating-children-there-arent-even-any-kids-clinical-trials-yet"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt; have only just started to be included in COVID-19 vaccine trials, so the early waves of vaccinations will be for adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ef3SmM"&gt;The systems in place to track vaccinations today are much more advanced than they were in 2009, when the country &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/we-need-a-covid-19-vaccine-lets-get-it-right-the-first-time/"&gt;struggled&lt;/a&gt; to distribute and track the H1N1 flu vaccine (which was only one shot), and electronic health records were rare. Only some states used their IIS programs. Many states had to rely on SurveyMonkey to connect with health care providers about vaccine delivery, for example, Hannan says. That’s not likely to happen this time because of the systems developed in the past decade, but making sure they work like they’re supposed to is a resource-intensive challenge. “We’ve come a long way, but it’s a double-edged sword,” she says. “The disadvantage to that is it’s more complex and more costly, and it takes longer to set up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ST4Mj6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’ve come a long way, but it’s a double-edged sword.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3Lfp5n"&gt;For example, all the electronic systems, from the state level down, are able to work together more effectively if they all use standard ways of collecting patient information. Any place giving vaccines — doctors’ offices, pharmacies, pop-up centers — should collect the same data from patients, and in the same way, Moscovitch says. That way, it’s easy to match up the records if someone needs to go somewhere else for their second shot. But no standard for that data currently exists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LroipU"&gt;Moscovitch and Pew Charitable Trusts are &lt;a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2020/12/01/federal-effort-aims-to-standardize-addresses-to-improve-patient-matching"&gt;pushing the federal government&lt;/a&gt; to adopt better standards that would help match a patient with their vaccine records. There are still open questions about how well this might work with the COVID-19 vaccine, Moscovitch says. “There’s a lack of clarity. Given that a vaccine is hopefully right around the corner, these issues need to be adjudicated and publicly released, so that we can get patient matching right,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The artisanal Crocs have landed</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Crocs are cool now, and artists are accessorizing them all over Instagram &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Z2AlUI"&gt;Lots of objects look good stuffed into a pair of Crocs. Strange things you wouldn’t expect, like mini plastic bowls of ramen, beaded butterflies, or, like in Jillian Maddocks’ case, a pile of pistachio green foam with a cherry on top. Maddocks started selling her take on Jibbitz, a Crocs-specific word for charms that stick into the shoes’ holes for decoration, as part of her 323 apparel line. She repurposed materials she already had lying around — foam she uses to make headbands, fake cherries, and seashells — and ended up designing charms that make the Crocs look like a wearable sundae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQXVjg"&gt;“I’ve sold more [Jibbitz] than I sold everything else this year, which is really weird and funny and exciting,” Maddocks says. She guesses she sold around 100 total pairs in the three months they were live in her shop before she stopped taking preorders to perfect the design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpSdP9"&gt;A number of artists added Jibbitz to their inventory this year, thanks mostly to the interest Instagram drives in them. The #Jibbitz tag on Instagram has more than 105,000 posts where creators show off the ways in which they’ve made the shoes their own, from &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CIBuY2qM2_m/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; customizations&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CIVxRMjgcOD/"&gt;fully stuffed shoes with chains on top&lt;/a&gt;. Some creators design their Jibbitz from scratch, while others want to show off their decked-out shoes with pre-made accessories or how they put together a variety of trinkets and Jibbitz to create a wholly new Croc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="RxqJyJ"&gt;Pandemic leisurewear is in this year, and Crocs are becoming the shoe of the moment. &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/style/bad-bunny-crocs.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; sales of Crocs were up 48 percent in September this year, compared to 2019, and Crocs says its revenue reached new records in the third quarter. &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/crocs-are-grails-sorry"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GQ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/strategist/article/strawberry-crocs-review.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deemed the shoes stylish and cool, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crocs.com%2Fcollaborations%2Fjustin-bieber.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22152676%2Fcrocs-jibbitz-charms-instagram-susan-alexandra-323#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Justin Bieber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crocs.com%2Fbad-bunny.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22152676%2Fcrocs-jibbitz-charms-instagram-susan-alexandra-323#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bad Bunny&lt;/a&gt;, and Instagram-centric creators like &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CG2enKvFlVZ/"&gt;Nicole McLaughlin&lt;/a&gt; released their own limited edition collaborations with the brand. Crocs are even for sale on Grailed, the reselling platform, for upwards of $100. The clogs might actually be coveted in 2020, mainly pushed through Instagram posts of cool people wearing them and teasing those exclusive celebrity shoe drops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYpiSq"&gt;It’s the Jibbitz accessories, though, that make the shoes pop, and Crocs says revenue from selling the charms &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/133460125/files/doc_financials/quarterly_results/2020/q3/2020-09-Q3-Investor-Presentation_vF.pdf"&gt;doubled&lt;/a&gt; last quarter. Crocs, the corporation, sees Jibbitz as an easy upsell. “The reason we love Jibbitz, besides they’re high margin, is they really can create really good consumer engagement and they sell clogs,” said CFO Anne Mehlman in an earnings call. “It’s our unique way to really do personalization in a way that resonates with the consumer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fG5jF"&gt;All of the limited edition collaborations feature unique Jibbitz, like a flashlight and rope on McLaughlin’s and glow-in-the-dark charms on Bad Bunny’s. Crocs continues to introduce new Jibbitz to its arsenal, too, including some that promote the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/crocs/status/1283431497500852225?lang=en"&gt;Black Lives Matter movement&lt;/a&gt;. People still seek out third-party creations, though, to find Jibbitz that really fit their interests or to support designers they enjoy. For the creators who sell Jibbitz on their own, the charms are a more affordable way to show off their designs, especially when everyone wants to be at home and comfy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgKgPO"&gt;“A lot of the people who shop with me can’t really afford an $800 pair of shoes, but they can afford something that’s a $40 set per shoe that they can put on that makes what they’re wearing feel really expensive and special,” Maddocks says. “I feel like that’s part of why they’re doing really well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lC1miS"&gt;Carley Holtsinger, who designs under the brand &lt;a href="https://sparkledivatopia.com/"&gt;Sparkle Diva&lt;/a&gt;, received her first pair of Crocs for her birthday this year and got hooked. She couldn’t stop wearing them, although they were a bit bland for her taste, so she whipped up her beaded, stringy pom-pom Jibbitz. They sit atop the shoe and result in something like a disco ball effect or like seeing dangly earrings on someone, drawing your eye to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFafc0"&gt;“I was like, ‘Oh my god I need to throw in some Sparkle Diva homemade Jibbitz, so it just kind of went from there,” she says. “I get so many compliments from all walks of life in them, especially because people can hear me walking up and they’ll turn around and look at my shoes and they’re like, ‘Oh my god, I love those.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRSmYR"&gt;Holtsinger says her charms haven’t been a massive hit, although her Instagram post showing them off is one of her most popular. She considers her Jibbitz a niche product, really only for people who are willing to make noise with beaded pom-poms and draw even more attention to their Crocs. (Crocs doesn’t seem to mind creators using the word Jibbitz to promote their products, but the company didn’t respond to a request for comment about this.)&lt;/p&gt;

(@cozycreationss)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eg6i2u"&gt;“I have a few orders, and I’ve definitely had several friends reach out to me and be like, ‘Oh my god, I just bought my first pair of Crocs I’m obsessed,’ so I feel like they’re not my most popular product, but it’s definitely piqued some interest, and I think it’s a fun novelty thing to make for me,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOUL72"&gt;Meanwhile, Susan Korn, a designer most well-known for her beaded bags under the name Susan Alexandra, posted an image on Instagram of her “shoe tzotchkes,” featuring glued-on beaded butterflies and other oddities she found around her studio, and people seemingly loved it. “I don’t believe in soulmates but I think these are mine,” one person commented. Korn says Crocs reached out almost immediately to discuss a possible collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eA47lv"&gt;“The plan is to … create jewelry for the shoes and then elevate this very casual, utilitarian shoe into something that’s almost like high fashion, and really sparkly and fancy and pretty,” she says. “They’re objectively ugly shoes, they’re shapeless, have holes in them, etc., so it’s taking something that’s like a potato and shining it up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpBT2l"&gt;These designers, who focus on creating handmade charms to go in the shoes, join a legion of creators on both Instagram and Etsy who sell fully formed Crocs with pre-made plastic charms that more align with the bubbly style Crocs created. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUYpp5"&gt;Jadyn Taylor, a 17-year-old in Georgia, has gained over 12,000 followers on Instagram since June, under the name Cozy Creationz, selling assembled Crocs. She orders the shoes from China, charms from various places online, rhinestones from Amazon, and puts it all together to make the shoes sparkle. People order her Crocs so that instead of receiving a boring pair and having to individually customize their shoes, they’ll receive some that are ready to be shown off. Taylor says she’s sold 200 orders so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ISV6di"&gt;The pandemic no doubt helped propel Crocs to newer, cooler heights. But when it wanes, will people still want to wear a pair of “objectively ugly” shoes? Maybe if there’s art attached.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is selling ugly Windows sweaters, and part of the proceeds benefit Girls Who Code</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iXBf_tiejg4ACw5v-RxX4f6-SFU=/0x0:711x474/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68174378/Screen_Shot_2020_12_01_at_11.02.18_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IL7mnS"&gt;Microsoft is getting into the holiday spirit a bit early by offering MS Paint and Windows-themed “ugly” sweaters &lt;a href="https://gear.xbox.com/pages/windows?ocid=Evergreen_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Photo_buy_HolidaySweater"&gt;for sale on its online store&lt;/a&gt;, with a portion of the proceeds from each sale donated to Girls Who Code. The company made Windows XP and 95 sweaters in the past to give to influencers and super fans, but this marks the first time the company is selling a sweater directly to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hTxcZ"&gt;When the sweaters first went on sale on Tuesday, there were briefly three varieties of Microsoft “soft-wear” available for purchase: the previously mentioned MS Paint sweater and leftover stock of the Windows 95 and XP sweaters. When we first checked the store, those XP and 95 sweaters were already running low on stock, and they quickly sold out with only this year’s MS Paint sweater available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y94bdJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9813113"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IsJ8oS"&gt;On Friday, December 4th, Microsoft restocked its older &lt;a href="https://gear.xbox.com/products/windows-95-ugly-sweater"&gt;Windows 95&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gear.xbox.com/products/windows-xp-ugly-sweater"&gt;Windows XP&lt;/a&gt; sweaters, but keep in mind this new run won’t ship until after December 25th. The offer is exciting all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZpMTv"&gt;Microsoft has had fun in the past with these promotions, even packaging the older Windows XP sweater inside a Windows XP-style box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hgpeS7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft’s ugly Christmas sweater is Windows XP this year. It even comes in a softwear box   &lt;a href="https://t.co/Oz0lNhryPI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Oz0lNhryPI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1204782275755495428?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 11, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id="WZzdaa"&gt;Since MS Paint comes installed on Windows rather than being sold separately, it’s hard to know how this year’s sweater will come packaged, but here’s hoping Microsoft’s goofy trend continues. Clearly, the company has some sweater fans among its ranks. Maybe it’s a latent bit of Bill Gates’ influence?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bill Gates" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I-n6t41Jbdu6ggaW38MfK5rW4qI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/921440/billgatestock.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bill Gates wearing a sweater, as he often does.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0UlS8l"&gt;Whatever the source, the sweaters are now all in stock for $69.99 each, with $20 of each sale going directly to Girls Who Code through December 23rd. Microsoft says it plans to donate a minimum of $50,000 to the nonprofit from this promotion. Girls Who Code is a nonprofit dedicated to getting more women into the computer science field by offering classes and educational resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAEZY2"&gt;The relative ugliness of these sweaters is up for debate (personally, I think the MS Paint sweater looks pretty good), but if you’re nostalgic for the Windows of old, you can deck yourself out in time for a virtual ugly sweater party. Keeping on theme, Microsoft is also providing &lt;a href="https://gear.xbox.com/pages/ms-paint-accessories"&gt;Windows and MS Paint backgrounds&lt;/a&gt; for Skype and Teams, if you want to look like you’re trapped in a drawing you made on your parent’s computer while video chatting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sn9pVk"&gt;You can purchase the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fgear.xbox.com%2Fproducts%2Fms-paint-ugly-sweater%3Fvariant%3D37154383233189" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MS Paint sweater&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://gear.xbox.com/products/windows-xp-ugly-sweater"&gt;Windows XP sweater&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://gear.xbox.com/products/windows-xp-ugly-sweater"&gt;Windows 95 sweater&lt;/a&gt; now to benefit a good cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2xfWh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 4th, 1:21PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added information about the sweater restock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7PikT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HpDO1B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1ITX0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6pTV4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5Hbop"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Metal Gear Solid movie to star Oscar Isaac as Solid Snake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="92nd Annual Academy Awards - Backstage" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KeykHUji2t9HJg9bpXcQWWo7nOw=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68457610/1205168026.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZzuggX"&gt;Sony’s upcoming &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid&lt;/em&gt; movie adaptation will star Oscar Isaac as protagonist Solid Snake, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/12/oscar-isaac-solid-snake-sonys-metal-gear-solid-movie-1234650259/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You might be familiar with Isaac as Resistance fighter Poe Dameron in the latest &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; film trilogy and his upcoming role as Duke Leto Atreides in &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, and I think he could be a great fit to play Solid Snake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBN7D8"&gt;Apparently Isaac did, too, as he cast himself for the role &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LordBalvin/status/1334909389011083265?s=20"&gt;in this interview&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C9mKAU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;MARCH 2019.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OSCAR ISAAC CAST HIMSELF AS SOLID SNAKE. &lt;a href="https://t.co/bFbZ9K2TLf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bFbZ9K2TLf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Big Boss (@LordBalvin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LordBalvin/status/1334909389011083265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1pP7t9"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid&lt;/em&gt; movie, which is still in development, will be directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts. But like some other movie adaptations of video games, this one has been in development for years — &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid&lt;/em&gt; creator Hideo Kojima first revealed that a movie was in the works &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-06-live-action-metal-gear-solid-movie-confirmed/1100-6150282/"&gt;all the way back in 2006&lt;/a&gt;. A start date for production is still unknown, according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;, so it doesn’t seem like we should expect the movie anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJ57D1"&gt;Hopefully Isaac’s casting for the leading role in could indicate that the movie might really happen. The &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; movie, which has also been in the works for over a decade, appears to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528606/tom-holland-nathan-drake-first-photo-uncharted-movie-sony"&gt;actually had scenes filmed&lt;/a&gt;, so perhaps that’s a good omen for the &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid&lt;/em&gt; movie, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0jJc1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PAX still plans to host its in-person game festivals in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x2yCFu"&gt;ReedPop and Penny Arcade, the organizers of the PAX gaming conventions, announced on Friday that they &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pax/status/1334890211621433349?s=20"&gt;plan to resume PAX East, West, and Unplugged in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Organizers are planning to hold these events as long as it’s safe to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtfONp"&gt;The organizers announced that they have no plans to hold PAX South next year, but the show will return in 2022, while information on PAX Australia will follow “in the coming weeks.” As far as the other PAX conventions go, locations remain unchanged, but the dates for PAX East, typically held in March at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, have been pushed back to the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1hgOcT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;With optimism and safety in mind, we're announcing our &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PAX?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PAX&lt;/a&gt; 2021 Dates. Read the full statement below: &lt;a href="https://t.co/dDMhsJwd7t"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dDMhsJwd7t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PAX (@pax) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pax/status/1334890211621433349?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tBPWbu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Its last in-person convention was held in February&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ymBwO6"&gt;With support from local governments and health officials and “pending improvement in the global COVID-19 situation,” the gaming conventions are slated to return with PAX East in Boston from June 3rd–6th. PAX West will also return, with the four-day event running from September 3rd–6th. PAX Unplugged will run from December 10th–12th. More information on all three events will be shared next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvHWjg"&gt;The last in-person convention was held in February with PAX East. Following COVID-19 safety concerns, organizers enhanced their cleaning and sanitation efforts during the event. But despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21230014/pax-west-event-dates-convention-safety-public-health"&gt;intending to hold PAX West in Seattle over Labor Day weekend&lt;/a&gt;, organizers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21293169/pax-west-online-australia-canceled-date-seattle-gaming-convention"&gt;canceled the in-person event&lt;/a&gt; and shifted to a nine-day online-only conference. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden coronavirus appointee has cut ties with Facebook, transition team says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Acting OMB Director Jeffrey Zients Testifies On President’s FY2014 Budget" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yZG-ij2iqAQ7blDl7LcDfnp-PNM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68456543/166333903.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by T.J. Kirkpatrick / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TUihFo"&gt;President-elect Joe Biden’s incoming COVID czar, Jeffrey Zients, is facing new scrutiny over his corporate ties — particularly a two-year stint on Facebook’s board of directors. But the Biden transition team confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Zients liquidated his Facebook stock earlier this year and will retain no equity when he officially begins his White House role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SWCkaf"&gt;Zients &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/05/zients-joins-facebook-board/"&gt;joined the Facebook board&lt;/a&gt; in May 2018 in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal but declined to seek reelection to the board when his term ended in 2020. &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680120000037/facebook2020definitiveprox.htm"&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission filings&lt;/a&gt; show he was compensated with $100,000 in cash and just over $300,000 in stock awards for his work chairing the board’s Audit &amp;amp; Risk Oversight Committee, which met 13 times in 2019. Crucially, the last of his restricted stock units were vested in May 2020, leaving him able to entirely liquidate his financial ties to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XRwJvB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook must be held accountable for amplifying misinformation.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uUG2hf"&gt;Zients’ departure from the Facebook board was abrupt and came amid rumors of a split with the company’s management. “Mr. Zients was generally aligned with Kenneth Chenault, [who] resigned from the company’s board following disagreements with founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and other Facebook officials,” &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-names-former-deputy-secretary-of-the-treasury-to-its-board-11585256495"&gt;wrote &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the time. “They differed over governance at the company and its policies around political discourse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B48RdB"&gt;Zients’ role as &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/03/zients-murthy-biden-coronavirus-team-442609"&gt;the incoming White House’s COVID-19 coordinator&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t directly affect Facebook, but with the company facing unprecedented federal scrutiny and an impending antitrust action from regulators, tech activist groups are particularly sensitive to any connections between Facebook and the Biden White House. In September, a coalition of antitrust groups &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418368/joe-biden-facebook-transition-team-administration-employees-executives"&gt;called on the transition&lt;/a&gt; to forswear any Facebook executives or registered lobbyists tied to the company from White House appointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZGJhM"&gt;On Thursday, Accountable Tech co-founder Jesse Lehrich called Zients a “talented problem-solver” but said Facebook’s role in spreading anti-vaccine misinformation could not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k79NAY"&gt;“Facebook must be held accountable for amplifying misinformation that has undermined our pandemic response and sown baseless distrust in vaccines,” Lehrich said. “In order to guard against conflicts of interest, Mr. Zients should immediately divest of the significant equity he earned in Facebook from his service on the Board and commit to hiring an online misinformation expert to handle his team’s engagement with major social media platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTnPST"&gt;Zients previously served in a number of economic policy roles in the Obama administration — most notably, as director of the National Economic Council and acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.&lt;/p&gt;
