    <title>Floating virtual lawmaker pauses relief meeting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wm0TdIQCFD5KLsm84hVBGMPdRjA=/131x0:1517x924/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68800417/Screen_Shot_2021_02_10_at_4.13.10_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Rep. Tom Emmer tunes into a House Financial Services markup upside down.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iJNxue"&gt;Like plenty of other congressional committees this week, the House Financial Services Committee met Wednesday to press forward on the latest pandemic relief package. Unlike those other committees, however, this one had the floating head of an upside-down congressman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdgmpQ"&gt;It’s not unusual for lawmakers to appear virtually for committee hearings much anymore due to the coronavirus pandemic. But it &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;unusual for them to stream in as a bodiless apparition. Asking to speak during Wednesday’s hearing, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN) appeared flipped upside-down while making a standard statement on the underlying measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzS3Xo"&gt;“Mr. Emmer, are you okay?” Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xHtQa"&gt;“I am,” Emmer responded. “I don’t know what happened. It just came out this way. I turned it off and turned it back on and I’m still... okay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9onG4k"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I am not a cat. &lt;a href="https://t.co/d4lhQd0sJ4"&gt;pic.twitter.com/d4lhQd0sJ4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Emmer (@RepTomEmmer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer/status/1359598666638581774?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3HxZaz"&gt;With everything moving online — from birthday parties to congressional hearings — the learning curve has proven steep for some users. Just yesterday, a Zoom filter trapped a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/2/9/22274865/zoom-hearing-cat-filter-lawyer-texas-live-court-hearing"&gt;lawyer as an adorable cat&lt;/a&gt; during a live court hearing that went viral after the judge tweeted out a clip. Rod Ponton, cat lawyer, couldn’t figure out how to remove the filter before streaming into the hearing and even suggested continuing with the cat face on. But it didn’t take very long for Ponton to figure out how to remove it, and the hearing proceeded without further incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3sIm6"&gt;“At least he’s not a cat!” one lawmaker shouted, referencing Tuesday’s lawyer cat flub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="25q6T9"&gt;“You’re going viral, Tom!” another lawmaker informed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5Bj9Z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pY9tdo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If you’re vaccinated against COVID-19, you won’t have to quarantine if you’re exposed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New York’s Yankee Stadium Hosts Major Coronavirus Vaccination Site" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LbQVOotuGwH7N9cRVG9maqx2Glc=/0x0:5956x3971/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68800375/1300510738.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uupTvW"&gt;People who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and don’t have any symptoms don’t have to quarantine if they’re exposed to someone with the disease, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html"&gt;new guidelines&lt;/a&gt; released today. They should still follow other public health guidelines, like wearing a mask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWnpIe"&gt;Someone is considered fully vaccinated if it has been more than two weeks since they’ve received the second dose of a two-dose vaccine or a dose of a single-dose vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2MFLFA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As far as selling points for getting vaccinated go, "you won't have to quarantine after a COVID exposure anymore" might be a pretty strong one &lt;a href="https://t.co/RODB8pyNL5"&gt;https://t.co/RODB8pyNL5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ed MD (@notdred) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/notdred/status/1359588988621893633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="odZmtS"&gt;Even the best vaccines aren’t perfect protection against COVID-19. The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, the two authorized in the United States so far, are around 95 percent effective at protecting from symptomatic disease. That means there may be a small number of people who are vaccinated who could still get sick. The CDC says people who don’t quarantine should still watch out for symptoms and get tested if they experience any. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snwi2m"&gt;Researchers still don’t know how long protection from the vaccines lasts. So for now, the CDC says people should only skip quarantine during the three months after their last dose. That’s the length of time pharmaceutical companies tracked people enrolled in their clinical trials. That could change as companies have more time to gather and analyze data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7D0ZZ"&gt;The guidelines are similar to those for people who have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/duration-isolation.html"&gt;already been sick&lt;/a&gt; with COVID-19 and presumably have some level of natural immunity. If someone is within three months of their initial infection, they also don’t have to quarantine unless they develop symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVcuYm"&gt;Scientists still aren’t sure if people who get vaccinated can spread the coronavirus to others. Research is ongoing, and there should be clearer answers soon. However, based on what we know about vaccines and viral infections, there’s a good chance someone who has been vaccinated would be less contagious if they have an asymptomatic infection. For the CDC, the benefits of minimizing quarantines outweigh the potential, likely small risk of viral spread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyTIjp"&gt;Over &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;33 million people&lt;/a&gt; in the US have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk and Witcher hackers claim they’ll auction off stolen source code for millions of dollars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O3CkIiabaXXcHmbarZp4cijtVRY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68800290/acastro_170621_1777_0001_fin.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cPm7UR"&gt;The hackers who targeted video game developer CD Projekt Red (CDPR) with a ransomware attack are now auctioning off the stolen source code they acquired for a payday of potentially millions of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhjyKe"&gt;The breach, which CDPR &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274035/cd-projekt-hack-source-code-cyberpunk-2077-witcher-3-encrypt-data-ransom"&gt;first disclosed yesterday&lt;/a&gt; after learning of it on Monday of this week, involved critical game code related to high-profile releases like &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077. &lt;/em&gt;CDPR said at the time that it had no intention of meeting the hackers’ demands, even if that meant stolen material from the hack began circulating online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5KcXy"&gt;That has now started to happen, it appears. Earlier today, leaks of potentially legitimate source code information started appearing on online forums, as noted on Twitter by the cybersecurity account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1359473460448231425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1359473460448231425%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;vx-underground&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bSGMBd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;CD Projekt Red's ransomed data has been leaked online. &lt;a href="https://t.co/T4Zzqfn78F"&gt;pic.twitter.com/T4Zzqfn78F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— vx-underground (@vxunderground) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1359473460448231425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ktYPsT"&gt;This initial leak is believed to include source code of the CDPR’s virtual card game &lt;em&gt;Gwent&lt;/em&gt;, while vx-underground disclosed that auctions for the more valuable source code were happening on a hacking forum known as Exploit. We haven’t been able to verify that information, and CDPR has not responded to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cd2j6r"&gt;But a cybersecurity firm called KELA, which specializes in providing threat intelligence to companies based on analyses of dark web websites and communities, says it has reason to believe the auctions are, in fact, legitimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hD11qX"&gt;“We do believe that this is a real auction by a real seller who accessed the data. The seller offers to use a guarantor and he allows only those who have a deposit to participate — a tactic that is used by many sellers to show that they are serious and to ensure that no scam will occur,” a spokesperson for KELA tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YkUKkI"&gt;KELA says its threat intelligence analyst, Victoria Kivilevich, was able to download some of the information provided to him by an individual claiming to be involved with the auctions. Kivilevich believes it is genuine, and KELA shared screenshots with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;of some of the file lists allegedly showing off stolen source code of CDPR’s Red Engine, its in-house game engine platform. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6e0KCL_fuEuXjsCtkbBaZRlEDdk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22295499/WhatsApp_Image_2021_02_10_at_14.12.09.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: KELA&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OOWPJFZMAQc0QaZobsLkX0-sJqc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22295501/WhatsApp_Image_2021_02_10_at_14.12.10.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: KELA&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pB9yL6"&gt;KELA says the auction is offering source code files for both the Red Engine and CDPR game releases, including &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales &lt;/em&gt;spinoff, and the recently released &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. The stolen material is also believed to include internal documents, though it’s not clear what types of documents or additional material the full cache includes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7JTJB"&gt;KELA says the starting price of the auction is $1 million, with higher bids in increments of $500,000 and a buy-it-now price of $7 million. Only users who deposit 0.1 bitcoin can participate, which is why Kivilevich believes the hackers are serious about hosting the auction and that the material for sale is likely legitimate because it ensures nobody participating in the auction is trying to scam the sellers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frH0A9"&gt;Vx-underground also independently verified the pricing terms of the auction after KELA had provided the information to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, including screenshots alleging it’s to take place tomorrow at 5AM ET / 1PM Moscow Standard Time and run until 48 hours after the last bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JmANoV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Update: a mistake was made. They stated starting bid $1kk. This was assumed as a typo for $1,000. They meant $1,000,000. They are also selling immediately for $7,000,000.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attached images supplied by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrFurfagMD?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DrFurfagMD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/JnOcwnGqZk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JnOcwnGqZk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— vx-underground (@vxunderground) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1359568916339646466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CuMxxm"&gt;It’s not clear whether the leak from earlier today — which has already been removed from file upload sites like Mega and scrubbed from hacking forums and other sites — is in any way associated with the ransomware attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBLeb6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PK9Vay"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus is killing off tiny easy-to-lose M.2 screws with this handy Q-Latch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ddgzNZuUm0uwJTzzvhctxB3xc6E=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68800119/q_latch_asus_gif_2.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qzxpmc"&gt;Is there anything worse than repeatedly dropping the super tiny screw that lets you install an M.2 solid-state drive in your PC? Yes, but it’s definitely up there on the list — and now, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ASUS_ROG/status/1358694010932449281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1358694010932449281%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;Asus has a solution&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFwjD1"&gt;It’s called the Q-Latch, and it’s about as simple as it gets: a plastic retaining lever that you can rotate into place with the single swipe of your thumb. You can get one in several of &lt;a href="https://www.asus.com/us/site/motherboards/Intel-Rocket-Lake-Z590-H570-B560-series/"&gt;Asus’ new Z590 and B560 motherboards&lt;/a&gt;, though it hasn’t rolled out to the company’s most expensive boards yet, &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/asus/m2-q-latch-installation"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;PCGamesN&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zBM1i4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/VaOz7YqG2G"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VaOz7YqG2G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ROG Global (@ASUS_ROG) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ASUS_ROG/status/1358694010932449281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eiYJEc"&gt;This isn’t a brand-new idea, as the kind of business-oriented laptops and desktops that your sysadmin might have procured have sometimes featured plastic retaining clips in the past, but it’s the first time I’ve seen anything like this on DIY desktop components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2l8Er"&gt;More than one &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer is happy to see Asus doing something about this. New SSDs don’t typically come with these screws, so you generally have to carefully save the ones from your motherboard if you want to install one later on. They’re also annoying to insert: I helped one of my buds remotely build a computer last week, and he dropped it repeatedly. (Sorry, friend. Your sad story is memorialized on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; now.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzwCy7"&gt;One trick is to place the M.2 screw on the lip of your SSD before you fully press it down against the motherboard, using both the spring tension of the SSD and the tip of your screwdriver to hold it in place as you push down. But if you’d rather not deal with that, I’m seeing Asus’ Q-Latch listed for the following motherboards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xXLnzL"&gt;TUF Gaming Z590-Plus WiFi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Yp0c80"&gt;ROG Strix Z590-A Gaming WiFi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lQZ8vy"&gt;ROG Strix Z590-E Gaming WiFi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t69GFW"&gt;ROG Strix Z590-F Gaming WiFi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Bx0im"&gt;ROG Strix B560-A Gaming WiFi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6HIWYA"&gt;ROG Strix B560-F Gaming WiFi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d44Ur3"&gt;ROG Strix B560-G Gaming WiFi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="opCrjw"&gt;Hopefully, other manufacturers will follow Asus’ lead, but I’m not holding out hope. Remember when I asked whether there was anything worse than M.2 screws? One worse thing is tiny header cables — you know, the ones that seem to enjoy being guillotined by graphics cards and are a pain to slot if you’ve got big hands. Asus has something for that, too, but&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-Connector"&gt; its “Q-Connector”&lt;/a&gt; (see below) isn’t widespread, either.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A little plastic brick with pins that allows you to insert all the motherboard headers at once." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WEXmwYq-zs4F8v9VWiaR3QPBnGI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22295529/asus_q_connector.jpg"&gt;

    <title>Pokémon cards are selling so well the Pokémon Company is rushing to print more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pokemon European International Championships" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8fw1DVYdjOnPoxWFq8gINtSslU8=/0x0:4944x3296/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68799905/875487558.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by John Keeble/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="svo9eH"&gt;Demand for Pokémon cards has been high the last few weeks as the series celebrates its 25th anniversary. To accommodate the high demand, The Pokémon Company announced today that it &lt;a href="https://support.pokemon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056644571-Update-on-Pok%C3%A9mon-Trading-Card-Game-Product-Availability"&gt;will be reprinting trading cards&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="212vyK"&gt;The Pokémon Company &lt;a href="https://support.pokemon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056644571-Update-on-Pok%C3%A9mon-Trading-Card-Game-Product-Availability"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; on its support page that it is “aware that some fans are experiencing difficulties purchasing certain Pokémon trading card products due to a very high demand and global shipping constraints impacting g availability,” while also confirming that it is reprinting impacted products at “maximum capacity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W2UsoE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re aware that some fans are experiencing difficulties purchasing certain Pokémon TCG products due to very high demand. In response, we are reprinting impacted products at maximum capacity to ensure more fans can enjoy the Pokémon TCG. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More info here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/sClZo3BXsp"&gt;https://t.co/sClZo3BXsp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Play Pokémon (@playpokemon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playpokemon/status/1359548922780213249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="HIeblb"&gt;There’s no specific time frame on when retailers are expected to receive new shipments, but the company pledged that it will “replenish stock at retailers as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uo0NbP"&gt;Over the last several months, Pokémon trading cards have been &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/11/6/21551503/pokemon-card-charizard-appraisal-shadowless-collection-first-edition-prices"&gt;in high demand&lt;/a&gt; with products selling out quickly at retailers and older cards selling for as much as &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/10/28/21538821/box-of-first-edition-pokemon-cards-fake-375000-dumb-money-logan-paul"&gt;$375,000 by third-party sellers&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, card opening videos have &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQB8scCtrKg"&gt;blown up on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; over the last year — in some cases, getting millions of views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMdJQz"&gt;With the franchise celebrating a major milestone this year, Nintendo has been finding various ways to commemorate the occasion. This includes partnering with McDonald's to give out &lt;a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/collect-25th-anniversary-pokemon-tcg-cards-in-mcdonalds-happy-meals/"&gt;collectible cards when you buy a Happy Meal&lt;/a&gt; at the fast-food chain, but as our sister site &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22274841/mcdonalds-pokemon-cards-anniversary-25-scalpers-ebay-prices-resell-happy-meal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out, the demand for these items is high, and some people are taking advantage of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Asus TUF Dash F15 gaming laptop is efficient but not excellent</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Its quad-core CPU and low-powered RTX 3070 are great for efficiency but not intensive tasks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="BKRRgh"&gt;If it’s a thin gaming laptop you seek, Asus makes several, including last year’s excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt; and the intriguing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22249408/asus-rog-flow-x13-review-price-specs-features"&gt;ROG Flow x13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; that we recently reviewed. The TUF Dash F15 is the latest option to join the pack, and it’s the one that might catch your eye if you’re looking for a laptop outfitted with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226544/nvidia-rtx-3080-laptops-gpus-ces-2021"&gt;Nvidia RTX 3070 graphics chip&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225370/intel-11th-gen-h-series-chips-ultraportable-gaming-laptop-ces-2021"&gt;11th Gen Intel Core H-series processor&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to other perks like a Thunderbolt 4 port and a fast refresh rate display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPUGlG"&gt;As one of the first machines to launch with this processor and GPU, the TUF Dash F15 is a showcase for what you can expect from a thin chassis that costs $1,449, Asus’ MSRP for the configuration it sent over to me. (This specific model is set to release on March 8th. A $1,699.99 model with a slightly better processor is available now. A $1,099.99 model that contains the RTX 3060 is available as of February 15th, 2021.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoVUeZ"&gt;Like those other models I mentioned, the TUF Dash F15 is a really solid laptop — except for the fact that, like the Zephyrus G14, it doesn’t have a webcam. For that reason, it’s not an ideal machine if you frequently hop on video calls for work, class, or leisure. In terms of specs, I’m not convinced it has the chops to brave the next wave of demanding games in a year or two. I’ll explain why in a bit. At least for now, it can run most games at their highest graphical settings with relatively smooth frame rates, and it has great battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="r0z5CE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10336076"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j7oTsC"&gt;The TUF Dash F15 has a new chassis design that looks more refined than Asus’ TUF A15 gaming laptop. This model has a slimmer, more confident look that ditches the older version’s faux-brushed metal detailing and garish yellow backlit keys. Its lid is gunmetal grey (Asus also makes a “Moonlight White” variant), while the inside is black and all-plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zquto9"&gt;The keyboard is backlit in a color that I would describe as Mountain Dew Baja Blast. It’s a strange color choice — but I don’t hate it. The effect is more subtle than it seems and can be turned off or the brightness adjusted. Also, seeing the light shine through the transparent WASD keys looks cool (in addition to helping you quickly find those all-important directional keys).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus TUF Dash F15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y9jYjwepRC4jr97BDGoMc26A0nE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253386/cfaulkner_210114_4374_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This keyboard is a dream to type on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus TUF Dash F15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zHkmfPw2SgH3oNnvS9_BCkpFG-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253380/cfaulkner_210114_4374_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The volume keys have their own spot at the top.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4GkldM"&gt;I commend Asus for engineering a good keyboard, both in terms of key feel and usability. All of the keys are nicely spaced out, and I was quickly able to acclimate to typing on it. It was also smart to separate the volume keys from the row of function keys since they’re so commonly used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="iy7JHd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10336106"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fOJ4dO"&gt;Continuing Asus’ trend from the Zephyrus G14, this machine also has fantastic battery life. In my testing, the TUF Dash F15’s battery lasted into the start of a second day before needing to recharge. That’s over eight hours of use, which is fantastic longevity for a machine pitched as a gaming laptop. Unplugging the charger automatically puts it in “Silent” mode within Asus’ Armoury Crate performance-tracking software and knocks the display’s default 240Hz refresh rate down to a choppier 60Hz. In this mode, the system switches automatically to integrated graphics. (The Nvidia graphics chip is disabled when you unplug.) That’s a compromise, but I like that no toggling is necessary to get good results like these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YWz4p"&gt;Out of curiosity, I switched to 240Hz while running off the battery. It lasted most, but not all, of my workday. It’s no secret that high refresh rate displays can kill battery life, so I wouldn’t suggest doing this unless you keep a charger nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzyzP3"&gt;Speaking of chargers, the laptop ships with a big 200W power brick, but you have the option to recharge it with up to a 100W USB-C charger using its Thunderbolt 4 port. (Thunderbolt 4 doesn’t support wattage over 100W.) Obviously, it doesn’t charge as quickly that way; in fact, in my experience, the laptop drains faster while gaming than it can charge via USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus TUF Dash F15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gDEYeYSB1DzdUJTOcp1ySwDhwpU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253381/cfaulkner_210114_4374_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I like that Asus lets the TUF Dash F15 charge via the Thunderbolt 4 port (up to 100W).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus TUF Dash F15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rS3unEU_iFgqHiUfVyTi-q0u-Oo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253385/cfaulkner_210114_4374_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;But if you want the fastest recharge, you’ll have to plug in with the included 200W power brick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="81oDvw"&gt;The TUF Dash F15’s quad-core Intel Core i7-11730H processor and 16GB of DDR4 RAM didn’t miss a beat while I was using 10 tabs in Google Chrome, along with Spotify (streaming music via Bluetooth to my headphones — the laptop’s built-in speakers are awful), Slack, and Affinity Photo. For those apps, this device feels snappy enough to use as a daily driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNA38N"&gt;However, this doesn’t seem like the best choice if your work involves editing and exporting video or other processor-bound projects. When I ran our video export test (which crunches an Adobe Premiere Pro project into a 5-minute, 33-second 4K file), it took 6 minutes, 41 seconds, which was slower than I anticipated. The machine’s four-core, 35W TDP processor seemed to be the bottleneck, as Windows Task Manager performance stats showed that it was at full, or near full, utilization the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2apqzC"&gt;There are some older midrange gaming laptops we’ve reviewed that delivered faster Premiere Pro results, thanks to their higher-power 45W 10th Gen hexa-core and octa-core processors. A few include last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335740/lenovo-legion-5i-gaming-laptop-review-intel-nvidia"&gt;Lenovo Legion 5i&lt;/a&gt; and the 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21348101/msi-gs66-stealth-gaming-laptop-review-rtx-2070-super-300hz"&gt;MSI GS66 Stealth&lt;/a&gt; as well as the maxed-out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; we tested. However, I wouldn’t recommend opting for those since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225370/intel-11th-gen-h-series-chips-ultraportable-gaming-laptop-ces-2021"&gt;Intel has 45W 11th Gen processors in development&lt;/a&gt; that should leave the older chips in the dust. But none of this helps this laptop’s case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus TUF Dash F15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c61J82MAh6rl1FOBzOH3d_Iq3DE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253382/cfaulkner_210114_4374_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus also makes a “moonlight white” version of the TUF Dash F15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus TUF Dash F15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mj2algGtoORnz1kj7JOBXOwhgRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253387/cfaulkner_210114_4374_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Games look great on its 240Hz refresh rate IPS panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G1w6dy"&gt;The TUF Dash F15 was more middling with high-end gaming than I expected, too. Its RTX 3070 struggled to meet the bar for smooth 60 frame-per-second gameplay when I ran some demanding titles like &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt; at their highest graphical settings in 1080p. Open-world titles and games with ray-tracing features were particularly good at pushing this laptop to its limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="qCslkm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10336141"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tBPsdU"&gt;With the games running at their highest graphical settings, the benchmark utility in &lt;em&gt;Horizon: Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; averaged 68fps, while &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt;’s benchmark averaged 58fps. &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; fared better at around 80fps with DLSS settings set to quality mode. &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;topped out at around 50fps with all ray-tracing settings set to max and DLSS on, though performance varied wildly depending on the level of action or environment. These are all very playable frame rates, though the numbers tell me that you’ll need to make a few graphical tweaks to run these games smoothly. And possibly, games releasing in the next year or two might not fare as well as these ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMo9P2"&gt;I was expecting better performance from this chip in these tests since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22244409/msi-gp66-leopard-gaming-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;MSI GP66 Leopard&lt;/a&gt;, also using the RTX 3070, tested with higher numbers. However, there’s a good reason for these results. &lt;a href="https://www.asus.com/Laptops/For-Gaming/TUF-Gaming/2021-ASUS-TUF-Dash-F15/techspec/"&gt;Asus explains on its product page &lt;/a&gt;that it set the chip’s clock speed and total graphics power to its lowest-possible power requirements, likely due to the laptop’s slim design and to maintain efficient performance. The TUF Dash F15’s GPU is clocked at 1,290Mhz (with a boost of up to 1,390MHz), and it has a total graphics power of 85W; this is compared to 1,620MHz and 130W in the GP66 Leopard, which is the highest-possible configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Raz2Kb"&gt;This kind of occurrence isn’t new. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;what is new (and the cause for some confusion) is Nvidia’s recently evolved Max-Q branding&lt;/a&gt;, which previously indicated the power discrepancy noted above by attaching “Max-Q” to the graphics chip’s name. It now exists instead to tell people that a laptop ships with a particular set of power and efficiency software tools, which this one does.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus TUF Dash F15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ypUcBWbn719pm-KqjLiC-i0bOaI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253379/cfaulkner_210114_4374_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A nice slim bezel, but one without an essential webcam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KX5zX6"&gt;In short, Asus’ new TUF Dash F15 includes a batch of specs that offer quite a bit of power when it’s needed and long-lasting efficiency when it’s not. But while the laptop provides a good balancing act and some relatively smooth gaming, I don’t think it’ll be perfect for everyone, mainly because it doesn’t really make the grade for many of the things we use laptops for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPH9fX"&gt;Not only is it unusable for video meetings (again, no webcam), but it probably won’t meet the bar for more heavy-duty tasks like video production or even a daily load of apps like the ones I use. And for gaming, this slim machine’s RTX 3070 isn’t as powerful as I would want for a long-term investment like this, especially because I’m not convinced it has the chops to brave the next wave of demanding games in a year or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="1aHEZ9"&gt;I think there will probably soon be some machines containing these new components that can manage to please everyone. But this isn’t it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter resists Indian government’s orders to block protest accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OcekTka59RpIrGSNlq-oI51XQAE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68799738/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="51Yd1g"&gt;Twitter has refused an order from the Indian government to block certain Twitter accounts, including ones from politicians, activists, and journalists that were critical of the government’s response to a protest carried out in the country’s capital in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X92LrE"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_in/topics/company/2020/twitters-response-indian-government.html"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, Twitter explained that, while it has started blocking some accounts, it has “not taken any action on accounts that consist of news media entities, journalists, activists, and politicians” because it believes doing so would “violate their fundamental right to free expression under Indian law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQPP6G"&gt;Starting at the beginning of February, the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has sent orders to Twitter to block a number of accounts and hashtags connected to mass protests that have gripped the country. Many of the accounts &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/indian-government-block-critics?bfsource=relatedmanual"&gt;were critical of the Indian government and its response to the protests&lt;/a&gt;, including the official Twitter account of a prominent magazine &lt;em&gt;The Caravan&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/india-threatens-twitter-jail"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the government ordered the accounts suspended because they were “spreading misinformation about protests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHO00w"&gt;Twitter initially &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/narendra-modi-media-social-media-india-9777a8af9a08aa6dac64e7f8ee227872"&gt;complied with the orders&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a decision that drew significant criticism from civil rights groups. Some activists &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/india-threatens-twitter-jail"&gt;called the action censorship&lt;/a&gt;, while others &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/indian-government-block-critics?bfsource=relatedmanual"&gt;accused of Twitter bowing to government overreach&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cd04UB"&gt;The protests have been building since November, and have resulted in violence, deaths, and internet blackouts &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/asia/india-internet-cut-farmers-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;in parts of the country’s capital region&lt;/a&gt;. Tens of thousands of farmers have gone on strike over the course of the protests, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-55793731"&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt;. The farmers &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/violence-erupts-at-indian-farmers-latest-protest-against-agricultural-law-changes-11611664480?mod=article_inline"&gt;are concerned about changes to agricultural laws&lt;/a&gt; in India that they fear could cut their income. Farming policy is a hugely important issue in India. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/asia/india-internet-cut-farmers-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;According to CNN&lt;/a&gt;, 58 percent of the people in the country make their money primarily through agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w18GB9"&gt;Twitter’s justification for unblocking the accounts, in opposition to government orders, is it believes keeping them inaccessible “would violate their fundamental right to free expression under Indian law.” In its blog post, Twitter says it “do[es] not believe that the actions [it has] directed to take are consistent with Indian law,” and that unblocking the accounts is consistent “with [its] principles of defending protected speech and freedom of expression.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP’s refreshed Pavilion x360 convertible laptops are optimized for streaming  </title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WmxvVXiA26OL4TrIvkUZVa27xYo=/0x78:2094x1474/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68799528/Screen_Shot_2021_02_10_at_2.01.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hLKeb7"&gt;HP announced today that it has refreshed its Pavilion x360 line of 14- and 15-inch convertible laptops, making them smaller, lighter, and more geared toward streaming entertainment. The 15-inch version is available today. With an 11th Gen Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB of memory, and 256GB of storage, it starts at $750. The 14-inch version will be available later this spring; no pricing was available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JU5IN6"&gt;In view of marketing to “Gen Z” during a streaming-heavy pandemic, HP says it has optimized the new line for entertainment. The bezels have been reduced — something you’ll likely appreciate when watching videos — and HP has included a simplified version of its Omen Gaming Hub, which allows you to customize your keystrokes, lighting, and other features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxOFDZ"&gt;The two new Pavilion x360 laptops also have a smaller footprint than before. For example, the 14-inch version has been shrunk down from a width of 221mm to 209mm, and its weight has dropped from 1.61kg (3.5 pounds) to 1.50kg (3.3 pounds). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qZDwX"&gt;Other specs include an 11th Gen Intel Core i3/i5/i7 processor, storage up to 1TB, Intel Iris Xe graphics (in the i5 / i7 systems), and optional Wi-Fi 6. HP also is promoting the sustainability of the new computers, claiming they use post-consumer recycled and ocean-bound plastic and recycled aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="givVVN"&gt;The 14-inch Pavilion x360 will come in three colors: “natural silver,” “warm gold” (premium only), and “spruce blue” (non-premium only). The 15-inch version comes in “natural silver.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4529DG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJm2GwlbGF56gpDmNhJwIgppWKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989898/dseifert_201025_4263_0002.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Echo Dot with LED display&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. Currently, you can buy the Echo Dot for $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=9435ae8f24eb1f1ce631fc393e5b63fc&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, you will also receive &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=1f8cec5c4de66d34faec62b689563081&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one Sengled Bluetooth bulb&lt;/a&gt; at no extra cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjABjU"&gt;Amazon is also selling a bundle that includes one &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Amazon-Smart-Charcoal/dp/B08GTWC9ZB?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=9d071f8b7fa655d000e04ef86f37a2ae&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot and an Amazon Smart Plug&lt;/a&gt; for $60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;We have seen this product go down to $40. Right now, you can buy one for $55 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=62af1027db0f9e0b5d445aa7e24b9179&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3GbSWO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;You can buy a fourth-gen Amazon Echo for $90 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KVFM2XM?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=361ad144f7f58ae894b621dc4e2bef89&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;; the retailer will also throw in two Philips Hue bulbs along with the Echo.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiNGuc"&gt;If you are looking for a pair of Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $180&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $20 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="oiVOWB"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is one of two smart displays to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90 and we have seen it go down as low as $45. Right now, you can get it for $60 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZD7VZG?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4261fc6b8543b690542caa2dcbd1968d&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the Echo Show 5 on Amazon, you can also receive a one-year subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZD7VZG?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=6fde3082530c75af7d8ff189576c8fdf&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Food Network Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; at no extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJmJw1"&gt;Amazon also has a few bundles available at a discounted price; you can get an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089Q2RJH9?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=d2be23f6d66fe42b8ce0b1b1ba09793f&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and three months of Amazon Kids Plus&lt;/a&gt; for $61, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086P992GD?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=2fbb41aba454fb34ba8b518124dbff4e&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $70, and an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SW188FP?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=5e0b558c561fc5f089e3706f5558b213&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 plus an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $80. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVFAcO"&gt;Best Buy also has a few bundles currently available, including the $70 bundle with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730445461281046110" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt;. You can also get &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730445590854581686" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two Echo Show 5 units for just $120&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device; this includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the device go down as low as $65.

  &lt;p id="TQFidg"&gt;A new bill introduced in the North Dakota Senate might have far-reaching consequences for app store operators. The bill, &lt;a href="https://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/67-2021/documents/21-1044-01000.pdf"&gt;Senate Bill 2333&lt;/a&gt;, seeks to ban stores like Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store from mandating developers only use those app stores and their respective in-app payment systems. It also bans retaliation against developers in the event they choose an alternative distribution channel or payment system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6YbDg"&gt;“The purpose of the bill is to level the playing field for app developers in North Dakota and protect customers from devastating, monopolistic fees imposed by big tech companies,” said Sen. Kyle Davison (R-Fargo), who introduced the bill before a Senate committee on Tuesday, told reporters in a press conference yesterday, as &lt;a href="https://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/north-dakota-senate-bill-targets-monopolistic-app-stores/article_dc491c88-97e0-54cd-beb2-5a26044cb97c.html"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Bismarck Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Davison said the 30 percent fee imposed on app developers who sell software through Apple and Google’s marketplaces has the effect of “raising prices and limiting choices for consumers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmLQNZ"&gt;The bill is quite simple and lays out three key restrictions for any “digital application distribution platform” that exceeds $10 million in annual revenue. That means an app store cannot: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="KrRc8v"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“Require a developer to use a digital application distribution platform or digital transaction platform as the exclusive mode of distributing a digital product.”&lt;/strong&gt; That would likely mean that companies like Apple would have to allow app purchases outside a single locked-down store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xvC9Ot"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“Require a developer to use an in-application payment system as the exclusive mode of accepting payment from a user to download a software application or purchase a digital or physical product through a software application.”&lt;/strong&gt; This would allow an iOS version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, to process in-app payments through Epic instead of Apple’s system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JGsDGf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Retaliate against a developer for choosing to use an alternative application store or in-application payment system.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="Femqby"&gt;As a state bill, the proposed legislation would only affect the operation of businesses like the App Store within North Dakota. But the sweeping changes the bill calls for would likely require companies like Apple to make substantial platform-level changes that could affect software distribution on a national scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9Tusp"&gt;The use of alternative in-app payment methods is at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;heart of an ongoing legal battle&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;em&gt;Fornite &lt;/em&gt;developer Epic Games and both Apple and Google, after &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;was removed from the App Store and Play Store in August of last year for introducing its own payment processing tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijA1wq"&gt;Epic purposefully engineered its &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;update to bypass the 30 percent cut of all in-app purchases required by Apple and Google as a form of protest, both to the standard 30 percent cut and specifically Apple’s App Store rules that bar third-party app stores from the iPhone. (Google does allow Android users to sideload third-party software and for developers to create alternative app stores for distributing software, though it does make doing so difficult.) Epic is now suing both companies for alleged antitrust violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3ti9F9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The purpose of the bill is to level the playing field for app developers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LCbdc1"&gt;The Epic case is just one part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506682/google-apple-amazon-facebook-antitrust-report-house-judiciary"&gt;growing antitrust movement in the US that’s taken aim at Big Tech&lt;/a&gt;. Every one of the major US tech companies, save Microsoft, is currently under increased antitrust scrutiny from the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as state attorneys general, with various levels of investigations underway. While Apple is not under formal investigation, CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony"&gt;testified this past summer&lt;/a&gt; before the Senate Judiciary Committee during its tech antitrust hearing. Meanwhile, the European Commission has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;two ongoing antitrust investigations&lt;/a&gt; into Apple’s App Store and Apple Pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4f3J3m"&gt;Apple has already testified against North Dakota’s new bill in a hearing on Tuesday with North Dakota’s Senate Industry, Business and Labor Committee. Apple’s Erik Neuenschwander, its chief privacy engineer, told the committee the bill “threatens to destroy iPhone as you know it” and that it would “undermine the privacy, security, safety, and performance that’s built into iPhone by design,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Bismarck Tribune&lt;/em&gt;. “Simply put, we work hard to keep bad apps out of the App Store; (the bill) could require us to let them in.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y1XOt5"&gt;Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson, who attended the hearing and testified in favor of the bill, criticized Apple for exaggerating the threat the bill poses to its business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GwInFj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;North Dakota's SB 2333 is the first real, concrete legislative proposal I've seen that actually gives me hope that tech monopolies aren't going to rule the world forever. Fargo or Bismarck sound like wonderful places to set up shop under a shield against abuse   &lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1359203441827078145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fNPc52"&gt;Hansson has become a vocal critic of Apple’s App Store policies, following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293419/hey-apple-rejection-ios-app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust"&gt;showdown his company had with Apple&lt;/a&gt; last summer over Basecamp’s Hey email client. The disagreement centered on the functions of the Hey iOS email app, and Hansson and Basecamp CEO Jason Fried complained that the situation was emblematic of Apple’s inconsistently applied rules and the lengths the company goes to ensure developers are not sidestepping the 30 percent cut mandate. Although Apple and Basecamp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;reached a compromise&lt;/a&gt;, Hansson has since called for congressional action, as well as stronger antitrust regulation, to try to force Apple to alter its policies and to reign in Big Tech at large. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="APyX5i"&gt;In written testimony Hansson prepared prior to the hearing, he laid out his case for Senate Bill 2333. “After the recitals, the 17 lines of SB 2333 read like music. Written in a language I can understand without hiring counsel to parse it for me. It almost seems too good to be true! But I sincerely hope that it is not,” he wrote in his testimony, which he later &lt;a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/testimony-before-the-north-dakota-senate-industry-business-and-labor-committee/"&gt;released online&lt;/a&gt;. “That you will listen to the small software developers from all over the country, who are tired of being bullied and shaken down by a handful of big tech monopolists out of Seattle and Silicon Valley.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmdyQn"&gt;Hansson says the US needs a “fair digital marketplace free of monopoly abuse” and that “no single change will have a greater impact than giving small software makers like us a choice when it comes to in-app payment systems, and protection from retaliation, if we refuse the onerous deal the monopolists are offering.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayiay1"&gt;Chairman Sen. Jerry Klein (R-Fessenden) said during the committee hearing that “there’s still some mulling to be done” and that no action would be taken on the bill as of yet. Neither Apple nor Google have immediately responded to requests for comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
