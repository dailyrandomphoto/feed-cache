    <title>Apple Maps now shows COVID-19 vaccination locations</title>

  &lt;p id="v3Tryz"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F03%2Fapple-maps-now-displays-covid-19-vaccination-locations%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F16%2F22334609%2Fapple-maps-facebook-google-covid-19-vaccine-locations" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that Apple Maps has been updated with vaccine locations from VaccineFinder, a site run by Boston Children’s Hospital that provides information on vaccine eligibility and availability. People can search for nearby vaccination sites in Apple Maps or ask Siri, “Where can I get a COVID vaccination?” Over 20,000 locations are now listed, with more to be added in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image of a phone showing Apple Maps with locations marked as COVID-19 vaccine sites." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uXmYci24ul9wSwpsQjnRm0WnxxU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22375689/apple_maps_vaccinefinder_vaccine_search_results_03162021.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vaccination sites in Apple Maps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ACXEzW"&gt;Each vaccine site listing in Apple Maps includes the operating hours and contact information for the site, with a link to the provider’s website to find vaccine availability and make an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BbwVJ4"&gt;With the new feature, Apple joins a number of other tech companies offering more ways for people to check their eligibility, locate vaccination sites, and get vaccine appointments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VBOBY8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to score a COVID-19 vaccine appointment","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22279023/covid-19-vaccine-appointment-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0iMqDU"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2021/03/15/covid-vaccine-appointment-facebook-instagram-coronavirus-vaccination/4680803001/"&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that it will be adding VaccineFinder information to its COVID Information Center, showing people when and where they can get vaccinated and providing links to make appointments. The COVID Information Center will also be expanding to Instagram, and the company is working on expanding government and health authority WhatsApp chatbots to help people register for vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xO8sHB"&gt;Google is also offering more ways to find information about vaccination. The company &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/googles-business-messages-helps-the-public-find-covid-19-vaccines"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that people can use Business Messages in Google Maps and Google search to contact local pharmacies owned by Albertsons Companies — including Safeway, Jewel-Osco, Vons, Albertsons, Acme, Shaw’s, and Tom Thumb — with questions about vaccine eligibility, availability, and appointment booking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoqfW9"&gt;The US federal government is set to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22326335/biden-white-house-covid-19-vaccine-federal-website"&gt;launch its own vaccine-finding website&lt;/a&gt; by May 1st and has said that all adults in the US will be eligible for a vaccine at that time.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;So far, about 28 percent of adults in the US have received their first vaccine dose, &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft reiterates ‘VR for console is not a focus for us’ following localization bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5hWvKtjbkKgvU4bbiAuwpbs6H4Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68977570/acastro_180604_1777_xbox_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s6ER77"&gt;Microsoft has once again reiterated that VR support for Xbox was not a focus for the company, following reports earlier today that hinted it was working on a VR headset compatible with the Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VbMYr"&gt;The rumor first surfaced after &lt;a href="https://it.ign.com/xbox-series-x/179732/news/microsoft-al-lavoro-su-un-headset-vr-per-xbox-gli-indizi-arrivano-dalle-nuove-cuffie-wireless"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN Italy&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that some Italian Xbox users received messages, which translated to “[a]n update for the VR headset is available” and “[u]pdate VR headset,” when connecting the recently released Xbox Wireless Headset to their Xbox Series X or Series S consoles. My colleague, Cameron Faulkner, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;reviewed the Xbox Wireless headset&lt;/a&gt; and did not encounter this pop-up message while using the headset on an Xbox Series X console in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AK4lU4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“VR for console is not a focus for us at this time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5n48S"&gt;A Microsoft representative told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “the copy in this error message is inaccurate due to a localization bug,” while again reiterating that “VR for console is not a focus for us at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BO0ywN"&gt;Microsoft has yet to explore the VR space for its Xbox consoles. In 2018, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17485852/microsoft-xbox-one-no-vr-headset-support-windows-mixed-reality-e3-2018"&gt;pulled back&lt;/a&gt; on plans to support virtual reality headsets for Xbox in 2018, explaining that it wanted to focus “primarily on experiences you would play on your TV.” In late 2019, Xbox boss &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/28/20987089/xbox-phil-spencer-microsoft-vr-project-scarlet-half-life-alyx"&gt;Phil Spencer tweeted out&lt;/a&gt; that although he played “some great VR games” such as &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx,&lt;/em&gt; console VR was not Xbox’s focus ahead of the Xbox Series X / S release. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard lays off about 50 employees, citing COVID-19’s effects on its esports leagues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-knS_tIIZ4zQfYoNHMqedkeR15M=/0x0:3840x2560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68977519/The_Gauntlet_Final_Bracket_Day_3__62_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Activision Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YXDglQ"&gt;Activision Blizzard on Tuesday said it was laying off about 50 people across various divisions dealing predominantly with live events and esports as part of a restructuring. The company cites the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects on both the viability of live productions for its esports leagues and the changing viewership habits of its core audience over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNOwwL"&gt;“Players are increasingly choosing to connect with our games digitally and the e-sports team, much like traditional sports, entertainment, and broadcasting industries, has had to adapt its business due to the impact the pandemic has had on live events,” an Activision Blizzard spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/blizzard-fires-50-people-amid-shift-away-from-live-events?srnd=technology-vp&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in a statement. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, laid-off employees will receive three months’ severance and health benefits for the next 12 months. The layoffs also include some employees at Activision-owned mobile firm King, the maker of &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KaXp0D"&gt;Activision Blizzard operates two massive esports leagues for two of its most popular franchises, Blizzard’s team shooter &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; and Activision’s &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;series. Both leagues had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21122974/overwatch-league-season-3-preview-youtube-hero-pool-china-travel"&gt;global, travel-oriented productions&lt;/a&gt; planned for 2020 prior to the pandemic, and both had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505843/overwatch-league-owl-grand-finals-2020-schedule-youtube"&gt;shift pretty much every part of the operation&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22276595/call-of-duty-league-cdl-2021-season-preview-johanna-faries-interview"&gt;online-only production and remote competition&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tuZw9b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s a reaction to the realities of how the leagues are playing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6B7DZX"&gt;“We learned a lot last year in terms of how the leagues can be structured for online play, and we’ll look to carry forward the best practices from that,” Tony Petitti, Activision Blizzard’s president of sports and entertainment, &lt;a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/SB-Blogs/Breaking-News/2021/03/Activision-layoffs.aspx"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Sports Business Journal&lt;/em&gt; in an interview&lt;/a&gt;. “In terms of timing, it’s a reaction to the realities of how the leagues are playing and what resources we need to allocate to best serve the league, owners, teams and fans.” Petitti says the company is nonetheless “really optimistic” that its esports business can grow with a new focus on online production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cA2Hy"&gt;While the company’s esports business may have suffered during the pandemic, Activision Blizzard’s core business is doing remarkably well. The company’s latest quarterly earnings report, &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-fourth-quarter-and-2020-financial#:~:text=For%20the%20year%20ended%20December,GAAP%20operating%20margin%20was%2034%25."&gt;released last month&lt;/a&gt;, indicated record revenues for 2020 that smashed Wall Street expectations, thanks in large part to the ongoing success of &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;and its &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; battle royale game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9ojIL"&gt;“In a year filled with adversity our extraordinary employees were determined to provide connection and joy to our 400 million players around the world,” Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said at the time. “They accomplished this as well as generating record financial results for our shareholders. Under difficult circumstances, but with the same conviction and focus, they will continue to do so in 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Riot Games investigation says there’s ‘no evidence’ CEO harassed female employee</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="League of Legends – 2020 Worlds: Media-Day" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mxYVRbkHNBqTIULnAPyrinNgK00=/0x0:5200x3467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68977334/1282874591.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n18doO"&gt;Riot Games is closing an investigation into whether CEO Nicolo Laurent harassed or discriminated against former employee Sharon O’Donnell, saying it found “no evidence” of the claim. “After review of the results of the investigation,” Riot said in a statement, “there is no evidence that Nicolo harassed, discriminated, or retaliated against Ms. O’Donnell. The Special Committee has also expressed its full confidence in Nicolo’s leadership, that no action against him is warranted, and that he will continue to operate as CEO.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYQTA5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/03/16/nicolo-laurent-lawsuit-riot-games/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; the news earlier today, and Riot &lt;a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/special-committee-review"&gt;posted an overview&lt;/a&gt; of the investigation’s conclusions as well as a letter from Laurent. The &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Riot asked a court to speed up legal proceedings for a suit filed by O’Donnell earlier this year, attempting to move the case to arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40xp2R"&gt;Riot, the studio behind games like &lt;em&gt;Valorant &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; League of Legends,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275059/riot-games-ceo-investigation-gender-discrimination-sexual-harassment-allegations"&gt;opened an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Laurent following O’Donnell’s lawsuit. A former executive assistant, O’Donnell alleged that Laurent made inappropriate sexual remarks and demeaning comments about her gender. She also alleged that she was fired after refusing sexual advances from the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIxpUe"&gt;Now, based on the findings of an outside legal team, a special committee of the board of directors has concluded those claims were meritless. “This is not a recommendation we take lightly,” the committee said in a statement. “Most cases of this nature are not black and white; they fall into the grey. However, this was not one of those cases. In this case, we were simply unable to find any evidence that would justify a sanction of any kind against Laurent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qitQzp"&gt;The committee members said they would request the case be reopened if new evidence emerged. O’Donnell’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the investigation results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWT8ux"&gt;These claims against Laurent were part of a much bigger controversy involving Riot’s company culture. Several employees echoed stories about pervasive discrimination and harassment at the studio, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/29/17796238/riot-games-league-of-legends-toxic-sexism-workplace-culture-harassment-apology"&gt;leading Riot to apologize&lt;/a&gt; and promise changes, including &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/esports-lol-riot-gelb/reports-riot-games-suspends-coo-idUSKBN1OD0GS"&gt;suspending the company’s COO&lt;/a&gt; for two months. In addition to the suit from O’Donnell, Riot is &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-01-29-riot-games-seeks-arbitration-in-gender-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;currently pushing to settle&lt;/a&gt; a class action gender discrimination complaint. A report yesterday &lt;a href="https://dotesports.com/news/sources-alienware-terminates-lol-global-sponsorship-allegations-riot-ceo"&gt;suggested that Alienware&lt;/a&gt; had ended a partnership with Riot following the allegations; Riot declined to comment on the claim at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6pVGf"&gt;In its statement, the board committee attempted to separate Laurent’s investigation from a larger mission to change Riot’s culture. “While our conclusion in this particular case is that no discrimination, harassment, or retaliation occurred, let us be clear that as a committee, we remain fully invested in overseeing the Company’s initiatives to transform Riot’s culture,” it said. “We encourage any employee of Riot who has experienced misconduct to feel safe reporting it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Teen ‘mastermind’ behind the great Twitter hack sentenced to three years in prison</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GhMIM04WEo_FwcoWTfeJG30U6-M=/0x2:2048x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68977098/VRG_ILLO_1777_twitter_bitcoin.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TYfT1j"&gt;Teenage Twitter hacker Graham Ivan Clark has pleaded guilty to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326200/elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-hack-bitcoin-scam-compromised"&gt;last summer’s unprecedented bitcoin scam attack&lt;/a&gt; that involved the takeover of dozens of high-profile accounts on the social network, according to paperwork filed in Florida court on Tuesday. Clark, who was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352325/twitter-hack-arrest-go-read-this-new-york-times-profile"&gt;17 when accused of leading the scam&lt;/a&gt;, will spend three years in prison as part of his plea deal. The&lt;em&gt; Tampa Bay Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/crime/2021/03/16/tampa-twitter-hacker-agrees-to-three-years-in-prison-in-plea-deal/"&gt;reported the news&lt;/a&gt; earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZ65Ue"&gt;Clark has already been credited with 229 days of time served &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349920/twitter-hack-arrest-florida-teen-fbi-irs-secret-service"&gt;since his arrest last summer&lt;/a&gt;. As part of the deal, Clark is also being sentenced as a “youthful offender,” which lessened his prison time and also opens up the possibility that he can serve some of his sentence at a boot camp, according to the &lt;em&gt;Tampa Bay Times&lt;/em&gt;. Clark will also be banned from using computers without permission and without supervision from law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="au8Ovg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Clark was 17 at the time of the Twitter hack, which compromised several high-profile accounts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CWeksl"&gt;The hack took place on July 15th, 2020, and it quickly became one of the most fraught cybersecurity incidents in Twitter’s history, as accounts belonging to high-profile users like Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden were compromised in quick succession to promote a bitcoin scam Clark used to accept more than $100,000 in the cryptocurrency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0SIY9"&gt;How Clark pulled off the hack, which he did alongside two other collaborators he allegedly met on an online username-selling forum called OGusers, has been the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21329147/twitter-hack-attack-bitcoin-scam-how-it-happened-new-york-times-go-read-this"&gt;subject of numerous reports&lt;/a&gt; that detailed the group’s use of internal Twitter tools. Those tools, which can be used to reset account email addresses, allowed Clark and his collaborators to assume control of the accounts and send out tweets soliciting the public for bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMfcKF"&gt;Shortly after the hack, Clark was arrested at his home in Hillsborough, Florida. Clark’s partners, Nima Fazeli of Orlando and Mason Sheppard of the UK, were charged with federal crimes, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wikimedia will launch a paid service for big tech companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logo of Wikipedia" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tB4OKgNk0nIVTQsn4ep06qbJZMk=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68976992/1296469702.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hxgVf5"&gt;The Wikimedia Foundation is creating a &lt;a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Enterprise"&gt;new paid service&lt;/a&gt; for companies that draw on Wikipedia data. The foundation announced the news today &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wikipedia-finally-asking-big-tech-to-pay-up/?utm_brand=wired&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;via an article in &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and it’s planning to launch later in 2021. &lt;a href="https://enterprise.wikimedia.com/"&gt;Wikimedia Enterprise&lt;/a&gt;, as it’s called, won’t change how current Wikipedia services work. Instead, it will offer new options for companies that use its content, a category including giants like Google and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ew5SeV"&gt;Wikimedia is still finalizing how Wikimedia Enterprise will operate. But broadly, it’s like a premium version of Wikipedia’s API — the tool that lets anybody scrape and re-host Wikipedia articles. Enterprise customers could get data delivered faster or formatted to meet their needs, for instance, or get new options for sorting and posting it. As Wikimedia Foundation senior director Lane Becker explains to &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, companies may already be paying employees to clean up Wikipedia data, and Enterprise will do that kind of cleanup at the source. Or if they want, companies can keep using the existing API for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="srrWKD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wikimedia insists it’s not “forcing Big Tech to pay”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nI99s6"&gt;Many huge internet services are powered partly by Wikipedia. Google’s “knowledge boxes” incorporate information from the free encyclopedia, and so do voice assistants like Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri. As web platforms attempt to fight misinformation, Wikipedia has also become a go-to fact-checking resource. But while some companies have &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/amazon-echo-wikipedia-wikimedia-donation.html"&gt;offered donations&lt;/a&gt; in return for using Wikimedia’s free services, others have launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17120918/youtube-wikipedia-conspiracy-theory-partnerships-sxsw"&gt;big Wikipedia-powered initiatives&lt;/a&gt; without even telling the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEngot"&gt;Wikimedia’s &lt;a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Enterprise/FAQ"&gt;frequently asked questions page&lt;/a&gt; insists that Enterprise isn’t “forcing Big Tech to pay” for Wikipedia. But it &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;solve specific, well-known problems for those companies. One potential service would let companies display the most reliably community-vetted edits instead of the newest ones, preventing false or insulting vandalized articles from &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-search-california-gop-nazism/"&gt;ending up on their own platforms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gDbwK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Enterprise/Essay"&gt;In an essay&lt;/a&gt;, the Wikimedia Enterprise team acknowledges that it’s balancing commercial realities with a mission to provide free access to knowledge. “This is about setting up the movement to thrive for decades to come, to weather any storm, and to genuinely stand a chance at achieving the mission first conceived 20 years ago,”  the essay says. “We’re going to need more resources, more partners, and more allies if we are going to achieve the goals implicit in our vision statement.” And starting later this year, that could include paid partnerships with the internet’s biggest companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZiH55y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mars might be hiding most of its old water underground, scientists say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrsyMmhsQcxrRJ5vRdC65EHQE-M=/0x56:1602x1124/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68976337/25695_PIA24485_K4_ZCAM_main_sol004_Delta_Remnant_unannotated.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A deposit of sediments, called a delta, captured by NASA’s Perseverance rover on March 5th at the Jezero Crater.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA / JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HbAndJ"&gt;Vast amounts of ancient Martian water may have been buried beneath its surface instead of escaping into space, scientists report in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. The findings, published Tuesday, may help untangle a clash of theories seeking to explain the disappearance of Mars’ water, a resource that was abundant on the planet’s surface billions of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r88HBW"&gt;Through modeling and data from Mars probes, rovers, and meteorites, researchers at the California Institute of Technology found that a broad range — between 30 to 99 percent — of the Red Planet’s earliest amounts of water could have vanished from the surface through a geological process called crustal hydration, where water was locked away in the rocks&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;of Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqHsNP"&gt;Evidence of past water on Mars is written all over its rocky surface, where dried-out lake beds and rock formations illustrate a world shaped by liquids from more than 3 billion years ago. For years, scientists thought this water had mostly escaped outward into space, leaving the planet in its present — very dry — condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqvoxA"&gt;But that takes time. And the rate at which the water could have escaped the atmosphere, paired with the predicted amount of water that once existed on the Martian surface didn’t quite line up with modern observations of the planet. “If that persisted through the past 4 billion years, it can only account for a small fraction of water loss,” says Renyu Hu, one of the study’s co-authors. That left researchers with a key question: where exactly did the rest of the water on Mars go? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dyxpdi"&gt;The study, led by Eva Scheller, a graduate student in geology at Caltech studying planetary surface processes, might offer an answer. The study finds that most of the water loss occurred during Mars’ Noachian period between 3.7 billion to 4.1 billion years ago. During that time, the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;water on Mars could have interacted and fused&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;with minerals in the planet’s crust — in addition to escaping the planet’s atmosphere&lt;strong&gt; — &lt;/strong&gt;locking away as much water as roughly half of the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kO6x_Forl0UgJOPSe7WOMvdTMwU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22375099/_mars.nasa.gov_msl_raw_images_proj_msl_redops_ods_surface_sol_03052_opgs_edr_ncam_NLB_668441769EDR_F0870792NCAM00252M_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA / JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image of the Mont Mercou cliff, captured by one of the navigation cameras aboard NASA’s Curiosity rover this month. Data and images from Curiosity informed the findings made by Scheller’s team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BoeFba"&gt;“One of the things our team realized early in the study is that we needed to pay attention to the evidence from the last 10 to 15 years of Mars exploration in terms of what was going on with our discoveries about the Martian crust, and in particular the nature of water in the Martian crust,” says Bethany Ehlmann, a co-author on the study and professor of geological and planetary sciences at Caltech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hN7GfB"&gt;Water can break down rocks through a process called chemical weathering, which sometimes results in minerals becoming hydrated. Hydrated minerals take up and store water, locking it away. For example, gypsum, a water-soluble mineral found naturally on Mars, can keep its water trapped unless heated at temperatures higher than 212 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vUKjXj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The answers are there, but they slowly build through time as you gain more data”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fO0Ubb"&gt;For years, scientists have observed the distribution of water-bearing minerals across the Martian surface, thanks to spacecraft like NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been mapping the planet’s geology and climate since 2006. But those views alone are sometimes limited. “You have to wave your hands and extrapolate about how thick that layer is that you see at the surface,” says Michael Meyer, the lead scientist for NASA’s Mars Exploration Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RKYaZ"&gt;“It’s only by having measurements in particular places on the surface with your rovers or landers, like Phoenix, or your occasional view of a fresh crater, that you get an idea of how thick the particular spot is on the planet for the hydrated minerals that you’re looking at,” he says. “So the answers are there, but they slowly build through time as you gain more data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wumzyg"&gt;That’s what led to the study’s findings that oceans’ worth of ancient water may have escaped inward, not outward. “We wanted to understand this at different scales,” says Scheller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zwOue2"&gt;Crustal hydration happens on Earth, but our active plate tectonic system recycles rock deep inside our planet, heating rocks and releasing water in the process. That water gets sent back to the surface through volcanic activity, says Christopher Adcock, a planetary geochemist at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYquEo"&gt;Mars, on the other hand, is not as geologically active as Earth, which could explain why it only has limited water on its surface. The clearest evidence of water on Mars comes in the form of ice at the planet’s poles and in tiny quantities in the atmosphere. Scientists have studied hydrated rocks on the Moon, Mars, and on other planetary bodies as a potential source of drinkable water for future astronaut missions or fuel that could power habitats and rockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjwJMI"&gt;Adcock, whose studies include how humans can synthesize and use minerals on Mars for drinking water and rocket fuel, says the findings from Scheller’s team don’t totally change the game for resource utilization, “but it is certainly an encouraging reminder that the water we need for long term human missions to Mars might be right at our feet when we get there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlzHkq"&gt;Last month, NASA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;landed&lt;/a&gt; its Perseverance rover on Mars’ Jezero Crater, the site of a dried-out lake bed whose soil might hold the most pristine evidence of hydrated minerals — and fossilized microbial life. Perseverance will scoop up tiny soil samples and scatter them across the crater’s surface for a future “fetch” rover to retrieve. That presents a tantalizing opportunity for the researchers behind the &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtSWMg"&gt;“Samples from Jezero will help us test this model,” Ehlmann says. “It amplifies the importance of bringing those samples back.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Retail giants look to greener cargo ships to meet climate goals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Yangshan Deepwater Port In Shanghai" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MlSnqNONx-O9CVlQsebngq9Pex4=/135x0:5337x3468/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68976227/1179330572.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RBRB4a"&gt;Pressure from some of their biggest customers is pushing companies like global shipping giant Maersk to pollute less when they transport goods. It’s a sign that individual companies’ commitments to tackling climate change can influence others along the entire supply chain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="vqgNNR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One of the latest trends in retail &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Avt1dF"&gt;One of the latest trends in retail has been for companies to pledge to essentially eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions. In order for them to have any chance of meeting those goals, they’ll need to work with the companies that move their products. That means cleaning up the global shipping industry, which is responsible for close to 3 percent of the world’s total emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iw2ud"&gt;Maersk said last month that it’s significantly speeding up its timeline to develop what it says will be the world’s first cargo ship to run on fuels that don’t add more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. It pledged to complete the vessel by 2023 — seven years ahead of its original schedule. In the &lt;a href="https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2021/02/17/maersk-first-carbon-neutral-liner-vessel-by-2023"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the company pointed out that about half of its 200 largest customers had either set or were about to set targets to slash supply chain emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L78Q3K"&gt;“Customer demand is a big factor in saying, ‘Yes, we have to do this, and we have to do it now,’” says Lee Kindberg, head of environment and sustainability for Maersk in North America. Maersk works closely with some of its biggest customers to cut down on pollution, Kindberg says. Its customers’ supply chain emissions, after all, are Maersk’s primary emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wji9Lh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Customer demand is a big factor in saying, ‘Yes, we have to do this’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ca8HBj"&gt;Early in the climate commitment craze, companies made promises to slash emissions that come directly from their operations and electricity use. That might include the pollution from its factories or from keeping the lights on at their offices. Those commitments frequently excluded indirect emissions that come from things like the raw materials used to make products or from vessels hired to transport goods. Some companies argued that they had no control over those “indirect” emissions. But that’s changing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pFlYa"&gt;Maersk has &lt;a href="https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2019/10/29/maersk-join-forces-with-industry-peers-and-customers-to-develop-leo"&gt;partnered&lt;/a&gt; with its customers BMW, H&amp;amp;M, and Levi Strauss &amp;amp; Co., to develop more sustainable fuels for ships. Each of those companies has set goals for emissions cuts. Huge retailers like Amazon and Walmart, which sell items that might be transported via Maersk’s container ships, have also pledged to get rid of nearly all their planet-heating pollution by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="patjno"&gt;There’s been a push from environmental groups to make companies cut &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; emissions that come from their supply chains and the end use of their products — together referred to as emissions from the “&lt;a href="https://ghgprotocol.org/standards/scope-3-standard"&gt;value chain&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lejqZg"&gt;“For many companies, the majority of their emissions are in their value chain. So they can’t credibly demonstrate their leadership on climate without addressing those emissions, as well as the emissions in their operations,” says Cynthia Cummis, director of private sector climate mitigation at the nonprofit World Resources Institute, who also co-founded a United Nations-backed &lt;a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/"&gt;initiative&lt;/a&gt; to help companies develop science-based emissions-reduction targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="1vf8r0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They can’t credibly demonstrate their leadership on climate without addressing those emissions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RRIBwz"&gt;An added benefit to tackling indirect emissions from the supply chain is that it can force retailers to have conversations with their suppliers and carriers about the pollution they’re generating together. “This may be part of what is spurring Maersk to take action and provide carbon neutral transport to respond to the needs of their customers,” says Cummis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UFqPZT"&gt;Another likely impetus for Maersk’s climate goals is international policies that are driving deeper emissions cuts across the entire maritime transport industry. The United Nations’ International Maritime Organization set a &lt;a href="https://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/HotTopics/Pages/Reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-ships.aspx"&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; of cutting emissions from international shipping by 50 percent compared to 2008 levels by the year 2050. However, that might need to be a floor rather than a ceiling for the industry. Climate scientists &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; emissions need to drop to essentially zero by the middle of the century to avoid the worst effects of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHKiD0"&gt;Moving forward, all of Maersk’s newly constructed vessels will have dual-fuel technology that allows them to run on more traditional fuels or alternative carbon-neutral fuels. The company is also trying to make its vessels more energy efficient. The goal is to have a “carbon neutral fleet” by 2050. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5xaKO"&gt;For the vessel it plans to launch in 2023, Maersk has put its money on alternative fuels — specifically, so-called “green” methanol that is made with renewable energy or agricultural waste instead of coal or gas. While less polluting than conventional fuels, green methanol still &lt;a href="https://grist.org/energy/green-methanol-maersk-shipping-fuel/"&gt;has problems&lt;/a&gt;. For methanol made with agricultural waste, there are concerns that biofuels could compete with agriculture for land to grow feedstock, driving up food and water scarcity. Methanol also still releases some CO2 when burned, although proponents say this is offset by the carbon that’s captured from the process of making the fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJ7wo8"&gt;In the future, some of those problems could be solved with a switch to fuels made from liquid hydrogen or &lt;a href="https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2021/03/10/maritime-industry-leaders-to-explore-ammonia-as-marine-fuel-in-singapore"&gt;ammonia&lt;/a&gt; (which Maersk says it’s also looking into) — although those technologies are still a little further out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9fiAX"&gt;“Maersk is a really important player in this space,” says Dan Rutherford, who directs aviation and marine programs for the International Council on Clean Transportation. “There’s definitely a lot of interest in what technologies they put their money on.” As the company operating &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/263291/container-shipping-companies-worldwide-number-of-ships/#:~:text=Container%20shipping%20companies%20worldwide%20%2D%20number%20of%20ships%202021&amp;amp;text=As%20of%20March%204%2C%202021,or%20in%20its%20order%20book."&gt;the most container ships&lt;/a&gt; in the world, Maersk can influence the entire shipping industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t4mNtA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Maersk can still do more to address its &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; indirect emissions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ClEaFQ"&gt;Maersk can still do more to address its &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; value-chain emissions. Committing to cutting those emissions would exert pressure on its own suppliers. So far, the company hasn’t done that. That means there are likely still emissions generated from the process of building its next-generation ships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtjZ1n"&gt;Addressing those emissions could be in Maersk’s future, according to Kindberg. “Clearly, we’d like to be able to make the full commitment, but you need to be sure you’ve checked all the boxes before you expand it,” she says. She adds that Maersk is “evaluating” how it might be able to work with shipyards to cut down their pollution. In the meantime, Kindberg says, Maersk is focusing on its “controllable operations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtGcZi"&gt;Figuring out how to clean up ships, ports, and shipyards is a tall order. Shipping is considered one of the hardest sectors to get running on clean energy. Batteries aren’t advanced enough yet to electrify large ships making long journeys, which is why there’s a lot of focus on developing more sustainable fuels. And ships have a lifetime that can be decades longer than land-locked vehicles, which also puts the transition to less polluting vessels on a longer timeline. Designing and building a single ship can take years, too, which is another reason why Maersk says it had to move fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydgqeE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/ocean/topics/ocean-shipping/"&gt;Ninety percent&lt;/a&gt; of global trade moves by sea. So nearly any retailer that wants to cut down its carbon footprint will need to look seaward. And even if it takes time, cleaning up global shipping lanes will have a tremendous impact on the planet and the people these trade routes connect. That makes it all the more important to start working on carbon-cutting solutions as soon as possible.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqkKqD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Xbox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WgUfLH"&gt;Xbox &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/16/coming-soon-xbox-game-pass-march-2021-wave-2/"&gt;is announcing the next round of games coming to Game Pass&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a pretty stacked deck with games like &lt;em&gt;Undertale &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Octopath Traveler, &lt;/em&gt;both of which are coming to Xbox for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fwnn8O"&gt;Coming to all the Game Pass platforms (cloud, console, and PC) are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="5u3yxG"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt; (available today)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kIMhx0"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Empire of Sin &lt;/em&gt;(Available March 18th)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UqygYm"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yakuza 6: The Song of Life &lt;/em&gt;(March 25th)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tYv8Jy"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Narita Boy &lt;/em&gt;(March 30th)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="TOAuEm"&gt;Coming to just cloud and console is &lt;em&gt;Outriders&lt;/em&gt; (April 1st), and coming to just console and PC are &lt;em&gt;Octopath Traveler&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;/em&gt;, both on March 25th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6j2aS"&gt;The PC is also getting some love, with a few of games being added to the platform that were previously not available to PC Game Pass subscribers: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="EiDydI"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Nier: Automata &lt;/em&gt;(March 18th)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Hl6mOr"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Torchlight III&lt;/em&gt; (March 18th)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="74hx94"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire - Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt; (March 25th)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="txqnSp"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Supraland&lt;/em&gt; (March 25th)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="acjy7J"&gt;And finally, as if there weren’t enough games,&lt;em&gt; Star Wars: Squadrons &lt;/em&gt;will be available on EA Play for console players starting on March 18th. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will have access to the game through the included EA Play subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bn1vOt"&gt;Overall, there are some great games in here if you’re a Game Pass subscriber, whether you stream your games, play them on console or PC, or some of each. &lt;em&gt;Undertale &lt;/em&gt;coming to the service (and platform) feels like a &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt;, given the game’s incredible popularity and the fact that it’s been available on most platforms for a while now (it was released on the PlayStation Vita &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16151292/undertale-playstation-4-vita-release"&gt;almost three years ago&lt;/a&gt;). The game was first released in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxS4hD"&gt;Of course, many of these games are also becoming available for purchase on the Xbox as well, for those who prefer owning their games. And, as always, there must be some sort of balance in the universe, so three games will be leaving Game Pass on March 31st: &lt;em&gt;HyperDot&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Journey to the Savage Planet&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Machinarium. &lt;/em&gt;If you’ve been meaning to play any of those titles, it’s probably time to hop on it! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foxconn says it might build EVs at empty Wisconsin site, or in Mexico</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Foxconn’s “Fab”in Wisconsin. A state report says it no signs that it manufactures LCDs, or ever will" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vuIYBVJ9ETWze2iXZqvBH9KhjUs=/0x3:7192x4798/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68975977/Foxconn_proof_08_080520_3892.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://aerialscapes.com" target="_blank"&gt;Curtis Waltz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SyrArT"&gt;The chairman of Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn says the electronics giant is considering making electric vehicles at its mostly empty worksite in Wisconsin, where the company originally planned to make LCD panels. Either that, or Foxconn may make EVs in Mexico. The decision will be made by July 1st, chairman Young Liu said &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-wisconsin-mexico-scott-walker-taipei-313ff82519f7ac551f1a149eebf82b4e"&gt;at a press conference Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpnKjf"&gt;Best known for manufacturing iPhones, Foxconn has recently shifted some of its attention to the booming electric vehicle space as a way to diversify its revenue. Late last year, the conglomerate announced an EV platform on which &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/iphone-to-electric-cars-foxconn-reveals-ev-platform-promises-battery-breakthroughs/"&gt;other companies could build&lt;/a&gt;. This year, Foxconn announced tie-ups with China’s largest private automaker, Geely, and with a number of EV startups. It has agreed to build an electric vehicle with Fisker Inc., struggling startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212994/byton-foxconn-electric-vehicles-china-shutdown-extended"&gt;Byton&lt;/a&gt;, and may even build one with Faraday Future (as part of the deal with Geely), which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22247942/faraday-future-spac-merger-public-psac-property-solutions-nasdaq"&gt;now flush with cash after years on the brink&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jokfxm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Foxconn is considering Wisconsin or Mexico and will decide by July&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mY0Rrp"&gt;Foxconn also announced an EV partnership &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069288/foxconn-fiat-chrysler-electric-vehicles-china-joint-venture"&gt;with Fiat Chrysler in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, though neither company has commented on the project since. (Fiat Chrysler is now called Stellantis.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkEZwW"&gt;Fisker Inc. founder Henrik Fisker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298878/foxconn-fisker-ev-electric-vehicle-wisconsin-deal-fsr-suv"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; there was a “very good chance” that it would build a vehicle with Foxconn in Wisconsin, though the chairman’s comments Tuesday are the first time the Taiwanese company confirmed its interest in using the facility. Liu also said Foxconn is &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-assembler-foxconn-hints-at-making-electric-vehicles-in-u-s-11615905476"&gt;considering building EVs for multiple partners&lt;/a&gt; but dismissed rumors that it would work with Apple, which is developing an autonomous electric car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3QJsR"&gt;Foxconn broke ground on the factory in Wisconsin in 2018, after netting some $4 billion in tax credits and other incentives from state and local governments. The company promised it would invest $10 billion, build a 20-million-square-foot facility, and create 13,000 jobs all to make LCD panels. Former president Donald Trump once &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;called the site the “eighth wonder of the world.”&lt;/a&gt; The company said it wanted to build the Silicon Valley of the Midwest, calling it “Wisconn Valley.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YDI6Qt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside Foxconn’s empty buildings, empty factories, and empty promises in Wisconsin","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"},{"title":"Foxconn will build a new electric vehicle for Fisker","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298878/foxconn-fisker-ev-electric-vehicle-wisconsin-deal-fsr-suv"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5FmCbt"&gt;But that never happened. Foxconn has spent the intervening years narrowing the scope of its ambitions in Wisconsin, barely hitting hiring targets set by the state along the way, and has invested just 3 percent of that $10 billion total to date. The biggest structure it’s built measures only 1 million square feet. It was recently reclassified in official documents as a storage facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvD1Nr"&gt;Though Foxconn initially claimed it would manufacture LCD panels at the site, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;in reality&lt;/a&gt; the company has spent years searching for a viable product to manufacture in Wisconsin. For a time, it said it would use the space to create an “AI 8K+5G ecosystem” — though the company never coherently explained what that means. Foxconn also publicly considered &lt;a href="https://www.wpr.org/failed-partnerships-and-vacant-buildings-foxconns-wisconsin-commitment-remains-standstill"&gt;making coffee robots&lt;/a&gt; and, in the early throes of the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21213269/foxconn-ventilators-wisconsin-plant-medtronic-pb-560-open-source-design-covid-19"&gt;ventilators&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5FtlA"&gt;“I took over the Wisconsin task, and I need to make it a viable one, so I need to find a product that fits that location,” &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-wisconsin-mexico-scott-walker-taipei-313ff82519f7ac551f1a149eebf82b4e"&gt;said Liu&lt;/a&gt;, referring to how he inherited the project from previous chairman (and Foxconn founder) Terry Gou, who left the company to take on an ill-fated bid for president of Taiwan. “Whether it’s Wisconsin or Mexico, it’s not political, it’s business from my perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;
