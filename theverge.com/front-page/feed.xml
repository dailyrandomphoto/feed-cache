    <title>Google adds Smart Reply to Docs comments to fill your life with more bland platitudes</title>

  &lt;p id="B6F79s"&gt;Google is expanding the scope of its AI-powered Smart Reply feature &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/08/save-time-replying-to-comments-in.html"&gt;to suggest responses to comments in Google Docs&lt;/a&gt;. It will be rolling out in the coming weeks to all users and will be turned on by default, though you can disable it via &lt;em&gt;Tools &amp;gt; Preferences &amp;gt; Show Smart Reply suggestions&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zx0Cj"&gt;It’s the latest territory claimed by Google’s AI Smart Reply and Smart Compose features. The latter is already available in Gdocs and elsewhere, while the former lurks most prominently in your Gmail inbox. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Smart Reply as it appears in comments in Google Docs&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zzuL2e"&gt;Reactions to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/10/20688106/gmail-smart-reply-whyd-you-push-that-button"&gt;these AI-powered features are varied&lt;/a&gt;. Some enjoy the convenience of using AI to offer up those little verbal platitudes that keep the wheels of workplace life turning smoothly (“That’s perfect, thank you!”). Others bemoan the deadening effect they have on language and, if you’re feeling particularly hyperbolic, on the human soul. Why think about what you’re saying to your colleagues if AI can fill in the gaps where you brain used to be? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Gr8mO"&gt;I for one, am simply looking forward to a time when I’m no longer needed to do my job, and my AI self can chat to my AI workmates, and I can go have a lie down somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nirvana baby sues band alleging child pornography</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Opening Of ‘In Bloom The Nirvana Nevermind Exhibition’" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vCXtnRFYL10BEr2ROjfSymBfTwU=/0x34:3380x2287/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69772662/124872495.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spencer Elden, now 30, is suing over the iconic Nevermind album art.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Samir Hussein/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4bo1e7"&gt;The iconic nude baby photographed for the cover of Nirvana’s &lt;em&gt;Nevermind&lt;/em&gt; album is all grown up and suing the band, alleging the image violates child pornography laws. Spencer Elden, now 30, is seeking $150,000 from each of 17 named defendants, including record executives, Nirvana band members, and Courtney Love, the former wife and executor of Kurt Cobain’s estate, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/music/news/nirvana-baby-nevermind-lawsuit-1235048465/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GOeCM2"&gt;The lawsuit, a copy of which was obtained by &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;, claims that the defendants knowingly exploited young Elden to increase attention and boost sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KosPEi"&gt;“Defendants intentionally commercially marketed Spencer’s child pornography and leveraged the shocking nature of his image to promote themselves and their music at his expense,” reads the lawsuit. “Defendants used child pornography depicting Spencer as an essential element of a record promotion scheme commonly utilized in the music industry to get attention, wherein album covers posed children in a sexually provocative manner to gain notoriety, drive sales, and garner media attention, and critical reviews.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyUeTD"&gt;As a result, the lawsuit contends that Elden “has suffered and will continue to suffer lifelong damages.”&lt;/p&gt;

In past interviews, Elden has expressed mixed feelings over the photo but had never described it as pornographic, according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;, while regularly celebrating its existence. Not only does he have a “Nevermind” tattoo emblazoned across his chest, he’s also recreated the pose on several occasions (always wearing a swimsuit) to mark the album’s major anniversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung says it can remotely disable stolen TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6z_SUfTYXcWhtLO-_YZSddE9uC0=/0x20:1440x980/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69772610/samsung_tv.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung says the feature is “already pre-loaded on all Samsung TV products.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="omY2JF"&gt;Samsung has revealed its TVs &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/za/samsung-supports-retailers-affected-by-looting-with-innovative-television-block-function"&gt;can be remotely disabled&lt;/a&gt; if the company finds out the units have been stolen. The feature is called the “&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/za/support/newsalert/123186/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Television Block Function&lt;/a&gt;” and Samsung says it was recently activated in South Africa after a number of Samsung TVs were taken from a company warehouse during a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-57818215"&gt;wave of protests and unrest&lt;/a&gt; last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3t1yYw"&gt;Samsung says the technology is “already pre-loaded on all Samsung TV products” and “ensures that the television sets can only be used by the rightful owners with a valid proof of purchase.” It’s not clear, though, from Samsung’s description whether the feature is only intended to combat large-scale theft, or if it will ever be used to help individual consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jz8x2N"&gt;For the TV Block Function to work, Samsung needs to know serial code of the stolen unit. When the set connects to the internet, it checks its serial code against a list on Samsung’s servers, and disables all TV functionality if it finds a match.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jjqUfv1jxAGiNZZ1fa2uUfZWdWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804354/za_newsImg_485541334.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The TV Block feature logo&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fFVVLX"&gt;Blocking the TVs stolen in South Africa was presumably relatively easy. They’d been taken from Samsung’s own warehouse, where the company would be tracking its inventory. It’s possible that an average customer whose TV is stolen would be able to report its serial code to the company to have it remotely disabled, but it’s not clear if Samsung offers or plans to offer such a service. (We’ve reached out to the company to ask and will update this story if we hear back.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlQhVM"&gt;The company does say, though, that in the event that customers in South Africa have one of their TVs blocked by accident, they can have the block lifted by sending a proof of purchase to zaservicemanager@samsung.com.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Premium subscribers can now turn on picture-in-picture on iPhone — here’s how</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/unpHc4LCFhB85ZFP2--7UePeWxQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69772479/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VRhHTx"&gt;In June, YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22540482/youtube-picture-in-picture-iphone-ipad-ios-app-free-premium"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it would be bringing picture-in-picture to iOS. Now, it seems the much-demanded feature is finally available, though perhaps for a limited time only and only for YouTube Premium subscribers currently. Here’s how to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UifLlx"&gt;If you’re a YouTube Premium subscriber, open up a web browser and head to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/new"&gt;www.youtube.com/new&lt;/a&gt;. Scroll down to where “Picture-in-picture on iOS” is listed and click “Try it out.” You’ll be prompted to sign in to your account. Then, while watching a YouTube video, just navigate away from the app using the home button or by swiping up and picture-in-picture will start. Locking your phone screen while watching PiP will pause the video, but you can resume it via the lock screen media controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LIjZtyU48d6dZYFmAXgu6GpOa10=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804321/IMG_FAC59AB82AD0_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Head to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://www.youtube.com/new" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;www.youtube.com/new&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to enable the experimental feature&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cxDx7V"&gt;We spotted the news &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/24/youtube-picture-in-picture-iphone/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; which notes that some users have been able to get the feature working on iPads as well as iPhones, but it seems access is a little unpredictable. (Apparently deleting the app might help.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5YpjS"&gt;YouTube says the feature is “Available until 31 Oct,” and we’re not sure what happens after this date. Fingers’ crossed that will be when YouTube — as promised in June — will be bringing the feature to all users, not just paid ones. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California accuses Activision Blizzard of ‘withholding and suppressing evidence’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VGRDXoCuRG6EK6i6ifS7p4GOqnM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69771875/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y2hQOy"&gt;Activision Blizzard’s leaders have promised to work to make the company a safe place for women to work — but California has now accused the company of illegally “withholding and suppressing evidence” and shredding documents that it requested for its investigation (&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-temporary-workers-4a8fa284-a003-4c56-819c-43c7c2d3f3ca.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;originally filed the suit in July&lt;/a&gt;, which accused the company of creating a frat-like culture where female employees faced “constant sexual harassment” and discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sk1xpJ"&gt;The updated complaint can be read below, and you can read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;the original version here&lt;/a&gt;. Since the new version contains the same extremely disturbing details, it warrants the same &lt;strong&gt;content warning&lt;/strong&gt; as the original. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SCW4TK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The amended complaint says that Activision Blizzard cited attorney-client privilege when asked for evidence&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hbEK6Y"&gt;In a new section of the complaint, the DFEH says Activision Blizzard is encouraging employees to talk to attorneys at the WilmerHale law firm instead of state investigators — and then denying the state access to that evidence because the conversations were confidential. Activision Blizzard had already been criticized by both a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618776/activision-blizzard-shareholder-letter-soc-investment-group"&gt;company shareholder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618776/activision-blizzard-shareholder-letter-soc-investment-group"&gt;the press&lt;/a&gt; for hiring WilmerHale, a noted union-busting law firm that reportedly helped Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;initially defeat&lt;/a&gt; its workers’ efforts to organize in Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hO4CIz"&gt;The DFEH also claims Activision Blizzard tried to get employees to sign away their ability to speak freely to investigators in waivers, “secret settlements,” and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), which would require employees to notify Activision Blizzard before disclosing information about incidents covered by the NDA or settlements. They would also decide how much employees could freely say, giving the company the ability to “take all steps it deems to be appropriate to prevent or limit the required disclosure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GawM4h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The complaint now accuses the company of shredding “documents related to investigations”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xh0vEW"&gt;Activision Blizzard has promised to try to fix its culture after its initial public response was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598128/activision-blizzard-employees-ceo-letter-response-key-concerns"&gt;panned by employees&lt;/a&gt;, who would later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595922/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-sexual-harassment"&gt;stage a walkout&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;letter to employees published in late July&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s CEO promises that “anyone found to have impeded the integrity of our processes for evaluating claims and imposing appropriate consequences will be terminated.” The allegations in the updated complaint don’t paint a picture of a company working on fixing its culture, though. For its part, an &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-hr-shredded-documents"&gt;Activision Blizzard spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the company didn’t shred any documents, and that it had preserved “information relevant to the DFEH investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obOY6C"&gt;The complaint has also been updated in several places to clarify that it’s not just full-time employees, but also temps and contingent workers that experienced sexual harassment and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJnRvD"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. Both the AirPods and AirPods Pro are compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which isn’t always the case with even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;. The AirPods Max, the latest pair of headphones to join the AirPods lineup, are just as dependable, albeit at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Luckily, many of the most popular models routinely undergo a price cut. There are often sizable discounts available on the base model as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best AirPods deals available, including those on the AirPods AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. We’ll also include options for the AirPods model with the wireless charging case, if that’s something you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2RS0YX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;The AirPods are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. They usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted. Right now, for instance, you can find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods for $119 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747976896193620917#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with a wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one thing: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature, but, thankfully, chargers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-PowerWave-Upgraded-Fast-Charging/dp/B07THHQMHM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt; are now relatively cheap. If you have no use for wireless charging, however, we recommend opting for the base AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but be on the lookout for deals that bring the price down to $150 or below. Right now, you can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747977841356115870#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the models above, offer noise cancellation, and support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, a feature Apple recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rolled out to Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;. We think they’re the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ci8unb"&gt;Thankfully, the AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their asking price of $249, and sometimes drop to as low as $180. The lowest price you can grab a pair for right now is $197 at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D0%26%26adid%3D22222222227317608597%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D395477009936%26wl4%3Dpla-834433976587%26wl5%3D9061079%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D8175035%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D520468661%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwr56IBhAvEiwA1fuqGoJTvXd60Wil7w2NpRvHJQwNPXUkWno3r0nNI2Z3XwNpX4tSWE601RoCuScQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or for $200 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1122332/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro%2F-%2FA-54191101" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdTSzD"&gt;If you want to get an Apple Care Plus protection plan for your wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1570785-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is also selling a bundle that includes both for $239&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, wrapped in aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max have been discounted to under $450 in the past, there are currently few notable sales to speak of. You can, however, pick up a pair at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747975436149246309#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; right now for $50 off, their typical sale price.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EgrbgQ"&gt;A cell phone caught fire in the cabin of an Alaska Airlines flight that had landed in Seattle from New Orleans on Monday evening. The phone was a Samsung Galaxy A21, Perry Cooper, a spokesperson for the Port of Seattle, &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/flight-to-seattle-evacuated-after-passengers-cellphone-catches-fire/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exEGF5"&gt;“After much digging, I can tell you that the phone was burned beyond recognition,” Cooper said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/em&gt;. “However, during an interview with one of our Port of Seattle Police officers, the passenger volunteered the phone was a Samsung Galaxy A21. Again, we could not confirm it by looking at the remains of the device.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aic3fY"&gt;Samsung did not immediately reply to a request for comment from The Verge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYxQMY"&gt;An Alaska Airlines spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the plane’s crew used fire extinguishers and a battery containment bag to “stop the phone from smoking.” Passengers were evacuated from the plane via the evacuation slides “due to hazy conditions inside the cabin,” and two of were treated at a local hospital, the spokesperson said. A Twitter user who said they were on the flight described the cabin as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Madddzh/status/1430070384670347264"&gt;“like a smoke machine.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XvBAZT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;That’s me on my phone on the right. The passenger was 2-3 rows behind me on the opposite side. It was like a smoke machine. Flight attendants did an excellent job and all passengers were very calm. I believe one person sitting beside them might have minor injuries.&lt;/p&gt;— Maddy Harrison (@Madddzh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Madddzh/status/1430070384670347264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F8tRtd"&gt;Passengers were taken by bus to the terminal, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/flySEA/status/1430032802825658374"&gt;according to a tweet by Seattle-Tacoma International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, and two passengers were treated at a local hospital, the Alaska Airlines spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6HKcR"&gt;While the situation may bring to mind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12767670/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-fire-risk"&gt;Samsung’s recall of the Galaxy Note 7&lt;/a&gt; over fears of exploding batteries, it’s unclear if there’s any sort of common defect with any model of the A21 just yet. There have been many isolated incidents of phone batteries catching fire across many different brands. As for why those batteries can catch fire, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/8/12841342/why-do-phone-batteries-explode-samsung-galaxy-note-7"&gt;here’s our explainer about why that happens&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FAA grants could clean up airport emissions </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Coronavirus Pandemic Causes Climate Of Anxiety And Changing Routines In America" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/72GPQJs7TAIymG3LQ8GHyV2A_PY=/0x0:5172x3448/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69771272/1220188719.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Airplanes sit on the tarmac at Charlotte Douglas International Airport with the city skyline in the background on April 21, 2020 in Charlotte, North Carolina.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Streeter Lecka/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yv66Nv"&gt;The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is giving out more than $35 million in grants so that airports in the US can cut down their pollution, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=26463"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; today. Gas-burning vehicles that shuttle travelers and their luggage around airports and other on-the-ground equipment create emissions that worsen air quality and add to the climate crisis. Electrifying those operations could make travel at least a little more sustainable &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/faa-grants-airports-zero-emissions-c6dfadca-3257-448e-8612-4e8987503fc7.html"&gt;while the technology to clean up planes’ pollution is still nascent&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kXb20s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;$5.9 million will go towards “zero-emission” vehicles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="67gril"&gt;$5.9 million will go towards “zero-emission” vehicles and charging infrastructure. Charlotte/Douglas International Airport in North Carolina will get the biggest chunk of that change: $3.9 million for five electric shuttle buses. Three other airports in California, Indiana, and Ohio will also get new electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUDtMU"&gt;$14.5 million is earmarked for electric ramp equipment that services planes between flights and for systems that keep planes cool and provide power to them when their engines aren’t running. Pittsburgh International Airport, for example, will receive $4.6 million for 18 new units that pump temperature-controlled air into planes when their air conditioning systems are turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snP1AI"&gt;Louisville, Kentucky’s Muhammad Ali International Airport will receive a &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=26462"&gt;$10.6 million grant&lt;/a&gt; for a new geothermal system to heat and cool its terminal building. That system will replace gas-fired boilers, and slash pollution like soot, smog, and carbon monoxide, according to the FAA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNNfLw"&gt;The Biden administration has set a broader goal of making the nation’s power sector carbon-free by 2035. Meeting that goal will be key to gutting climate pollution in the US, which has the second-highest emissions in the world. It will be especially important as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22600226/bipartisan-infrastructure-plan-ev-charging-climate-change"&gt;transportation industry turns to electric vehicles to slash emissions&lt;/a&gt;, both at airports, and on the roads. Biden announced this month that he wants half of new cars sold in the US to be either &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22610501/biden-2030-ev-goal-trump-emissions-rollback"&gt;hybrid or all-electric by 2030&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="0C3G0D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even more cash could flow into airports soon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NVieva"&gt;Some of the FAA’s funding comes from the $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed in March. Even more cash could flow into airports soon. The bipartisan infrastructure package making its way through Congress includes $25 billion over five years for the nation’s air infrastructure. That bill is supposed to help airports take care of repair and maintenance backlogs and introduce new technology to cut pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0XWtN"&gt;Separately, the FAA also announced today that it set aside more than &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=26462"&gt;$22 million in grants&lt;/a&gt; that are supposed to make airports more accessible for people with disabilities. Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina plans to spend $16.4 million to expand its terminal with more gate seating, retail and restaurant space, and TSA screening areas that are ADA accessible. Fort Wayne International Airport will receive $6.1 million to expand its terminal and buy “hearing loop” technology that sends gate announcements straight to compatible hearing aid devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0xWtt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Conservative pranksters face $5 million proposed fine over robocalls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="robocall" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TDOjCvEp1nHKk9zmVfC_5bSsme0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69771062/DSCF2964.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JVzlyo"&gt;On Tuesday, the Federal Communications Commission proposed &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-375180A1.pdf"&gt;an over $5 million fine&lt;/a&gt; against conspiracy theorists and conservative activists John Burkman and Jacob Wohl for making hundreds of robocalls spreading 2020 election misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GP5nh"&gt;In its proposal, the FCC said that the agency is weighing a $5,134,500 fine against Burkman and Wohl for making over 1,100 robocalls in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA. The violating pre-recorded calls told voters that their personal information would be “part of a public database” that would be used by “police departments to track down old warrants and be used by credit card companies to collect outstanding debts” if they chose to vote by mail in the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bOZbX"&gt;It’s the largest TCPA fine the FCC has ever proposed, according to a press release from the agency Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bLlB0"&gt;Last October, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497823/jacob-wohl-jack-burkman-michigan-robocall-voter-intimidation-felony-charges"&gt;filed four felony charges&lt;/a&gt; against Burkman and Wohl, accusing the pair of discouraging Detroit residents from voting in the 2020 election. Specifically, the case accuses them of targeting voters in Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Illinois in around 85,000 calls last August. According to the Michigan Attorney General’s Office, the calls claimed to come from “Project 1599, a civil rights organization” founded by the pair and targeted areas with large populations of Black voters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCZvXd"&gt;“We remain committed to defending democracy against misinformation spread in an attempt to undermine our free and fair elections,” Nessel said in a statement earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3p4l7"&gt;A trial date &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/ag/0,4534,7-359-92297_47203-558712%E2%80%94,00.html"&gt;has not been set&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s OLED TV from my dreams reportedly delayed to 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vWJ1UQYTEcPA7RPZr9BxDJInNmw=/22x0:1030x672/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69770987/LG_Dolby_Vision_Gaming_02a.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XfIZuU"&gt;At CES 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224137/lg-display-42-inch-oled-tv-panel-announced"&gt;LG Display announced&lt;/a&gt; that it intended to produce a 42-inch OLED TV panel sometime in 2021. You weren’t alone if, like me, you got really excited, and also expected one of these more compact OLED panels to have already launched. That’s not happening this year, according to sources speaking to &lt;a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202108190017"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Korea Economic Daily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who say that the launch of LG’s planned 42-inch OLED TV has been pushed to 2022 instead, alongside the new 2022 TV lineup and debut at CES 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9AynW"&gt;The delay doesn’t seem to have been caused by issues with production, according to &lt;em&gt;The Korea Economic Daily. &lt;/em&gt;While its sources expected LG to launch the 42-inch in the second half of 2021 following mass production of the panels, they say the company switched the launch window to “maximize its marketing efforts rather than unveiling it later this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JVX2IBv3-2yRgRvXj0fJql5rzBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227031/44900793067647000_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;LG Display&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’d probably pose like this with an OLED if I owned one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z4WtQr"&gt;Compared to LG’s entry-level A1-series OLED TVs that have 60Hz displays, LG is apparently angling this new 42-inch model to fit in with its other high-end OLED TVs, like the OLED G1 evo and C1 lineups, despite its smaller size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYNtdq"&gt;If all of this pans out, it’ll ideally have a 120Hz refresh rate display with multiple HDMI 2.1 ports that allow 120 frames per second 4K gameplay (in games that support it) on PC, PS5, or Xbox Series X. It should also support variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low-latency mode, which are features that can make gaming look and feel smoother and more enjoyable. Though, with specs like that, I wouldn’t expect this to be a particularly affordable TV. The current 48-inch C1 was originally priced at $1,499.99 (but can currently be purchased for $1,299.99), so this smaller one will hopefully cost a little less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvXNZq"&gt;At 42 inches, this OLED panel isn’t going after the average TV viewer. This size straddles the line between TV and gaming monitor, and it seems ideal for gamers with desk space — and disposable income — to spare. There are plenty of big gaming monitor options north of $700 that offer competitive specs like HDMI 2.1 ports and VRR, but none that have a panel that can compete with the rich contrast, color accuracy, and brightness of an OLED. Well, except for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382201/gigabyte-aorus-4k-gaming-monitor-tv-oled"&gt;Gigabyte’s $1,500 Aorus FO48U gaming monitor&lt;/a&gt;. Okay, &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/b52e629c-c63e-4d6b-877d-6dff584c7863"&gt;the $2,500 curved Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is rad&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nRTH9t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to LG for confirmation of this alleged delay, and whether it can confirm if the TV will appear at CES 2022 next year.&lt;/p&gt;
