    <title>VR success I Expect You to Die is getting a sequel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="I Expect You To Die 2 logo over a gameplay image" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/knTLm7BqE0l4FJHhb8yV7ecz8h4=/200x0:1280x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729280/I_Expect_You_To_Die_2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YZeJSd"&gt;Schell Games is making a sequel to its massively successful virtual reality game &lt;em&gt;I Expect You to Die&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s expected to come out later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jtKWod"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.schellgames.com/blog/ieytd2-announcement/"&gt;Along with the announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the studio mentioned the original game earned $6 million in revenue across all VR platforms, which could explain how it can afford to make a sequel. It isn’t yet clear which VR platforms the next game will come to, but it &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1499120/I_Expect_You_To_Die_2/"&gt;will at least arrive on Steam&lt;/a&gt;, which indicates support for Vive, Index, and Windows Mixed Reality headsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Urb4EP"&gt;The original was more or less a spy-themed escape room in VR, and the second one looks like it’ll be more of the same, which isn’t necessarily unwelcome in a world where real-life escape rooms aren’t really accessible during a pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TlD7TB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Welcome back, Agents.&lt;br&gt;Ready to get back to work?&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IExpectYouToDie2?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#IExpectYouToDie2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/IYifJ4RzTK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/IYifJ4RzTK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— I Expect You To Die (@ieytd) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ieytd/status/1354462149712736260?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wb5ZfT"&gt;So far, most of the early era VR games people would recognize haven’t gotten follow-ups, and that’s doubly true for ones made by indie studios. While &lt;em&gt;Lone Echo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/lone-echo-2-release-date-further-delayed/"&gt;has a sequel in the works&lt;/a&gt;, the studio behind it &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/facebook-acquires-vr-studio-behind-lone-echo/"&gt;was bought by Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and is now a part of Oculus Studios. Similarly, &lt;em&gt;Job Simulator&lt;/em&gt;’s sequel (&lt;em&gt;Vacation Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, of course), was made after &lt;a href="https://owlchemylabs.com/owlchemy-labs-and-google-join-forces/"&gt;the studio behind it was purchased by Google&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q94OII"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Superhot&lt;/em&gt; was super fun when it came to VR, but its sequel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318812/superhot-mind-control-delete-expansion-free-all-owners-first-game"&gt;doesn’t yet support VR play&lt;/a&gt;. I could go on, making a list of VR games that haven’t gotten sequels like &lt;em&gt;Arizona Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Boneworks&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt; (not that it needs one), but you get the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvokBe"&gt;Hopefully, this sequel announcement speaks to the fact that VR is coming out of a slump. It had a pretty successful 2020, with the release of &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx &lt;/em&gt;and the Oculus Quest 2, but one year of success doesn’t necessarily indicate a trend. As with all things, content is king, and VR will need to keep having killer releases to gain market share. Obviously, it’s not all on&lt;em&gt; I Expect You to Die 2&lt;/em&gt;’s shoulders, but if it can replicate the success of the original, it could indicate that the VR market is getting back on its feet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This a cappella group is scarily good at imitating Windows sound effects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZKrrxnax9c_5nVJOD8wNc2sxxE=/278x0:1634x904/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729240/windows.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZKeTWR"&gt;If you’ve ever used Windows 10 before, I need you to stop what you’re doing and go listen to this a cappella group’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AZB64VBJfA&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;terrifyingly accurate&lt;/a&gt; covers of Windows sound effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqCCBn"&gt;No Windows noises were spared here. The compilation includes the Windows Vista startup theme (remember that?), the recycle bin crunch, the Windows XP shutdown tones, and more. But the two segments that are unbelievably spot-on are the “USB In” and “USB Out” noises, which come about 10 seconds in. If I closed my eyes, you could convince me they were the real deal. Also, the error message straight-up stresses me out. It’s haunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2Dyhn"&gt;But don’t take my word for it — give the video a watch yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Pf9QPI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4AZB64VBJfA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kGuLD3"&gt;The group behind this video is a Korean band called Maytree. They’ve got a number of other cover videos up on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/maytree_music/?hl=en"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, including an excellent rendition of Ariana Grande’s “Positions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHxtjH"&gt;I use Windows 10 every day and experience some of these sound effects constantly — they’ve grown so commonplace that they don’t register when I hear them. When I saw the title of this video, the cynic in me thought “Windows 10 sound effects? Really? Of all the things to cover?” But videos like this are a funny reminder that these operating systems are auditory experiences, too. And there’s a level of intricacy to even the most basic sound effects that’s hugely impressive for a group of human voices to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram made a richer story interface for desktops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iAs4S8_H6C9Nqv3TGcCupkqRJRw=/0x0:2720x1813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729073/instagramstories.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XYE6Th"&gt;Instagram is making its Stories feature more complete on the desktop. In a small interface refresh today, the company is updating its Stories feature so that it opens up to show a carousel of videos, which previews what’s cued up next and the content that just played. From this interface, viewers can click on whatever story they want to watch. It’s sort of like if the tiny circles at the top of users’ feeds went bigger and full-screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEKIzz"&gt;This is a minor change, but it rounds out the desktop feature and makes it more appealing to use, especially as people are on their computers more frequently while working from home. For the most part, Instagram has left Stories unchanged for years. The format is the same as always, with posts being ephemeral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fzxaf"&gt;Most of Instagram’s changes to the format come in the form of creative tools, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222038/instagram-small-business-sticker-stories-gift-cards-delivery"&gt;stickers for small businesses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1290347300439486464"&gt;new fonts&lt;/a&gt;. For now, Instagram’s firmly focusing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;on Reels&lt;/a&gt;, its TikTok competitor, with Stories receiving small updates to keep it fresh. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy S21 review: nice for the price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The processor is updated. The rest? Not so much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="kH6i08"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21 is a midrange phone with a flagship name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9QQQa"&gt;Rather than offer essentially the same top-tier phone at different sizes, Samsung has chosen to get aggressive on price this year. The Galaxy S21 starts at $799.99 for the smaller version with a 6.2-inch screen and $999.99 for the Plus version with a 6.7-inch display. Though in both cases, the smart move is to spend an extra $50 for the models with 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84zXoV"&gt;It helps that the S21 happens to be a very good midrange phone. Nevertheless, Samsung’s choices this year mean if you want to get the very best phone Samsung has to offer right now, you have to buy the very &lt;em&gt;biggest&lt;/em&gt; phone, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="em9jN5"&gt;If the Ultra is too big or too expensive for your needs, there’s nothing wrong with the regular Galaxy S21. Samsung has managed to cut the price without major sacrifices in either the experience or the features of this phone. However, avoiding massive failure isn’t necessarily the same thing as achieving great success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x6MAv8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10305775"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy S21" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZyXbMNC2UhUwsWa7wUsSa3j4ymE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258903/vpavic_210118_4378_0213.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="U6duVZ"&gt;The phones that aim to give you the best of everything tend to cost more than a thousand dollars. Below that, there are more noticeable trade-offs as each phone picks its priority. For the Galaxy S21, Samsung put its big bet behind just one part: the processor, Qualcomm’s high-end Snapdragon 888.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQcPkZ"&gt;In some markets outside the US, Samsung is using its own Exynos processor, and though I’ve heard Samsung has significantly improved it over last year’s, I haven’t been able to test it myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9duJp"&gt;On a basic level, prioritizing the processor means the S21 is a very fast phone with decent battery life. I am able to get through a full day with moderate to heavy use on the 4,000mAh battery, though with a little effort, I can drain it down. The bigger Galaxy S21 Plus — which I haven’t tested — has a 4,800mAh battery and presumably will last even longer despite its slightly larger screen. Both share the same resolution and features otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CArd0o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung prioritized putting in a fast new processor above all else&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8BaaoF"&gt;Just as importantly, the choice to go with the newest and best Qualcomm processor means the Galaxy S21 has a better chance of lasting you three or more years before the inevitable march of Android software bogs it down or leaves it behind. I’ve asked Samsung how many years of software updates it will guarantee for S21 users and will update this review if I hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hci2fC"&gt;The Snapdragon 888 also means these phones support both kinds of 5G in the US. In my testing in the Bay Area, I still find that 5G often isn’t notably faster than LTE, and the mmWave version of 5G is still very difficult to find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KC4Rgl"&gt;However, I can also see some improvements over last year. My take on 5G has therefore shifted a bit. I still think that you should not upgrade your phone just to get 5G. However, if you’re due for an upgrade &lt;em&gt;anyway&lt;/em&gt; and you have the choice of getting a 5G phone, you probably should. The networks aren’t good enough yet, but if you’re keeping your phone for a while, you may regret not having it in the years to come. (It’ll be hard to buy a phone without 5G if you’re spending over $500 this year, anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S21’s metal side rails curve into the camera bump" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A6m15bRQ0zZPq-LpOuRYucVqEJE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258912/vpavic_210118_4378_0178.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21’s metal side rails curve into the camera bump.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="FYZdAW"&gt;To go along with the priority you can’t see, Samsung’s other big change is the thing you can: the design. As with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, the regular Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus have metal rails that flow into the camera bump on the back. It looks as good here as it does on the Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ri1l39"&gt;However, Samsung went a step further on the smaller S21 by swapping out the usual rear glass panel with plastic (the Plus model still uses glass). It’s not a problem for me at all — in fact, in some ways, I prefer it as it’s one less thing that is able to shatter in a fall. It’s a way to cut costs, but one that makes me wonder whether I really want glass on the back of my phone in the first place. It feels great, with a matte finish and none of the cheap or flimsy associations plastic can bring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S21’s screen is only 1080p, but it’s flat and looks great" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FuVCp4MuSJ0RkXiPvwGD4OYIVlQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258907/vpavic_210118_4378_0197.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21’s screen is only 1080p, but it’s flat and looks great.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The back of the base model is plastic, but it feels good." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E6VFHY1LDByk6XWrM61fGMp0iMU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258895/vpavic_210119_4378_0238.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The back of the base model is plastic, but it feels good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are three cameras on the back of the S21" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nHnAtkSkPbgdAwQ2MqqUqDLYrF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258897/vpavic_210119_4378_0231.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are three cameras on the back of the S21.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rKrLXB"&gt;While we’re on the subject, here are some of the other ways Samsung has cut costs on the S21 compared to last year’s Galaxy S20. It lacks MST, Samsung’s tech for paying at credit card terminals that can’t read NFC. There is no microSD card slot for expanding the storage, which stings a bit as Samsung was a bit of a holdout in keeping the microSD card around in its flagships until recently. Samsung also saved costs by standing pat with the cameras — they’re virtually unchanged from last year. (More on the cameras below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAqGCX"&gt;The S21 also drops the screen resolution down from last year’s 1440p panel to 1080p on both the regular and Plus versions. They’re flat, too, which many people prefer to curved edges. I don’t mind curved screens so long as they fit with the ergonomics of the phone, but here, I think Samsung made the right call to go flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rp1mQ5"&gt;The screen has an adaptive refresh rate that can run at up to 120Hz, so scrolling and animations are very smooth. Unlike the Ultra’s more advanced screen technology, this screen’s refresh rate bottoms out at 48Hz, and it also uses more traditional OLED tech instead of the newer LTPO version in the Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jan4WZ"&gt;To those screen spec downgrades, I say this: whatever. Samsung is consistently great at making screens, and even though the S21 doesn’t showcase the company at its best, it’s still a great display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3BVXO"&gt;But more than any other upgrade or downgrade this year, the spec that had the most tangible effect on my experience with the S21 was the new fingerprint sensor under the screen. It can read from a larger area, and to me, it feels faster than last year’s sensor did. For as often as we unlock our phones, even milliseconds make a difference in how responsive the phone feels. Also: it works with masks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S21’s camera hardware is essentially unchanged from last year" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ldH3g-82fT_EWqT4iskr_P52nFo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258892/vpavic_210122_4378_0249.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21’s camera hardware is essentially unchanged from last year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Zphw1m"&gt;The only substantive difference between the camera systems on last year’s Galaxy S20 and this year’s Galaxy S21 isn’t in the hardware, but the software. Samsung has done some work to update its processing to improve photos in certain situations. I’ve noticed a small jump in low-light quality, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iesJXT"&gt;But outside a minor sensor swap on the ultrawide, the camera hardware is unchanged. The main sensor is 12 megapixels with OIS, the ultrawide is also 12 megapixels and has a 120-degree field of view, and the telephoto has a 3x optical zoom and does crop tricks with its 30-megapixel sensor to offer digital zoom up to 30X. The selfie camera is 10 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWFqPT"&gt;In the US, I think the most direct camera competitor in this price range is probably the $699 Google Pixel 5. Much to my surprise, the consensus among reviewers at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is that the Galaxy S21 takes better photos overall. I agree. The Pixel’s long-standing camera advantage has all but dissipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IE4UjG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10305812"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pXtk4E"&gt;Now, I still prefer the Pixel’s aesthetics to Samsung’s. The Pixel keeps its contrast-y, bluer look compared to Samsung’s tendency to over-brighten and oversaturate everything. However, on a technical level, the Galaxy S21 just does a better job. There’s less noise in shadows and low light, more detail in decent light, and much better zoom performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbSmBB"&gt;Don’t think the regular Galaxy S21 stands up to the superior telephoto images you can get from the Ultra, which has a 10X optical lens. But at zoom levels from 3X to the Pixel’s maximum of 7X, the S21 simply does a better job than Google’s algorithms. Samsung also wins on video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Szqb2E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10305816"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9yGvL4"&gt;There is the usual array of new camera features, many of which I think most users can ignore. Shooting 8K video doesn’t make much sense on a camera of this caliber, but you can do it. I do appreciate Samsung’s Pro modes for both video and photos, though. In situations where you’re able to spend a little time composing your shot and adjusting the camera settings, you can get something much more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlgR6d"&gt;Samsung has also made it possible to turn off face smoothing completely. It makes for better images, but more importantly, it might also help &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497587/google-pixel-phone-selfie-beauty-filter-retouching-camera"&gt;make for a better self-image&lt;/a&gt; for some people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung’s One UI software on the Galaxy S21" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_fzsUmpelPMwTxNytg_CUH6t3GI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258901/vpavic_210119_4378_0228.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s One UI software on the Galaxy S21.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="X9ND6z"&gt;As I noted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;in my review of the Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung is heading in the wrong direction with its software. It’s a shame because the fundamentals of Samsung’s version of Android, One UI, are still great. It makes Android feel a little cleaner and brighter and gives it key features to help manage gigantic screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Iz3Go"&gt;But instead of building on that strength, Samsung is bogging it down. There are too many arcane settings and too many nearly meaningless icons in the quick settings panel. In the US, S21 users will have to be savvy enough to know to download and use Android Messages instead of Samsung Messages if they want unfettered, unbroken access to RCS messaging (most of the rest of the world gets Android Messages by default). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q0JNaz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One UI still has the right fundamentals but is heading in the wrong direction&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ziztFW"&gt;Also, Samsung’s digital assistant, Bixby, is only worth using if you’ve connected the rest of your digital life to Samsung’s ecosystem. I suspect most in the US have not, and so the whole thing just seems redundant next to Google Assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxUqcd"&gt;Most egregiously of all, Samsung’s default apps often have ads at the top. Tapping the gigantic weather widget at the top of the default home screen reveals an ad in Samsung’s weather app. I don’t know what tiny marginal profit Samsung makes from these ads, but I don’t think the hit to its reputation is worth it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5xTyl"&gt;All of these hassles with Samsung’s software can either be avoided or undone by a knowledgeable user. And in general, I think most users will find their way to that knowledge — but that doesn’t mean it isn’t a hassle in the first place. I can be more productive on a well-configured Samsung phone than on virtually any other phone, but it shouldn’t require this much configuration and ad-dodging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy S21" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CuDtdwJTwbMBxwvpw_1cGz7AwFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258914/vpavic_210118_4378_0170.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="t8u2Le"&gt;Add up all of the choices and components in the Galaxy S21, and you can’t avoid the conclusion that it is a rehashed Galaxy S20 with a faster processor and a nicer exterior. That’s a fairly dour way of looking at it, but it is the truth, and I don’t think it should damn the phone. Sometimes the year-over-year updates are minor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eSqdNI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung brought the price down, but you should wait for carriers to discount it even further&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qF1o2d"&gt;That minor update means there’s little reason to rush out to buy the Galaxy S21. It’s a phone to get when you need to replace your old and busted phone, and if your phone is more than a couple of years old, it’ll make a huge difference. There’s another reason not to rush out to get the S21: Samsung’s phones are famous for getting deep discounts from carriers. I wouldn’t go so far as to say it would be a mistake to pay full price for an S21, but I would say you should look — or even wait — for a deal if you can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0MnS8u"&gt;The most interesting choice Samsung made this year is instead of making a lower-cost “Fan Edition” of its flagship phone, it just made that flagship the lower-cost version. That’s a reasonable choice for Samsung to make, but it also means that you as a consumer have one less choice. Once again, if you want Samsung’s very best phone this year, you’re going to have to buy Samsung’s biggest phone — and this year, the differences are even more stark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="iFdWeP"&gt;But if you’re not interested in the latest, greatest, and biggest, and you don’t mind the way Samsung handles Android, the Galaxy S21 is a fine choice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bridgerton is Netflix’s biggest show ever, but here are the caveats</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ACaY8ui3-roimcvFzYN_pm66BQY=/0x3:3600x2403/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729029/BRIDGERTON_108_Unit_01959R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mOfOr0"&gt;Netflix has a new worldwide mega-hit on its hands with the Regency-era British drama &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;, which the streaming service says is its &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/bridgerton-biggest-series-ever"&gt;biggest show ever&lt;/a&gt; with more than 82 million households tuning in to at least one partial episode in its first 28 days. It beats out the previous record-holder &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075927/netflix-the-witcher-viewer-numbers-length-metrics-q4-2019-earnings"&gt;watched by 76 million households&lt;/a&gt; when its first season debuted back in December 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5q1No8"&gt;Now, there are a few caveats to point out here. Netflix, which has always been guarded about publicly releasing metrics, counts a household as one account, including multiple profiles. And Netflix also classifies a watch as one profile on an account playing at least two minutes of one episode. So it’s likely not every single one of the accounts made it through the entire first season of &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; or even an entire episode. Netflix also had fewer total subscribers when &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; launched, making that show’s record more impressive at the time considering it represents a larger chunk of the subscriber base. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="U4UMby"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Bridgerton’ is still by all accounts a massive success for Netflix&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eldLEc"&gt;Still, &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton &lt;/em&gt;is a wildly successful new series for Netflix, considering more than 40 percent of the platform’s nearly 200 million subscribers opted to give it a shot. The show, adapted from Julia Quinn’s &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton &lt;/em&gt;series of historical romance novels, also hit number one in 83 countries around the world, a strong testament to the new hit’s international pull and our collective and seemingly insatiable appetite for British period dramas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCgCMd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridgerton &lt;/em&gt;joins a fast-growing collection of explosively popular Netflix series that have released in the last year while the entertainment history has struggled during the coronavirus pandemic. That includes chess drama &lt;em&gt;The Queen’s Gambit&lt;/em&gt; and French thriller &lt;em&gt;Lupin&lt;/em&gt;, both of which were watched by more than 62 million and 70 million households, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZGqsA"&gt;The show, produced by hit-making showrunner Shonda Rhimes and created by Rhimes’ longtime &lt;em&gt;Grey’s Anatomy &lt;/em&gt;collaborator Chris Van Dusen, has &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/bridgerton-netflix-shonda-rhimes-exciting-news-1234671229/"&gt;already been renewed for a second season&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4ERZM"&gt;“I think the show really provides an incredible escape for audiences at a time where that’s exactly what’s needed,” Van Dusen said of the show’s popularity after its second season renewal, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/bridgerton-netflix-viewership-record-biggest-series-ever-1234681242/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “&lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; is this lavish, vibrant, steamy Regency love story; it is about romance, love and joy; I think all of those things are really universal themes people are responding to.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook continue bans over Trump election claims</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rudy Giuliani Appears Before Michigan State Legislature’s House Oversight Committee" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rlwwU6If9vdHYbzird41Yxc3TMY=/0x81:5077x3466/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68728985/1229918044.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Rey Del Rio/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q6ZCT0"&gt;Election misinformation continues to be a problem on YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook even after all three companies took the unprecedented action to ban or suspend former US President Donald Trump. Now that President Biden is in office, those same platforms have kept pressure on, sustaining the bans and issuing new ones to Trump’s associates and allies. Here are some steps these platforms have taken in the last week to continue to stamp out election misinformation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GAkKzM"&gt;YouTube&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EunamZ"&gt;On January 26th, Rudy Giuliani joined Trump in a slightly less restrictive form of YouTube purgatory. Because the former mayor continued to parrot the same false claims about the “stolen” election, he’s been suspended as a YouTube Partner, cutting him off from partnership ad revenue, subscriptions, and donations. Giuliani can still upload videos as a non-Partner (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573937/youtube-ads-creators-partner-program-revenue-terms-of-service-update"&gt;YouTube can even monetize them&lt;/a&gt;), but he’ll have to wait 30 days before he can reapply, and even then he won’t be approved unless he “resolves the reason for his suspension,” &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/youtube-temporarily-suspends-rudy-giuliani-from-partner-program?utm_content=business&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. Giuliani has a smaller audience than Trump, but disincentivizing his role as a proxy for the former president and a spreader of misinformation is a good idea. Giuliani hasn’t uploaded a new video in three weeks, which is frankly poor form for an aspiring content creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFeJW4"&gt;That same day YouTube also decided to extend the suspension of Trump’s accounts, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/youtube-extends-trumps-suspension-for-a-second-time/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. That was the second extension after &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/19/youtube-extends-trump-suspension-for-another-week.html"&gt;the company’s previous extension on the 19th&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube is continuing to take the fallout from the election week by week after a flurry of action during the week of the Capitol building riot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g2n8mz"&gt;Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5tH51q"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;permanently banned Trump&lt;/a&gt; from using his &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump"&gt;@realDonaldTrump&lt;/a&gt; account on January 8th, days after the Capitol riot, and now the company is turning its attention to other sources of election misinformation close to the former president. Mike Lindell, the CEO of MyPillow, was banned from Twitter on Monday, &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/26/business/mypillow-ceo-mike-lindell-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;according to CNN&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter cited Lindell’s violation of its civic integrity policy for the move, which Lindell’s own public comments on the validity of the election and the attack on the Capitol might have violated. Lindell is a Republican donor and pillow mogul whose past comments about the Capitol riot being organized by “leftists groups and antifa” may have also gotten &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/19/business/mypillow-bed-bath-and-beyond-sales/index.html"&gt;his products dropped from Bed, Bath and Beyond&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FgaqXm"&gt;Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QEIabe"&gt;Finally, Facebook is still keeping Trump under an indefinite ban from posting on his Facebook page or Instagram account, but the company has announced that it would like its newly formed Oversight Board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242616/facebook-refers-decision-suspend-trump-oversight-board"&gt;to review the decision&lt;/a&gt;. Making a decision on the ban will be the board’s first major case, but because of the structure and role of the board, the responsibility would still fall to Facebook on whether the ban stays in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZOT1K"&gt;With every major platform keeping the doors closed on Trump and his associates, the former president is in an interesting position. His next steps as a private citizen are unknown, but being a public figure who thrives financially off reaching an audience, without a way to do so, could prove difficult. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22241390/trump-twitter-facebook-ban-deplatform-alex-jones-milo"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;, lots of previous right-wing media figures have suffered without access to platforms for driving attention. And alternative social media sites have either been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;hobbled, like Parler&lt;/a&gt;, or just don’t have the same reach (yet) as their mainstream counterparts, like &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/12/rumble-youtube-trump-conspiracy-theories.html"&gt;video site Rumble&lt;/a&gt;. There’s every possibility that could change or encrypted messaging platforms like Telegram and Signal could somehow become the new way to reach far-right true believers, but for now the game of bans and suspensions continues.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hitman 3 has perfected the art of turning bumbling players into master assassins </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iYD5gPMaGPZRuD0od6azaeHKQ_0=/290x0:1910x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68728847/Chongqing_Location.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: IO Interactive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The most accessible, cohesive Hitman game to date&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="HYGVyN"&gt;To the casual onlooker, the &lt;em&gt;Hitman &lt;/em&gt;series appears to be about embodying a master assassin, one who can assume a disguise with ease and dispatch a target using virtually any object in the room. A hairless John Wick, if you will — if John Wick ever used a silenced pistol and actually took the time to stuff his victims’ bodies into conveniently located and inexplicably empty storage closets. But that isn’t actually what the &lt;em&gt;Hitman &lt;/em&gt;games are about, at least not anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQP5lm"&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Hitman &lt;/em&gt;games, starting with developer IO Interactive’s episodic 2016 reboot and culminating with the third and final game in the “World of Assassin” trilogy, are about accessibility. Specifically, they’re about teaching a terrible assassin to become a better one, and eventually a legendary killer. This is a series with a complexity curve that starts out small and steady and eventually ends up at the rooftop of the world’s largest skyscraper, one you might conveniently nudge someone off if you were trying to complete the new Dubai level’s “accidental kill” challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuC12g"&gt;The most demanding tasks in &lt;em&gt;Hitman &lt;/em&gt;ask that you never be seen, that no body ever be found, and that you never don a disguise. You must become a ghost. But the beauty of the reboot trilogy is that IOI has meticulously crafted ways to teach even the most bumbling, haphazard players how to become Agent 47 in mind and body, so they can attempt those veteran-level challenges at their own leisure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TE4ztayY5HkGf_xhrrHcIBNB8sw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22263301/play_your_way.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: IO Interactive&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QUDdVb"&gt;This is because &lt;em&gt;Hitman &lt;/em&gt;games don’t focus on glorifying grisly murder sprees — for games ostensibly about killing people, they feature surprisingly little blood and almost no opportunity for sadism. Instead, they’re puzzle-solving exercises that invite players to master gameplay systems — planned paths and cause-and-effect mechanisms — and then exploit them. You’re effectively working against the game designers to undermine the carefully crafted sandboxes they’ve built to find all the most efficient and expedient ways to achieve in-game goals, no matter how many times you have to reload a save or flick a coin to make a security guard look the other way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iaa4KZ"&gt;The designers have built the games with this rough experimentation in mind, and they’re eager to hold your hand through the process until the moment you feel comfortable going your own way and perhaps even surprising them with feats they never anticipated. I was pleased, but not surprised, to learn that a level I spent a dozen hours mastering earlier this week was just completed &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/speedrunners-are-beating-hitman-3s-dubai-level-in-under-1846121772"&gt;in less than 10 seconds by a speed runner&lt;/a&gt;, one who no doubt spent more time than I to achieve that level of mastery and knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XodjFm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt; has essentially perfected this new player-friendly formula, building off the last two games’ sometimes meandering and experimental approaches. &lt;em&gt;Hitman 1 &lt;/em&gt;was episodic, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/7/11614044/hitman-2016-perfect-episodic-video-game"&gt;I liked&lt;/a&gt;, but many longtime fans didn’t because it stretched out the game’s missions into a slow drip feed over many months. &lt;em&gt;Hitman 2&lt;/em&gt; improved on the design of the prior installment, and IOI released all the levels at once to satisfy the diehard fans’ desire to play at their own pace. But it still harbored the disjointed tone of its predecessor, seeming more like an extra-large expansion rather than a full-fledged sequel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ACSL3o"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10305820"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7MDWZO"&gt;This third and final iteration in the reboot series, perhaps the last &lt;em&gt;Hitman &lt;/em&gt;we get for a long while now that IOI is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575090/james-bond-game-origin-io-interactive-007-project-hitman"&gt;fittingly tackling a new James Bond game&lt;/a&gt;, feels like the most cohesive and balanced in the series. It marries the narrative meat of &lt;em&gt;Hitman: Absolution —&lt;/em&gt; the rare &lt;em&gt;Hitman &lt;/em&gt;game with an engrossing story — with the freedom and replayability of &lt;em&gt;Blood Money&lt;/em&gt;, the entry most veteran &lt;em&gt;Hitman &lt;/em&gt;players reminiscent about the most. It feels like a proper and fitting conclusion for Agent 47. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHHce0"&gt;IOI has retained the same core structure as the previous two games. There are still six levels, some more expansive and complex than others, but pretty much all of which are large and overwhelming — at least at first. And every mission features a familiar set of challenges, feats, discovery tasks, and other completionist checklist items that can keep you busy on a single level for well over 10 hours of play time. You’ll still find yourself treading some familiar territory; I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve sprinkled emetic rat poison in a cocktail to earn some quality alone time with a target in the toilet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5rPQ5R"&gt;The game also retains IOI’s excellent mission stories feature, which uses waypoints to turn a destination’s more complex assassination arcs into easy-to-follow in-game guides. These act as helpful primers on the flow of a level from start to finish and the kinds of character interactions you can expect to exploit for more sophisticated kills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utbG6p"&gt;The mission stories often guide you through a level’s most unique assassinations, which is a nice gift to players who don’t like engaging in the aggressive, save scumming and trial-and-error obsessiveness those never-be-seen challenges require. There’s also a much-needed new shortcuts feature that lets you create quick pathways between a level’s more intricate areas to cut down on backtracking and repetition, which is another fantastic accessibility decision that helps encourage less seasoned players to try more challenging tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52WKbQ"&gt;One of the few notable departures in a game mostly centered on tight and welcome refinements is its surprisingly adept storytelling, more often an afterthought in &lt;em&gt;Hitman &lt;/em&gt;games. The stronger narrative helps give you a more defined purpose in your assassinations by tasking you with the final destruction of Providence, the New World Order-esque secret society you’ve been stalking since the first game, now with the help of your childhood friend and Providence archenemy Lucas Grey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfIiW4"&gt;The narrative is no longer loosely told through vague context clues and the occasional cutscene, which the past games stuffed in between missions and openly implored you to skip if you felt like it. Instead, it’s now front and center, with Grey a central character and temporary replacement for Agent 47’s longtime handler Diana Burnwood. There are also more story-driven starting points and mission story options that feel like proper canonical starts and ends to each level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGyIyQ"&gt;The general nuts and bolts of the gameplay haven’t drastically changed in &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt;, but there are quite a few clever touches that bode well for the direction I anticipate the studio is taking its new Bond game. For instance, you now have a spy camera, with which Grey can help you hack various environmental objects. There are also better hidden and more crafty secrets, like safe and keypad codes and computer terminals, that involve eavesdropping and clue hunting to make use of in a way that paints Agent 47 even more like an international super spy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7upH663-xaghd3shUwpKGxXauL8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22263467/H3_Preview_Intro.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: IO Interactive&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="thYYHr"&gt;An early favorite of mine involved eavesdropping on a pair of security guards who tell of an evacuation protocol involving sabotage-ripe parachutes, but which requires you swipe a special keycard in two distinct locations within a certain time frame. The only hint the game gives you that this is even possible is in an assassination challenge card. The rest is for you to figure out on your own using in-game clues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZchV1F"&gt;It’s those hidden gems in &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt; you uncover on your own that make all the bumbling in the dark and accidentally hilarious failures worth it, because it means you’re plumbing the deeper depths of a level’s machinery and really unlocking how it all fits together. Succeeding at something you thought impossible — dispatching an entire floor of security guards silently and without a trace, so that only your target wanders the halls unaware of their imminent fate — makes &lt;em&gt;Hitman &lt;/em&gt;such a memorable and darkly comedic experience, one that quite often revels in the absurdity of Hollywood espionage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="TrsW0e"&gt;Players invested in the fate of Agent 47, Grey, and Providence find the final few levels of &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt; really deliver on the story promises with some alarming twists and a satisfying conclusion. And those looking for the full ramp up from casual &lt;em&gt;Hitman &lt;/em&gt;playing to borderline speed runner have a whole lot to work with here. But what makes me more excited is knowing IOI has nailed its formula for helping players improve and understand why it is they like to play games like this and how to get better at them. I can’t wait to see how the spirit of Agent 47 lives on in what they create next. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can get Control and its next-gen upgrade for free on PS Plus next month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tupjwgxIm3oTL4lOafMNTDJNHWI=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68728745/controlscreenPC.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Control. | Image: Remedy Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tlWbJH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control: Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt;, which bundles the original game with all of its post-launch content, will be downloadable for free for PS Plus subscribers &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/01/27/destruction-allstars-control-ultimate-edition-and-concrete-genie-are-your-playstation-plus-games-for-february/"&gt;starting February 2nd&lt;/a&gt;. This free version of &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; arrives alongside the game’s next-gen update, which also hits digital storefronts on February 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mDtD1"&gt;The next-gen upgrade will include a 60fps performance mode and a 30fps performance mode with ray tracing. You can get a preview of what both of those modes should look like in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0EGW3Qoi8&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;this trailer&lt;/a&gt; from Remedy, which was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ControlRemedy/status/1339933440607547393"&gt;recorded on a PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fN0G2q"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2D0EGW3Qoi8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6yIHKR"&gt;There’s something you should know about the next-gen version of the game, though: only people who have &lt;em&gt;Control: Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt;, which was released on the PlayStation 4 (and PC and Xbox One) last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21377148/control-remedy-505-games-developer-next-gen-upgrade-ultimate-edition"&gt;can get the next-gen upgrade for free&lt;/a&gt;. Publisher 505 Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21364797/control-free-ps5-xbox-series-x-smart-delivery-digital-update-ultimate-edition"&gt;isn’t offering&lt;/a&gt; a free next-gen upgrade to people who own the original version of &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21377148/control-remedy-505-games-developer-next-gen-upgrade-ultimate-edition"&gt;has stuck to&lt;/a&gt; that decision despite some criticism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feeMda"&gt;All that means this free offer on PS Plus is even more of a good deal than it would normally be. If you only have the non-&lt;em&gt;Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;and you’re a PS Plus subscriber, you’ll soon have a way to check out the next-gen improvements to the game at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oiJQzY"&gt;The other free games in February’s PS Plus lineup are &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20909620/concrete-genie-review-ps4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concrete Genie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Control: Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concrete Genie&lt;/em&gt; will be available to download from February 2nd until March 1st. You’ll have a bit longer to grab &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars, &lt;/em&gt;which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534475/destruction-all-stars-ps5-launch-title-delayed-ps-plus-february-2021"&gt;originally set to launch&lt;/a&gt; with the PS5 on November 12th — it will be available from February 2nd until April 5th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ctg6U9v5jr9RrXkzgL82pqnQOXQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67735830/vpavic_4261_20201023_0084.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For the early adopters of next-gen hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cyuvuR"&gt;Just over two months after their release, the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world. While it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on a new console, those lucky enough to own one can enjoy something unprecedented in modern gaming history. For the first time, next-gen console owners can take their existing library — whether it’s physical, digital, or a mix of the two — and bring it to a next-gen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNh3ro"&gt;That gives consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play and what performance benefits are worthwhile enough to upgrade. And technologies like cross-platform play and now even cross-generation support will allow people to still play with their friends, even if they don’t upgrade to the latest gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uXjX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CveWHl"&gt;Yes, both consoles arrived within seven years of the last generation of console hardware. And while it’s likely within the first year of both consoles’ lifespan that many of the hottest titles may launch on last- and current-gen simultaneously, there’s still a good chunk of games that will be exclusive titles playable only a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79IWA"&gt;Besides 4K, the solid-state drives, and other spec changes, Microsoft and Sony have pledged to support close to every title in the existing console platforms’ libraries. Every Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One game currently playable on existing Xbox One hardware (minus Kinect games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326805/xbox-series-x-xbox-one-game-support-backward-compatible-feature-kinect"&gt;will be playable on the Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, while Sony is supporting a “vast majority” of PS4 games, totaling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan"&gt;more than 4,000 titles&lt;/a&gt;. With both consoles early into their lifespan, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;easy for many to return to older games&lt;/a&gt; to help fill the gap in between long wait periods for more titles to be added to each console’s library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwgnjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new consoles let you take a majority of your existing libraries with you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlnZM"&gt;This changes the calculus a bit with regard to buying a new console. No longer do you have to abandon what you were playing on your old device and start anew. And thanks to some genuinely consumer-friendly initiatives like Xbox Smart Delivery and similar upgrade programs, plenty of the games we own now or are planning to buy in the next couple of months will not only work on the new platforms, but in most cases, they’ll also come with free upgrades from the standard PS4 and Xbox One versions. Sony also introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a library of PS4 games available for free with its online subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmWX6y"&gt;That leaves us with one big issue: how do you know what new games are coming out for which platforms and when? There’s also the painstaking process of parsing whether a game company is giving out a free next-gen upgrade of a cross-gen title, charging a little extra, or releasing a next-gen-only game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsrpjD"&gt;2021 is packed full of new releases and full optimizations of cross-gen games that should further pad out what’s available to play on your new system of choice. We’ve compiled the list below to help you understand every game coming out during the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM3UJT"&gt;This excludes games without release dates that may have been previously announced — like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Fable &lt;/em&gt;reboot, for example — and any games that were released for either console in 2020, including launch titles. We’ve also chosen only to list release dates for games where the publisher has chosen a concrete date with both day and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hTe555"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9552771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQEqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 2020, 12:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that &lt;/em&gt;ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;em&gt; recently released an Xbox Series X enhancement update that will be available to new console owners on launch day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC6OMy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated &lt;/em&gt;Haven &lt;em&gt;would be a PS5-only release and that &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder &lt;em&gt;would be Xbox Series-only at launch. Those are incorrect; Haven is also coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox One and as part of Game Pass at launch, and &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is slated for PS5 mid-November. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPYdhq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add additional titles releasing in 2021 and update any games that may have been delayed into this year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yywDTp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n76LJk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s new desktop GPUs won’t work in AMD systems</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kM0Pkx8OPNI9cchAE87UlPKFq2o=/57x0:1992x1290/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68728505/intellogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z5mGRH"&gt;Intel launched its first Iris Xe desktop graphics cards yesterday, but you won’t see them appearing in AMD-powered systems. While Nvidia and AMD’s desktop GPUs typically work across a variety of Intel and AMD processors, Intel’s new desktop GPUs are a little more limited for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7a2tXb"&gt;“The Iris Xe discrete add-in card will be paired with 9th gen (Coffee Lake-S) and 10th gen (Comet Lake-S) Intel® Core™ desktop processors and Intel(R) B460, H410, B365, and H310C chipset-based motherboards and sold as part of pre-built systems,” says an Intel spokesperson in a &lt;a href="https://www.legitreviews.com/intel-iris-xe-discrete-card-will-only-work-with-select-cpus-and-motherboards_225470"&gt;statement to &lt;em&gt;Legit Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “These motherboards require a special BIOS that supports Intel Iris Xe, so the cards won’t be compatible with other systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VprjXRBos3nS3fYLLeXIv4TbOsI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22261494/dg1_3d_rwd.png.rendition.intel.web.978.550.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of Intel’s first Iris Xe desktop GPUs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M9IGJ5"&gt;The restrictions make more sense when you consider the target market of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251142/intel-iris-xe-graphics-cards-desktop-gpu-pc"&gt;these first Intel desktop GPUs&lt;/a&gt;. Intel is working with Asus and other vendors to sell these cards to system integrators who will bundle them with prebuilt systems. These aren’t GPUs you can just order online, and they’re meant to be specially bundled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tt2CLF"&gt;Intel’s idea with its initial Iris Xe desktop GPUs is to simply improve what’s available on mainstream PCs right now. Most standard business-focused PCs ship with integrated graphics, and Intel is trying to offer something that improves multi-display support and hardware acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="paYRBV"&gt;These cards aren’t designed to improve gaming or to be used in gaming rigs. Intel is also working on its Xe-HPG architecture that could eventually deliver cards that can compete with AMD and Nvidia. Hopefully these cards won’t be restricted to Intel systems in a similar way, though.&lt;/p&gt;
