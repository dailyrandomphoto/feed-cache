    <title>GoDaddy wins our 2020 award for most evil company email</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="godaddy logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vg1s1mMzUds2jAlhyJWWClTDF6A=/97x0:706x406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68578977/godaddy-logo.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IoTVMD"&gt;What’s the cruelest prank you can make on employees who are struggling during a global pandemic when millions of people have lost their jobs or lives? GoDaddy — a web domain registrar once best known for its sexist advertisements — tried to find out when it sent employees a fake email informing them they’d receive a $650 holiday bonus. &lt;a href="https://coppercourier.com/story/godaddy-employees-holiday-bonus-secruity-test/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Copper Courier &lt;/em&gt;originally reported&lt;/a&gt;, GoDaddy sent an email phishing “test” to its employees promising much-needed money; “2020 has been a record year for GoDaddy, thanks to you!”, it said. “Though we cannot celebrate together during our annual Holiday Party, we want to show our appreciation and share a $650 one—time Holiday bonus!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4dWHY"&gt;The employees who clicked the link then &lt;a href="https://coppercourier.com/story/godaddy-employees-holiday-bonus-secruity-test/"&gt;reportedly received&lt;/a&gt; an email two days later telling them they failed the test. Instead of receiving a holiday bonus, they’d instead be required to take a training course on social engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNDGeY"&gt;Phishing tests are normal, but promising employees fake money definitely falls into the “oh no they didn’t” category. It’s probably worth mentioning that promising fake bonuses is literally something Michael Scott, the world’s worst fictional boss from &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, inflicted on his employees at Dunder Mifflin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ce4Qnu"&gt;So congratulations, GoDaddy: you win our brand-new award for Most Evil Company Email Of The Year. Let’s hope this is the first and only time we have to award it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Warner Bros. believes that theaters will still exist in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mad Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PgWJq5Nk0AbMrBwnbWEGoVtEWro=/347x0:1540x795/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68578510/Screen_Shot_2015-03-30_at_10.52.35_AM.0.5.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xmkuqd"&gt;Warner Bros. ruffled some feathers when it announced it would release all of its new 2021 movies simultaneously on HBO Max, but the company seems to be betting that theaters won’t become an apocalyptic wasteland. &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/warner-bros-mad-max-fury-road-color-purple-1234874609/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the company plans to release &lt;em&gt;Furiosa&lt;/em&gt;, the prequel to &lt;em&gt;Max Max: Fury Road, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple &lt;/em&gt;first in theaters in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRCnGy"&gt;Warner’s plan to launch next year’s films online &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;is a great thing for consumers&lt;/a&gt; who would rather stay at home than risk contracting a deadly virus to see, say, &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;. But the plan immediately made enemies of some Hollywood veterans. Director Christopher Nolan called HBO Max “the worst streaming service” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22162918/christopher-nolan-tenet-hbo-max-warner-bros-streaming-service-cinematic-releases"&gt;and accused Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt; of not telling anyone about its plan until just 90 minutes before it was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPSDfb"&gt;Despite Warner’s rosy outlook on the existence of theaters, the signs on their marquees might not look the same by 2023. AMC has warned investors that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169538/amc-theaters-revenue-closing-warner-bros-hbo-max-streaming"&gt;it will run out of cash&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of January if it can’t find $750 million.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Echo Frames review: listen to these specs</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Great in concept, but there’s a limit to what Alexa can do on a phone&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lhpWyg"&gt;I did not expect to like the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083C58VDP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Frames&lt;/a&gt; as much as I do. The concept is relatively simple: they’re a pair of eyeglasses with tiny little speakers and microphones embedded in the stems so you can listen to music and command Alexa. They run $249 and come with basic plastic lenses, but you can take them to an optometrist and get prescription lenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDa7s1"&gt;It’s a much smarter strategy than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/18/17255354/intel-vaunt-shut-down"&gt;the failed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308281/google-north-focals-glasses-purchase-acquire"&gt;smart glasses&lt;/a&gt; that tried to add a display into the mix. Maybe that’s in the works, but as with many of its products, Amazon starts with a minimum viable product and iterates. That’s doubly true for these Echo Frames, which are now widely available for anybody to buy in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575243/amazon-echo-frames-smart-glasses-alexa-loop-second-gen-available"&gt;version two of the product&lt;/a&gt; that makes some tweaks to the internal hardware and battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wy3EIQ"&gt;Amazon isn’t alone in this category, though. Bose is also on its second iteration of sunglasses (or eyeglasses) with little speakers in the stems — and it offers multiple styles, to boot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zp9ml5"&gt;The Echo Frames have sold me on the concept of having discreet, personal audio available at all times. It’s a bit like discovering headphones all over again. But while I’m sold on the &lt;em&gt;concept&lt;/em&gt;, for reasons both in and out of Amazon’s control, the experience of actually &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; the Echo Frames falls well short of their potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jbyw3D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10250111"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Echo Frames look like relatively normal — but cheap — eyeglasses" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hgy-DT5Y-Z1w9pc2liziaQuN3oY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183630/vpavic_201215_4343_0164_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Frames look like relatively normal — but cheap — eyeglasses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hfcFDy"&gt;Echo Frames hardware and style&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1wrKFd"&gt;The Echo Frames are basic, rectangular glasses. They’re made entirely of glossy plastic and come in three different colors: an all-black version, a tortoiseshell design, and a version that fades from black to blue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LkzCg"&gt;They’re also quite large. It’s a one-size-fits-all product, but that’s not really how glasses work. They felt comfortable on my head, but I do think they look a little big — maybe I just don’t like this shape. The stems have plenty of flex where they attach, at least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="nmaE6I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;They look normal, but they don’t look especially nice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The stems contain all the electronics, and are quite thick." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kkDBnCYDJq7pWQz1z-Q52xC2xqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183637/vpavic_201215_4343_0117_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stems contain all the electronics, and are quite thick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rot6Ju"&gt;Amazon has a partnership with LensCrafters to help people get prescription lenses added to the Echo Frames, but I used them as they shipped, with clear plastic lenses. Those built-in lenses are reflective as hell, making them so distracting during Zoom calls that I had to take them off. (I normally wear glasses, so I had contact lenses in during my testing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uqnZ0"&gt;As far as the techy components go, they’re subtle. There is a mic, power button, and a couple of volume buttons on the underside of the right stem — plus a magnetic pogo pin receiver for charging. Each stem has two tiny holes located back near your ear for audio. The right stem also has a touch sensor on the side that’s able to detect taps and swipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5RgCHa"&gt;All those components are there, but unless somebody is looking for them, they’re basically invisible. The only real giveaway that these are smart glasses is that the stems are quite thick, narrowing suddenly so they can actually fit behind your ears. I was worried they’d feel heavy (I prefer glasses on the lighter side to begin with), but they never felt that way to me — Amazon clocks them at 31 grams.  I was also worried they would look somehow techy, but fortunately they don’t. They just look kind of, well, cheap. Even just offering a different finish on the plastic might have helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="All the physical controls for the Echo Frames are on the right stem." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WM4B5UkQAZjmbpPh-j9olJJjcX0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183639/vpavic_201215_4343_0098_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All the physical controls for the Echo Frames are on the right stem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QIOJyu"&gt;Echo Frames software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="axhE4Q"&gt;There are two ways to use the Echo Frames: as basic Bluetooth “headphones” and as an Alexa device. Obviously Amazon intends you to do the latter, but I found that they were surprisingly decent as teleconference and telephone call headphones. Unfortunately, they can only be paired to one device at a time and require a full re-pairing to switch devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESwflB"&gt;Really, these are meant to be accessories to your phone only, and so the only good move is to set them up inside the Alexa app like any other Echo device. There are a few unique options, like setting up an automatic volume feature that tries to set the volume just loud enough to overcome ambient noise. Otherwise, if you’ve used any other Echo device, then the experience here is about the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZQwBBA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone limits what the Frames are allowed to really do&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rWJUuC"&gt;That’s both good and bad. It’s nice to just have Alexa available all the time, whether you’re at home or not. But since the Echo Frames are paired to a phone, you’d like to think that Alexa would be able to do the sorts of things you expect a digital assistant on a phone to do. It cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQAJaZ"&gt;I used the Echo Frames with an iPhone, and basic tasks that Siri can do like making calls or responding to texts are just never going to happen for Alexa. When I asked Alexa to “Call Dan Seifert,” Alexa defaulted to using its own teleconferencing system, which meant that my attempt to just ring Dan’s cellphone resulted in every single Echo device in his house ringing and annoying his entire family. (You can also use Siri with the Frames with a long press on the stem, at least.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goneZC"&gt;There is one interesting phone trick I appreciated: the ability to pick and choose which notifications get announced. When a new notification comes in, you can tap or swipe to tell the Frames whether you want to hear notifications from that app read aloud to you. I’m normally super annoyed by audio systems for notifications, but this one makes it easy to filter them down to the very urgent stuff, and to dismiss them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNbDMz"&gt;As an Alexa device, I really have few complaints. It took a little while for the Echo speakers in my apartment to figure out that I was talking to my glasses instead of them, but that eventually settled down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are tiny speaker holes right in front of your ears on each stem" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h0EL3KgTrIIOsBojdd9cJQGVgEA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183636/vpavic_201215_4343_0121_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are tiny speaker holes right in front of your ears on each stem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zxdL8V"&gt;Echo Frames audio and battery life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KwtofW"&gt;Maybe my favorite software trick on the Echo Frames is that when you set the glasses down on a table upside-down, they turn off after a few seconds. I think it’s also a necessary trick. Although Amazon promises you can get through a “14-hour day” of mixed use, that mixed use really boils down to just over three hours of actively using the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcwUvv"&gt;That’s really not long enough, honestly. I know that because I was killing the battery on these glasses by mid-afternoon every day — because I was using them much more than I expected to. Working from home, I’m constantly donning and doffing headphones to listen to music, take calls, talk to my spouse, or just give my ears a rest. With the Echo Frames, my source of audio is just &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;, unobtrusive and always available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXzt0z"&gt;They were so convenient and handy that I was all the more annoyed by their shortcomings. I couldn’t connect them to my computer without significant hassle and their battery life simply wasn’t up to the task of doing what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hxcC3u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;They were so convenient, I wanted to use them more than the battery could handle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SceIEK"&gt;I don’t know exactly how I should judge the sound quality. The Echo Frames have tiny speakers that sit just forward of your ears, so expecting deep bass or really anything great would be a mistake. They did provide clarity, however, both in listening to music and podcasts. When I used them for phone calls, people on the other end were surprised to hear I was on a Bluetooth headset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DicrII"&gt;Those little speakers are also remarkably good at being directional. In most environments, you can hear them loud and clear while somebody standing just a couple feet away would hear nothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZIrlk"&gt;It’s great that your ears are open — I felt much safer using the Echo Frames while riding my bike than with my usual one-earbud-in, one-earbud-out habit. Unfortunately, the Echo Frames just don’t get loud enough to compete with street noise. Even cranked to the max, it can be difficult to hear the Frames when there’s traffic, and if you’re in a loud subway train, forget it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon Echo Frames" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OWMd36oVzutyw7kB-zqj0Ua5NuM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183633/vpavic_201215_4343_0147_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon Echo Frames.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7wYzCW"&gt;I did have some strange moments with the Echo Frames. Wearing headphones is a big social signal that your ears are occupied and your attention isn’t immediately available to those around you. But with the Echo Frames, you look the same whether you’re staring into space or listening to a podcast, so people around you will just start talking to you as though you weren’t wearing headphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDNE34"&gt;There are places where social interactions with Echo Frames are less fraught. In a doctor’s office waiting room, for example, I could listen to a podcast while still able to listen for my name when it was called. Being able to not only do that but also not be the guy with one earbud in was nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvSBXy"&gt;A few days into using the Echo Frames, I suddenly realized I had stopped messing about with the volume on my phone anymore. I constantly am riding the volume buttons to either listen to a quick video or silence one. But just having convenient, comfortable, and personal audio on at all times meant I never had to worry about it. The audio quality isn’t great, but the convenience is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="kRP4hV"&gt;It was great, and it made me wish for a version of the Echo Frames that didn’t have to make all the compromises Amazon had to make here, especially on battery life (for the size) and on styling (for the price). Most of all, though, I found that while Alexa is great in my house, it feels like Apple put a hard ceiling on what it’s allowed to do on an iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="7m7uUl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10250138"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Tony Robbins claims he saved his employee from COVID — she says that’s a lie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r5xW9e0ZPhgSnsG_MwWcBL7Fdik=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68577104/VRG_ILLO_4349_Tony_Robbins_Covid.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel, Photography by Jim Spellman/WireImage &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;Astrid Stawiar via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Behind Tony Robbins’ dangerous approach to the pandemic&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="N4DvmG"&gt;The story Tony Robbins told on his podcast was harrowing — if also a little convoluted. One of his staff members had come down with a fever of 102 when she started watching the news and freaking out. She went to the hospital, presumably with COVID-19, and began to hyperventilate. The doctors put her on a ventilator — then in a medically induced coma. “The doctor said … ‘If she doesn’t wake up in three weeks, we’ll declare her dead,’” Robbins recounted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2xl7W"&gt;The self-help guru had been researching coronavirus treatments and decided pressure from ventilators could damage the lungs. “I’m not saying these people are trying to harm. I think they’re all trying to help, but the research is now showing a very different component there,” he said on the &lt;em&gt;Tony Robbins Podcast&lt;/em&gt;. So Robbins asked a physician friend to call the hospital and convince the woman’s doctors to lower the pressure. “As a result, four or five days later, she opened her eyes, which we’re so grateful for, and she’s still in the hospital but she’s healing,” Robbins said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ix5fI"&gt;The episode fit neatly into Robbins’ self-aggrandizing coronavirus narrative. Since the early days of the pandemic, he’d been suspicious of the hysteria surrounding COVID-19.  He told employees in late March that the flu was worse than coronavirus, adding: “We have lost our minds on this.” He also hosted two events amid the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApPNvx"&gt;Robbins’ spokesperson Jennifer Connelly said that, since February: “Two small, private in-person meetings were held, and those were in compliance with federal, state and local regulations and guidance regarding COVID-19.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wodrcq"&gt;As a coach, Robbins always taught people that they had the ability to change their lives — not their wives or their pastors or their priests. The story he told on his podcast highlighted how little doctors knew about the illness they were supposed to be treating and underlined his own heroism in saving her life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xs0K7"&gt;But according to a new federal lawsuit filed in the Southern District of New York, the tale was largely fabricated. Debbie Kosta, the employee in question, is suing Robbins and his company, Robbins Research International (RRI), saying he lied about his part in her recovery and made it nearly impossible for her to return to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HYJG1O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;She just wanted to help people change their lives&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GUQI5y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWQOjt"&gt;The complaint lays out a starkly different picture of Tony Robbins than the inspirational coach he plays on social media. It says his organization refused to let Kosta return to work part-time while she was recovering from COVID-19 and dealing with a recent cancer diagnosis. Instead, roughly three months after Kosta got off a ventilator, the complaint alleges her managers gave her an ultimatum: return to work full-time or lose her job and her health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujThx5"&gt;In a statement, Robbins’ spokesperson said: “When we were informed Ms. Kosta had contracted COVID-19 and was hospitalized, Mr. Robbins and his organization inquired with compassion and support for her and have treated her fairly and consistent with all applicable laws. RRI answered all of her questions, provided all of her requested accommodations, and did not retaliate against her in any way. Ms. Kosta remains employed by RRI and the organization continues to pay the complete cost of her medical insurance, even though its legal obligation to do so ended in June.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMzzjJ"&gt;Kosta had been an employee of Robbins’ for 18 years when the pandemic arrived. She’d started working for him in Europe, then moved to New York and joined the sales team in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqjrQw"&gt;Sales reps at RRI sold tickets to Robbins’ live events — multiday seminars with names like “Unleash the Power Within” and “Date with Destiny.” The world-famous coach taught people to eliminate pain “for good” and urged followers not to “settle for an ordinary life when you can create an extraordinary one.” As such, tickets cost between $600 and $3,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0E6yZQ"&gt;Some of Robbins’ clients were dealing with major life issues. They were drug addicts, alcoholics, or philanderers. To them, Robbins’ philosophy of self-empowerment was entirely new. It allowed them to take control of their lives and transformed them into loyal fans along the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4CILt"&gt;But Kosta wasn’t like that. She’d always had high self-esteem and a relentlessly positive attitude. Robbins’ curriculum reminded her of Greek philosophy, and while she believed in what he was teaching, she didn’t worship him like others seemed to. She just wanted to help people change their lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnjYAV"&gt;What stood out to Kosta was Robbins’ delivery. He’d run onstage to pulsing music, high-fiving and shouting like a maniac. And it worked. “I saw it, it was like, ‘Oh, people listen to this,’” Kosta says. “People actually like high-fiving and hugging.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PErzHz"&gt;Back in New York, Kosta became one of Robbins’ top performing sales reps, according to the complaint. The gig was commission-only, but there were bonuses for people who sold a lot. One anonymous employee who worked on the sales team said they regularly made $80,000 a year in bonuses alone. Kosta liked the hustle and was willing to skip holidays if it meant succeeding at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yEPQh0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1MD7lh"&gt;Over the next nine years, Kosta made a life for herself and her two young daughters in New York City. She was able to send them to a good prep school in Manhattan and take them to Europe in the summers. But the real money went to Tony Robbins. After a particularly massive event, Kosta says he called her to congratulate her on how much business she was bringing in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBjxvj"&gt;Then, in early 2020, things started to shift. Robbins’ biggest event was scheduled to take place in San Jose, California, in March. “Unleash the Power Within” was a four-day seminar that taught people to “unlock and unleash the forces inside you to break through your limitations and take control of your life.” Unfortunately, some worried that a 12,000-person event could unleash a bunch of coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFNZvM"&gt;Less than a week before the event, Robbins was forced to cancel. Attendees started calling to get their money back, sending the sales team into a panic. RRI had a brutal policy that meant each refund came out of employees’ commissions. Some team members went from making well over $100,000 to not being able to make their mortgage payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19x5wh"&gt;In late March, Robbins offered employees a stipend of roughly $5,000 a month and urged them to “step the fuck up,” according to audio leaked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;They were told they’d need to pay Robbins back by the end of the year. The following month, in April, &lt;a href="https://projects.propublica.org/coronavirus/bailouts/loans/robbins-research-international-inc-c62b8f906ee86f60821af1e98cc0c006"&gt;RRI received a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan&lt;/a&gt; from the federal government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmxDR3"&gt;(In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;Robbins’ spokesperson wrote: “RRI properly and legally applied and received PPP support and has used those funds in compliance with the program’s rules.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLtexQ"&gt;The news wasn’t great for Kosta, but she was dealing with bigger problems. She’d developed a high fever and was having a difficult time breathing. Her daughter Stella, a 19-year-old film student at Hunter College, had never seen her mom so sick. On April 12th, when Kosta’s fever had been hovering at 104 for three days, Stella decided to call an ambulance. “She’s very strong and upbeat, so seeing her so weak, barely able to string sentences together, not breathing, it was very mind-boggling to me,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXSG7H"&gt;Stella had watched the trucks of dead bodies lining the streets in Manhattan. Everyone she knew either had COVID or knew someone who’d died from it. “I was just like, ‘My mom cannot become one of those people,’” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="drw0Rb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;But Stella says none of that is true&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zIsaFH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnhTEW"&gt;At the hospital, doctors put Kosta on a ventilator, then in a medically induced coma. Robbins called Stella to see how her mother was doing. This is where Robbins’ telling of the story really diverges from the truth, according to Kosta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYOI4J"&gt;Robbins said that Stella did her research and found that the longer her mom was on a ventilator, the more likely she was to die. “The daughter went crazy,” he said on his podcast. “She said, ‘You put her in the coma. She came in with a cough and a fever and shortness of breath…’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nrkz00"&gt;But Stella says none of that is true. “I’m not knowledgeable enough,” she says, bewildered. “Whatever the doctors were telling me, I was believing it.” At one point, she says she asked the doctors how much longer her mother would have to be on a ventilator. “But I was never like, ‘Take her off right now,’” she adds. “Why would I ever do that? I was just asking, ‘How can you make her better?’ But I never went against the ventilator. The ventilator is what saved her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80KzfO"&gt;The complaint also says that Robbins told Kosta’s clients he was the one who convinced the doctors to take her off the ventilator. And, it alleges that Sage Robbins, Tony’s wife, called Stella to “pry information from her regarding Ms. Kosta’s condition.” Kosta’s attorney, Chris Albanese, of the employment law firm White, Hilferty and Albanese, says: “Tony and his wife went out of their way to harm her, what kind of person would do that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eaSLDn"&gt;(Robbins’ spokesperson says the “allegations concerning RRI, Mr. Robbins and his wife, are false.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9KBuuJ"&gt;Robbins took advantage of Kosta’s situation for his own benefit, the complaint adds. He made it seem like she was overreacting about her symptoms because of the news. “I talked to him personally and told him about the 104 fever and how she couldn’t breathe,” Stella notes. “For him to turn around and say, ‘Oh, she had 102 fever and then watched the news and started hyperventilating’ — it was just so shocking. It’s a betrayal. I took lessons from his events at heart and tried to change my life with them. Now I’m just wondering, ‘Well, how much have you been lying then? How many of your stories and how many of your experiences that you used to teach us are lies?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYt1oF"&gt;Kosta stayed in a coma until early May. Then, miraculously, she started to get better. When she finally got home from the hospital on May 5th, she could barely walk around the block or speak a full sentence without losing her breath. But she was alive. Then her doctors discovered a growth on her chest. They said said she’d likely need six months to fully recover, according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3dBCf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nfaAO1WIv679OD1QxSSoGWyqO4w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22192464/akrales_201221_4349_0380.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Debbie Kosta and her two daughters in New York City. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iGrYic"&gt;Kosta was on New York State Paid Family Leave, but it was set to run out at the end of June. She knew she wasn’t well enough to return to work; she still needed surgery to remove the growth. Talking on the phone all day with her voice ravaged from the ventilator seemed impossible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Rp060"&gt;According to the lawsuit, she emailed HR to see if she could have more time off. They said no. If she didn’t return in July, she’d lose her health insurance. Kosta asked to reduce her hours. She was a commissioned-based employee who worked from home, so the request seemed pretty reasonable. But RRI refused, the complaint says. They offered her $15,000 in severance and encouraged her to go on disability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ai8uFy"&gt;“Debbie Kosta was at the peak of her sales career when she contracted coronavirus,” said Vincent White, Kosta’s other attorney. “Instead of supporting a woman who had not only supported his organization but enriched him personally, Tony Robbins left her without reasonable accommodation for her disability. She has lost a tremendous amount of earning potential during this time, and frankly it is impossible to put a number on the emotional damages Ms. Kosta has endured at the hands of a company that claims to lift up, not break down, the human spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5ea9r"&gt;Kosta’s complaint, which was filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ahead of its filing in federal court in New York City, says that her request to reduce her hours was a reasonable accommodation, and RRI’s refusal to grant it violates the Americans with Disabilities Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8WLOU9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m done with this Guru!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2TbZjw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSp6P0"&gt;Robbins had been walking a thin line between COVID-19 skepticism and denial. He didn’t doubt that the disease existed, but he hinted that the news coverage surrounding the death rate was exaggerated. Then, in August 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/TonyRobbins/posts/the-most-powerful-vaccine-youve-never-heard-ofjoin-peter-diamandis-tony-robbins-/10158871342659060/"&gt;he started promoting a coronavirus vaccine&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook, designed by his friend and longtime collaborator Peter H. Diamandis. Diamandis’ company, Covaxx, is backed by Prime Movers Lab, a venture capital firm where Robbins works as a business strategist and partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsdlQ0"&gt;Jennifer Connelly, Robbins’ spokesperson, said: “Mr. Robbins has invested in one of several companies working on the development of an effective COVID vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cyb0Wd"&gt;The perceived change disappointed his followers. “I can’t believe what I am actually reading from Tony Robbins who said during 7 day challenge that Covid 19 equivalent of the Flu,” one wrote on Facebook. “What a sell out Tony Robbins turned out to be promoting a ‘safe vaccine’ by one of his Business partners. I’m done with this Guru!” Another wrote: “No thanks Tony how much cash do you have invested in this vaccine?!?!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="t9aZQ2"&gt;The answer, according to Pitchbook, could be close to $2.85 million, which is the amount Covaxx raised in May, in a funding round led by Prime Movers Lab. It might help explain Robbins’ core philosophy — not self-empowerment, or personal growth, but capitalism. America’s number one coach might say his mission is to “help individuals and businesses succeed.” But according to some employees, the individual he’s most interested in helping is himself. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s an HDMI-themed holiday podcast to listen to this season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6eMiETjdOuCKmDP7vOg4DSH1C2A=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68577101/acastro_HDMI_spectacular_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JGSQvR"&gt;Happy holidays! Here is our gift to you: over an hour of audio content exclusively dedicated to HDMI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7njAV"&gt;If you’re lucky this holiday season, you may be opening up a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"&gt;Xbox Series S&lt;/a&gt;. And with that, a brand-new HDMI 2.1 cable — ready to game in 4K at 120Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5JGlG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://hdmi.org/spec/hdmi2_1"&gt;HDMI 2.1&lt;/a&gt; is an updated HDMI standard that expands the bandwidth of HDMI up to 48Gbps, allowing the ability for multiple features like &lt;a href="https://www.hdmi.org/spec21sub/variablerefreshrate"&gt;variable refresh rate&lt;/a&gt; (VRR), &lt;a href="https://www.hdmi.org/spec21sub/autolowlatencymode"&gt;auto low latency mode&lt;/a&gt; (ALLM), and &lt;a href="https://www.hdmi.org/spec21sub/enhancedaudioreturnchannel"&gt;enhanced audio return channel&lt;/a&gt; (eARC). It also supports high resolution and refresh rates like 8K60 and 4K120, and all of these features can upgrade your console gaming significantly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MATiSx"&gt;Both your TV and HDMI cable need to support HDMI 2.1 to unlock these features. This holiday season, it’s still a bit confusing to try to figure out which TVs are the best choice. &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/3/21348598/ps5-sony-tv-playstation-5-ready-4k-8k"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Polygon’s &lt;/em&gt;Samit Sarkar points out&lt;/a&gt;, some of Sony’s own “Ready for PS5” branded TVs do not support VRR or ALLM, and in other sets, only one of their multiple ports is HDMI 2.1-ready. From what we’ve seen, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/4/21151509/xbox-series-x-ps5-specs-4k-8k-tv-hdmi"&gt;this is not an isolated problem&lt;/a&gt; in the market right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5H0XZ"&gt;Hopefully, this podcast can help you sort through it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bGHPU1"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP7588472400" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dBVhvn"&gt;For a special &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;holiday episode, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and Chris Welch talked to three industry experts about the new HDMI 2.1 standard. They go through what to look for when buying a new TV, how serious the TV manufacturers are on supporting 2.1, and how the new standard is being implemented throughout the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5xl9u"&gt;First, Dieter and Chris talk with the aforementioned Samit Sarkar, front page editor of &lt;em&gt;Polygon,&lt;/em&gt; about the state of TVs, next-gen gaming, and availability of HDMI 2.1 features in consumer tech at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpBHUk"&gt;After that, Nilay and Chris chat with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18172397/airplay-2-homekit-vizio-tv-bill-baxter-interview-vergecast-ces-2019"&gt;Vizio CTO Bill Baxter&lt;/a&gt; about implementing HDMI 2.1 in the company’s popular TVs, as well as early bugs that Vizio has encountered between its televisions and the Xbox Series X and PS5. They also talk over where things go from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5tJaY"&gt;Last but certainly not least, the crew sits down with the president of the &lt;a href="https://hdmi.org/"&gt;HDMI Forum&lt;/a&gt;, David Glen, to talk about the ins and outs of the organization in charge of HDMI and how the adoption of 2.1 has been going this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5c0HN"&gt;With this star-studded cast, we hope this episode helps explain why you may or may not be interested in upgrading your TV for HDMI 2.1 this holiday season. You can listen to the full discussion here or in your preferred podcast player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbwwkP"&gt;Whether you’re dreaming of a new 4K OLED, PS5, or a new Xbox this Christmas, from all of us at &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, may your frames be variably refreshed and your latency be extremely low. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s when you can watch Wonder Woman 1984, Soul, and Bridgerton on Christmas Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A promotional picture of Wonder Woman 1984" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/03VZm2gPTafw3z285_0JMMCF8o8=/41x0:740x466/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68577098/wonder_woman.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warner Bros.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFItjc"&gt;December 25th is going to be a big deal for streaming, with blockbusters like &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt; debuting on HBO Max and Disney Plus, respectively, alongside hyped streaming shows like Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; We Can Be Heroes.&lt;/em&gt; If you’re planning a big Christmas Day marathon, here’s when each of those pieces of content will debut, so you can plan ahead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5Hpcj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;will be the last to debut, arriving at 12PM ET on Christmas Day. That means you should have some time to unwrap and set up any new streaming or A/V gear before it debuts on HBO Max. Given the usual 3AM or midnight release times for streaming shows, it’s worth taking note of the noon ET drop here when making your movie marathon plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PwKcTx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soul &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;will arrive on Disney Plus at 3AM ET on December 25th. If you’re willing to stay up late, you’ll be able to watch it then. But if you’re not interested in staying up, it’ll be ready to view whenever you wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfDIZm"&gt;Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; will bring the flair of rockstar producer Shonda Rhimes to Regency London on December 25th at 3AM ET, perfect for anyone looking for a more lengthy show to binge-watch over the holiday weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwQuAS"&gt;And for younger audiences (or adults who are still fans of &lt;em&gt;The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D), &lt;/em&gt;Robert Rodriguez’s sequel &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Can Be Heroes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will continue the story with a new generation of heroes starting at 3AM ET on December 25th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro said to cost $199</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nGqHqU"&gt;More details of Samsung’s unannounced Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds with active noise cancelation have leaked, including the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQ70Vh"&gt;According to slides shared on Twitter by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1341767829926768643"&gt;WalkingCat&lt;/a&gt;, the Galaxy Buds Pro will cost $199 at launch making them $80 cheaper than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507552/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-best-noise-cancellation"&gt;Bose QuietComfort Earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, our noise-canceling champions. Samsung’s pro buds will feature strong IPX7 durability against dust and water, and up to 8 hours of listening time which can be extended to 28 hours with the charging case. WalkingCat provides this handy chart to compare specs across all of Samsung’s wireless buds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="o2prhE"&gt;WalkingCat also shared a slide showing an exploded view of the new active noise canceling buds, revealing an 11-mm woofer and 6.5-mm tweeter. The slide also supports rumors of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22193235/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-3d-spatial-audio-leak"&gt;Apple-like spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. With a price of $199, the Buds Pro would be $50 cheaper than Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless buds. On paper at least, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro are looking very competitive with Apple’s best buds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="FDPrun"&gt;The new slides are similar in look to those leaked by WalkingCat yesterday showing details about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197354/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-leaked-specs-better-battery-life-lower-price"&gt;Samsung’s $699 Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll know soon if they’re legit. The big CES show is coming up and Samsung is hosting its own event in January for the presumed launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22196897/s-pen-uwb-comfirm-galaxy-s21-ultra-fcc"&gt;Galaxy S21 series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Five easy ways for Elon Musk to combine his companies into a superconglomerate</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ho0CY5bFI60hyNxwPhYYSqP7zZQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68575588/pacalin_190721_3581_0013.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GkZ8C9"&gt;Elon Musk thinks it’s a “good idea” to create a holding company above Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company — at least, that’s what the billionaire CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1341801143631028225"&gt;said in response to the idea on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Such a holding company could be simply known as “X,” longtime Tesla shareholder Dave Lee suggested, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/10/15949862/elon-musk-x-com-paypal-tesla-spacex-domain-name"&gt;a nod to Musk’s ownership of “X.com” from his PayPal days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNIIkO"&gt;Musk notoriously entertains changes, big and small, to his companies in &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wired25-jack-dorsey/"&gt;Twitter’s public square&lt;/a&gt;. In 2018 he even suggested one so large (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/27/17911428/sec-lawsuit-elon-musk-tesla-funding-tweet"&gt;largely baseless&lt;/a&gt;) — taking Tesla private using “funding secured” from Saudi Arabia — that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/26/18484751/elon-musk-sec-fraud-tesla-tweets-contempt-agreement"&gt;he wound up in court&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p3aYNQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was only five years ago that Google surprise-announced a similar shakeup&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pr8PVr"&gt;But the idea here isn’t &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; far outside the realm of possibility. It was only five years ago that Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/11/9129131/alphabet-google-larry-page-sergey-brin-merger-strategy"&gt;surprise-announced a similar shakeup&lt;/a&gt;, creating the Alphabet holding company and splitting some of its bigger and bolder projects out into their own ventures alongside the search giant but still under that new umbrella. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvI5yt"&gt;If Musk is entertaining something similar after thumbing through Twitter, let’s have a think on what that would even look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vBctC8"&gt;Repeating Alphabet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kQCnGE"&gt;The most straightforward way for Musk to create X could be to roughly follow that Alphabet model. The big difference is SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company are all separate entities that exist outside of Tesla, the only publicly-traded business of the bunch. Let’s start with Tesla, since that’s where most of the action will have to take place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBBc5v"&gt;Here’s the hilariously paper push-y way Alphabet deal was structured: Google created a wholly-owned subsidiary called Alphabet. It created &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; new wholly-owned subsidiary underneath Alphabet called “&lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001652044/000119312515336577/d82837dex21.htm"&gt;Maple Technologies&lt;/a&gt;.” It then merged Maple and Google to create a new version of Google that was, you got it, wholly owned by Alphabet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6tFbT"&gt;Easy, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgEeSW"&gt;As for Google stockholders: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5fzL7R"&gt;Each share of each class of Google stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Alphabet Merger will automatically convert into an equivalent corresponding share of Alphabet stock, having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the corresponding share of Google stock being converted. Accordingly, upon consummation of the Alphabet Merger, Google’s current stockholders will become stockholders of Alphabet. The stockholders of Google will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the conversion of their shares in the Alphabet Merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfoWPS"&gt;In other words, Google basically said “sit tight while we change things up, and when we’re done you’ll now own a slice of Alphabet worth the same amount.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5zqT1"&gt;The same could be done with Tesla. Create a Tesla subsidiary called “X,” create a merger entity underneath &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, and then combine the merger entity with Tesla. Tesla shareholders transform into equivalent shareholders of X, deal done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZiWgnr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The trouble would more likely be philosophical&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ztZ2iW"&gt;Well, not so fast. X would then have to bring the other three private companies into the fold. Instead of being able to just shuffle them around, like Google did with businesses like Nest, or Calico, X would probably have to acquire SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8CggVX"&gt;That shouldn’t be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; difficult since Musk is the majority owner of those companies. The trouble would more likely be philosophical. Tesla’s stock price is currently very high because a lot of people believe in the company. But how would people perceive the value of X stock if it includes these other operations?  Would X stock be subject to the fewer dramatic swings since the company’s value would be less dependent on Tesla’s performance? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/david_j_roth/status/212767135901024256?lang=en"&gt;Things of that nature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnUN6p"&gt;Combining the four companies under X could help Musk further sell his futurist vision (making humanity run on sustainable energy, settling other worlds, etc.). More boringly, it could help him consolidate the various companies’ financial or human resources departments, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-12-08/google-makes-so-much-money-it-never-had-to-worry-about-financial-discipline?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;which was a benefit Google sought with Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVXMPg"&gt;Okay now let’s get weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XVjWcR"&gt;Musk buys Tesla&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ADYypj"&gt;What &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t gel about going the Alphabet route is Musk... &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/8/17664296/elon-musk-tesla-public-private-offering-stocks"&gt;kind of despises that Tesla is a public company&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s what Musk wrote when he tried to take Tesla private back in 2018: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="exDB3a"&gt;As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders. Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term. Finally, as the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Wqc9FU"&gt;Tesla’s in a much better place financially now, so it doesn’t have to worry so much about the second and third point there. But the overall message still tracks. Musk would rather manage his businesses with fewer prying eyes. Would he really expose SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company to the same kinds of pressures by folding them into a public holding company? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2eY5W"&gt;Probably not, so how do you solve that? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRLbaS"&gt;Tesla is the only public company of the three currently, so... take it private. Yep. Let’s run the whole funding secured experiment all over again, but forget trying to sell it off to Saudi Arabia, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195959/elon-musk-tesla-tim-cook-apple-sale-meeting-acquisition-refused"&gt;Apple.&lt;/a&gt; Let’s get &lt;em&gt;weirder&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vAogd3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Seems like the least Ellison could do&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h4ODCI"&gt;Musk is now the second-richest man in the world, currently worth around $140 billion. He probably can’t come up with all the money it would take to buy out Tesla at its current valuation north of $600 billion — especially since half his shares in Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-techs-cash-poor-billionaire-11588967043"&gt;are already pledged as collateral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;the company’s board has limited him to borrowing just 25 percent of the value of any additional shares. It’s also unclear how much of his SpaceX shares are pledged as collateral. But using his ownership in all four companies as the basis for loans, one could see him taking a fair-sized bite out of that $600 billion price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLKUTj"&gt;He would need still some serious partners to join him in buying out Tesla. Perhaps billionaire and Tesla board member Larry Ellison? Seems like the least Ellison could do after Musk brought him into the fold following the funding secured debacle, and turned what was a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/15/investing/telsa-stock-larry-ellison/index.html"&gt;modest investment&lt;/a&gt; into what is now many billions of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPreTm"&gt;Musk does seem to love Tesla’s most loyal shareholders, to the point that he tried to promise that they would still own part of the company during the failed go-private transaction in 2018 — an idea &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/20/18507476/elon-musk-420-funding-secured-sec-lawsuit"&gt;that confused experts&lt;/a&gt; — so maybe he could find a way for them to be involved, too. Whatever consortium Musk draws up could just stand in for X, acquire Tesla, and then bring the other companies into the fold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IK71iC"&gt;SPAC X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iju2Mm"&gt;Musk creates one of the special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, that have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;oh-so-hot this year&lt;/a&gt; and calls it X. He kicks it off with a lot of his own money (likely from leveraged Tesla and SpaceX shares) and the stock price immediately soars once it starts trading, because a) it’s a SPAC and that’s just how things work now, apparently, b) its existence as a vehicle for brute force capitalism excites the masses, and c) it’s Elon Musk. SPAC X becomes a blank check behemoth, he uses it to buy Tesla and the other companies, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PWDDjv"&gt;Mars Street&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EGSreF"&gt;Unsatisfied with merely theorizing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837590/elon-musk-mars-government-direct-democracy-law-code-conference"&gt;what the laws should be on Mars&lt;/a&gt;, Musk establishes the first Mars Stock Exchange. He models it after terrestrial stock exchanges, but with tweaks to reduce some of his least-favorite aspects (like quarterly reporting rules or that pesky Securities and Exchange Commission). Nobody is quite sure if it’s legal, or “real,” but then again the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/27/14398492/outer-space-treaty-50-anniversary-exploration-guidelines"&gt;Outer Space Treaty&lt;/a&gt; didn’t exactly go long on financial regulation now, did it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wCLbGX"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AyntSq"&gt;Musk reveals he’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166096/bitcoin-blockchain-code-currency-money-genesis-block-silk-road-mt-gox"&gt;bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; creator &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/30/16222590/satoshi-sec-officials-investors-ucoin-scheme-japanese"&gt;Satoshi Nakamoto&lt;/a&gt;, sells all his coins, and buys Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Dp5OgK"&gt;As you can see, Musk has a few options if he really wants to create the kind of world-beating conglomerate that only shows up in the movies. It may be a long shot, but that’s sort of his&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;whole&lt;em&gt; thing&lt;/em&gt;. No wonder he thinks it’s a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2DeAY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFf1yO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nuro can now charge for robot deliveries in California</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/peRb3_lKsfIJz6eNmSbWnLJDLiM=/856x0:7336x4320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68575385/Nuro_8.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Xd1PN"&gt;Nuro is now the first company in California that’s allowed to operate autonomous cars commercially (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/nuro-can-now-operate-and-charge-for-autonomous-delivery-services-in-california/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company received a permit that allowed it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21212719/nuro-driverless-car-test-california-dmv-delivery"&gt;to test its robots&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, but this permit will allow the firm to actually charge people for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kiN4W9"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://medium.com/nuro/california-dmv-grants-nuro-first-ever-av-deployment-permit-ca424ebd2"&gt;a Medium post by Nuro’s chief legal and policy officer&lt;/a&gt;, the company is planning to “announce [its] first deployment in California with an established partner.” Who that partner is remains to be seen, but it’s likely to be a delivery service that can make use of Nuro’s completely driverless Prius vehicles, though the company plans on (literally) rolling out its own custom R2 bots later on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12gjks"&gt;The permit, &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/dmv-approves-nuro-to-use-autonomous-vehicles-for-commercial-service/"&gt;issued by the California DMV&lt;/a&gt;, only allows the company to operate its delivery service in parts of Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, which would mean most of the Silicon Valley and its tech workers would be within its domain, but not San Francisco or Oakland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkLpbN"&gt;There are some additional restrictions as well — the vehicles will only be allowed on surface streets with a speed limit of 35 miles an hour (and the bots are only allowed to go 25 mph), so don’t expect to see an driverless Prius zipping along the freeway to make a delivery anytime soon. The vehicles are also only allowed to drive in “fair weather conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F205ew"&gt;The company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/30/16936548/nuro-self-driving-delivery-last-mile-google"&gt;founded by two ex-Google engineers&lt;/a&gt;, and was, ironically, the only company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18044670/waymo-fully-driverless-car-permit-california-dmv"&gt;besides Google’s Waymo&lt;/a&gt; to get a California permit allowing it to test driverless cars. Now, it’s beaten the other company to the punch in getting the ability to make a business out of it in the state. It’s a different story in Arizona, though, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507814/waymo-driverless-cars-allow-more-customers-phoenix"&gt;Waymo is running&lt;/a&gt; a paid ride service with its driverless cars.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Queen’s Gambit Funko Pops immortalize the show in plastic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iXiKnlKOb_vj8T5c-494uk9yuUc=/0x37:768x549/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68575353/POP_Television_The_Queens_Gambit_Beth_Harmon_with_Trophies.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Funko Inc.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="klN1iG"&gt;In what will hopefully be the last surprise of 2020, Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;The Queen’s Gambit&lt;/em&gt; is getting its own set of &lt;a href="https://bleedingcool.com/collectibles/funko-pop-the-queens-gambit-netflix/"&gt;Pop! Vinyl figurines from Funko&lt;/a&gt;. The three figurines will feature Anya Taylor-Joy’s main character, Beth Harmon, in a variety of outfits from the show, none of which are chess-related, but all of which are stylish. Fans can purchase the Pops to own a piece of the show’s unique aesthetic, filtered through Funko’s dead-eyed one, but the real question is, why is &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Queen’s Gambit&lt;/em&gt; getting Funko Pops?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VL6obX"&gt;If you’ll allow me to speculate wildly, maybe &lt;em&gt;The Queen’s Gambit &lt;/em&gt;is getting a Funko Pop, not because it’s a Netflix show that’s both &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/the-queens-gambit-netflix-review-anya-taylor-joy.html"&gt;critically well-received&lt;/a&gt; and popular &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/queens-gambit-netflix-viewing-record-1234838090/"&gt;according to Netflix’s own metrics&lt;/a&gt;, but rather because “getting Funko’ed” (coining that now) solidifies popular content that can be a little bit transient because of streaming algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tha14v"&gt;Netflix has been able to maintain &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21231023/netflix-tv-shows-movies-new-2020-pandemic-production-disney-universal-warner-bros-sony"&gt;an aggressive release schedule during 2020&lt;/a&gt; because of how many shows and movies it had already banked up. But can you honestly say you remember any of those early hits from February and March, like &lt;em&gt;Tiger King &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Love is Blind&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IdcXgd"&gt;

&lt;p id="iJGkv1"&gt;More broadly, was your media property really popular if it didn’t “get Funko’ed”? I’d argue no. And Netflix’s other Funko collaborations have immortalized similarly popular streaming mega-hits like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Funko-POP-Television-Money-Professor/dp/B07HJDSXBX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Money Heist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Funko-Stranger-Things-Eleven-Figure/dp/B01M5IK8M9/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=stranger+things+funko&amp;amp;qid=1608758641&amp;amp;s=toys-and-games&amp;amp;sr=1-6&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;before they got folded into the Netflix soup, only to resurface for new seasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgNgFz"&gt;Getting Funko’ed is almost like getting a panel at Comic-Con; it signals a level of fan engagement that warrants capitalizing on, at least monetarily. A show might fade from interest (or Netflix’s many carousels), but plastic junk is forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2d2Ypb"&gt;Funko’s ability to spin up figurines fast certainly helps in that regard. Even if Netflix’s deal was set before the show was a hit, Funko’s fast-fashion approach to manufacturing allows it to get a Pop into production in under two months, according to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/8/13/20798910/funko-pop-vinyl-figurines-collectibles"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The Goods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Given the October 23rd premiere date for &lt;em&gt;The Queen’s Gambit&lt;/em&gt;, the Beth Harmon Pops fall well within Funko’s compact production window. (Another weird thing: these Funko Pops &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Ftoys-collectibles%2Ffunko%2Fpop%2Fproducts%2Fpop-television-the-queens-gambit-beth-harmon-with-trophies%2F11113245.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;start shipping on April 20th of next year&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tpzkx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Queen’s Gambit&lt;/em&gt; Funko Pop! is an interesting flex of Funko’s manufacturing power, Netflix’s development skills, and the weird ways popularity surfaces in culture. No one will likely be talking about the show 40 years from now, but when I’m scavenging the wastelands of California and I find a Beth Harmon Pop in a busted-out suburb, I’ll remember, and barter for water accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
