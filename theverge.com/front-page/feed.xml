  &lt;p id="yyEvJx"&gt;This week, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22395472/covid-vaccine-pfizer-kid-ages-12-15-fda-authorization"&gt;authorized the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for people 12-15&lt;/a&gt;, a moment that many families have been eagerly waiting for since the vaccine rollout began in the US. As shots became available, parents &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-rush-to-get-covid-19-vaccines-for-their-children-11620984600"&gt;rushed to get their kids the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. But the decision has also contributed to ongoing discussions about how to best distribute vaccines around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUrG8H"&gt;In Santa Barbara, one 14-year-old got a &lt;a href="https://newspress.com/vaccines-for-teens/"&gt;vaccine for his birthday&lt;/a&gt;. In Colorado, schools are &lt;a href="https://co.chalkbeat.org/2021/5/13/22435327/covid-vaccine-teens-families-colorado-schools"&gt;setting up vaccine clinics&lt;/a&gt;. In Los Angeles, high-schoolers were eager for their shot at experiencing a normal life again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Bhn7OJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yO4Gd3"&gt;“I have a large family, one that I haven’t been able to see in over a year. I’ve missed out on being with my friends, spending time with family, going to school and so much more,” 15-year-old Malyna Trujillo &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-12/l-a-county-to-offer-covid-19-vaccines-to-younger-teens-thursday"&gt;said at a news conference&lt;/a&gt; in LA. “This vaccination isn’t just for me, it’s for my family — for my community.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BXYmM"&gt;On Wednesday, an advisory committee to the CDC endorsed the FDA’s decision, clearing the way for vaccinations to start in earnest. After the committee’s vote, Henry Bernstein, a member of the panel and a Professor of Pediatrics at the Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell said he was excited that younger people could now get the vaccine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXUxjz"&gt;“This will provide protection for 12 to 15 year olds. It’ll decrease transmission within their families. It’ll contribute to community immunity, and it allows the kids to more safely go back to camps this summer, and back to in person school.” Bernstein said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CDteaD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’ve missed out on being with my friends, spending time with family, going to school and so much more,”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3FyMEH"&gt;Not everyone was thrilled with the decision. “I understand why some countries want to vaccinate their children and adolescents, but right now I urge them to reconsider” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organisation, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-urges-rich-countries-donate-shots-instead-vaccinating-children-2021-05-14/"&gt;said this week&lt;/a&gt;. He asked that countries donate vaccines to other countries instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndhnoJ"&gt;“In low and lower-middle income countries, Covid-19 vaccine supply has not been enough to even immunize healthcare workers, and hospitals are being inundated with people that need lifesaving care urgently,” &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-57114734"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUhd7s"&gt;People on the CDC committee acknowledged the disparity in comments after the vote. “If we look at what’s happening elsewhere in the world, that’s evidence of what happens if you don’t have adequate supplies of safe and effective vaccines” said Matthew Daley, a pediatrician and researcher at Kaiser Permanente’s Institute for Health Research. “We’re in this very privileged position where we can see declining deaths and declining case rates because of these vaccines.” &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4NNYy8"&gt;Younger people are not at as great a risk of developing severe complications of COVID-19 as older people. But less risk is not zero risk, and as vaccinations have accelerated in the United States, doctors have seen &lt;a href="https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/childrens-health/covid-upticks-among-kids-and-teens-what-parents-should-know"&gt;spikes in infections in unvaccinated children.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNlq7T"&gt;For parents, securing an early vaccine slot was a first chance to provide their kids a little bit more freedom after a year of caution. Kids were excited at the prospect of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/us/coronavirus-vaccine-children-ages-12-15.html"&gt;sleepovers, shopping&lt;/a&gt;, and anything that looks like pre-pandemic life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTgphd"&gt;“The reason why I got it was because I want to see my friend, which I haven’t seen for a while. We’ve only been able to call each other,” 13-year-old Evan Yaney told &lt;a href="https://www.wilx.com/2021/05/13/mid-michigan-teenagers-lining-up-for-covid-vaccines/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WILX&lt;/em&gt; in Lansing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ms5fQB"&gt;That loneliness is something that experts hope this next stage of the vaccine rollout might combat. At the meeting of the CDC’s advisory panel this week, Grace Lee, a Professor of Pediatrics at Stanford University pointed out that we still don’t know the long-term effects of this pandemic on younger age groups.  “I think sometimes we lose the importance of children and adolescents in the midst of a pandemic. There’s been such a focus on older adults in particular, I think that the childhood experience our kids have gone through will have long-lasting consequences that may extend across generations,” said Lee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C6emvr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I want to see my friend, which I haven’t seen for a while.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KW7Id4"&gt;It has been a brutally hard year for children, many of whom have been kept apart from friends and family, suffered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21366285/covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-education-school-distance-learning-control-damage"&gt;educational setbacks&lt;/a&gt;, or witnessed trauma. For them, the chance to get a vaccine offers them hope — for themselves, and also for the future.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5ES9H"&gt;“I have been extremely careful throughout this whole thing,” 13-year-old Pia Andrade told &lt;a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2021/05/13/houston-area-teens-among-first-to-be-vaccinated-in-12-through-15-age-group/"&gt;Houston’s &lt;em&gt;KPRC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as she got vaccinated this week. “My principal actually died from COVID. He was perfectly fine and he got it and was hospitalized and he just died. I’ve seen the effects firsthand, and the more of us that get vaccinated, the better the world will be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="je9oHk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ABb4MR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03606-z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The epidemiological impact of the NHS COVID-19 App&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;This research paper in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; this week models how well the NHS’s contact tracing app worked. The researchers found it worked about as well as manual contact tracing methods, and calculated that it &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-google-contact-tracing-uk-1225935/"&gt;may have saved thousands of lives&lt;/a&gt;. They suggest that similar apps could be used in other countries to blunt the pandemic, while the world waits on vaccines. (Fraser et al, &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5OLqcU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2021-05-13/most-kids-with-coronavirus-infectios-lack-typical-covid-symptoms"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most kids with coronavirus infections lack typical symptoms of COVID-19, study says&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;People under 18 make up about 13 percent of COVID-19 cases in the US. But they don’t always show the same symptoms as adults. In particular, they are much less likely to have a fever, making temperature screenings less effective at catching cases. (Karen Kaplan/Los Angeles Times) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAN7XX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01246-x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How COVID broke the evidence pipeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;With more than a year of pandemic research under our belt, scientists are starting to take stock of the flood of COVID-19 related medical research. They’re finding that some of it...wasn’t that great. There were too many studies on individual (useless) drugs, studies with too few trial participants for any significant results, or review studies that quickly went out of date. There were major successes too, but scientists hope they can learn from the failures the next time an emergency crops up.  (Helen Pearson/&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s a real-world example from Buffalo, NY of just how well these programs are working.

But They Aren’t ‘Hesitant’ Either.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;About 30 million people in the US say they’d get a COVID-19 vaccine, but haven’t actually taken the plunge yet. Their reasons vary, but many in this group face hurdles like language barriers, difficult work schedules, or general lack of access.

&lt;p id="S9Buvl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/health/vaccine-pregnancy.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coronavirus Vaccines Protect Pregnant Women, Another Study Suggests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;New studies are adding to a growing pile of evidence that coronavirus vaccines protect pregnant people. A new paper showed that pregnant people can pass antibodies on to their fetus, and that breastmilk can pass antibodies along to infants. Another study found that the vaccine does not damage the placenta.  (Emily Anthes/&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yCQQf3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspectives &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="trV7c7"&gt;This week, the CDC changed its guidance for fully vaccinated people, saying that they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434645/vaccines-masks-social-distancing-cdc-covid"&gt;don’t have to wear masks&lt;/a&gt; in many settings. But masking won’t disappear overnight. Here are a few perspectives from people who are continuing to mask up, for a variety of reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="xgoNr5"&gt;“Maybe it’s because I’m a New Yorker or maybe it’s because I always feel like I have to present my best self to the world, but it has been such a relief to feel anonymous. It’s like having a force field around me that says ‘don’t see me’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KFi5nY"&gt;— ‘Francesca’ a professor, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/10/the-people-who-want-to-keep-masking-its-like-an-invisibility-cloak?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; why she’ll continue to wear a mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="tP16fT"&gt;“I know it’s a low percentage, but there are children who have gotten it and been affected. What if it was your kid? I would take a gamble on myself. But my children? Never.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="093DkB"&gt;— Jani Able, mother of two 7-year-olds &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/05/14/covid-19-cdc-mask-guidance-parents-young-children-coronavirus/5093405001/"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;why her family will continue to wear masks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6V62M0"&gt;“I still have fears that my husband will die even though we’re vaccinated...Just because I’ve read so many stories about people’s husbands dying. Or I have fears that my child will be that one kid who gets the rare syndrome, and visions of myself in the hospital. I have an overactive imagination. I tend to be anxious and impressionable. But I think a lot of people, not just me, are going through similar thoughts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8nPuBQ"&gt;— Frani, a woman in New York City &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93yye8/pandemic-safety-mask-lockdown-cant-quit-grief-trauma-anxiety"&gt;talks to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about why she’s still wearing a mask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Wd58Qi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eB0mEC"&gt;To the people who have received the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/"&gt;1.41 billion vaccine doses&lt;/a&gt; distributed so far — thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVY63I"&gt;To the more than 161,951,393 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMVaxk"&gt;To the families and friends of the 3,359,318 people who have died worldwide — 585,233 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MppEl6"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1pxQd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBfWHt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket suffers failure, loses payload of two satellites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/--Mym7fCDgbkzOvOWe8kXL6l068=/11x0:1382x914/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292048/Screen_Shot_2021_05_15_at_9.42.00_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket launches from New Zealand on Saturday, as seen on the company’s live video feed. | Rocket Lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RxHIoa"&gt;Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket failed to reach orbit after suffering an unexpected engine shutdown mid-flight on Saturday, losing the mission’s payload of two satellites, the company said. The launch from New Zealand was Electron’s 20th, and marked the company’s second mission failure in less than a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aATXd1"&gt;Electron, a roughly six-story tall rocket with two booster stages, lifted off from Rocket Lab’s Launch Complex 1 on the Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand at 7:11AM ET on Saturday, aiming to send a pair of Earth observation satellites for BlackSky into orbit. Two and a half minutes into flight, the rocket’s second stage booster successfully separated from its first stage and ignited for a few seconds before shutting down, indicating a problem as seen on the company’s launch live stream. Mission control lost telemetry of the booster shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVjl45"&gt;“An issue was experienced during today’s launch, resulting in the loss of the mission,” Rocket Lab &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RocketLab/status/1393531340188913665?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; after the failure. “We are deeply sorry to our launch customers BlackSky and Spaceflight. The issue occurred shortly after stage two ignition. More information will be provided as it becomes available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tj5Ods"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We will learn from this, and we’ll be back on the pad again”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1EGUpD"&gt;A secondary objective for the mission, dubbed “Running Out Of Toes,” involved a test of some hardware upgrades meant to improve Electron’s reusability, including a new heat shield for the booster’s reentry. The rocket’s first stage booster successfully splashed down in the ocean under parachutes as planned after lofting the second stage toward space, Rocket Lab said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcnL8L"&gt;The company is working with the Federal Aviation Administration to investigate the cause of Saturday’s issue to correct it for future missions, the statement said. “With multiple launch vehicles currently in production, Rocket Lab is prepared for a rapid return to flight as soon as investigations are complete and any required corrective actions are in place,” it said. No injuries or public damage were reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZCtUH"&gt;“We will learn from this, and we’ll be back on the pad again,” Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck said in the statement. BlackSky, the launch customer, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BlackSky_Inc/status/1393539335807397897?s=20"&gt;retweeted&lt;/a&gt; Rocket Lab’s statement, saying: “This is what we have received from Rocket Lab. We will continue to offer updates as we learn more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOsrWv"&gt;Electron’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/4/21313502/rocket-lab-electron-launch-failure-pics-or-it-didnt-happen"&gt;last failure&lt;/a&gt; occurred in July 2020, carrying and ultimately losing seven satellites after its second stage shut down early. Rocket Lab &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408378/rocket-lab-electron-return-to-flight-capella-space-sequoia-satellite#:~:text=But%20just%20a%20few%20minutes,and%20fell%20back%20to%20Earth."&gt;returned to flight&lt;/a&gt; two months later after pegging the failure on a faulty electrical connection, carrying on with six successful Electron missions thereafter. The company has launched 17 successful missions in all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Twitter policy that could temporarily censor every single one of your tweets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l-C9MND0vH5SM4VNjNpiHNWe6xs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69291957/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ay94xs"&gt;On Tuesday, a noted Palestinian-American journalist reporting live from protests near Jerusalem was suddenly and mysteriously silenced on Twitter — with every single tweet replaced by the message “@MariamBarghouti’s account is temporarily unavailable because it violates the Twitter Media Policy.” &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8b4x/twitter-said-it-restricted-palestinian-writers-account-by-accident"&gt;It was a mistake&lt;/a&gt;, the company quickly admitted, and her tweets were quickly restored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMMZwe"&gt;But it turns out that one part of the incident was &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;a mistake. While Twitter may have taken action on this person’s account in error, there actually is one particular situation where Twitter reserves the right to make your tweets disappear. And — if you ask me — it’s super, super dumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iOKPG7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;ive been on twitter what feels like my entire life and ive never seen before what they're doing to this palestinian journalist's account &lt;a href="https://t.co/z6bSmLCvNn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/z6bSmLCvNn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Casey Johnston (@caseyjohnston) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/caseyjohnston/status/1392235369614163976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7PWFPP"&gt;Twitter pointed me to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/notices-on-twitter"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://cdn.cms-twdigitalassets.com/content/dam/help-twitter/tombstones2/mediapolicymobile4.png"&gt;this specific image&lt;/a&gt; as an example of the policy, which seems like it could date back as far as October 2017: &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I found references to this policy on Twitter’s site dating back to 2018, though you can see an October 2017 timestamp on this theoretical example.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8H1aVo"&gt;There, the “Requiring media or profile edits” policy reads: “If an account’s profile or media content is not compliant with our policies, we may make it temporarily unavailable and require that the violator edit the media or information in their profile to comply with our rules. We also explain which policy their profile or media content has violated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bnvzS"&gt;Or, in plain English, if your profile picture, header image, or other picture you post doesn’t meet Twitter’s standards, Twitter won’t just censor that image — it may censor your entire account until you fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7M9wR"&gt;Why would Twitter need to notify people about a bad image on every single tweet from an author, instead of just omitting the image and perhaps providing an explanation? Over the past several years, we’ve seen many, many instances of Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296518/twitter-trump-video-manipulated-media-deepfake-carpe-donktum"&gt;choosing&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21554013/twitter-flags-president-trumps-tweets-votes-counted-election-pennsylvania"&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271207/twitter-donald-trump-fact-check-mail-in-voting-coronavirus-pandemic-california"&gt;warning labels&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254733/twitter-covid-19-misleading-information-label-warnings-misinformation"&gt;nearby&lt;/a&gt; offensive and damaging content, labels that still allow people to easily view those tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAMZqu"&gt;When I raised this question, a Twitter spokesperson would only say that the policy is designed to “better inform folks on the actions taken by Twitter.” The company declined to say more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbTRAL"&gt;The most generous explanation I can muster is that this is an old, antiquated policy that should have been retired long ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Scy2fG"&gt;Twitter also initially restricted Barghouti’s ability to tweet, retweet, follow and like for 12 hours, according to screenshots she provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not clear why her account was mistakenly censored to begin with; Twitter couldn’t immediately say whether it was a human action or an automated system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSqblk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly will continue to require masks in its US retail stores </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A man wearing a face mask is seen outside an Apple retail store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VhAl_w0FHoyVHyOw1lEddZEV8rE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69291913/1232558252.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple will keep its mask mandate in place at its US retail stores | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KWfcNW"&gt;Despite new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Apple will keep its mandatory mask policy in place at its US retail stores for the time being,&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-15/apple-stores-keep-mask-mandate-as-company-evaluates-measures?sref=10lNAhZ9"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The company informed stores that it is continuing to evaluate COVID-19-related health and safety measures, but that the policy requiring customers and employees at its Apple stores would stay in effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6U0Bt"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434645/vaccines-masks-social-distancing-cdc-covid"&gt;CDC announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that people who had been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus could do away with wearing masks indoors and outdoors, and did not have to continue social distancing. There are some exceptions to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html"&gt;CDC guidance&lt;/a&gt;, which recommends people continue masking on public transit, airplanes, and trains, and in health care settings such as a doctor’s office. Immunocompromised people are advised to consult their healthcare professional before discontinuing masks, and someone who develops new COVID-19 symptoms should start wearing masks again to be safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLw1dp"&gt;Some retail stores across the US &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2021/05/14/mask-mandate-stores-change-fully-vaccinated-cdc-no-masks-indoors/5102169001/"&gt;began lifting their mask requirements&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, with large companies including Walmart, Trader Joe’s, and Costco updating their policies. But Target and CVS were among the retailers who said they would keep their mask requirements in place as they assessed the CDC guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tza6u7"&gt;In its stores that have reopened— some are open on a limited basis — Apple currently requires customers and store employees to wear masks, and provides masks for customers that don’t have their own. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbrowse%2Fstore%2Fplan_your_visit&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F15%2F22437593%2Fapple-masks-retail-stores-covid-cdc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The company’s FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; also says it requires temperature checks before anyone is allowed to enter an Apple store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jd1X63"&gt;Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Our favorite pandemic gifts to ourselves</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kqsvsEEq4IsuOcNyKS5okTXeSs4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69291857/akrales_191008_3706_0164.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hbnGki"&gt;When you’ve been through tough times — and we all have — sometimes you just need a distraction or something that just makes you feel good to get you through it. We asked the staff of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; what they’ve treated themselves to in order to help make all the upheavals and lockdowns of the past year just a bit more bearable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jtnjoh"&gt;These are some of the things that made them smile over the past year. Hopefully, you’ve got something that made you smile as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a4FI6v"&gt;World of Warcraft subscription &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MCtE3J"&gt;Nothing feels like an escape more than a world of Orcs, Mages, and Warriors. I’ve played &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; off and on throughout the years, but — faced with hours of Netflix, in-home workouts, and utter boredom during the pandemic — I decided it was time to re-commit to playing. Nearly six months into my renewed subscription, I’m thankful for it. The winter was long, lonely, and dreary, but I found a community in &lt;em&gt;WoW&lt;/em&gt; that helped me mentally escape. I don’t know if I’ll continue playing once life starts returning back to normal, but I’m glad for the hours I spent in that magical little world. &lt;em&gt;— Kaitlin Hatton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1PbGX8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498504" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9VzBwI"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5WrWNM"&gt;Blue Apron&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vT3DXC"&gt;Blue Apron helped me get through lockdown (and continues to help) in more than one way. Early on, when going to the grocery store was about as fraught as a journey to Mordor, BA meant three fewer meals to shop for every week, which was a huge relief. It’s also been a low-effort way to help break up the “every day feels like Groundhog Day” monotony of dinner after dinner at home. I get to try something new but with pre-portioned ingredients and a recipe card holding my hand the whole way. Some of the meals have been more successful than others, and I’ve actually gained some confidence as a home cook — that’s huge for someone like me who can simultaneously worry that a piece of meat is both overcooked and undercooked. I don’t think I’ll keep the subscription in the long run, but I have a stack of recipe cards and a few more skills to rely on when I do decide to strike out on my own. &lt;em&gt;— Allison Johnson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OVUXLo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8tmMt0"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1TLgW7"&gt;Circular knitting needles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TKc8cE"&gt;Knitting is the only skill I have that’s never produced a catastrophic mental death spiral. And during a long year at home, I realized relying on straight needles — the things I almost exclusively associated with knitting when I started — is a sucker’s game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNTM6j"&gt;Circular needles are designed for making round projects like hats. It took me way too long to grasp that they’re great for shawls, scarves, and other flat-knit stuff, too. Also, screwing together different sizes of needles and cords &lt;a href="https://www.knitterspride.com/Materialwise-size-Details.asp?id=188"&gt;from an interchangeable set&lt;/a&gt; is inexplicably satisfying. I wish I’d bought this thing sooner — although my increasingly knitwear-laden friends and family might disagree. &lt;em&gt;— Adi Robertson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4UcwL4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498668"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Pfzff4"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tGCa5Y"&gt;Remodel your bed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2WEY5g"&gt;I got sick — not with COVID — in November and early December, and come January, I was still pretty exhausted. I was spending more time in bed than usual, so I thought, “Why not make bed more pleasant?” First, I bought the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slumbercloud.com%2Fproducts%2Fcore-mattress-pad&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22434062%2Fgifts-covid-favorite-warcraft-knitting-ps5-nintendo-echo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Slumber Cloud Nacreous Mattress Pad&lt;/a&gt;, which has kept my temperature pleasantly even. Then &lt;a href="https://brooklinen.pxf.io/c/482924/971323/12856?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brooklinen.com%2Fproducts%2Flinen-core-sheet-set%3Fvariant%3D43437481045&amp;amp;sharedid=VergePandemicGifts051421"&gt;Brooklinen’s Core Linen Set&lt;/a&gt; (in cream), which gets softer every time I wash my bedding and feels lovely on the skin. Finally, I added the &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/go/tempur-neck-pillow-best-pillows-for-neck-pain"&gt;Tempur-Pedic Tempur-Neck Pillow&lt;/a&gt;, which looks dorky but has been an absolute pleasure to sleep on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSvlNU"&gt;I’m back on my feet again, but these purchases keep paying off. I don’t think I’ve slept so well or thoroughly in years. There’s nothing better than crawling into a cozy bed and drifting off after a long day. &lt;em&gt;— Liz Lopatto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fUEksd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498716"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="e82Hu6"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="612JhG"&gt;Fully Jarvis standing desk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vSn2UV"&gt;I’ve required several unnecessary pick-me-up purchases during the pandemic, like a &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-2/dp/B08F7PTF53?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;. My latest purchase is the priciest yet, but it seems more logical. I just bought a Fully Jarvis standing desk so that I can actually stand up a few times during the day to get my blood flowing. There are several days per week when I really don’t move around as much as I should (even on the days I do move, I’m still not doing much), so I think this should help me out. If not, I can blame &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310104/remote-work-desk-home-set-up-jay-peters-macbook-xbox"&gt;Jay Peters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22395531/remote-work-desk-setup-from-home-office-tech"&gt;Dan Seifert&lt;/a&gt; for being effusive about their Fully Jarvis desks in their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22340755/whats-on-your-desk-setup-tech-verge"&gt;What’s on your desk?&lt;/a&gt; posts. I haven’t even received the desk yet, so I’m anxiously awaiting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adIsxr"&gt;Will it be my most fun pandemic gift to myself? Probably not. For one, this desk can’t play &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;. In seriousness, it’s one of the few things I’ve done for myself in the past year that takes my future well-being into consideration. That’s not easy to do these days, but I’m hopeful that I have this desk for many happy years to come and can look back on it as being my favorite pandemic gift. &lt;em&gt;— Cameron Faulkner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0GFRpf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10306098"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="15bVrT"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6Pyfxl"&gt;A water kettle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VZaYnk"&gt;Buying coffee equipment is like painting a house: the second you improve one part of your setup, it immediately exposes something else that needs an upgrade. So after switching to a Hario V60 coffee dripper for my home brewing, I quickly started lusting after a nice gooseneck kettle. Eventually, I picked the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coffee-Kettle-Hario-V60-Drip-Fitness/dp/B07C9GG9XH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hario V60 Fit Drip Kettle&lt;/a&gt; stovetop kettle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnneDr"&gt;I don’t think it’s the best pick for everyone — it doesn’t have a temperature gauge, and a lot of people prefer electric kettles over stove-top models — but it fits my needs perfectly. It’s got a nice plastic handle that doesn’t get hot as the water boils, it works on induction coils (which wasn’t a guarantee with &lt;a href="https://fellowproducts.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001717292-Is-Stagg-compatible-with-induction-cooktops-?and"&gt;Fellow’s otherwise beautiful Stagg kettle&lt;/a&gt;), and overall, it’s easy to control when you’re trying to deal with finicky pour-over coffee. Mostly though, I’m just glad it doesn’t have the weird ridged design of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hario.co.uk%2Fcollections%2Fcoffee-brew-kettles%2Fproducts%2Fv60-drip-kettle-buono-in-large&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22434062%2Fgifts-covid-favorite-warcraft-knitting-ps5-nintendo-echo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hario’s previous drip kettle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;— Jon Porter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L2fyuW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498783"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="SjqpHx"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EwlUA8"&gt;A PlayStation 4 and &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xrsCB8"&gt;Like many fans of the original &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt;, I followed the years of &lt;em&gt;Remake’s&lt;/em&gt; development with the hope that it would actually hold a candle to the classic PlayStation RPG. And to my surprise, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207441/final-fantasy-7-remake-ff7-review-ps4"&gt;the game turned out to actually be good&lt;/a&gt;, and that pushed me to drop nearly $400 to buy a PlayStation 4 just so I could play the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2AA4im"&gt;That was a big chunk of change, and I worried that I would regret spending all that cash just for a single game, but it was one of the best gifts I bought myself all last year. &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; was an absolute joy to play through, and it gave my wife and me hours of entertainment (and some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150661/entertainment-2020-music-games-movies-comfort-favorites"&gt;memorable quips&lt;/a&gt; from protagonist Cloud Strife).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOnfTc"&gt;Ever since I beat &lt;em&gt;FF7R&lt;/em&gt;, I’ve been working my way through the many fantastic PS4 games that I missed. I’ve also been lucky enough to snag a PS5 &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an Xbox Series X, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;which are fantastic machines for older games&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that I’m now spending even more time catching up on the last generation of gaming. And it’s all thanks to taking the leap on playing &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake. — Jay Peters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GXl4zA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oI39us"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="am2gnl"&gt;Pepper Cannon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GUklis"&gt;I moved into an apartment with a real person-sized kitchen at the beginning of the pandemic and found a renewed love for cooking. (I skipped the bread-baking trend.) That meant a lot of my favorite gadgets of the pandemic were things like my blender and my stand mixer. The gadget that really found the sweet spot between kitchen tool and super neat thing that scratches the gadget itch was the obscenely priced “pepper cannon” I kickstarted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9a6h5"&gt;I spent a lot of money on this “pepper cannon” that is designed to churn out more pepper with every turn. It is an expensive device, and its only job is to grind pepper, which means it is absolutely not worth the money. But the Pepper Cannon is so thoughtfully designed and good at its job that I don’t really mind I spent $150 months ago to back the Kickstarter. My eggs are perfectly speckled with pepper, and my steaks look gorgeously seasoned before they hit the grill. I used to have to pour peppercorns into a mortar to bulk grind them down to dust for rubs and soups, but now I can just give the pepper cannon a few turns and be done with it. &lt;em&gt;— Alex Cranz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jkisP4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498874"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Fta0u6"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TcZdIC"&gt;Ring Fit Adventure for Nintendo Switch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AIBbZc"&gt;Being instructed to stay at home made me feel less bad about not going to the gym, but there was a point in the pandemic where I really needed to get more exercise in my day. After playing hours of &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; on my couch, I realized the thing that was going to make me exercise was another video game: Nintendo’s &lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt; fitness RPG. In the game, you are performing a variety of exercise moves using a pilates ring and a leg strap both attached to the Switch’s Joy-Con controllers while you defeat monsters. This has made it fun and easy to get a good amount of exercise every day just by walking into my living room. Since I bought it, it has been a staple in my morning routine.  &lt;em&gt;—Andru Marino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gD6iIE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10273326"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CXlZax"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MXrPr9"&gt;Puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vFw8jq"&gt;My greatest comforts usually come in the form of tinkering and putting things together. I had grand plans to use pandemic time to finally repair some Super 8 film viewers that had been languishing in my family’s attic for years, but it’s now been many months of, “Maybe I’ll do that this weekend.” Instead, I’ve invested in things that scratch a similar itch: puzzles. I know puzzles, jigsaw or otherwise, can be divisive (several of my friends vocally hate them), but for me, there’s no better self-soothing activity than spending a few hours hunched over a bunch of pieces while I listen to podcasts or music. I will pester my spouse with announcements that I’m “in a puzzling mood” and need to be driven ASAP to the local puzzle store, where I can select a &lt;a href="https://www.mudpuppy.com/products/ocean-life-1000-piece-puzzle"&gt;sea creature jigsaw&lt;/a&gt; or a tiny model dinosaur skeleton that begs to be assembled and displayed on my shelf. I even splurged on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fnasa-space-shuttle-discovery-10283&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22434062%2Fgifts-covid-favorite-warcraft-knitting-ps5-nintendo-echo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lego Space Shuttle Discovery set&lt;/a&gt; and spent a full weekend achieving transcendence while aggravating my arthritis. — &lt;em&gt;Kait Sanchez&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AoHFy5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498907"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zig3Mv"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dcqt6m"&gt;Amazon Echo Show 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qlUu5y"&gt;Until the pandemic hit, I tried to visit my mother once a week or so. However, when lockdown hit, I realized that the visits would have to be put off indefinitely. So as soon as I could — in other words, as soon as I could visit briefly and with safeguards — I set her up with an Echo Show 8. This allowed me to do video calls with her more easily than having to direct her how to use Zoom (which may seem simple to us but is problematic for somebody who didn’t grow up with computers). It also lets her listen to music and get the weather just by asking for it, among other things.

    <title>Microsoft’s Surface Duo is down to $600 at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jKmlo0RRyTJeW5ZE8V_P-BW44lg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69291775/vpavic_4176_20200905_0061.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nS6yAp"&gt;This week brought some unexpected bargains by way of an eBay sitewide code that can knock up to $100 off a pricey purchase, such as a 4K TV, as well as an excellent Humble Bundle with 100 percent of proceeds going toward COVID-19 relief in India and Brazil. There are more, including a day-long sale on AT&amp;amp;T-locked Microsoft Surface Duo phones and more, so take a spin through this dispatch to see what we thought stood out from the rest in deals world this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="elQOar"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eoq8JU"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Duo is just $600 at Woot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Bzabl7"&gt;We featured a popular deal on the Surface Duo earlier this week, which had the foldable phone selling for $690. That was a great promotion, especially because it was for the version that worked on Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T. That deal is over now, but Woot is picking it back up and improving on the price. You can get the AT&amp;amp;T-locked version of the phone with &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13112648?sid=VergeWeekendDeal051521+&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fmicrosoft-surface-duo-dual-screen-lte-tablets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage for just $600&lt;/a&gt;. The 256GB version costs $670. This is good news if you’re on AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aydBWI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10497909"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="7XS5Er"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9c9Eru"&gt;Get a fantastic 4K TV for up to $100 off at eBay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zCYsWF"&gt;Whether you primarily game or watch sports, movies, or TV shows, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl"&gt;eBay is listing some really good televisions&lt;/a&gt;. Better yet, through Sunday, May 16th, you can get up to $100 off on eligible products when you use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;PICKSUMMER15&lt;/strong&gt;. The code actually knocks 15 percent off your purchase, but it caps the discount at $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3QADU"&gt;The TVs below are an even better value than usual because of this discount, so check them out if you’re in the market for an upgrade. Of course, this deal isn’t limited to TVs, so I suggest that you go to eBay and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fb%2FeBay-Coupons%2Fbn_7109765183%3F_trkparms%3D%2526clkid%253D1590810078023031888%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F15%2F22435896%2Fmicrosoft-surface-duo-foldable-android-phone-ebay-4k-tv-tcl-lg-samsung-oled-qled-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;see what else might appeal to you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="8ue3MQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462552"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="7vRNst"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iGnpkC"&gt;Buy the second-generation Apple Pencil for $20 off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HkSd7c"&gt;If you own one of the iPad Pro or iPad Air models that has a USB-C port, the second-generation Apple Pencil should make for a good companion if you want to draw or write. At Woot, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13142085?sid=VergeDeals&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation-3%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_1_1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get one of these rarely discounted accessories for $110 new&lt;/a&gt;. Other retailers are selling it for $130. Compared to the first-gen Apple Pencil that recharged via its Lightning jack, this one attaches magnetically onto the side of supported iPads and charges wirelessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5drZrP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500002"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="IvfqMe"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RQ8jIj"&gt;Two 20W USB-C wall adapters cost just $14 at Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPDz0n"&gt;The items above are a bit pricey. If you’re looking for something that’s less expensive but very useful, check out this deal on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08PG1BJ5T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RavPower’s two-pack of 20W USB-C chargers that costs $13.60 before tax&lt;/a&gt;. We highlighted this deal earlier in the week (it was almost $2 cheaper then) because it’s what iPhone users should get instead of buying Apple’s equivalent gadget that costs $20. It’s for more than just iPhones, though. It’ll fast-charge many Android phones, and it should work great with charging the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8myGG5"&gt;To get this deal, make sure to click the “Save an extra 15% when you apply this coupon” prompt located underneath the product price at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ofskZp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10495834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LyyPIp"&gt;Donate to COVID-19 relief, and get several great indie games, software, and more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6ol41e"&gt;The latest Humble Bundle package &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/humble-heal-covid-19-bundle?partner=VoxMedia"&gt;will turn your pledge&lt;/a&gt; for a smattering of indie games, software, and more into a donation to support COVID-19 relief in India and Brazil. Humble suggests at least a $25 pledge — and that’s very fair based on what you’re getting in exchange — but you can donate as much or as little as you can. To name a few games included, you’ll get &lt;em&gt;Into the Breach, Superhot, BioShock, The Witness, Undertale, Hyper Light Drifter&lt;/em&gt;, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China has landed on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CHINA-MARS PROBE-TIANWEN-1-FOURTH ORBITAL CORRECTION-IMAGE (CN)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ih73i8RnywtQ3XLKJsBj9fKMTR8=/0x625:3000x2625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69289643/1230995747.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A photo of Mars captured by China’s Tianwen-1 probe in February.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Xinhua via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JdVKlQ"&gt;China landed its first pair of robots on the surface of Mars on Friday, state-affiliated media &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CGTNOfficial/status/1393365096609435648"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; on social media, becoming the second country to do so successfully after overcoming a daring, seven-minute landing sequence. The country’s Tianwen-1 spacecraft ejected the rover-lander bundle for a Martian touchdown at around 7PM ET, kicking off a mission to study the Red Planet’s climate and geology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FshZmf"&gt;The mission marks China’s first independent trek to Mars, about 200 million miles away from Earth. Only NASA has successfully managed to land and operate rovers on the planet in the past. (The Soviet Union’s Mars 3 spacecraft landed on the planet in 1971 and communicated for about 20 seconds before unexpectedly going dark.) China’s mission, involving three spacecraft working together, is ambitiously complex for a first-timer — the first US mission, Viking 1 in 1976, only involved a lander deployed from its probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9wAYu"&gt;The landing took place at Utopia Planitia, a flat swath of Martian land and the same region where NASA’s Viking 2 lander touched down in 1976. After touching down, the lander will unfurl a ramp and deploy China’s Zhurong rover, a six-wheeled solar-powered robot named after the god of fire in ancient Chinese mythology. The rover carries a suite of onboard instruments, including two cameras, a Mars-Rover Subsurface Exploration Radar, Mars Magnetic Field Detector, and Mars Meteorology Monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xO5zKt"&gt;The Tianwen-1 spacecraft launched from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in China’s Hainan province on July 23rd last year, setting off on a seven-month trek to the Red Planet. The spacecraft trio “has functioned normally” since it entered Mars orbit in February, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said in a statement Friday morning. It collected a “huge amount” of scientific data and snapped photos of Mars while in its orbit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="CHINA-SPACE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ULe8kMJK8EHuP7dEA3b-DYwjFT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22514880/1231506139.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Wang Zhao / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c7DC5O"&gt;The Tianwen-1 orbiter, clutching the rover-lander bundle, has been scoping out the Utopia Planitia landing site for over three months, flying close to Mars every 49 hours in an elliptical orbit (an egg-shaped orbital pattern), according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalgeographic.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fchina-landing-rover-on-mars-in-high-stakes-mission&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F14%2F22436072%2Fchina-tianwen-1-mars-landing-zhurong-rover" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Andrew Jones&lt;/a&gt;, a journalist covering China’s activities in space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FzDYog"&gt;Now on the Martian surface, the Zhurong rover will embark on a mission of at least three months to study Mars’ climate and geology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8YZIL"&gt;“The main task of Tianwen-1 is to perform a global and extensive survey of the entire planet using the orbiter, and to send the rover to surface locations of scientific interests to conduct detailed investigations with high accuracy and resolution,” the mission’s top scientists &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1148-6"&gt;wrote in &lt;em&gt;Nature Astronomy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year. The roughly 240kg rover is nearly twice the mass of China’s Yutu Moon rovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCeNHw"&gt;Tianwen-1 is the name of the overall Mars mission, named after the long poem “Tianwen,” which means “Questions to Heaven.” It marks the latest in a quick succession of advances in space exploration for China. The country became the first nation in history to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18127180/china-national-space-administration-change-4-mission-lander-rover-far-side"&gt;land and operate a rover&lt;/a&gt; on the far side of the Moon in 2019. It also completed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178582/china-change-5-lunar-sample-return-mission"&gt;brief lunar sample mission&lt;/a&gt; in December last year, launching a robot to the Moon and swiftly returning it back to Earth with a cache of Moon rocks for evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="TOPSHOT-CHINA-SPACE-SCIENCE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y85DQ0quNu9280cKXeWsezLwK8o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496591/1232586805.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;China’s Long March 5B, the same rocket used to send Tianwen-1 to Mars, launches a space station module last month.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z8HI59"&gt;More recently, China launched the first core module of its planned space station, Tianhe, which will serve as living quarters for groups of astronauts. The rocket that launched that module spawned an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422791/china-long-march-5b-uncontrollable-rocket-stage-crash-low-risk-public"&gt;international freakout&lt;/a&gt; over where on Earth it might reenter. (It eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22426968/chinese-rocket-re-entered-earth-atmosphere"&gt;reentered&lt;/a&gt; over the Indian Ocean, and large chunks of the rocket splashed down roughly 30 miles off an island in the Maldives, the Chinese government said.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bp8QLx"&gt;Despite this ambitious trek to Mars with its trio of three robots, China’s focus seems to be fixed on the Moon — the same immediate destination for NASA’s Artemis program. Earlier this year, China &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321114/lunar-moon-space-station-russia-china-agreement-nasa"&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to build a lunar space station and base on the Moon’s surface with Russia, NASA’s longtime partner on the International Space Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGGleJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:12PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that we’re now waiting for official word from China as to whether the mission was a success or failure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJ1ApS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:47PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now with confirmation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter politely asks you to protect its targeted ad dollars in new iOS 14.5 prompt</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ubKsTG_gcfxb7B5-IGw6T3eiUqI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69290632/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="shKhfk"&gt;As part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt; forces developers to ask permission for something they used to be able to do for free: track iOS users. Today, Twitter is joining the ranks of other developers and adding a prompt that asks users to enable tracking on iOS (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/14/twitter-app-tracking-transparency-support/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJ2nR0"&gt;Twitter’s main justification for listening to its request is straightforward — having the feature enabled allows it to serve “better” ads. The company includes a link to settings so you can make those changes, but read Twitter’s explanation before you decide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZXbtIX"&gt;Keep ads relevant to you by allowing Twitter to track data from other companies on this device, like apps you use and websites you visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gEzkzL"&gt;The company also includes a link to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/about-ios-tracking"&gt;a support post&lt;/a&gt; in the Twitter help center which explains why it has to ask for permission, includes a link to its current App Privacy Policy, and goes over what enabling or disabling tracking does in iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SHLWi8XOwvk6Hm6F5shHPFyKnow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22515698/Image_23.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Twitter ad tracking prompt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bHoO3K"&gt;It’s a surprisingly low-key attempt to get users to allow Twitter to track them, considering the company highlighted Apple’s addition of App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14.5 as a potential risk in its recent &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1'21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;earnings statement (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="KRFfUZ"&gt;We continue to expect total revenue to grow faster than expenses in 2021, assuming the global pandemic continues to improve and that we see modest impact from the rollout of changes associated with iOS 14.5. How much faster will depend on various factors, including our execution on our direct response roadmap and macroeconomic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2fOfnN"&gt;Facebook and Instagram took &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415824/facebook-instagram-notice-ios-apps-free-privacy-tracking"&gt;a far more aggressive approach&lt;/a&gt; to convince users its use of ad tracking is on the up-and-up — even going as far as including a vague threat that enabling tracking will “help keep Facebook/Instagram free of charge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syShzs"&gt;Companies like Twitter and Facebook rely on tracking users to support their separate, often very lucrative ad businesses. After all, it’s usually ad sales that pay for free social networks,  and customer data helps to target those ads. As a company that’s more interested in selling hardware and subscription services, Apple doesn’t really have to worry about things like that, but brash changes like the new tracking permissions can leave developers scrambling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8Qksg"&gt;App Tracking Transparency has proven popular, though — around &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/"&gt;96 percent of US users&lt;/a&gt; are opting out of tracking according to some recent surveys. And with Google considering developing its own methods for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266823/google-anti-tracking-feature-android-privacy-apple-ios-app-tracking-transparency"&gt;blocking tracking on Android&lt;/a&gt;, we might just have to get used to apps coming to us and begging for free data.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="7rVASp"&gt;If you’re hoping to turn a dollar on that extremely explicit hentai you picked up in college, you won’t be selling it on eBay. As first &lt;a href="https://avn.com/business/articles/legal/breaking-ebay-to-ban-sale-of-all-adult-items-effective-june-15-900875.html"&gt;noticed by Adult Video News&lt;/a&gt;, eBay is banning the sale of most sexually explicit materials starting June 15th, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaiRGB"&gt;Everyone has a different definition of what constitutes “sexually explicit” and eBay’s is extremely PG. While the policy is confusing in that it appears to conflate nudity and sexually explicit content, it carefully defines nudity as “showing any part of male or female genitalia, anus, or female breasts where the areola or nipple is visible.” It goes on to say that those same bits don’t get a pass if they’re covered by see-through material or confined by tight clothing. The policy also classifies “people engaged in sexual contact or activity” as nudity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egr3Xf"&gt;It goes on to say “most adult-only items are prohibited” and includes “sexually explicit anime, comics, books, films, animation, manga, hentai, yaoi” as among the things considered adult only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRXPBU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fhelp%2Fpolicies%2Fprohibited-restricted-items%2Frestricted-adult-items-policy%3Fid%3D4278%26st%3D3%26pos%3D1%26query%3DRestricted%2520adult%2520items%2520policy%26intent%3Drestricted%2520adult%26lucenceai%3Dlucenceai%26docId%3DHELP1181&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F14%2F22436855%2Febay-sex-ban-june-15" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The policy, as written,&lt;/a&gt; would appear to ban the sale of &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, where “&lt;a href="https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Sexposition"&gt;sexposition&lt;/a&gt;” was all the rage, as well as films like &lt;em&gt;Blue is the Warmest Color&lt;/em&gt;. Your favorite romance novel would be safe (images, not words, appear to be the problem) but Alan Moore’s epic comic collection &lt;em&gt;Lost Girls&lt;/em&gt;, where Wendy from Peter Pan and Dorothy from &lt;em&gt;The Wizard of Oz&lt;/em&gt; just really go at it in more pages than I personally wanted to see, would not. Explicit comics, explicit manga, hentai, and yaoi, which a pedantic might say are all the same thing, would be forbidden under the policy as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwZSsO"&gt;The policy does, however, carve out an exemption for &lt;em&gt;Playboy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Playgirl&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mayfair&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Penthouse&lt;/em&gt;. Tasteful nudes sold in the Art section would also be allowed provided poses are acceptable and there are no sexual acts. What that means for prints of any version of Leda and the Swan is up to eBay. The same would likely go for the complete works of Katsushika Hokusai. The artist is best known for his woodblock print series featuring Mount Fuji, but was also known for his extremely explicit woodblock print erotica—including one of the earliest instances of “tentacle porn”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83aovF"&gt;Sex toys in unopened packages will continue to be permitted provided the packaging isn’t sexually explicit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dv6ASK"&gt;Censorship, even in a relatively open marketplace like eBay, is a notoriously tricky business. When &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18129532/tumblr-nsfw-porn-ban-fallout-storystream-updates-news"&gt;Tumblr attempted to deal with its porn problem&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, it saw traffic take a nosedive as horny users went elsewhere. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kvb7z/ebay-is-banning-hentai-and-other-adult-content"&gt;eBay told &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that this new ban was in the interest of safety. Banning all adult content should make it more difficult for bad actors to monetize revenge porn or other content published without the consent of all participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lextnd"&gt;When reached for comment eBay told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="1q4j1Z"&gt;eBay is committed to maintaining a safe and trusted marketplace. Starting June 15, 2021, items showing sexual content or sexually suggestive poses will no longer be allowed on eBay.com. The “Everything Else &amp;gt; Adult Only” will no longer be available as a category. No new listings will be allowed in the Adult Only category and good-til-cancelled listings will be ended upon their renewal date. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Venmo shows who you’re friends with even if you’re Joe Biden</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N8xFgN"&gt;Venmo has a major privacy flaw that’s been well-known &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-wrong-with-your-venmo-account-and-how-to-fix-it-1543932128"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/evjxqa/venmo-letter-eff-mozilla-public-by-default-settings"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;: there’s no way to keep your list of Venmo contacts private. That means you can see the contact list of any user on the platform, a flaw that’s so large that &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; was able to track down President Joe Biden’s Venmo account &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/we-found-joe-bidens-secret-venmo"&gt;in less than 10 minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv1htD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; didn’t just find the president, though; the publication also discovered accounts for many people in Biden’s inner circle, and, because of the nature of this flaw, all of &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; contacts as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="BCmibJ"&gt;BuzzFeed News found nearly a dozen Biden family members and mapped out a social web that encompasses not only the first family, but a wide network of people around them, including the president’s children, grandchildren, senior White House officials, and all of their contacts on Venmo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SQahvk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; dug in after seeing a mention of Biden sending his grandchildren money over Venmo &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/us/politics/joe-biden-policy-decisions.html"&gt;in a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article published Friday&lt;/a&gt;. Biden’s transactions weren’t public (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/8/22374698/venmo-feed-matt-gaetz-public"&gt;unlike Matt Gaetz’s, at one point&lt;/a&gt;), and all of Biden’s friends on Venmo were removed after &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; contacted the White House for comment, the publication reported. (Venmo gives you the ability to remove contacts, but you have to do it manually.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSuOBJ"&gt;When asked for comment on the situation, Venmo provided the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Ikpe77"&gt;The safety and privacy of all Venmo users and their information is always a top priority, and we take this responsibility very seriously. Customers always have the ability to make their transactions private and determine their own privacy settings in the app. We’re consistently evolving and strengthening the privacy measures for all Venmo users to continue to provide a safe, secure place to send and spend money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="XwdIiA"&gt;As of press time, Venmo has not replied to a question asking if the company plans to let people make their contact lists private, which could help prevent something like this from happening in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
