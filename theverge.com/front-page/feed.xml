    <title>Alienware’s latest gaming laptops can now be configured with Cherry MX switches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P_0zYZDwXDjIK0ppak_gDbITOyA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986482/cfaulkner_200826_4165_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M15 R3 is pictured here, though the switches can only be configured on the latest R4.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5lrIud"&gt;Alienware and Cherry have worked together to cram what both companies are calling the “first true” mechanical keyboard into a gaming laptop. Starting March 18th, you’ll be able to purchase Alienware’s M15 R4 or M17 R4 laptops and upgrade them to a Cherry MX mechanical keyboard for an extra $150 at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZSGfR"&gt;The laptops will house a new kind of Cherry switch called the MX Ultra Low Profile, which is 3.5mm thick (compared to the 11.9mm-sized MX Low Profile switch). The switch is built with stainless steel wings that swing open and push down — picture the way a DeLorean’s car doors open and close. (Cherry not-so-subtly teased these new switches with a picture of the famously heavy car that’s built with stainless steel). The rest of the switch is made of thermoplastic polymer that can withstand high temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZVfZJxzskkZnOb5wdg0lA5ua_RU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374417/mxultralow.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Cherry&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GVigzC"&gt;Cherry touts 1.8mm of total travel for this switch, which the company says provides a satisfying amount of feedback. The design of the switch is also said to improve typing accuracy, as well as self-clean with each press to prevent particles from messing it up over time. And, based on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Alienware/status/1372216233819521028"&gt;this tweet from Alienware&lt;/a&gt;, the switches seem like they’ll have that signature “thock” sound that’s associated with mechanical keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Cherry MX Ultra Low Profile" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nZCqlwKKSWvzB9bDfQJvHKGjedw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374420/GIF_ULP.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Cherry&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new MX Ultra Low switch in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NDyBrI"&gt;As for its integration into the latest Alienware M15 and M17 R4 laptops, the companies say that the laptop designs didn’t need to be tweaked at all to accommodate the new Cherry switch. The lids will still close just fine, which seems like a testament to how thin the switch is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ez22W9"&gt;When you purchase the Cherry upgrade, you’ll get per-key RGB backlighting and AlienFX customization, along with full N-key rollover with anti-ghosting, so it won’t get overloaded when you’re pressing a lot of keys at once. One thing to note is that when you get the keyboard upgrade, all keys, aside from the function row, will have the Cherry MX Ultra Low Profile switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Fz524"&gt;I haven’t had the chance to try out these new switches, so I can’t attest to how they feel compared not only to other Cherry MX switches but to the switches Alienware typically uses as well. Admittedly, $150 is a steep add-on for a laptop that’s already going to cost you a lot of money, but it could end up being a good investment if you’re obsessed with mechanical keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s everything we know about the new OnePlus phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lE-2gDCTGXNR5XV-8rXMMGMVx7s=/0x0:627x418/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986485/Ewgs_gjUcAMIE12.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3I8qce"&gt;OnePlus has an upcoming event on March 23rd, where it’ll be formally announcing the OnePlus 9, and OnePlus 9 Pro. As with any smartphone event these days, there’s a ton of information about what will be revealed at the event, thanks in no small part to OnePlus itself doling out pieces of news over the past couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VbxpkT"&gt;Confirmed by OnePlus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WmyBTC"&gt;OnePlus has been in the habit lately of trying to build up suspense for its events, which is why you see it and its executives just tweeting out information about the phones. Here’s what we’ve learned from them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8N3qvy"&gt;Chargers? In the box&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kgVwo9"&gt;OnePlus’s CEO, Pete Lau, has confirmed on a forum post that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319657/oneplus-9-charger-in-box-pete-lau-announcement"&gt;will be including a charger in the box&lt;/a&gt; with the 9-series phones, instead of going the route that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22225930/samsung-galaxy-s21-no-charger-brick-headphones-price"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; have taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BKDz3r"&gt;The Pro will have 50W wireless charging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6LSMRg"&gt;OnePlus has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22099073"&gt;let &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;try the 9 Pro’s 50W wireless charging&lt;/a&gt;, and it is indeed fast, charging the phone from 1 to 100% in 43 minutes. If you prefer charging with a cable, both the Pro and regular 9 will support 65W wired charging as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3IqcIH"&gt;OnePlus has already shown off the design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3qPDX1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/tech/oneplus-says-screw-it-heres-the-oneplus-9-pro-photos-from-every-angle"&gt;Input has a collection&lt;/a&gt; of all the images that OnePlus has posted of the 9 Pro on Twitter, and there’s not a ton left to the imagination. It does, in fact, look like a smartphone, with USB-C port on the bottom, and a camera bump.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d_J0Z-X41ti1g5WJVCjBt0YCtB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22377986/1_M00_22_12_rB8bwmBQEOWACzO_AAZ7LBXLBP0204.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hasselblad branding and a variety of lenses. The 9 is on the left, the 9 Pro on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Zo1q43"&gt;OnePlus is focusing on cameras&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9nfFNG"&gt;We know that the legendary camera company Hasselblad will be working on &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-9-exclusive-ceo-pete-lau-on-its-new-camera-and-whats-next"&gt;providing “color expertise” for the phones’ cameras&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus has been dropping subtle hints about the collaboration, like centering its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306934/oneplus-9-launch-event-date-moonshot-pete-lau"&gt;marketing material around the moon&lt;/a&gt; (when Apollo astronauts went to the moon, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise"&gt;they took Hasselblad cameras&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/tech/oneplus-says-screw-it-heres-the-oneplus-9-pro-photos-from-every-angle"&gt;releasing pictures of the phones&lt;/a&gt;, which have the word “Hasselblad” written on the camera modules. And having a Hasselblad section on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Flaunch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F18%2F22334396%2Foneplus-9-march-23rd-event-rumor-announcement-roundup-smartwatch-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the phone’s launch page&lt;/a&gt;. Okay, maybe it’s not so subtle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2t2j5X"&gt;When it comes to the capabilities of those cameras, we can look at an &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-9-exclusive-ceo-pete-lau-on-its-new-camera-and-whats-next"&gt;interview Pete Lau did with &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He talks about the phones working with Sony to make a custom IMX789 sensor (something he’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1369304680241762311"&gt;also tweeted about&lt;/a&gt;), and mentions that they will be capable of shooting 4K at 120FPS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsIHrY"&gt;What the camera capabilities of the 9 Pro versus the regular 9 are will probably have to wait for the official announcement — but the pictures released by OnePlus show that the Pro seems to have four cameras, where the regular only has three. As with past OnePlus phones, at least one of the cameras &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1369304680241762311"&gt;will be an ultra-wide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="T3LZsr"&gt;Of course, the phones will be 5G-capable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="YLd2pZ"&gt;The OnePlus 8 series had 5G, and the 9 series will too, as indicated by the “5G” superscript on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1371400783950970881"&gt;OnePlus’s announcement images&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2vdq5B"&gt;There will be a smartwatch launched as well&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xYowLD"&gt;OnePlus has already released a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1372170855661330436?s=20"&gt;teaser video of the device&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/17/oneplus-watch-wear-os-confirmed/"&gt;confirmed that it won’t be running Google’s Wear OS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vXVuXF"&gt;The phones will use the Snapdragon 888&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VUJYho"&gt;OnePlus is continuing its tradition of including Qualcomm’s flagship-class processor, according to tweets &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1372193579674841090?s=20"&gt;from Pete Lau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1372140664868208643?s=20"&gt;the OnePlus account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hXzd1h"&gt;What we know about the displays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FqInCT"&gt;Pete Lau also tweeted out most of the details about the 9 Pro’s display:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jQovJ1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just the rundown: &lt;br&gt;LTPO&lt;br&gt;QHD+ &lt;br&gt;Smart 120Hz &lt;br&gt;Native 10-bit color depth (1.07 billion colors)&lt;br&gt;1300 nits&lt;br&gt;MEMC&lt;br&gt;HDR10+&lt;/p&gt;— Pete Lau (@PeteLau) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1371817947694514176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aam7r6"&gt;LTPO displays &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;can run at different refresh rates&lt;/a&gt; depending on the content being displayed, meaning that the OnePlus 9 screens should be able to sip power when displaying static images, but still provide smooth animations &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1371830276926668801?s=20"&gt;at 120Hz when you’re actually using the phone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;PC Mag&lt;/em&gt; has already seen &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/exclusive-first-test-results-of-the-radical-oneplus-9-pro-display"&gt;in-depth testing results&lt;/a&gt; from the Pro’s screen, showing its power usage, and 360Hz touch-polling rate, which should lead to improved responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71ix5v"&gt;Also new to the Pro is a 10-bit display which should, in theory, show colors more accurately. Otherwise, it’s packing many of the same features as the screen on the OnePlus 8 Pro, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219861/oneplus-8-pro-review-specs-features-price-camera-battery-photos-video"&gt;is not a complaint&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, unless you don’t like big screens — &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/exclusive-first-test-results-of-the-radical-oneplus-9-pro-display"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Pro’s display is 6.7 inches, the same size as an iPhone Pro Max or Galaxy Note 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UOnjXq"&gt;Colors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="almzN5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1371400783950970881"&gt;We’ve officially seen&lt;/a&gt; the Pro’s Morning Mist (silver) and regular OnePlus 9’s Winter Mist (purple) colors, but...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="456Leu"&gt;Left to the Imagination (and leaks)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="u71pvB"&gt;... &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323979/oneplus-9-pro-leak-images-hasselblad-camera"&gt;there have also been leaks showing off other colors&lt;/a&gt;, like a forest green on the Pro, and a blue for the regular OnePlus 9. And, of course, there are black versions of each phone as well (I anxiously await to see if OnePlus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230934/samsung-galaxy-s21-phantom-black-phone-color"&gt;makes a big deal about it in the presentation&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IB9KKz"&gt;The Regular 9 will have a (slightly) smaller screen than the Pro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QE1Lvf"&gt;While OnePlus officially shared the Pro’s screen size with &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, the details of the regular 9 weren’t mentioned. &lt;a href="http://www.slashleaks.com/l/oneplus-9-key-specs-leaked-through-aida64"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slashleaks&lt;/em&gt; indicates&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be 6.55 inches, and have a slightly lower resolution of 1080 x 2400, as opposed to the 1440 x 3216 reported for the Pro by &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eF2bOf"&gt;A third phone?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5Vdj7q"&gt;There are also rumors of a third phone, which may be called the 9R or the 9 Lite. &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-lite-snapdragon-865-will-launch-alongside-oneplus-9-9-pro"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports that it may have a stepped-down, Snapdragon 865 processor, but apart from that not much else is known. Will it actually happen? We’ll have to see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="tm7ffh"&gt;
&lt;p id="IkhucV"&gt;It seems that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus"&gt;OnePlus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau"&gt;its CEO&lt;/a&gt; are going to be posting more details on Twitter during the lead-up to the event, but at this point it seems like we’ve got a good outline of what the phones will be like. Now, it’s just waiting until the 23rd, at 10AM ET, to have the details filled in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Shorts arrives in the US to take on TikTok, but the beta is still half-baked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Three screenshots showing the interface of YouTube Shorts in beta. One shows a video, another shows a carousel of videos on the YouTube app’s main screen, and the third shows a grid of videos using the same sound." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IMNVQr_wWWXlyTJpAm2SjCuITew=/0x1:4332x2889/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986542/youtube_shorts_beta.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube Shorts in beta. | Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pRwCZZ"&gt;YouTube Shorts, the company’s short-form answer to TikTok, is launching in beta in the United States starting today. The short video format has already been available for several months in India, but today marks its debut stateside (along with the addition of several new features).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ILMCqB"&gt;For the beta launch, YouTube Shorts will feature all the basics of any TikTok clone: a multi-segment camera that makes it easy for creators to quickly string together clips, a wide selection of music tracks (with catalogs from “over 250 labels and publishers”), and a robust-looking captioning tool, the last of which is debuting alongside the US launch. “We really want to create a playground of creativity here where we give creators the raw materials to produce great videos,” says Todd Sherman, YouTube’s product lead for Shorts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FawHsP"&gt;Like TikTok, users will be able to swipe through an endless, algorithmically generated feed of short videos, subscribe to their favorite creators, explore specific hashtags or sounds, and remix other videos’ audio tracks. Even the interface looks similar to TikTok’s player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eJpGsV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Shorts is for “that next generation of creators” who may find traditional YouTube “too difficult”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UVHp0a"&gt;But instead of getting its own app, Shorts will live on a new carousel on the home tab of the mobile YouTube app. (The company is also experimenting with a dedicated Shorts tab.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9VjF8"&gt;And while Shorts checks off a lot of the basics, it’s missing plenty of features that make TikTok such a unique viral hit. There’s virtually no collaborative features available in Shorts at launch — so users won’t be able to reply to other videos or join together in a version of TikTok’s popular duet or stitch features. Also missing is a way to view a more curated feed. For now, Shorts only offers its main, algorithmic feed (similar to TikTok’s “For You” page), with no option to only view videos from accounts to which you’ve subscribed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MeIpWM"&gt;Sherman says that the company views Shorts as a new avenue for the next generation of content creators to emerge. YouTube itself is filled with a hyper-competitive landscape of established creators who specialize in making videos that typically run 10 minutes or longer. Shorts offers creators a chance to break that mold, much like what YouTube originally offered to internet creators when it first launched in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPOT6P"&gt;“I think the real core of what Shorts is about is enabling that next generation of creators that maybe even found it too difficult, previously, to even consider creating on YouTube,” Sherman explains. “And if we can help fulfill our mission of giving them a voice, then I think that would make us feel like we’re continuing to grow a YouTube in a way that keeps it relevant for this next generation of creators to find a voice on this platform.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qqw9qe"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9GrfXSNmTpQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UHhB4l"&gt;That’s not to say that Shorts won’t offer anything to existing creators. For starters, YouTube will share subscriptions across traditional channels and Shorts. So any users that find your content in Shorts and subscribe to get more of it will also be signing up for any long-form videos, and creators with tons of subscribers already will have a built-in audience to whom they can deliver Shorts. In at least one implementation of Shorts that the company is trying, Shorts videos will appear directly in users’ subscription tabs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UCHBZ6"&gt;According to Sherman, YouTube has some big plans for how it’ll tie Shorts into the broader YouTube ecosystem down the line — features that might help the fledgling service stand out in a crowded field that’s already dominated by TikTok and other (less established) competitors like Instagram’s Reels or Snapchat’s Spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="be4hQm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube hasn’t shared how creators can monetize their videos yet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oVVlwT"&gt;And those features are going to be essential: YouTube is coming very late to a party that’s already ruled by TikTok, and as Reels and Spotlight have shown, its no small task to not only replicate but outdo TikTok’s seemingly magical blend of algorithmic alchemy, collaborative tools, and viral trends. Unfortunately, YouTube Shorts is already playing catch-up, and its uniquely YouTube features are still very half-baked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6TCszX"&gt;Shorts does have a few clever ties into traditional YouTube videos: at launch, creators will be able to jump right to creating a Short from music videos for licensed songs, for instance. And in the future, the company plans to allow users to remix sound from any YouTube video for use in Shorts, a potential goldmine of content for creators to remix into new memes and videos. (YouTube users will be able to opt out, if they’d prefer to not have their audios used.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXkco5"&gt;But Shorts just still barely scratches the surface. For example, Shorts that use a song clip can link out to the music video on YouTube proper, but there’s no easy collection or link to find Shorts of a song from the regular video player, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n9tTPk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-ay_m4AljU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nipIP5"&gt;While it’s starting from behind, YouTube is an unparalleled force for videos online, and the fact that creators can seamlessly transition between Shorts and long-form videos — while bringing their audiences with them — isn’t something to discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6W2tQa"&gt;“As we grow Shorts, we can connect that ecosystem to the broader YouTube. And that means that if you are a short-form creator and you grow to be a long-form creator, that audience can grow with you,” Sherman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9KGtc9"&gt;Being able to directly link to the original sources of content for audio — whether it be a song, a movie clip, or a snippet of an interview — is also a powerful advantage for YouTube, as is the sheer size of the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsToCe"&gt;As Sherman explains, “One of the underpinnings that has helped so many people become creators is that you if give them high-quality inputs, they’re more likely to get to high-quality outputs by remixing other things.” And if you’re looking for videos to input, it’s hard to find a bigger source of them than Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgwnQF"&gt;But there are still big unanswered questions that YouTube has to figure out about Shorts — chief among them, how creators will make money. “I think the world has come to expect YouTube to support creators. And I think that’s going to extend to Shorts also,” says Sherman. “The way we think about it is: television has a different business model than movies, YouTube has a different business model than television, and short-form video is going to have a different business model than long-form YouTube.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bsojl"&gt;For now, though, YouTube isn’t making any announcements as to what monetization options will look like on Shorts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNZeIH"&gt;Another big question is what — if anything — YouTube is planning to do to make sure that Shorts doesn’t end up as another place for clout-chasing content farmers to just repost popular TikToks and reap the rewards (something that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274332/instagram-algorithm-tiktok-watermark-recommendation-software-best-practices"&gt;Instagram Reels continues to struggle with&lt;/a&gt;.) Sherman says that it’s something that the Shorts team is looking into, but that they have a fine line to walk: YouTube doesn’t want to discourage creators from posting their content on multiple platforms, but it also doesn’t want people just reposting videos from other people that they just downloaded off TikTok either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqtuBc"&gt;The company says that it’ll take a bit of time for Shorts to roll out, but that it should “be available to everybody in the US over the next several weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8m8t7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZPxVF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGAANN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZhz1X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wK8g6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify says over 13,000 artists’ catalogs earned at least $50K in royalties last year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8epCtJAbMrnabV7a9zaExY7ZORk=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986490/spotrev.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wfB3yD"&gt;Musicians aren’t thrilled with Spotify — they say the streaming platform undervalues their work and they deserve to be paid more per stream. So today, Spotify’s trying to address those concerns with &lt;a href="https://loudandclear.byspotify.com/"&gt;a new website&lt;/a&gt; called Loud &amp;amp; Clear, which offers more insight into how much the platform pays artists and how that money is distributed. The site also includes a calculator so artists can see where their work ranks on Spotify, like how a song with 100,000 all-time streams would only be in the top 2,710,000 tracks on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VfzrGo"&gt;Notably, the company says it’s paid over $23 billion in royalties to rights holders, including over $5 billion in 2020, which is up from $3.3 billion in 2017. It also notes that there are 1.2 million artists with over 1,000 listeners on the platform — it doesn’t say how many artists there are total — and that 15 percent, or 184,500, of their catalogs generated recording and publishing royalties of at least $1,000. (Those payments don’t go directly to artists and are instead paid to their rights holders, like distributors or record labels, which then refer to the contracts they hold with artists to pay them. This means the artists likely didn’t receive the full $1,000 from their Spotify streams.) On the higher end, only 870 artists’ catalogs generated $1 million or more in royalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="473M5n"&gt;You can play around with the website to see all the data and, if you have questions about how streaming royalties work and how the company figures out how much to pay rights holders, there’s a video on that. I’m embedding it below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MyvHLv"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z4UMr0bYmjY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OKK0P8"&gt;Spotify’s increased interest in transparency comes about during a time when a couple of its competitors are experimenting with new ways to pay artists. Earlier this month, SoundCloud &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309090/soundcloud-artist-stream-pay-listener-fan-royalties"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’d pay indie artists based on their actual listeners, rather than share of overall streams. So a SoundCloud subscriber’s subscription fee or advertising revenue is divvied up among the artists they actually listen to, rather than going to a big pot and being split up and shared with the platform’s most popular artists, like Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGTHSz"&gt;In a chat with&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Charlie Hellman, Spotify’s VP and head of marketplace, noted that the company’s internal research doesn’t suggest that this model would meaningfully shift the types of artists that succeed, but that if the industry decided to move toward the change, Spotify would be “open” to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IunQ6"&gt;Maybe transparency will help artists feel like Spotify isn’t just profiting from their work, but it’s hard to imagine that being the case. Spotify, to its credit, has attempted to make it easier for artists to directly profit, with features like &lt;a href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/introducing-artist-fundraising-pick"&gt;a tip jar&lt;/a&gt; and the ability to &lt;a href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-sell-merch"&gt;sell merch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://artists.spotify.com/faq/concerts#how-can-i-promote-my-concerts-on-spotify"&gt;concert tickets&lt;/a&gt; through the platform. But how much artists have earned through those features isn’t detailed on this new website, and the website makes clear that hundreds of thousands of artists earn far less than a living wage through the platform’s streams.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia is doubling the price of its GeForce Now cloud gaming service for new users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pd0DnHL34VOPeEmsbnagVbDH3aA=/154x0:1174x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986494/GFN.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bID7w7"&gt;Nvidia on Thursday announced a &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/03/18/geforce-now-priority/"&gt;new subscription tier for its GeForce Now cloud gaming service&lt;/a&gt; called Priority that will replace its existing paid Founders tier and contain the same perks like extended session length and RTX support. The catch: the change will come with a price increase, from what used to be a $4.99-per-month subscription to what will now be a $9.99-per-month one for new subscribers. Nvidia will also start offering a $99.99-per-year Priority subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfeFDZ"&gt;However, those who had active memberships as of yesterday, March 17th, will be eligible for the Founders pricing for life, Nvidia says, which comes out to a little less than $60 per year. The company still plans to offer a free tier of GeForce Now, too, but that tier restricts you to a one-hour session length. Nvidia says the price hike is meant to represent the platform’s evolution since it launched in beta way back in 2015 and entered what Nvidia has referred to as a public testing phase a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="psB8X2"&gt;“As GeForce Now enters year two, and rapidly approaches 10 million members, the service is ready to kick things up a notch,” the company said in a statement. “GeForce Now launched out of beta last February with Founders memberships — a limited time, promotional plan. On Thursday, Founders memberships will close to new registrations and Priority memberships, the new premium offering, will be introduced.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pS6Y4EW-SiD2n7D0V-c46HzhyjY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22378196/gfn_product_matrix_monthly.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iLA4D1"&gt;Those who have tried out GeForce Now with a Founders subscription but let that subscription lapse may be displeased to find out that Nvidia does not intend to give the $4.99-per-month pricing to anyone who may have been a paying subscriber in the recent past, even if you let your subscription lapse a few days ago. You’ll need to have been an active, paying Founders member as of yesterday, and you’ll also need to keep the membership active to continue paying the reduced price. If you cancel, you’ll lose the promotion for good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMrHhO"&gt;“Members need to be subscribed to the Founders membership as of 3/17/2021, and keep their membership in good standing, to be eligible for the benefit. If you were previously a Founders member but downgraded, unfortunately you’re not eligible,” an Nvidia spokesperson clarified to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H18isl"&gt;To its credit, Nvidia hasn’t sold monthly memberships for some time now, instead selling a promotional six-month bundle for $24.99. That makes it less likely that someone who subscribed any time in the last few months will find themselves ineligible for this Founders pricing perk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsj1rH"&gt;Nvidia intends to continue upping its investment in the platform as it’s proved quite successful, with close to 10 million members, in the otherwise struggling cloud gaming scene. Most recently, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"&gt;closed down its in-house game development studios&lt;/a&gt; creating titles for its Stadia service, while Amazon’s Luna platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22177222/amazon-luna-android-cloud-gaming-google-pixel-samsung-oneplus"&gt;remains in beta&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="h1RulK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Founders is gone for good, replaced by the $9.99 Priority subscription&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L5O9ol"&gt;GeForce Now differs from those platforms by letting members stream games they’ve already purchased from Epic, Steam, and other digital distributors over the cloud. The service’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161469/nvidia-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-service-developers-controversy-licensing"&gt;paid tier launch last year was a bumpy one&lt;/a&gt; after high-profile publishers like Activision Blizzard and 2K Games pulled their libraries, the dispute caused by Nvidia streaming those companies’ games without explicit permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BR3Zk9"&gt;Since then, Nvidia has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272558/nvidia-geforce-now-opt-in-agreement-game-developers-publishers-licensing-cloud-gaming"&gt;switched to an opt-in model&lt;/a&gt; to court game makers to the platform on friendlier terms, a strategy that’s paid off as Nvidia has added roughly 10 new games to the platform every week. The company now has a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce-now%2Fgames%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F18%2F22336600%2Fnvidia-geforce-now-price-tier-cloud-gaming-subscription" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full list of supported titles on its website&lt;/a&gt;, a welcome addition after the rocky licensing fallout of last spring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mB2WLs"&gt;Nvidia says the tech will keep improving over time, while its “GFN Thursday” new game onboarding will jump from 10 new titles added per week to 15 by the end of the year. GeForce Now will later this month get support for Adaptive Vsync, which “synchronizes frame rates at 60 or 59.94 Hz server-side to match the display client-side, reducing stutter and latency on supported games,” the company explains. Nvidia says it’s also releasing a “new adaptive de-jitter technology” to increase bit rates for games streamed over slower networks. (Nvidia could not, however, provide a timeline for when the platform will support 4K streaming when asked.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NimvT9"&gt;Other benefits coming soon include account linking for games with cross-platform support and improvements to preloading to cut down load times by half, both coming in the next one to two months. Nvidia says it’s also adding data center capacity in Phoenix, Arizona, as well as bringing online its first Canadian data center in Montreal later this year, both of which will help reduce wait times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gtwvH"&gt;As for the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;iOS beta&lt;/a&gt;, which launched back in November, Nvidia didn’t have much new to share. But a company spokesperson did say that “all previously announced projects continue to be on the roadmap in collaboration with the team at Epic,” referencing the ongoing work to bring Epic’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;back to the iPhone and iPad via GeForce Now on the mobile web after it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;banned by Apple and Google last summer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where to buy AMD’s Radeon RX 6700 XT graphics card </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UwbfPEKP6O0W2W1x6P6kJ1_PeuQ=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986439/twarren_210315_4475_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zVPNQ3"&gt;AMD’s new Radeon RX 6700 XT GPU will be available to purchase today starting at 6AM PT / 9AM ET, with a retail price of $479.99. Like other GPUs released within the last few months, AMD’s latest Radeon RX graphics card will likely sell out quickly, though AMD tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be able to buy this graphics card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJPSYV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Sean Hollister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/3/17/22334662/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-review-gpu-graphics-card"&gt;reviewed the RX 6700 XT&lt;/a&gt; and noted in his review that the GPU is a solid performer that delivers a 1440p experience for most games, but the performance is not quite as good when compared to Nvidia's 3060 Ti and RTX 3070 cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2iQMu"&gt;So far, only Micro Center has listings up for various iterations of AMD’s Radeon RX 6700 XT GPU. We will continue to update the list of cards and retailers selling them as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WallStreetBets donates more than $350,000 to gorilla charity to prove ‘apes together strong’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Congo Battles To Save Wildlife After Years Of War And Poaching" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J6rACJbevgH9H1oRzohQ11n6_5o=/0x3:3000x2003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986413/71495571.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nj78JL"&gt;“Apes together strong” is one of the mottoes of Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets community. Now, members of the financial subreddit are making good on one of their favorite memes by donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to charities supporting gorillas in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HZHVb"&gt;The most prominent recipient of the redditors’ generosity is the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, whose president and CEO Tara Stoinski describes it as “the world’s largest and longest running organization that is fully dedicated to gorilla conservation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPCygv"&gt;The fund has so far received more than $350,000 in donations, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56416954"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with redditors adopting approximately 3,500 endangered gorillas in six days. For comparison, the charity says it usually registers 20 adoptions in a typical weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xKUjbc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’ve truly made a difference for our world”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wjV4dN"&gt;Stoinski told &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“They’ve truly made a difference for our world and shown what can be accomplished when people come together. When we save gorillas and we save forests, we save our world.” In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SavingGorillas/status/1371507425346523136"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the charity said that all the funds “will go straight into our field programs, where 365 days a year we’re tracking, monitoring and studying wild gorillas and their habitat, and helping people who share their first home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PNp9EM"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created='"2021-03-18T11:43:59.940375+00:00"'&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4i2ib/a_message_to_wsb_from_the_director_of_the_dian/?ref_source=embed&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;A message to WSB from the Director of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund!&lt;/a&gt; from
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/"&gt;wallstreetbets&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;script async="" src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="svFuy6"&gt;Stoinski posted a video to r/WallStreetBets earlier this week, thanking the community’s members for their donations. Commenters responded with enthusiasm and joy. “Apes supporting apes,” noted one. “Just a bunch of degenerative apes protecting their own species,” said another. The Dian Fossey Fund is returning the redditors’ meme-laden good wishes, updating its &lt;a href="https://gorillafund.org/"&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt; to feature the slogan: “Apes together strong.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snPmEr"&gt;The slogan itself is a &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/apes-together-strong"&gt;meme&lt;/a&gt; taken from the 2011 film &lt;em&gt;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&lt;/em&gt;, but has been embraced by members of r/WallStreetBets, who see their coordinated financial action as proof that an army of “dumb” day traders can outsmart the “geniuses” of Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XhfaM"&gt;The subreddit is notable for numerous inside jokes, many of which found their way into the group’s support for gorillas. Redditors sharing their donations to Dian Fossey fund have variously signed off as “Harambe GameStop,” “Wall St Bets Ape,” and “Karl Tendiekong.” (The latter is a reference to the community’s idolization of chicken tenders, or tendies; the only meal fit to celebrate hearty profits after a hard day trading.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yGZIRw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; WE HAVE NEWS   It’s safe to say that the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/investor?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#investor&lt;/a&gt; community on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reddit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@reddit&lt;/a&gt; is not traditionally who we think of as our supporter base. But they definitely surprised and overwhelmed us over the weekend. A THREAD. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CNN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CNBC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/business?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@business&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WSJ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@WSJ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/JRB1Gj1Mub"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JRB1Gj1Mub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund (@SavingGorillas) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SavingGorillas/status/1371507415754145793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hyurb3"&gt;The subreddit shot to fame this January when members &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;piled their money into GameStop stock&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to undermine the financial positions of various hedge funds which had been shorting the retailer. Since then, GameStop’s stock has rocketed up and down, making some millions and losing others just as much. Many commenters responding to Stoinski’s video said they’d specifically donated a portion of their profits from trading GameStop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygcs1P"&gt;It’s hard to summarize the outcome of WallStreeBets’ memefication of the stock markets, but for many experts, it changes very little. In the case of GameStop, financial journalist Matt Levine &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-04/elon-musk-s-gamestop-tweets-are-now-a-hedge-fund-signal"&gt;noted in February&lt;/a&gt; that while some hedge funds shorting the stock lost money and some redditors who got in early made lots, other hedge funds who predicted when the stock would fall &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; made money, while plenty of redditors who got in late &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; lost it. The basic mechanism of what happened, says Levine, “is that Reddit correctly noticed that &lt;em&gt;if everyone buys a stock then it will go up&lt;/em&gt;, and then they all did that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYNNgh"&gt;Is there a lesson in all this? It probably depends on whether the person asking lost or made money. But as the flood of donations to the Dian Fossey fund proves: at least the gorillas are getting something out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS developer who drew attention to App Store scams is now suing Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P8VOytbQjhwM4pNFyhhTl9_Tr0A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986294/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Be9Nie"&gt;Mobile app developer Kosta Eleftheriou, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;publicly called out Apple earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; for negligence with regard to policing iOS scams and copycat apps on the App Store, has filed a lawsuit against the iPhone maker in California. He’s accusing the company of exploiting its monopoly power over iOS apps “to make billions of dollars in profits at the expense of small application developers and consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6IHJA"&gt;Eleftheriou’s company KPAW LLC, which he co-owns with his partner Ashley Eleftheriou, filed its complaint in Santa Clara County on Wednesday. It details the development and release timeline of Eleftheriou’s Apple Watch keyboard app FlickType. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jIZ8V"&gt;At the time he began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;accusing Apple of abetting App Store scams&lt;/a&gt; early last month, Eleftheriou revealed that his FlickType app had been targeted by competing software he says either didn’t work well or didn’t work at all, and yet nonetheless chipped away at this sales and App Store rankings through false advertising and the purchase of fake reviews. After he complained, he said Apple did not do enough to combat the scams, though Apple did later remove some of the apps he called attention to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bTOuKZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The App Store has a big problem &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You: an honest developer, working hard to improve your IAP conversions.&lt;br&gt;Your competitor: a $2M/year scam running rampant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1/ &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011069395755009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iCwzu7"&gt;Eleftheriou’s claims join a chorus of growing complaints against Apple and the App Store. Some developers, competing tech companies, regulators, and now state lawmakers have accused the mobile marketplace of being a monopoly in software distribution that harms competition and keeps consumers paying higher prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SngFHz"&gt;Epic Games, the maker of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;targeting both Apple and Google with antitrust lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; over the removal of the battle royale game last summer for use of an alternative in-app payment system. Meanwhile, a group of app makers, ranging from Epic to Spotify to Tinder parent company Match Group, have begun lobbying state lawmakers to take up the fight against the App Store and Google Play Store, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309284/arizona-app-store-bill-2005-apple-30-percent-cut-bypass-legislation"&gt;surprising success so far in Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and numerous other bills around the country in the works, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mff1OQ"&gt;In the complaint, Eleftheriou goes further into detail about what he claims is wrongful behavior from Apple, including alleged false advertising, breach of its developer agreement, and fraud. One notable claim involves Apple trying to acquire FlickType, after which Eleftheriou says he faced “roadblock after roadblock” to selling his software on the App Store. The complaint suggests Apple chose not to take action on scam and copycat apps in an effort to force Eleftheriou to sell his app to Apple. “Evidently, Apple thought Plaintiff would simply give up and sell its application to Apple at a discount,” the complaint reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cakQJk"&gt;At the heart of the dispute appears to be conversations Eleftheriou had with an Apple executive Randy Marsden, who led mobile keyboard technology at the company and later held the position of Text Input Special Projects Manager. Marsden is well known in the tech industry for co-founding the keyboard technology startup Swype, and for later co-founding the app Dryft, which was &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/08/apple-quietly-bought-dryft-a-keyboard-app/"&gt;acquired by Apple in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. The acquisition resulted in Marsden being put in charge of the iOS keyboard at Apple from 2014 to 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MGygaY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple systematically flexes its monopoly muscle against potential competition through the App Store”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G8H2CO"&gt;Eleftheriou says he was approached by Marsden, who expressed interest in having Apple acquire his software to improve typing on the Apple Watch. Yet, the negotiations went quiet, and afterward, Eleftheriou claims Apple removed his FlickType keyboard app and refused to approve future versions as well as a note-taking variant, on what he thinks are suspicious grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mu2UYd"&gt;Only later did Apple permit both apps after months of appeals and after Eleftheriou let countless other app makers integrate his technology. Those apps using the FlickType tech were approved without issue, the complaint says. Meanwhile, many other wearable and mobile keyboard apps Eleftheriou characterizes as scams were also approved and allowed on the App Store. “By this time, Apple’s wrongful rejections had already cost Plaintiff over a year of revenue,” the complaint reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="462hBJ"&gt;Eleftheriou’s complaint says this is evidence of Apple “flexing its monopoly muscle against potential competition”: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="z21d1N"&gt;Apple entices software application developers like Plaintiff to develop innovative applications with the promise of a fair and secure App Store in which to sell them. In truth, Apple systematically flexes its monopoly muscle against potential competition through the App Store and profits from rampant fraudulent practices. If Apple cannot buy a desired application from a developer on the cheap, Apple attempts to crush that developer through exploitive fees and selective application of opaque and unreasonable constraints against the developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXDx4A"&gt; At the same time, Apple permits other developers that Apple does not view as real competition, including scam competitors, to peddle similar, inferior products because Apple profits from their sales. Scammers oftentimes use screenshots and videos taken from legitimate developer’s applications and manipulate their ratings. Apple does little to police these practices because it profits from them. Apple then lies to its regulators by asserting that it must maintain its monopoly power over the sale of Apple-related applications to protect consumers, when, in fact, Apple lets them get ripped off and exploits the developers trying to deliver innovation to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="A9h9uq"&gt;Eleftheriou says even after his app became the No. 1 paid app on the App Store after it was approved, earning him $130,000 in its first month of release, he had to face down a wave of scam apps and copycat software that targeted FlickType after its visible success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oiHVGV"&gt;“Despite possessing massive resources and technological savvy, Apple intentionally fails to police these fraudsters, costing honest developers millions, and perhaps billions, while Apple continues to amass huge profits for itself,” the complaint reads. “Apple holds both its device users and developers hostage. Yet each time it faces antitrust claims, Apple justifies its monopoly by claiming it is necessary to protect its users and developers from unscrupulous conduct and ensure a fair competitive marketplace for the benefit of both. In truth, Apple turns a blind eye to rampant fraud and exploitation to make an easy profit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZuPiN"&gt;Eleftheriou is accusing Apple of false advertising, unfair competition in violation of California’s business and professions code, breach of good faith and fair dealing with regard to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, fraud, and negligence and negligent misrepresentation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony announces new PS5 VR controllers with adaptive triggers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P8akL2XuFWEgzy0go6yAsdiBI60=/85x0:1003x612/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986292/03_withnotice.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XL7Gm7"&gt;Sony is revealing its new VR controllers for the PS5 today. The orb-shaped controllers look more like typical VR controllers than existing PlayStation Move motion controllers, and they also include the same adaptive trigger technology found on the DualSense PS5 controller. Each controller has tensions in the triggers, and Sony is aiming to use this tech in future VR games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0Tvm4"&gt;The controllers also have haptic feedback, and finger touch detection that will let them detect fingers without having to press areas where you rest your thumb, index, or middle fingers. “This enables you to make more natural gestures with your hands during gameplay,” &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/03/18/next-gen-vr-on-ps5-the-new-controller/"&gt;says Hideaki Nishino&lt;/a&gt;, head of platform planning and management at PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IYStA-oWU5Jj8LBdE2F3QKauCxE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22379639/04_withnotice_scaled.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each controller has haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mNepXH"&gt;Naturally, these controllers will also include tracking to Sony’s new VR headset via a ring at the bottom of the controller. These certainly look far improved over what’s currently available on the PS Move controllers, with better ergonomics, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WrGNkc"&gt;“SIE’s Product, Engineering, and Design teams have collaborated to build our new VR controller from the ground up with a goal of making a huge leap from current-gen VR gaming,” says Nishino. “Prototypes of our new VR controller will be in the hands of the development community soon, and we can’t wait to see what ideas they come up with and how the controller helps bring their imagination to life!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="001YKX"&gt;Sony hasn’t shown off the design of its next-gen VR headset for the PS5 just yet, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296998/sony-ps5-next-gen-vr-headset-virtual-reality-features"&gt;company did reveal&lt;/a&gt; it has an improved field of view, resolution, and even a single cord to make it easier to use. Sony isn’t planning to launch its VR headset for the PS5 in 2021, but it’s clear the company is getting ready to test it with game developers soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 9 Pro supports seriously fast 50W wireless charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dG01GnSbVB8Nosjmfthf-AFsIbo=/59x0:1942x1255/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986172/OP_charge_white.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With a new wireless charger, the OnePlus 9 Pro can charge in either portrait or landscape orientation.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OyFUhs"&gt;It’s not often that the actual spec is better than the rumor, but that’s the case here: the OnePlus 9 Pro supports 50W wireless charging — a little faster than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213390/oneplus-9-pro-45-watt-wireless-charging-reverse"&gt;45W rumor we reported on&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. We’ve been able to test drive this feature ahead of the phone’s official debut on March 23rd and can confirm: the 9 Pro offers really, really fast wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1udiA"&gt;OnePlus claims that the phone will charge wirelessly (with the new Warp Charge 50 charger) from 1 to 100 percent in 43 minutes, and our own testing confirmed this down to the minute. That’s a big boost over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219525/oneplus-8-wireless-charger-warp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;OnePlus 8 Pro’s 30W wireless charging&lt;/a&gt;, which supplied a 50 percent charge in 30 minutes. The improvements aren’t limited to wireless charging, or the 9 Pro for that matter; the 9 and 9 Pro have 65W wired charging that takes the battery from empty to full in 29 minutes. While the base model OnePlus 9 doesn’t get those fast wireless speeds, it can be used with the new charger at up to 15W. Additionally, both the 9 and 9 Pro support standard Qi wireless charging at 15W.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6u9e5nAlDJmvfBFl4hiaOnAeuOM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22378643/OnePlus_9_Pro_Warp_Charge_50_Wireless_Dock_Dark.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Warp Charge 50 wireless charger now features a detachable cable based on user feedback.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2yw65a"&gt;Fast charging has definitely been OnePlus’ “thing” for a while, and according to Kinder Liu, COO and head of R&amp;amp;D, it’s been a hit with customers. “Since introducing our first fast-charging technology with the OnePlus 3, we have heard a lot of positive feedback, with many OnePlus users saying it has fundamentally changed the way they charge their devices. They can simply top up for a day’s charge while getting ready in the morning instead of charging overnight.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVgrX0"&gt;The OnePlus 9-series uses a twin-cell battery design first introduced in the 8T, which is part of the 9 Pro’s formula for achieving such fast wireless charging speeds: each cell is charged at 25W simultaneously. OnePlus uses higher voltage power, which produces less heat than using higher amps and avoids frying the phone by channeling the power through a proprietary charge pump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0CHA9M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The newly designed charger supports charging in either horizontal or vertical orientation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AyfXvH"&gt;The 9 Pro’s twin-cell battery design also helps mitigate the heat produced by wireless charging, along with some other design tweaks to help with heat dissipation, like thicker copper foil and a larger heatsink. There’s also a key feature on the charger itself that we were grateful for in our testing: a fan. The added fan noise isn’t ideal if the charger is on your nightstand, but for the Pro 9 owner who wants to keep their nighttime charging routine, there’s support for quieter charging during bedtime mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7nG92w"&gt;The newly designed charger also includes two charging coils, making it possible to charge the phone in either horizontal or vertical orientation. That’s useful if you want to multitask your charging time and watch a video, too, which OnePlus says shouldn’t affect charging speed. We couldn’t confirm that in our initial testing, but it’s something we’ll be following up on. As for the cost of the charger, we don’t have pricing yet, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219525/oneplus-8-wireless-charger-warp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;last year’s Warp Charge 30 chargers&lt;/a&gt; didn’t come cheap — the pad version was introduced at $69.95 and the stand version for $79.95.&lt;/p&gt;
