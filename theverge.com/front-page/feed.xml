    <title>Epic has appealed Friday’s ruling in the Epic v. Apple case</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qx655b"&gt;Epic Games has filed an appeal to a Friday’s ruling in its lawsuit against Apple, calling on a higher court to reexamine the case and overturn the judge’s ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29aZkr"&gt;“Notice is hereby given that Epic Games, Inc.... appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from the final Judgment entered on September 10, 2021,” &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21061142-epic-games-appeal"&gt;the document reads&lt;/a&gt;. Few details are given about the legal basis for Epic’s appeal, but it is likely to continue to press on the federal antitrust allegations dismissed by the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYIsOt"&gt;At trial, Epic argued Apple had a monopoly because of how it requires developers to use its payments system for in-game purchases. But Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled Friday that Epic should pay damages to Apple for violating rules around its in-app purchasing system, while undoing Apple’s most restrictive rules on steering customers to alternate payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yG3pML"&gt;Most notably, the judge found that Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;failed to make the case&lt;/a&gt; for Apple as a monopoly in the mobile gaming marketplace, which she ultimately found was the relevant market for the company’s claims. “The evidence does suggest that Apple is near the precipice of substantial market power, or monopoly power, with its considerable market share,” Judge Rogers wrote — but said the antitrust claims failed in part “because [Epic] did not focus on this topic.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first iPhone with 1TB of storage is reportedly coming Tuesday</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IJGCgc"&gt;Days before Apple’s California Streaming event on September 14th, a new investor report from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says he expects the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max to each have a 1TB storage configuration (h/t &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/12/kuo-iphone-13-to-drop-64gb-storage-size-pro-models-to-offer-1tb-option/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Kuo also says the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini will have storage configurations of 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB, but no 64GB option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybhuHK"&gt;Kuo also said he expects Apple to reveal AirPods 3 at Tuesday’s event, but that Apple will probably keep the AirPods 2 available. He cautions that the iPhone 13 could be affected by supply chain shortages, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;has been previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, but expects there will be limited impact on iPhone 13 shipments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTkCLy"&gt;Previous leaks and rumors have pointed to an iPhone 13 lineup that will include four models in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;same sizes as last year’s models&lt;/a&gt;. The new phones are expected to have improved cameras that include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618070/apple-2021-iphone-13-camera-features-video-portrait-prores-ai-filters"&gt;video portrait mode and an astrophotography mode&lt;/a&gt;, an improved ultrawide lens and a better optical zoom for video recording. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eH8z5A"&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;rumors around the Apple Watch 7&lt;/a&gt; are predicting a faster processor and a new hardware design, including larger screens and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654621/apple-watch-series-7-new-watchfaces-bigger-screens"&gt;new watchfaces&lt;/a&gt;. And the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels"&gt; iPad Mini is expected&lt;/a&gt; to get a big redesign, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hehdwZ"&gt;The fall event gets underway at 1PM ET on September 14th, and will be a virtual event &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-events%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F12%2F22670072%2Fapple-iphone-13-pro-models-1tb-storage-kuo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;streaming from Apple Park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A short history of every time Apple CEO Tim Cook praised augmented reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tim Cook stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BFSuuOJCdScY2AnKMm3g_j2QVS4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69848232/tim-cook-apple-stock-0563.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Cook has been singing the praises of AR for five years&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ERzUQ0"&gt;Tim Cook has just marked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;10 years as Apple’s CEO&lt;/a&gt;, and while he’s grown Apple into the most valuable company in the world, it’s reasonable to argue he hasn’t yet introduced a signature, industry shaking product like Apple co-founder Steve Jobs did with the iPhone, iPad, Mac and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqO7Qo"&gt;But if you’ve been following Apple for a minute, you’ve probably heard Cook talk about the game-changing potential of augmented reality. While he once said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/28/4374482/tim-cook-apple-wearable-google-glass"&gt;hard to see the appeal of Google Glass&lt;/a&gt;, the AR wearable that proved unpopular with consumers, he’s held a consistently positive opinion on AR since at least 2016. While most of the industry was putting all its eggs in the VR basket, Cook repeatedly expressed support for what he views as the far superior AR. This would become a running theme: AR good, VR not so good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3j429"&gt;It seems likely that AR may become the hallmark of Cook’s tenure, as long as Apple executes on a winning idea. While that’s not exactly guaranteed — Apple has yet to unveil an AR headset or glasses — Cook’s frequent comments about the tech keep the topic in the news and reassure investors and customers that Apple is working on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZIIDx"&gt;AR features are already available on the iPhone and iPad. And while hope is starting to fade that Apple will release a mixed reality device in 2022, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;latest rumors suggest&lt;/a&gt; the company is still forging ahead with some kind of AR/VR headset to be released in the not-distant future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5jIE1"&gt;Here’s a brief history of all the times Tim Cook said he was convinced AR was the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LR10VY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; Cook says in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/26/12290920/apple-augmented-reality-ar-tim-cook"&gt;quarterly earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that “AR can be really great.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wX7rQO"&gt;“We have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run, we think there’s great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity. The number one thing is to make sure our products work well with other developers’ kind of products like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;, that’s why you see so many iPhones in the wild chasing pokemons.” (Cook pronounces it “pokey-mans.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3BaXv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2016: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/exclusive-apple-ceo-tim-cook-prefers-augmented-reality/story?id=42064913"&gt;Cook tells &lt;em&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an interview that he believes AR is a bigger deal than VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtE9kB"&gt;“There’s virtual reality and there’s augmented reality — both of these are incredibly interesting. But my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEwdho"&gt;AR “gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present, talking to each other, but also have other things — visually — for both of us to see. Maybe it’s something we’re talking about, maybe it’s someone else here who’s not here present but who can be made to appear to be present.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WB8GUn"&gt;“There’s a lot of really cool things there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqvA1V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; Cook makes a brief mention of AR in a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2016/08/13/tim-cook-the-interview-running-apple-is-sort-of-a-lonely-job/?utm_term=.71cfafb58188"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; profile&lt;/a&gt;: “I think AR [augmented reality] is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology. So, yes, it’s something we’re doing a lot of things on behind that curtain that we talked about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfFqeu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2016: &lt;/strong&gt;In an appearance at Utah Tech Tour, Cook goes into detail about &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/02/tim-cook-talks-steve-jobs-need-for-encryption-at-utah-tech-tour-video/"&gt;how crucial AR may become&lt;/a&gt; and why he views it as superior to VR — while stressing that AR presents significant technology challenges before it can be adopted for mass consumerism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="s4U9pW"&gt;In terms of it becoming a mass adoption [phenomenon], so that, say, everyone in here would have an AR experience, the reality to do that, it has to be something that everyone in here views to be an “acceptable thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fE5O2T"&gt;And nobody in here, few people in here, think it’s acceptable to be tethered to a computer walking in here and sitting down, few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something, because we’re all social people at heart. Even introverts are social people, we like people and we want to interact. It has to be that it’s likely that AR, of the two, is the one the largest number of people will engage with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyxSDF"&gt;I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day, it will become that much a part of you, a lot of us live on our smartphones, the iPhone, I hope, is very important for everyone, so AR will become really big. VR I think is not going to be that big, compared to AR. I’m not saying it’s not important, it is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mfq3v"&gt;I’m excited about VR from an education point of view, I think it can be really big for education, I think it can be very big for games. But I can’t imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you’re sitting in here with me. But I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now, if the technology was there, which it’s not today. How long will it take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wx2VTE"&gt;AR is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there. But it will happen, it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it. Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="o5nJLd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkV78RZ73Mw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d6ivZT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; Cook &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-ceo-tim-cook-on-virtual-reality-theres-no-substitute-f#.qel1aEjdb"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that while “VR has some interesting applications,” AR is superior to VR because “there’s no substitute for human contact. And so you want the technology to encourage that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LWV7WX"&gt;Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it’s profound. We might ... have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right? And so I think that things like these are better when they’re incorporated without becoming a barrier to our talking. ... You want the technology to amplify it, not to be a barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8zwWMG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2017: &lt;/strong&gt;Cook &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/apple-tim-cook-boss-brexit-uk-theresa-may-number-10-interview-ustwo-a7574086.html"&gt;expands his thoughts on AR’s potential&lt;/a&gt;, adding a new comparison: AR is a big idea, like the smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qlZDkX"&gt;I’m excited about augmented reality because unlike virtual reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on what’s happening presently. Most people don’t want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can’t do that because you get sick from it. With AR you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHlQnM"&gt;I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don’t have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it’s for everyone. I think AR is that big, it’s huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives. And be entertaining. I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone, it’s not a product per se, it’s a core technology. But there are things to discover before that technology is good enough for the mainstream. I do think there can be a lot of things that really help people out in daily life, real-life things, that’s why I get so excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ywuu2K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; In a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-06-15/apple-s-tim-cook-on-donald-trump-the-homepod-and-the-legacy-of-steve-jobs"&gt;wide-ranging interview with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Cook details his vision for AR at Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="b2MVpL"&gt;I think it is profound. I am so excited about it, I just want to yell out and scream. The first step in making it a mainstream kind of experience is to put it in the operating system. We’re building it into iOS 11, opening it to ­developers—and unleashing the creativity of millions of people. Even we can’t predict what’s going to come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5fDe2"&gt;There’s some things that you can already get a vision of. We’ve talked to IKEA, and they have 3D images of their furniture line. You’re talking about changing the whole experience of how you shop for, in this case, furniture and other objects that you can place around the home. You can take that idea and begin to think this is something that stretches from enterprise to consumer. There’s not a lot of things that do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hboXPl"&gt;You’ll see things happening in enterprises where AR is ­fundamental to what they’re doing. You’re going to see some consumer things that are unbelievably cool. Can we do everything we want to do now? No. The technology’s not complete yet. But that’s the beauty to a certain degree. This has a runway. And it’s an incredible runway. It’s time to put the seat belt on and go. When people begin to see what’s possible, it’s going to get them very excited—like we are, like we’ve been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DIea6k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; At an &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41590323"&gt;event at Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, Cook responds to a student who asks what technology he would consider “transformative.” Cook says there are widespread uses for AR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYUKHM"&gt;“I’m incredibly excited by AR because I can see uses for it everywhere. I can see uses for it in education, in consumers, in entertainment, in sports. I can see it in every business that I know anything about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JpVYm"&gt;“I also like the fact that it doesn’t isolate. I don’t like our products being used a lot. I like our products amplifying thoughts and I think AR can help amplify the human connection. I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite. There are clearly some cool niche things for VR but it’s not profound in my view. AR is profound.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJlluP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; In an &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/exclusive-apple-ceo-tim-cook-future-of-fashion-augmented-reality"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Vogue UK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Cook says while Apple wasn’t looking to build a “giant database of clothes,” it would support companies in the AR space who were doing this work. “If you think about a runway show in the fashion world, that’s a great application of AR because some of these, you want to see the dress all the way around, you do not want to just see the front,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;, noting how many runway shows are live-streamed and not just visible to an in-person audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBEvu6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; With the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15742736/apple-arkit-augmented-reality-platform-wwdc-breakdown"&gt;introduction of its ARKit platform on iOS 11&lt;/a&gt;, Cook says in a quarterly earnings call that &lt;a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2017/11/the-transcript-of-todays-opening-statement-from-apples-ceo-on-fiscal-q4-2017-is-now-available.html"&gt;Apple has created&lt;/a&gt; the world’s largest augmented reality platform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GdJYqz"&gt;There already are over a thousand apps with powerful AR features in our App Store today with developers creating amazing new experiences in virtually every category of app aimed at consumers, students and business users alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RV7Y54"&gt;Put simply, we believe AR is going to change the way we use technology forever. We’re already seeing things that will transform the way you work, play, connect and learn. For example, there are AR apps that you interact with virtual models of everything you can imagine from the human body to the solar system. And of course you experience them like you’re really there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="je9Rb6"&gt;Instantly education becomes much more powerful when every subject comes to life in 3D. And imagine shopping when you can place an object in your living room before you make a purchase – or attending live sporting events when you can see the stats on the field. AR is going to change everything&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DM0tys"&gt;This is not quite what came to pass (more on that later). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJAyaa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; Post-ARKit launch, Cook admits he &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/apple-iphone-tim-cook-interview-features-new-augmented-reality-ar-arkit-a7993566.html"&gt;thinks AR technology&lt;/a&gt; for headsets or glasses isn’t yet up to par as far as Apple is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ag0KHY"&gt;“I can tell you the technology itself doesn’t exist to do that in a quality way. The display technology required, as well as putting enough stuff around your face — there’s huge challenges with that. The field of view, the quality of the display itself, it’s not there yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMoVt4"&gt;“We don’t give a rat’s about being first, we want to be the best, and give people a great experience. But now anything you would see on the market any time soon would not be something any of us would be satisfied with. Nor do I think the vast majority of people would be satisfied.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvKmAY"&gt;“Most technology challenges can be solved, but it’s a matter of how long.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiQf8M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2018: &lt;/strong&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2018/02/01/apple-inc-appl-q1-2018-earnings-conference-call-tr.aspx"&gt;Apple’s Q1 earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, Cook describes “great excitement” around augmented reality among customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5QNWq"&gt;“Augmented reality is going to revolutionize many of the experiences we have with mobile devices, and with ARKit, we’re giving developers the most advanced tools on the market to create apps for the most advanced operating system running on the most advanced hardware. This is something only Apple can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yOGiC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2018: &lt;/strong&gt;Cook tells &lt;em&gt;NowThisNews&lt;/em&gt; during an interview about Apple’s Watch that AR is poised to become indispensable. “I think that one day we will wonder how we ever lived without it,” Cook says of AR. “We can have a much more enhanced conversation with the power of AR.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZOOfV"&gt;“The future is now,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="VO88JU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2020: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/tim-cook-ar-war-ducks-healthtech"&gt;Cook tells an audience in Dublin, Ireland&lt;/a&gt; that augmented reality “is the next big thing” and that it will “pervade our entire lives.” He gives an example of a company using AR and described its potential uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ImgYq0"&gt;Yesterday, I visited a development company called War Ducks … in Dublin – 15 people and they’re staffing up and using AR for games. You can imagine, for games it’s incredible but even for our discussion here. You and I might be talking about an article and using AR we can pull it up, and can both be looking at the same thing at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDw6RA"&gt;I think it’s something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5lTJJO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2021&lt;/strong&gt;: During an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/apples-ceo-is-making-very-different-choices-from-mark-zuckerberg.html?showTranscript=1"&gt;interview with journalist Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; Cook agreed with her that augmented reality is “a critically important part of Apple’s future.” He imagines AR being used in health, education, retail, and gaming. “I’m already seeing AR take off in some of these areas with use of the phone. And I think the promise is even greater in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NExGsI"&gt;What’s Apple plan for AR?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MZhJMH"&gt;Clearly, Tim Cook has been bullish on AR for a long time. But so far, Apple’s biggest foray into AR remains the 2017 launch of ARKit — which use iPhones’ and iPads’ cameras and sensors to overlay images in 3D space when the device is pointed at a given area — for iOS 11. ARKit is available across Apple’s devices, which meant a lot of &lt;a href="https://github.com/olucurious/Awesome-ARKit"&gt;cool little projects&lt;/a&gt; by amateur AR enthusiasts. When ARKit launched, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15742736/apple-arkit-augmented-reality-platform-wwdc-breakdown"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt; that the tech had the potential to allow Apple to catch rival Google in the AR space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dv9YB6"&gt;But despite the interesting early projects, ARKit hype fizzled after a few months. It’s not totally clear why, because it was released at the height of the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; craze when AR finally had a popular mass-market application for a devoted fan base. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565654/pokemon-go-5-billion-fifth-anniversary-revenue-analytics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;itself is still wildly profitable&lt;/a&gt;, raking in a billion dollars a year on average, but we haven’t seen a larger movement.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikGTfK"&gt;Since ARKit, Apple has made other, smaller steps forward with AR apps for the iPhone. In May 2019, it introduced its &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/14/statue-of-liberty-ar-ios-app/"&gt;Statue of Liberty AR app&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1128412203932049408"&gt;Cook tweeting&lt;/a&gt;, “The Statue of Liberty app is just the beginning of how AR will transform the way we connect with our world’s treasures.” In July 2019, it introduced augmented reality art sessions for iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hh9exC"&gt;In addition to Tim Cook’s constant cheerleading of the technology, there are other signs that Apple is moving toward an AR future. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/natbro/status/1155849145350909954"&gt;hiring of people like Nat Brown&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of Microsoft; listing &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/08/01/apple-lists-ar-vr-jobs-reportedly-taps-executive-who-finalizes-products/"&gt;dozens of AR and VR job postings&lt;/a&gt;; acquisitions including &lt;a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/05/28/apple-buys-german-augmented-reality-firm-metaio/"&gt;Metaio in 2015&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/26/15877520/apple-sensomotoric-instruments-acquisition-ar-vr-eye-tracking"&gt;SensoMotoric in 2017&lt;/a&gt;; and patents on things like “&lt;a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=09383582&amp;amp;SectionNum=1&amp;amp;IDKey=4E2221DF6AD9&amp;amp;HomeUrl=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526d=PALL%2526p=1%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r=1%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526s1=9,383,582.PN.%2526OS=PN/9,383,582%2526RS=PN/9,383,582"&gt;head mounted display&lt;/a&gt;” devices all demonstrate its steady progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WuEKr7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s AR hardware is perennially two years away&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BbknTJ"&gt;Reports started &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-is-working-on-an-ar-augmented-reality-vr-virtual-reality-headset-powered-by-a-wireless-wigig-hub/"&gt;trickling out in 2018&lt;/a&gt; that Apple had a timeline to launch both an AR headset and AR glasses. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/apple-s-ar-push-will-start-with-ipad-and-culminate-with-glasses"&gt;The company had 1,000 engineers&lt;/a&gt; working on its VR and AR initiative — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-04/apple-augmented-reality-headset-executive-leaves-company"&gt;codenamed “T288”&lt;/a&gt; — which were expected to include a combined VR and AR headset to be released in 2021 or 2022, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;, with a pair of sleeker AR glasses predicted to launch in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqsIdJ"&gt;The latest reporting from &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-ar-vr-headset-will-need-connection-to-other-device-such-as-iphone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;however, indicates that an Apple AR/VR headset may need to rely on the processor of another connected device like an iPhone (similar to the early Apple Watch models), and that Apple is working on a custom chip for the helmet-like headset that might take at least another year to arrive. Some aren’t as bullish on the more glasses-like variant either; &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; suggests Apple could still release that in 2023, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks&lt;/a&gt; a 2025 release is more likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2d0mj"&gt;It shouldn’t be all that surprising that Apple has taken its time making AR hardware; it is, after all, the company that introduced the AirPower wireless charging pad, showed it off to the world, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;canceled the product because it wasn’t up to company standards&lt;/a&gt; — and that was just an charging accessory, not a potentially new computing paradigm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrJyTD"&gt;So it’s to be expected that Apple would take its time on an AR or VR headset. After hyping the potential for AR all this time, Cook surely doesn’t want Apple to repeat the failure of Google Glass by launching iGlasses too soon, and definitely not before the technology meets Apple’s very high bar.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A comprehensive breakdown of the Epic v. Apple ruling</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Whoever lost, we win&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="tZUq6R"&gt;On Friday, a California judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;ruled on the influential &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667769/apple-epic-lost-lawsuit-verdict-ruling"&gt;both sides lost&lt;/a&gt;. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers concluded that Apple wasn’t unfairly monopolizing the mobile app space with iOS or its in-app purchasing system, and she &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.814.0_2.pdf"&gt;ordered Epic to pay&lt;/a&gt; damages for violating its developer agreement with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. At the same time, she &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.813.0_3.pdf"&gt;ordered Apple to remove&lt;/a&gt; its anti-steering rules — policies banning developers from telling users about alternatives to Apple’s in-app purchase system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="UhUeEU"&gt;For readers outside those two companies, though, &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.812.0_3.pdf"&gt;Judge Rogers’ opinion&lt;/a&gt; has a lot to offer. Rogers clearly considers much of Epic and Apple’s behavior silly and many of both companies’ arguments bad. But she seriously examines all these arguments and lays out a blueprint for further legal arguments about mobile platforms, app monopolies, and modern antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="cgUMNJ"&gt;So we’re going to take a close look into the ruling’s biggest conclusions — and what they mean for both companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WozvDh"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="482" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP3856497645&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1332xI"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; suit is about mobile game payments, not iOS apps or the bigger game market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="f0NWG6"&gt;During the trial, both sides argued over which market &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; iOS app belonged to. Epic claimed Apple had abused a monopoly on the iOS app ecosystem; Apple claimed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was playing in the more competitive overall digital game market. (This is why the trial’s lawyers kept asking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425774/epic-apple-roblox-fortnite-store-game-trial-day-5"&gt;whether &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is a game&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hUYi2"&gt;Judge Rogers says both these definitions are wrong, although Apple’s is somewhat less wrong. Instead, the question is whether Apple has an unlawful monopoly in “digital mobile gaming transactions.” Rogers notes that mobile games often have a different user base than PC or console games, and they rely hugely on the “freemium” model of in-game item sales, which are less important to both mobile apps and console or PC games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtzwYy"&gt;Epic made 10 claims against Apple. Most of them depended significantly on Apple having an unfair monopoly under either the federal Sherman Antitrust Act or California’s antitrust-focused Cartwright Act. And although the ruling is sympathetic toward several of Epic’s underlying arguments, nearly all its claims were dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J68sDL"&gt;Apple doesn’t have a monopoly in mobile gaming — yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5wV9nV"&gt;Mobile games are a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; part of Apple’s App Store revenue — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business"&gt;approximately 70 percent&lt;/a&gt;, according to the ruling — and Apple has outsized power in mobile gaming. Rogers concludes iOS and Android hold a near-duopoly, although she considers the Nintendo Switch and cloud gaming services potential near-future competitors. The ruling estimates that Apple has a share of around 55 percent in the mobile game transactions market, alongside “extraordinarily high profit margins,” which can be a sign of monopoly power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pdl6sN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Success is not illegal”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RrGKLl"&gt;But despite Apple’s “considerable” power and profit margins, “these factors alone do not show antitrust conduct. Success is not illegal,” Rogers concludes. While Epic argued that iMessage and other factors deliberately lock users into iOS, Rogers wasn’t convinced by this line of reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMPX5K"&gt;The ruling leaves the door open for future antitrust complaints. “The evidence does suggest that Apple is near the precipice of substantial market power, or monopoly power, with its considerable market share,” Rogers writes. “Apple is only saved by the fact that its share is not higher, that competitors from related submarkets are making inroads into the mobile gaming submarket, and, perhaps, because [Epic] did not focus on this topic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSh0zM"&gt;For now, though, this judgment undercut Epic’s allegation that Apple maintained a monopoly or unlawfully restrained trade under the Sherman Act, helping taking down four of its claims against Apple. The ruling says that by extension, it means Apple didn’t violate California’s Cartwright Act, taking down two more of the claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9TwG9"&gt;A seventh claim said iOS was an “essential facility” that Apple had unfairly denied access to. But Epic didn’t seriously argue this claim, and for mobile app developers, Rogers says web apps and other digital platforms provide a reasonable (if not ideal) distribution alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Jxi0sJ"&gt;The App Store has a troubling lack of competition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EE2yh1"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; ruling has some harsh words for the App Store. At one point, Rogers notes that “nothing other than legal action seems to motivate Apple to reconsider pricing and reduce rates.” At other points, she says Apple “does a poor job of mediating disputes between a developer and its customer,” and it’s been “slow either to adopt automated tools that could improve speed and accuracy or to hire more reviewers” for its app review process. “Apple’s slow innovation stems in part from its low investment in the App Store,” the ruling elaborates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2QuZ5"&gt;Meanwhile, although Rogers takes a dim view of Epic’s economic analysis, she accepts that “Apple’s operating margins tied to the App Store are extraordinarily high.” And she specifically calls out a lack of competition as an issue. “The point is not that ... Apple provides bad services. It does not,” she writes. “The point is that a third-party app store could put pressure on Apple to innovate by providing features that Apple has neglected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6bCBIN"&gt;Apple has valid security fears about opening up iOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIXRgv"&gt;Apple’s trial witnesses promoted iOS as an unusually safe and secure ecosystem because of its walled-garden model, saying no other option would be appropriate for the sensitive data on people’s phones. Epic called that claim a pretext for shutting down competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BiHVZW"&gt;The ruling deflates some of Apple’s protestations. Judge Rogers is particularly dubious of Apple software engineering VP Craig Federighi, who delivered a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667256/apple-vs-epic-trail-judge-craig-federighi-macos-security-arguments-iphone-ios-response"&gt;dramatic but suspiciously new denunciation&lt;/a&gt; of macOS malware. She’s generally receptive to Epic’s suggestion that Apple could review and notarize iOS apps for security but allow distribution through other sources, similar to macOS. “Even though unrestricted app distribution likely decreases security, alternative models are readily achievable to attain the same ends even if not currently employed,” she concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJbOvQ"&gt;Rogers doesn’t think that makes Apple’s claims pretextual, though. She agrees with Apple that comprehensive human review — which isn’t part of macOS notarization — can offer a “safe and trusted user experience” that’s actually pro-consumer. By contrast, she says Epic’s proposed solutions “principally appear to eliminate app review.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SesPrv"&gt;The ruling dashes Epic’s hope that Apple would legally have to allow sideloaded apps and third-party app stores on iOS — which was Apple’s worst-case scenario going into the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ypc4OO"&gt;Apple has a right to require its in-app payment options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QA0G2F"&gt;As you might remember if you’ve been following &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;, this whole dispute started with in-app purchase (or IAP) payment processing. Epic tweaked &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on iOS so that players could buy in-game V-Bucks via two methods: the Apple App Store or an “Epic direct payment” with a 20 percent discount.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Epic’s “Direct Pay” option on Fortnite for iOS" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3eqtNf3_1u_dHbT4SK8io5ZnyvM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22842905/epic_direct_pay_apple_app_store_2045x979_730033169.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Epic’s “Direct Pay” option on Fortnite for iOS, August 2020&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AAQide"&gt;Epic described Apple’s IAP system as a glorified payment processor with outsized fees, and it argued that Apple was illegally tying IAP to the overall App Store. In Epic’s view, developers should be able to offer multiple payment processing options or reject Apple’s payment system altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEQffk"&gt;This is a big point of dissatisfaction among major app developers, and Friday’s ruling isn’t terribly promising for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jACtu"&gt;Rogers is skeptical of some Apple arguments for its current locked-down system and the attendant 30 percent — for big companies like Epic — commission. (Dunking on both sides’ expert witness analysis is a running theme in her ruling.) She also notes there’s “no evidence that IAP provides developers with any unique features” compared to standard payment processing. But she’s fairly straightforwardly opposed to making Apple unbundle the system, calling Epic’s request for it “deficient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpZxdf"&gt;Throughout the trial, Apple has said that it’s not simply charging for payment processing on IAP. It’s using it to collect a commission — the 15 or 30 percent so-called “Apple Tax” — on the larger value of the App Store. Epic disputed that Apple meaningfully earned that commission, saying that although the App Store connects (in its words, “matches”) users with developers, Apple doesn’t deserve a cut of every transaction that happens after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sjKF7R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple and Epic argued over how much the in-app purchase system actually benefits developers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qhhmZ0"&gt;The ruling says the matching description is “partially true,” but that Apple has “never argued that it levies a commission merely because it matches the developers with the customers.” Instead, “IAP is the method by which Apple collects its licensing fee from developers for the use of Apple’s intellectual property.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28REhZ"&gt;Rogers admittedly finds “no basis” for the specific 30 percent rate, despite Apple hiring a consultant to testify about the value of its patents. (As mentioned previously, the ruling is &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt; of dunks on the expert witnesses.) But she says Apple is still entitled to license that intellectual property for a fee of some sort, and requiring developers to use Apple’s payment system “accomplishes this goal in the easiest and most direct manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ty0mzd"&gt;Epic’s unbundling alternative, meanwhile, would “severely undermine” the system, says the ruling. “Indeed, to the extent Epic Games suggests that Apple receive nothing from in-app purchases made on its platform, such a remedy is inconsistent with prevailing intellectual property law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXFczv"&gt;Rogers’ conclusion is another reason Epic didn’t prevail on the monopoly maintenance or restraint of trade claims discussed above, since two of them specifically dealt with IAP. She also says IAP isn’t a standalone product, so Apple isn’t illegally tying it to the App Store, which nixes two more Sherman and Cartwright Act claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5F17md"&gt;For those keeping score, that’s nine claims down for Epic. But there’s one final claim that makes this ruling a significant thorn in Apple’s side. Let’s talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Drmlt4"&gt;iOS developers have a right to talk about alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2LfpMU"&gt;Rogers concludes that Apple doesn’t monopolize mobile gaming. But the company &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; violate California’s Unfair Competition Law (UCL) through its anti-steering rules: policies that restrict developers from telling users they can buy digital goods outside Apple’s ecosystem. The ruling focuses on this portion of Apple’s developer agreement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="teWznP"&gt;“Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9HEtdf"&gt;Rogers has almost unreserved scorn for this policy. “By employing anti-steering provisions, consumers do not know what developers may be offering on their websites, including lower prices,” she writes. Developers are allowed to email customers to advertise, but only through addresses they’ve collected outside the iOS signup process, which consumers also don’t necessarily know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HVpQx"&gt;Users don’t necessarily even know about the cut Apple is taking — that “if they subscribe to their favorite newspaper on the web,” for instance, “all the proceeds go to the newspaper, rather than the reduced amount by subscribing on the iOS device.” Some people appreciate that Apple offers a unified place to manage subscriptions. But others might not, and “Apple actively denies them the choice” to find alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="E34gtC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple created a new and innovative platform which was also a black box”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fhcWQH"&gt;“Apple created a new and innovative platform which was also a black box. It enforced silence to control information and actively impede users from obtaining the knowledge to obtain digital goods on other platforms,” Rogers concludes. “Apple has used this lack of knowledge to exploit its position.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zi337e"&gt;The ruling says Apple’s situation is “distinctly different” from another case that let American Express use anti-steering rules for brick-and-mortar merchants, because even in that scenario, merchants can still say they also accept Visa and MasterCard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWLp8B"&gt;Accordingly, a new injunction will soon prevent Apple from banning “buttons, external links, or other calls to action” that direct users to other payment mechanisms. That’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business"&gt;potentially a big deal for Apple&lt;/a&gt;... although it’s not yet clear just &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; big a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WDuR25"&gt;Apple could collect an ‘Apple Tax’ even without in-app payment charges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="o2ZXJn"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"&gt;my colleague Nilay Patel discusses&lt;/a&gt;, Judge Rogers’ injunction leaves some weird ambiguity about what developers can do. In theory, a developer could add a button that directs users to Safari or another app for payment, but looks indistinguishable from the option to pay with Apple’s system. (It’s worth noting the injunction &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; say Apple has to let developers build complete alternate payment methods into their apps, and based on the statements quoted earlier, Rogers seems fairly down on that prospect.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQsMYF"&gt;But developers like Epic don’t just care about controlling payment methods out of principle — although it offers some unique benefits like getting to handle refunds. They care about ditching Apple’s 30 percent commission. And Rogers says bluntly that it’s not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9kscF"&gt;Even if developers could entirely stop using the IAP system, “Apple could still charge a commission on developers. It would simply be more difficult for Apple to collect that commission,” Rogers writes. The ruling elaborates on this scenario — in which Apple is outright banned from making developers use its payment option — in a footnote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XuuLne"&gt;“In such a hypothetical world, developers could potentially avoid the commission while benefitting from Apple’s innovation and intellectual property free of charge. The Court presumes that in such circumstances that Apple may rely on imposing and utilizing a contractual right to audit developers annual accounting to ensure compliance with its commissions, among other methods. Of course, any alternatives to IAP (including the foregoing) would seemingly impose both increased monetary and time costs to both Apple and the developers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TXWvCV"&gt;The law now says that Apple can’t stop developers from offering cheaper prices outside their iOS apps and telling users about it. But if big developers successfully route a lot of money away from the App Store this way, Rogers seemingly leaves the door open to collecting the “Apple Tax” some other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LidZbJ"&gt;Epic and Apple’s contract was valid, and Epic knowingly broke it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="a0bs43"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; ruling declares that part of Apple’s developer agreement (called the DPLA) is unlawful... but Epic still has to pay for breaking it with the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; payment system change. By the same token, Apple doesn’t have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667069/fortnite-ios-return-apple-epic-ruling"&gt;restore &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or keep Epic’s other apps on iOS if it doesn’t agree to follow Apple’s rules. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AuAAIW"&gt;The first reason is basically that Apple’s agreement didn’t break the law &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt;. Epic claimed the contract was “illegal and unenforceable” because it violated the Sherman Act, the Cartwright Act, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the UCL. Rogers concludes that the single UCL offense wasn’t sufficiently related or severe to justify Epic’s rulebreaking. She also dismisses the claim that Apple’s contract was “unconscionable” — in other words, one-sided enough to “shock the conscience.” (“These are billion and trillion dollar companies with a business dispute,” the ruling notes dryly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lXqm5t"&gt;The second reason is that Epic broke another rule in the process. It hid the alternate payment system inside a remote “hotfix” when Apple’s policies said it couldn’t “provide, unlock, or enable additional features or functionality through distribution mechanisms other than the App Store.” That specific provision wasn’t related to antitrust claims, and the ruling concludes Epic “never showed why it had to breach its agreements” to challenge Apple’s alleged anti-competitive actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CzJay8"&gt;We still don’t know what a game is&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ahoIyG"&gt;Sure, all the questions above are &lt;em&gt;legally relevant&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;important for consumers&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;set a detailed precedent for future antitrust legislation and lawsuits&lt;/em&gt;. But let’s end with the fun part: after all the time witnesses spent arguing about what a video game is, does the ruling give us a definition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYo3N1"&gt;The short answer is no, because it doesn’t have to. “The court need not reach a conclusive definition of a video game or game because by all accounts, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; itself is both externally and internally considered a video game.” &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; markets itself as a game, and even if CEO Tim Sweeney &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;considers it the basis for a larger metaverse&lt;/a&gt; (in case you were wondering, “the court generally finds Mr. Sweeney’s personal beliefs about the future of the metaverse are sincerely held”), the metaverse as a product “remains in its infancy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdPQ4P"&gt;As for the definitions introduced by witnesses, “unfortunately, no one agrees and neither side introduced evidence of any commonly accepted industry definition.” That includes Sweeney’s claim that a game “involves some sort of win or loss or a score progression,” as well as Apple app review head Trystan Kosmynka’s claim that “games have a beginning, [and] an end,” and “there’s challenges in place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jX5BQC"&gt;Rogers does, however, spend a surprising amount of time breaking down the core elements of a video game. Here’s a brief definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WlDnB1"&gt;“The court concludes that video games include a diverse and eclectic genre of games, that are tied together at minimum through varying degrees of interactivity and involvement from a game player.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JZEU5f"&gt;There’s also a more elaborate one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6OmG0k"&gt;“At a bare minimum, video games appear to require some level of interactivity or involvement between the player and the medium. In other words, a game requires that a player be able to input some level of a command or choice which is then reflected in the game itself. This gaming definition contrasts to other forms of entertainment, which are often passive forms enjoyed by consumers (e.g., films, television, music). Video games are also generally graphically rendered or animated, as opposed to being recorded live or via motion capture as in films and television.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eidJop"&gt;You could certainly quibble with elements of this, and Rogers admits she’s not clarifying the “outer boundaries of the definition of video games.” She declines to say whether specific non-Epic titles, like &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; and Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;, are games. She also says she can’t conclude whether &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5"&gt;certain games on the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://Itch.io"&gt;Itch.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5"&gt; storefront&lt;/a&gt; were sexually explicit or problematic, given that “the corresponding materials ... were not submitted to the court” — although she does offer a ruling on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666922/apple-epic-peely-naked-banana-judgement"&gt;naked banana man decorum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Ff4CL1"&gt;Ultimately, “the court leaves the thornier further questions of what is properly included and excluded in the definition of a video game to the academics and commentators,” Rogers determines. And fortunately plenty of both seem ready to take up the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honda and Toyota criticize Democrats’ proposed tax credit for union-made electric vehicles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="EV smart charging" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/37AF_6i5c_ALC_Mv4iRl4IcTPfg=/0x0:4875x3250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69847626/P90375018_highRes.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An electric vehicle plugged into a charging station. A new proposal would boost the tax credit for US union-made EVs.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cBOx2r"&gt;Honda and Toyota are criticizing a new proposal by Democratic lawmakers to expand tax credits for electric vehicles, saying it discriminates against non-union auto workers, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-says-it-will-fight-us-house-electric-vehicle-tax-plan-2021-09-11/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Under the proposal, US union-made electric vehicles would qualify for a tax credit of $12,500 per vehicle, while keeping a credit for most other EVs at $7,500. The proposal would significantly favor Big Three US automakers GM, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler over non-union companies such as Tesla and the Japanese carmakers, both of which have plants in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EnL8E1"&gt;US Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Michigan) told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; “We want to incentivize this. It puts American manufacturers in the lead, which is where we want them, and it reduces emissions faster than any other policy that we could put in place.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22610501/biden-2030-ev-goal-trump-emissions-rollback"&gt;President Biden has said&lt;/a&gt; he wants electric vehicles to represent at least 50 percent of vehicle sales in the US by the year 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SOKoD"&gt;Honda said in a statement that the bill was unfair, and that it “discriminates among EVs made by hard-working American auto workers based simply on whether they belong to a union.” The company noted that Honda has plants in Alabama, Indiana, and Ohio that build EVs, and said those workers “deserve fair and equal treatment by Congress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4J3e0"&gt;Toyota told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that the bill as written discriminates ““against American autoworkers based on their choice not to unionize,” and added it planned to “fight to focus taxpayer dollars on making all electrified vehicles accessible for American consumers who can’t afford high-priced cars and trucks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMmhSs"&gt;The proposal is scheduled for a vote before the House Ways and Means committee on Tuesday, part of a proposed $3.5 trillion spending bill. It’s likely to face opposition in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffBAX5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Salesforce will help employees concerned about access to reproductive healthcare to exit Texas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="the Salesforce logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n-jcHDpIRXcoiyXUQ2d3-6rtGFs=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69847528/1317338667.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Salesforce will help workers move if they’re worried about abortion access | Photo by Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5O0ESP"&gt;Salesforce has told employees that the company will help them and their families relocate if they’re concerned about abortion access in the state where they live. According to a Slack message &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/salesforce-offers-to-relocate-employees-from-texas-after-abortion-bill.html"&gt;obtained by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, the company didn’t refer to any specific state, but the message was sent to thousands of employees late Friday, a day after the US &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/09/1035467999/justice-department-sues-texas-over-new-abortion-ban"&gt;Department of Justice sued Texas&lt;/a&gt; over its new abortion law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aIk6qv"&gt;“These are incredibly personal issues that directly impact many of us — especially women,” the Slack message reads, according to CNBC. “[I]f you have concerns about access to reproductive healthcare in your state, Salesforce will help relocate you and members of your immediate family.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYcj13"&gt;The Slack message didn’t suggest the company was taking a position on abortion or the new Texas law, noting that “we all have deeply held and different perspectives. As a company, we stand with all of our women at Salesforce and everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtzVr9"&gt;Later, CEO Mark Benioff clarified that the company apparently did have Texas in mind when it sent the Slack message, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Benioff/status/1436508394194718720?s=20"&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt; “Ohana if you want to move we’ll help you exit TX. Your choice” and linking to the CNBC report (the word “Ohana” is considered a &lt;a href="https://kenconklin.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=The_Word_%27Ohana_Is_A_Modern_Invention#Honolulu_Magazine.2C_September.2C_2001.2C_pp._42-45."&gt;neologism&lt;/a&gt; that is typically translated to mean “family” in Hawaiian).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m0AtDs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ohana if you want to move we’ll help you exit TX. Your choice.❤️&lt;a href="https://t.co/y5IKpm5fNs"&gt;https://t.co/y5IKpm5fNs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Marc Benioff (@Benioff) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Benioff/status/1436508394194718720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QbRB3T"&gt;The Texas law bans abortion after six weeks— before most people realize they are pregnant— has no exception for rape or incest, and, empowers anyone to sue someone else for “aiding and abetting” abortions after six weeks. That includes not only the person seeking the abortion and abortion clinics, but anyone who helps pay for the procedure, or drives a person to have the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0Ajmx"&gt;In a rare moment of solidarity, rival ride-hailing companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22656392/lyft-uber-legal-fees-drivers-lawsuit-texas-sb8-abortion-law"&gt;Lyft and Uber both said last week they would cover legal fees&lt;/a&gt; for any of its drivers sued under the Texas law. And Bumble and Tinder parent company Match Group announced the creation of &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/bumble-and-match-have-created-a-relief-fund-to-help-cov-1847613072"&gt;a relief fund for women seeking abortions&lt;/a&gt;. Both companies have their headquarters in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qoIfkq"&gt;The Justice Department seeks an injunction to prevent enforcement of the Texas law, noting &lt;a href="https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=21060104-us-v-state-of-"&gt;in its lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; that “It is settled constitutional law that ‘a state may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability.’ But Texas has done just that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google One adds a 5TB storage plan for $24.99 per month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_2JiA-97ZSPYtyZ8-VywoPadcOs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69845524/mdoying_180117_2249_0281stills.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google One now has a 5TB storage plan | Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sn2cMk"&gt;After it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561171/photo-storage-service-google-amazon-flickr"&gt;ended free unlimited storage &lt;/a&gt;for Google Photos in June, many Google users had figure out how to store images and other data in the Google accounts. They could keep their Google account stored data under 15GB, or pay for a Google One plan. Options included a 100GB plan for $1.99 per month, a 200GB plan for $2.99 a month, a 2TB plan for $9.99 a month, or a plan with 10TB of storage for $49.99 per month. 20TB and 30TB plans are also available, for $99.99 and $149.99 per month, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gtgy76"&gt;Now Google’s introduced a middle option between 2TB and 10TB, as noticed by &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/11/google-5tb-one-storage-plan/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://one.google.com/storage"&gt;5TB Google One plan&lt;/a&gt; costs $24.99 per month, a good (and less expensive) option for people who want a little more than 2TB but don’t quite need a plan with 10TB of storage or more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="76Hqjt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to choose an alternative to Google Photos — if you want one","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21561171/photo-storage-service-google-amazon-flickr"},{"title":"How to share your Google One storage with your family","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22543606/google-one-storage-share-family-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rX5Uns"&gt;If you’re sure the 5TB plan will meet your needs, you can save a little money by prepaying for a year’s subscription; it will run you $249.99. Like the 2TB and 10TB plans, the 5TB plan also includes 10 percent off Google Store purchases, the option to add family members, access to Google experts, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21541032/google-one-vpn-cloud-storage-subscription"&gt;VPN for Android&lt;/a&gt; phones. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google reportedly gave some users’ data to Hong Kong authorities in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OtA4ChznIJ_h1r8ryH0QM9tGjZA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69845427/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AGWy4c"&gt;Google provided some user data to the government of Hong Kong last year, despite promising it would not process such data requests from authorities, according to the &lt;a href="https://hongkongfp.com/2021/09/11/google-handed-user-data-to-hong-kong-authorities-despite-pledge-after-security-law-was-enacted/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hong Kong Free Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company told the news outlet it “produced some data” in response to three of the 43 requests it received from Hong Kong’s government. Two of the requests had to do with investigations into human trafficking and included search warrants, and a third was an emergency disclosure as part of a credible threat to someone’s life, &lt;em&gt;HKFP &lt;/em&gt;reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3smXc"&gt;The company told &lt;em&gt;HKFP&lt;/em&gt; that none of the three responses included users’ content data.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRTpwc"&gt;Last August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21314900/google-facebook-twitter-hong-kong-government-data-china"&gt;Google said it would stop responding&lt;/a&gt; to data requests from Hong Kong’s government, unless the requests were made in cooperation with the US Department of Justice. The move was in response to a new Hong Kong national security law imposed by China, which included a possible sentence of life in prison for people found guilty of subversion. China has used subversion charges to detain political protesters and dissidents in the Chinese mainland. Facebook and Twitter also halted the processing of data requests from Hong Kong’s government in response to the security law.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL won’t release a foldable smartphone this year</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dyG2CT"&gt;Electronics company TCL is pausing its plans release a lower-cost foldable phone this year, the company confirmed in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; Its clamshell-style foldable phone, codenamed Project Chicago, was in mid-development when the company made the decision to put it on indefinite hold. According to TCL the delay is due in part to rising production costs and supply chain shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZkmUG"&gt;“Although the foldable market is growing each year, it is still a premium product category,” Stefan Streit, chief marketing officer of TCL said in a statement t&lt;em&gt;o The Verge. &lt;/em&gt; “In combination with recent component shortages, the COVID-19 pandemic and rising costs in foldable production, TCL has made the difficult decision to suspend the launch of its first commercially available foldable smartphone until the company can produce and bring it to market at a price point that’s accessible to as many consumers as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdOmRe"&gt;Streit added that the company is “closely monitoring the market to determine the best time to launch a foldable smartphone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HzjOj"&gt;The company gave out a few sample devices to reviewers (looks like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmJJvzrGODk&amp;amp;ab_channel=MrMobile%5BMichaelFisher%5D"&gt;MrMobile got their hands on one&lt;/a&gt;) , but said it did not have any additional devices available, or any photos of Chicago to share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLt1bP"&gt;The news comes a few weeks after the launch of Samsung’s latest foldable devices: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; (TCL decided to pause its Chicago device before Samsung’s launch) But both of the foldable Samsung phones are on the higher end of the price range; the Flip 3 goes for $999, and the Fold 3 is priced at $1,799.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jo7aU9"&gt;TCL &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/3/5/21165069/tcl-foldable-trifold-phone-hands-on-rollable-concept-prototype-display-tablet"&gt;showed off a few foldable&lt;/a&gt; prototypes last year, and again &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;earlier this year at CES 2021&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a “rollable” screen design. In April &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383668/tcl-fold-n-roll-concept-rollable-phone-tablet"&gt;TCL showed off a Fold ‘n Roll&lt;/a&gt; device that could expand from a 6.87-inch phone screen to become an 8.85-inch phablet, or a 10-inch tablet size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCYO0w"&gt;The company says it’s not giving up on the foldable product category but doesn’t have a time frame for when its first foldable device may be commercially available. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now buy a $475 NFT ticket to see Beeple’s $69 million NFT at an IRL party</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BJk7wCHQmPfQiilBZZ3ATt_VMXI=/0x112:1858x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69844723/Screen_Shot_2021_09_10_at_5.58.33_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The NFT tickets, seen above, change after they’re scanned. | Image: Dreamverse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f8jlr7"&gt;We can all agree &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt; are kind of weird, so here’s another twist to puzzle over: in November, you’ll be able to see the “inaugural display” of &lt;em&gt;The First 5000 Days&lt;/em&gt;, the collage/NFT that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;Beeple sold for $69 million&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. You can also, obviously, view the image right now, for free, wherever you are, on whatever device you’re using, by searching that title on Google. You could also pull the image up on your TV, or display it on a projector, or print it out, because that’s how digital images work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zh5eE"&gt;Here, look, I’m just going to embed a tweet with the image in it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pF3clf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Christie's is proud to offer "Everydays - The First 5000 Days" by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/beeple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@beeple&lt;/a&gt; as the first purely digital work of art ever offered by a major auction house. Bidding will be open from Feb 25-Mar 11.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more here &lt;a href="https://t.co/srx95HCE0o"&gt;https://t.co/srx95HCE0o&lt;/a&gt; | NFT issued in partnership w/ &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/makersplaceco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@makersplaceco&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/zymq2DSjy7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zymq2DSjy7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Christie's (@ChristiesInc) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChristiesInc/status/1361670588608176128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lFvqkU"&gt;The meaningful twist for this party is that it will feature the first &lt;em&gt;authorized &lt;/em&gt;public projection of &lt;em&gt;The First 5000 Days&lt;/em&gt;. That means the image’s owner, Metapurse, the crypto fund run by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327594/metakovan-beeple-highest-auction-price-69-million-nft"&gt;the pseudonymous investor Metakovan&lt;/a&gt;, is taking its one-and-only authentic copy of the image (or at the very least, its nominally exclusive display rights) and using them to put this piece of artwork up for a night as though it were being temporarily shown in a gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUpQSw"&gt;So I guess the question is: is it cool to see the “authorized” debut of an image you can already see any time you want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iND9Of"&gt;My guess is, for at least some people, the answer is yes. It might be akin to waiting in line to buy something at Supreme instead of ordering a knockoff, or seeing a re-release of a movie in theaters that’s been out for years and you can just as well watch at home. Maybe &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;don’t want to spend the money on that, but surely some people do. (I don’t, mostly. Although I did pay to see the 2005 &lt;em&gt;Pride &amp;amp; Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; at Alamo Drafthouse a couple years ago, despite owning a digital copy of it at home. It looked very good on the big screen.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFmFhK"&gt;One selling point for seeing it IRL? “The inaugural showcase of the work will be projected on a bespoke three-story-tall hybrid physical and digital structure,” according to Metapurse. IMO, big artworks are often the coolest artworks, so I think this has some real potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VdxtMt"&gt;If you’re interested, the image will be shown as part of an NFT event in New York City in November. The event, called &lt;a href="https://dreamverse.life/index.html"&gt;Dreamverse New York&lt;/a&gt;, will be split into two parts. There’ll be a gallery during the day, which will showcase more than 150 artists in an “interactive digital art experience.” Then at night, there’ll be a party and, notably, the display of Beeple’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfX3BM"&gt;Tickets start at $150 for a plain ol’ ticket to the party. If you want an &lt;em&gt;NFT ticket&lt;/em&gt; (of course you do), you’ll have to pay at least $475 to get into the party. If you just want to attend the gallery, you can get an NFT ticket for $30.&lt;/p&gt;
