    <title>Apple’s AirPods Max are $30 off at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9st56iOy91X0sdGE_jo8wjIUbJQ=/0x0:2075x1383/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69405646/AirPodsMax.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1FZwy8"&gt;Apple’s over-ear AirPods Max are $30 less than usual at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Silver/dp/B08PZD76NP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733321576396561727#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; today. Normally $549, every color option is $520 (Best Buy has most, but not all, colors at this price). Are they worth the purchase even with this slightly more affordable cost? If you’re a discerning shopper looking for unparalleled design and build quality, as well as great sound quality and ease of use, then perhaps they’ll be worth it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXCx2k"&gt;This price is hundreds more than the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose’s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700&lt;/a&gt;, both of which will serve most people very well. My colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Welch notes in his review&lt;/a&gt;, though, that the AirPods Max are tough to beat on the little details that might make a big difference with your day-to-day use of them. Things like the comfort, intuitive Digital Crown controls, easy device switching, and spatial audio give them the nod versus other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LYT1Nd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aDynKN"&gt;If you want to spend far less than the cost of the AirPods Max today, we have other deals to show you, like this one on the Shure digital condenser mic that can plug in via USB or Lightning for Apple products. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11552259?sid=VergeDeals&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.guitarcenter.com%2FShure%2FMOTIV-MV5-Digital-Condenser-Microphone-With-USB-and-Lightning-Cables-Included-Gray-1433776528834.gc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s available for almost half off at Guitar Center for $5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.guitarcenter.com/Shure/MOTIV-MV5-Digital-Condenser-Microphone-With-USB-and-Lightning-Cables-Included-Gray-1433776528834.gc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; (normally $100). This is the Motiv MV5, which the site lists as the previous generation model. It offers real-time audio monitoring with its 3.5mm jack, and it can connect to PC, macOS, Android, and iOS devices that use the Lightning port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RosQhT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10590511"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TmrScM"&gt;If you’re still gaming on a PS4, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064320/sony-ps4-dualshock-4-back-button-attachment-review-gaming-pro-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Back Button Attachment&lt;/a&gt; for your DualShock 4 controller might be of interest. Originally $30, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-dualshock-4-back-button-attachment%2F-%2FA-79382326&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1082904/2092?subId1=VergeDeals&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-dualshock-4-back-button-attachment%2F-%2FA-79382326" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;s just $15 at Target&lt;/a&gt;. The accessory attaches at the bottom and provides two paddle buttons that can be mapped to activate whichever button on the controller you’d like. For instance, if clicking R3 is annoying to you, just map it to one of the paddles. Or perhaps it’s where you’d like one of the D-pad arrows to be delegated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WPrEeE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10590518"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eVcqsP"&gt;Fitbit’s Charge 4 fitness tracker is down to $100 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084CQSL3Q/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742479826213234853#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; (originally $150). This model is a good fit for people who want comprehensive tracking without the need for a bigger, pricier smartwatch. It has built-in GPS for tracking walks, runs, and bike rides, as well as a heart rate monitor and support for contactless payments. Both the black and maroon models are discounted at Amazon, and they include small and large bands in the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4VLpKb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10590539"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple WWDC 2021: iOS 15, new MacBook Pros, and what else to expect</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qq4VZ46b6ppEuSTkzmyvRj8pXY=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69405394/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A promotional image for WWDC 2021.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LrPAza"&gt;Apple’s annual developer extravaganza, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), is coming up fast, kicking off with the keynote presentation on June 7th at 1PM ET. Like last year, WWDC will be an entirely digital and online-only event due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and for the keynote, that means we can likely expect another tightly produced video highlighting everything Apple has in store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcZ4wB"&gt;While we aren’t expecting any announcements on the level of Apple’s shift to custom silicon in its computers, which was WWDC 2020’s big news, Apple presumably has some notable changes in the works for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and its other operating systems. And if the current rumors pan out, we could also see brand-new MacBook Pros with the return of some long-missed features, such as MagSafe charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHOWsh"&gt;Read on to learn everything we expect from the big show. And don’t be surprised if Apple has a few surprises in store, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The large FaceID notch is still there, but it eventually feels normal." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s9nbJbUEu2WEZNOlTas0gOz9CFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973495/vpavic_4243_20201018_0144.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z1kYgB"&gt;iOS 15 may bring improvements to notifications and iMessage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XOV5HQ"&gt;We haven’t heard much about what may be coming to Apple’s next version of its mobile operating system, which will presumably be called iOS 15, but we could see big changes to notifications and possibly iMessage, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/apple-plans-notifications-ipad-home-screen-upgrades-for-ios-15?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGgV0K"&gt;For notifications, you may be able to have different notification settings for situations like driving, working, sleeping, or even a custom category, and you’ll be able to flip those on as you need to. You might also be able to set automatic replies based on which notification setting you’re currently using, like what you can do now with Do Not Disturb while driving mode. Personally, I’m hoping iOS 15 will let me allow notifications from a select few people while silencing just about everything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejmorG"&gt;As for iMessages, Apple is apparently working on features to make it act like “more of a social network” to compete with Facebook’s WhatsApp, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; said, but those features are still “early in development” and could be announced at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHBN4P"&gt;Apple also plans to add a feature that shows you apps that are silently collecting data about you, continuing the company’s trend of adding privacy-focused updates to its operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qs0a7Q"&gt;For iPadOS 15, you can apparently expect a major update to the homescreen, including the ability to put widgets anywhere you want. And with Apple just introducing the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;M1-powered iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt;, here’s hoping we see some new upgrades to take advantage of the new chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWYOGr"&gt;In May, Apple also announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22457534%2Fapple-wwdc-2021-rumors-ios-15-new-macbook-pro-what-to-expect" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a lot of new accessibility features&lt;/a&gt; coming to Apple’s operating systems, such as improvements in iOS to VoiceOver, support for bidirectional hearing aids, a built-in background sounds player, and new Memoji customizations like cochlear implants. Apple said these features would arrive “later this year,” which suggests they’ll be included in iOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h7c0nD"&gt;We don’t know much about macOS, watchOS 8, and tvOS 15 — but we could see a new “homeOS”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NohEvo"&gt;We haven’t heard all that much about upcoming software updates for the Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV, so we’ll just have to wait and see what Apple is cooking up. One tidbit: macOS could be a “more minor” update, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says. That wouldn’t be too much of a surprise, given that the macOS operating system got a big overhaul &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"&gt;with Big Sur&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AblZZZ"&gt;However, we could see the introduction of a brand-new operating system called “homeOS,” which was recently mentioned in and later removed from &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/02/apple-homeos-mentioned-in-job-listing/"&gt;an Apple job listing&lt;/a&gt;. While it’s unclear exactly which devices this OS is for, perhaps it will work on Apple’s home-focused products like the Apple TV and HomePod Mini.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UDG2Pc"&gt;New, redesigned MacBook Pros and a new Apple CPU could be announced&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5KJ6oA"&gt;Apple doesn’t always introduce new hardware at WWDC, but this year, new MacBook Pros seem like a possibility. In a May 18th report, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; said&lt;/a&gt; that new MacBook Pros might arrive “as soon as early this summer,” which could indicate an announcement at WWDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6QmUJq"&gt;These new laptops would have new Apple-designed processors that would “greatly outpace the performance and capabilities of the current M1 chips,” according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. The M1 is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;already pretty dang good&lt;/a&gt;, so it sounds like these new chips could be even more impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGX9qI"&gt;Apple is apparently planning on releasing &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; chips for the new Pros. Both should have eight high-performance cores and two energy-efficient cores, while leaving you with the option of either 16 or 32 graphics cores. (By comparison, the M1’s CPU has four high-performance and four energy-efficient cores, while its GPU is offered with either seven or eight cores.) You’ll probably also be able to spec the laptops with as much as 64GB of memory, up from a max of 16GB on M1-equipped computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5MBrI"&gt;The new laptops should be offered with either 14-inch or 16-inch screens and those screens could have “brighter, higher contrast” displays, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;according to a &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report from January&lt;/a&gt;. The laptops may also have a new design with flat edges as in the iPhone 12, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/"&gt;analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in January&lt;/a&gt;. I’m curious to see what that design might look like in practice — I worry that the hard edges could be uncomfortable if you have the laptop on your lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OiOCO"&gt;The best rumor is that the new design may also mark the return of some of the ports and features that were taken away with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13490774/apple-macbook-pro-review-2016-13-inch-laptop"&gt;now-infamous 2016 MacBook Pro redesign&lt;/a&gt;, including a MagSafe charger, an HDMI port, and an SD card slot, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; said in its May report. And, according to Kuo, the OLED Touch Bar currently found on Intel-based MacBook Pros will apparently be removed in favor of physical function keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cueoYL"&gt;We could see at least one other new Mac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Sr0eKZ"&gt;While it seems like MacBook Pros are the only new hardware we’ll be seeing at WWDC this year, that hasn’t stopped some other Mac rumors from swirling lately, and there’s always the chance Apple could announce more at its big event. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Apple also has “a revamped MacBook Air, a new low-end MacBook Pro, and an all-new Mac Pro workstation” in the works as well as a “higher-end Mac Mini desktop and larger iMac,” all of which would be powered by Apple’s custom silicon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpTzLE"&gt;The new Mac Mini may have the same chip as the new MacBook Pros. The new Mac Pro could be a beast, with processors that are “either twice or four times as powerful as the new high-end MacBook Pro chip.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8DBcX"&gt;And the redesigned “higher-end” MacBook Air could arrive as early as the end of this year. Frankly, I hope that refreshed Air arrives even later. I just bought the M1-equipped Air and it’s one of the best computers I’ve ever used, but I have a bad feeling I’ll be first in line to buy a redesigned and more capable Air anyway. (Especially if it gets the MagSafe charger that’s rumored for the new Pros.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SdMhc8"&gt;Apple might have dropped a hint about its AR / VR headset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hWxuz9"&gt;Apple has long been rumored to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;a mixed reality headset in the works&lt;/a&gt;, and recently, we’ve learned a few more potential details about it. The headset might be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; expensive — approximately $3,000, according to one report — though it could be packed with 8K displays, more than a dozen cameras to track hand movements and capture footage, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;might weigh less than an iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbDfpo"&gt;While the headset could be a ways out, as it’s not expected to ship until 2022 at the earliest, a few suspicious details in Apple’s WWDC promotional images &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be hinting toward some kind of reveal of Apple’s upcoming headset or the software on which it runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEwuRw"&gt;Check out this image below (that I also used at the top of this post), which Apple released alongside the announcement of WWDC in March. Notice the way the app icons are reflected in the glasses — I could imagine some sort of mixed reality headset showing icons in front of your eyes in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GVsPoR1G837_6LQp6aHbEOLrLa4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22549429/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those icons sure are reflected in an interesting spot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJi4b2"&gt;Apple continued that reflections motif with new images released in May — you can see things from the laptop screens reflected in all of the eyes of the Memojis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bPEFWi2kCP_J0PT-w7N3kd70zVg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22549430/Apple_WWDC21_details_announcement_052421.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look at those reflections.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xq7x4h"&gt;Now, these reflections may just be Apple’s artists flexing their design chops. And if I had to guess, given how far out a rumored mixed reality headset is, I don’t think we’re going to see anything about it at WWDC this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1tXnv"&gt;But Apple has surprised us in the past, and maybe these images are an indication of one more thing Apple has in store for WWDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SP4Jl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySvSwa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden’s proposed budget keeps a block on recreational weed sales in Washington, DC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hemp plants in Hedersleben" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QTbxLIds4hCswNK_LW1V1QTXy3g=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69405392/1227889847.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="48XIFE"&gt;A rider that has effectively blocked recreational cannabis for years in Washington, DC appears in President Joe Biden’s proposed 2022 budget, which may keep weed on the back burner yet again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4Ufdh"&gt;Even though residents of DC &lt;a href="https://wamu.org/story/14/11/05/pot_legalization_approved_by_dc_voters/"&gt;voted to legalize&lt;/a&gt; possession of recreational marijuana in 2014, the measure has been in limbo since then, &lt;a href="https://dcist.com/story/21/06/01/biden-budget-keeps-ban-on-weed-sales-in-dc/"&gt;derailed by a rider&lt;/a&gt; to DC’s appropriations bill first introduced by Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD), that prohibits the District from spending its local funds on commercialization of recreational cannabis, such as dispensaries. And Biden’s proposed 2022 budget includes the rider’s language yet again.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmKpWy"&gt;Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) &lt;a href="https://norton.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/norton-secures-major-victories-for-dc-in-biden-budget-disappointed-with"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; she was having a hard time reconciling the Biden administration's support for DC statehood with its budget that would prevent DC from commercializing recreational cannabis. “With Democrats controlling the White House, House and Senate, we have the best opportunity in over a decade to enact a D.C. appropriations bill that does not contain any anti-home-rule riders,” Norton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DB7KnL"&gt;Asked if the president plans to remove the language from the proposed budget, a Biden administration official said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the president “continues to strongly support DC statehood, under which the people of DC could make policy choices just like other states.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfuEqv"&gt;DC has long had a so-called “&lt;a href="https://dcist.com/story/16/09/16/weed-delivery-in-dc/"&gt;gray market&lt;/a&gt;” for marijuana, with medical cannabis legal, and recreational cannabis technically legal, but unable to be taxed or regulated because of the Harris rider. DC voters first &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/daily/sept99/marijuana21.htm"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; medical marijuana in 1998, but it too was initially blocked, by the Barr Amendment, legislation that Congress finally overturned in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpF0i1"&gt;Biden, once a leading voice in the “&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/20/18677998/joe-biden-1994-crime-bill-law-mass-incarceration"&gt;War on Drugs&lt;/a&gt;” of the 1980s and ’90s, said during the 2020 presidential campaign that it was “time to decriminalize” marijuana use, but so far during his administration there’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22243311/democrats-biden-marijuana-policy-reschedule-drug"&gt;little action to do so&lt;/a&gt; at the federal level. Dozens of US states have legalized medical marijuana, recreational marijuana, or both, and public opinion &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/323582/support-legal-marijuana-inches-new-high.aspx"&gt;supporting legal weed is at an all-time high&lt;/a&gt;. And Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Ron Wyden (D-OR), have said they would work together &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22243311/democrats-biden-marijuana-policy-reschedule-drug"&gt;to advance comprehensive cannabis reform&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lzCeQ"&gt;In February, DC Mayor Muriel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MayorBowser/status/1365368726967775234?"&gt;Bowser proposed legislation&lt;/a&gt; “to create an equitable adult-use cannabis program” in DC, which would impose a 17 percent tax on cannabis sales. But it’s unlikely to take effect if the rider remains in Biden’s proposed 2022 budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHDJQT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4djcW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99c8QD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZHwhLr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU and UK open antitrust investigations into Facebook Marketplace</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dveNeQEMR-wwqpYH2-rTxmPR804=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404905/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mwtjs4"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2848"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-investigates-facebook-s-use-of-ad-data"&gt;UK regulators&lt;/a&gt; have opened antitrust investigations into Facebook over concerns its Marketplace service is unfairly distorting competition for classified ads. Both are interested in whether or not Facebook unfairly used advertising data to compete in the classified ads market, and are collaborating as part of the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgCYVc"&gt;“Facebook collects vast troves of data on the activities of users of its social network and beyond, enabling it to target specific customer groups,” the European Commission’s competition head Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. “We will look in detail at whether this data gives Facebook an undue competitive advantage in particular on the online classified ads sector, where people buy and sell goods every day, and where Facebook also competes with companies from which it collects data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="brlIJ3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We will look in detail at whether this data gives Facebook an undue competitive advantage”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WpeTnh"&gt;In particular, the Commission says a preliminary investigation has raised concerns that Facebook may be using data from rival classified ads services that advertise on its platform to compete with them. The Commission and UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will now carry out in-depth formal investigations to assess these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoTpzI"&gt;In addition to concerns about Facebook Marketplace and classified ads, the UK’s CMA is also investigating Facebook’s dating service on similar grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqELAS"&gt;In a statement, a spokesperson from Facebook said it believes the allegations are “without merit,” adding that both Facebook Marketplace and Facebook Dating are part of “highly competitive” markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="undEjj"&gt;“We are always developing new and better services to meet evolving demand from people who use Facebook. Marketplace and Dating offer people more choices and both products operate in a highly competitive environment with many large incumbents,” the spokesperson said. “We will continue to cooperate fully with the investigations to demonstrate that they are without merit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oT1FdC"&gt;The European Commission has been scrutinizing Facebook Marketplace for years. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-marketplace-faces-eu-antitrust-probe-source-2021-05-26/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that European officials sent out questionnaires about the service back in 2019, only for Facebook to push back against the investigation &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53558947"&gt;the following year&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that the scale of the EU’s document request meant it would have to hand over unrelated, yet highly sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iii5zs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/3/13145242/facebook-marketplace-launch-buy-sell-ebay-craigslist-amazon"&gt;Launched in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s Marketplace service allows people to buy and sell items from locals. It’s now used by 800 million Facebook users across 70 countries, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. Rivals have reportedly complained that Facebook gives itself an unfair advantage by being able to advertise Marketplace for free to its 2 billion users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFeKmp"&gt;This is the first time Facebook has been formally investigated by the EU, the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3750ad46-04c3-4010-9fc1-fe2427c8520c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt; previously noted&lt;/a&gt;, with the case joining similar anti-competitive investigations by the bloc into the likes of Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;the EU formally accused Apple&lt;/a&gt; of violating antitrust rules with its App Store policies, and last November &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;the commission said Amazon&lt;/a&gt; was misusing the data it collects from third-party marketplace sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpWGvD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 4th, 7:03AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with Facebook’s statement on the investigations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new TV remote is great, but only when apps properly support it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vGjeS3jkHTEzIJSHAoxONF76doc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404757/DSCF3948_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JbNWB6"&gt;Users are complaining that the Disney Plus and HBO Max Apple TV apps aren’t properly supporting the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;new Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;. Disney Plus has &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/nrem4m/disney_doesnt_work_with_new_apple_tv_remotes/"&gt;yet to be updated&lt;/a&gt; to make use of the remote’s helpful scroll wheel scrubbing feature, which works on rival Netflix and Apple TV Plus apps. The HBO Max app has more issues, &lt;a href="https://www.screentimes.net/article/hbo-max-tvos-update-breaks-several-key-features-degrading-experience-significantly"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screen Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, and lacks support for several of the remote’s features and voice commands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNBA7o"&gt;When we tried the HBO Max app for ourselves, we found it doesn’t seem to support the new remote’s D-pad. Instead, we could only use the remote’s touchpad circle, which is technically an element of the remote you’re supposed to be able to disable. Scrubbing using the touchpad works, just very badly. The cause of these problems appears to be a recent app update, which replaced the standard tvOS playback UI with HBO’s own (and apparently far less capable) version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBClAz"&gt;It just goes to show that a platform holder can build a powerful combination of hardware and software in support of third-party apps and services, but it doesn’t mean anything unless those same apps and services actually bother to add support. We’ve reached out to both Disney Plus and HBO Max to see if they’re aware of the issues, and to find out when users can expect a fix.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A very sus chicken nugget shaped like an Among Us crewmate sells for $99,997 on eBay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3aSSXd7jAizhVH_IYno9waPdUP4=/0x160:1200x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404693/s_l1600.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’d still eat it.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/304012821839?_trksid=p2471758.m4704" target="_blank"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UI0t59"&gt;After an intense, dayslong bidding war, a single McDonald’s chicken nugget shaped like one of the &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; crewmates has just sold for an eye-watering $99,997&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F304012821839%3F_trksid%3Dp2471758.m4703&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F6%2F4%2F22504587%2Famong-us-mcdonalds-chicken-nugget-ebay-auction-bts" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on eBay&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpPCcV"&gt;The little nugget started off from humble beginnings, listed for a respectable 99 cents on May 28th. (I’d pay that much for it. Maybe even $5.) And for a little while, there were no bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cumi2C"&gt;But then, two days after it was first listed, somebody placed an (at the time) astonishingly high $14,869.69 first bid on the nugget, and things just escalated from there. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fbfl%2Fviewbids%2F304012821839%3Fitem%3D304012821839%26rt%3Dnc%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.l2565&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F6%2F4%2F22504587%2Famong-us-mcdonalds-chicken-nugget-ebay-auction-bts" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;I recommend scrolling through the bid history, it’s wild&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iCzwn0w4PY89BiGK0HWnIoxIuUo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22636616/msedge_SOv9UYEFFc.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: eBay&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The completed listing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A7d4Js"&gt;One factor that may have driven up the price is that the nugget apparently came from &lt;a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/bts-meal.html"&gt;a BTS Meal&lt;/a&gt; — yes, like the huge K-pop group. Maybe BTS Meal nuggets taste better? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neisuW"&gt;Oh, and if you were wondering, should the buyer choose to eat the nugget it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be safe to — the seller said they would freeze and air-seal the nugget and that it would be delivered “prior to expiration.” If I were the buyer, though, I’d use some caution. The seller says that “this food product has an average expiration of about 14 days,” but I am not sure where they’re getting that information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ciTx3Y"&gt;But if the buyer wants to dip the nugget in some Szechuan sauce? They’ll have to ask for that. “I have Szechuan and at buyers [sic] request will ship some with the nugget,” the seller said. Harsh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9p7Zn"&gt;Let’s just hope the nugget isn’t an imposter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Taito announces mini arcade cabinet with rotating screen and trackball controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bDH2eMvkcCQXwbrp_ZCGWmtQgNo=/1x0:1000x666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404638/taito1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zBZ6Hi"&gt;Taito is the latest Japanese video game publisher to resurrect old hardware in mini form. The company behind &lt;em&gt;Space Invaders&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bubble Bobble&lt;/em&gt;, and many more arcade classics has just announced the &lt;a href="https://taito.co.jp/egret2mini"&gt;Egret II Mini&lt;/a&gt;, which like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22347909/astro-city-mini-review-sega-arcade-cabinet-us-release-price-games"&gt;Sega’s excellent Astro City Mini&lt;/a&gt; is a shrunken-down version of a popular arcade cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3A3OIp"&gt;The original Egret II was released in the ‘90s, and its key feature was the ability to rotate its screen 90 degrees so that games with tall aspect ratios — like &lt;em&gt;Space Invaders&lt;/em&gt; and other shooters — could be played in &lt;em&gt;tate&lt;/em&gt; (vertical) mode. Appropriately enough, that feature is present on the Egret II Mini, which has a 5-inch 4:3 LCD that can be played in either orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ohl2w_fEGjI5gjNat_GA-TE5p0k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22636582/taito1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OHAVB6"&gt;The Egret II Mini’s primary controls include six primary buttons and an arcade-style microswitched stick that can be adjusted from four to eight directions depending on the game. There’s also an optional expansion controller that includes a paddle input for games like &lt;em&gt;Arkanoid, &lt;/em&gt;as well as a trackball for the likes of &lt;em&gt;Cameltry&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHEHpn"&gt;Here’s what the controller looks like. It’s 240 x 100 x 48mm, so it looks pretty substantial — somewhere between a traditional gamepad and fighting stick in size.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r7kZbanLZlbk_TqLc-GECzfd0H4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22636585/taito2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Jfe9E1"&gt;Taito is also selling a gamepad and an additional arcade stick as optional extras:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DW6jUN65tCk0IuvcTE_CvIIi7NM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22636591/taito3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="K3NohM"&gt;There’ll be 40 games preloaded on the cabinet itself, and the expansion controller also includes an SD card with ten games that use the paddle or trackball. Here’s the list of titles that have been confirmed so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mCAPnY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Invaders &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mtCl2w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lunar Rescue &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="m5xEbu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Qix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pJbgDt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elevator Action&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8DSmdj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chack’n Pop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BatQIx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bubble Bobble&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UyvEga"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rastan Saga&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nDNDQX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rainbow Islands Extra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="M9MMiO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Zealand Story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="F163wK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don Doko Don&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Y2IM0M"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Violence Fight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qUyjDQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cadash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NdmMTO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liquid Kids&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zgrKF8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metal Black&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0hN8Ik"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaiser Knuckle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="BdiX63"&gt;The paddle/trackball games so far confirmed for the bundled SD card include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="v021lo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strike Bowling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1mPp5G"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arkanoid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wsN1hi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plump Pop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="40rPIQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Syvalion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HwkGKR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cameltry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t6WYKc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arkanoid Returns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="m5SC1l"&gt;Beyond the SD card slot, the Egret II Mini also has a USB-C port for power, two USB-A ports for controllers, an HDMI port for TV output, and a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVpnMH"&gt;The Egret II Mini could get pretty expensive depending how big of a Taito fan you are. The cabinet itself costs 18,678 yen (~$170), the expansion controller is 12,078 yen ($110), the extra arcade stick is 8,778 yen ($80), and the gamepad is $3,278 yen ($30). There’s also a 49,478-yen ($450) limited bundle that includes everything plus some extras like soundtrack CDs, and a 32,978-yen ($300) bundle that excludes the arcade stick and the gamepad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbaegO"&gt;At least there’s time to save up your yen — the Egret II Mini won’t ship until March 2nd 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s next iPad Pro has wireless charging and a glass back: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2021 11-inch iPad Pro. This review has focused a lot on the 12.9, but other than the screen and size the 11-inch is the same." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xD1MZdg_0RBL6JtRDapYh_oyZsE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404453/vpavic_210512_4592_0203.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sYmdkN"&gt;Apple is working on a new version of the iPad Pro with wireless charging, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/apple-working-on-ipad-pro-with-wireless-charging-new-ipad-mini"&gt;new report in Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. To accommodate the technology, Apple will reportedly switch to a glass back for the new models, instead of the aluminum found on the rear of every iPad released so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nmfVk"&gt;Apple is said to be testing a magnetic charging system for the new iPad Pro similar to the MagSafe connector introduced with the iPhone 12 range of phones last year. Apple may also include reverse wireless charging in the new iPad Pro, according to the report, which would allow the iPad to serve as a wireless charging point itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nqHYdc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Editor’s Choice: iPad mini 2019","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/13/18564029/ipad-mini-5th-generation-2019-editors-choice"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="I4b119"&gt;Apple only just released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;the new M1 iPad Pro with its Mini LED display&lt;/a&gt;, and the wireless charging model reportedly won’t be ready until next year. However, Bloomberg also says that Apple will release a redesigned iPad Mini in 2021 with narrower screen bezels. It’s not clear whether it’ll switch to Face ID like the iPad Pro or Touch ID on the power button like the iPad Air — Bloomberg’s report only says that “the removal of its home button has also been tested.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7jgAh"&gt;Alongside the new iPad Mini, Apple is also said to be planning to release a thinner version of the 10.2-inch iPad. Both products are likely to be released around the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Climate tech is about to fly commercial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HlVmHmfQJ0b5DKC-A4UxCxIBcio=/0x0:689x459/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69403168/paolo_wilczak_groton_ct_04252020_compressed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Hiring private contractors to sample greenhouse gases from the air is an important aspect of NOAA’s climate research. Here, Paolo Wilczak pilots a sampling flight over southeastern Connecticut on April 25, 2020, as part of the East Coast Outflow field mission. The Global Monitoring Laboratory hopes to add civilian airliners to its sampling fleet.&amp;nbsp; | Paolo Wilczak, Scientific Aviation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u7IXYA"&gt;A greenhouse gas-tracking technology is about to go commercial. Greenhouse gas detectors will soon take flight on an Alaska Airlines-run Boeing 737-9, in an effort to help federal scientists get even more information about how we’re changing the climate. The tools would measure concentrations of planet-heating pollution in the air, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwQyHa"&gt;They’re calling the plane, which won’t have any passengers, an “&lt;a href="http://www.boeing.com/principles/environment/ecodemonstrator"&gt;ecoDemonstrator&lt;/a&gt;.” It’s testing a number of contraptions along with the greenhouse-gas detector — including features that might make the plane more fuel-efficient or less noisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bR1OzA"&gt;Over several test flights this year, NOAA will figure out the best place to install their devices — either mounted on a window or in a duct that feeds outside air into the plane — in order to stay out of the way of the plane’s own exhaust. The goal is to beef up NOAA’s existing data collection efforts by eventually getting the equipment on a number of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;commercial airliners making domestic and international flights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oNOGOJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re actually measuring where it counts”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pq3zBk"&gt;A handful of private jets already collect samples for NOAA. An entire fleet of commercial planes adding to the effort could become a powerful tool for tracking where greenhouse gas emissions come from and how much they’re building up in the atmosphere. That knowledge could also help scientists and policymakers measure whether or not humans are making any progress towards tackling climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtvQSX"&gt;“We think we’re making inroads, but are we making inroads? Is the atmosphere actually changing?” says Colm Sweeney, lead scientist for the NOAA Earth System Research Lab Aircraft Program. “Are we looking at the forest or are we just looking at one tree?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prsN3s"&gt;Sweeney and his colleagues plan to focus on carbon dioxide and methane. From the ground, researchers can get pretty good estimates of how much CO2 comes from burning fossil fuels for things like electricity, transportation, and industry. Ground-level data on methane emissions, on the other hand, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22360189/gas-stove-methane-leaks-electric-climate-change"&gt;murkier because it typically just leaks&lt;/a&gt; out of oil and gas infrastructure. There have been more efforts lately to measure these things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/12/16460014/nasa-oco-2-satellite-carbon-dioxide-earth-atmosphere-plants-ocean-climate-change"&gt;by satellite&lt;/a&gt;, too. But planes can fly through the air where these greenhouse gases actually build up, making more precise measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEO10q"&gt;“We’re actually measuring where it counts,” Sweeney says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="agDyxh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Big news! NOAA and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Boeing?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Boeing&lt;/a&gt; are teaming up on the 2021 ecoDemonstrator program, which will allow NOAA to test out its greenhouse gas sampling system on an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlaskaAir?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AlaskaAir&lt;/a&gt; airplane. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TAwmP4thOx"&gt;https://t.co/TAwmP4thOx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/6wnAaMaZgM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6wnAaMaZgM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NOAA Research (@NOAAResearch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NOAAResearch/status/1400457720000516103?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xmPcaI"&gt;By taking samples of the outside air over the course of the plane’s journey, researchers can potentially triangulate the source of the pollutants that they measure. Not only are they tracing the emissions back to their source, but they’re also seeing how that pollution travels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gr5XDz"&gt;That’s also important for sussing out how changes to the natural world are affecting the climate. Rising temperatures are melting permafrost, releasing even more methane into the atmosphere, pushing temperatures higher in a dangerous feedback loop. NOAA hopes to better understand the extent to which that’s happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="mTmkFh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NOAA’s measurements could give some early warnings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oYB4pQ"&gt;Scientists are also worried about how much humans can continue to rely on natural resources, like oceans and forests, to draw down and store carbon dioxide emissions. NOAA’s measurements could give some early warnings before these ‘carbon sinks’ reach their limits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hi3vNi"&gt;Sweeney hopes NOAA’s test runs are successful. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/03/826848818/one-more-coronavirus-problem-accurate-weather-forecasts"&gt;Thousands of commercial planes&lt;/a&gt; are already taking temperature readings used for weather forecasts. So perhaps one day they could all also take stock of the pollution that’s giving the planet a fever in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google confirms diversity exec no longer in role after problematic post</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RyVY1e4lie7Y0cfQ7GA2sUgtd7I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69402074/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="laUksJ"&gt;One of Google’s top executives in diversity strategy and research has left his position after a 2007 blog post slamming the state of Israel resurfaced on June 1st. In the post, Kamau Bobb used antisemitic language, insinuating Jews have an “insatiable appetite for war and killing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z37YRi"&gt;The post was quickly picked up by the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Washington Free Beacon&lt;/em&gt;. “While Google has been a vocal supporter of diversity initiatives... it has not commented on the recent spike in anti-Semitic hate crimes,” &lt;a href="https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/google-diversity-head-said-jews-have-insatiable-appetite-for-war/"&gt;read a &lt;em&gt;Washington Free Beacon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; article on the subject&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qvq8H6"&gt;But the controversy likely didn’t start with the right-wing press. It seems to have begun internally, with an email from a member of Google’s Jewish employee resource group. On June 1st, an employee sent a note to the Jewish employee listserv, which has more than 3,000 members, writing that they were “deeply concerned about antisemitism within our DEI leadership.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mQrG2"&gt;The email read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Oq0qwK"&gt;As the subject indicates, I’m very concerned about antisemitism within our leadership. Our Director of Diversity Strategy and Research appears to have strong opinion about Jews and Israel. I’ll let you all have a look at his blog for yourselves, but here are some quotes that you’ll find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a96bB5"&gt;“If I were a Jew I would be concerned about my insatiable appetite for war and killing in defense of myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OGvquI"&gt;“The ability of the United States and Israel to not only dictate the terms of my subjugation but characterize my desire to be free as rooted in hatred would burn my intellect and my sensibility as a human being.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5IU6q"&gt;“Looming large, like a grand dark cloud of human atrocity, is the slaughter of Palestinians by unrepentant Israeli Jews.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2bCdz"&gt;Does anyone else think this is totally inappropriate for someone in this kind of position? I’m scared that someone at this level has these kinds of feelings about Jews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="lMoJ7s"&gt;The thread spiraled, garnering roughly 80 responses, with multiple calls for Bobb to be fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqJFa9"&gt;More moderate members of the group felt that while the blog post sounded problematic, the underlying sentiment resonated. “The language of this letter is very hurtful and antisemitic,” says a current employee who asked to remain anonymous. “That said, digging up an old blog from over a decade ago feels like a witch hunt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmW87X"&gt;Later that evening, Bobb sent an email to the Jewish employee resource group, apologizing for what he had said. “What I wrote crudely characterized the entire Jewish community,” he wrote. “What was intended as a critique of particular military action fed into antisemitic tropes and prejudice. I think we can all agree, there is no easy solution to this situation. But that’s beside the point. The way I expressed my views on that conflict were hurtful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xwTd1"&gt;Now, Google has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Bobb is no longer a member of the diversity team, though he remains at the company. “We unequivocally condemn the past writings by a member of our diversity team that are causing deep offense and pain to members of our Jewish community and our LGBTQ+ community,” wrote a Google spokesperson in a statement. “These writings are unquestionably hurtful. The author acknowledges this and has apologized. He will no longer be part of our diversity team going forward and will focus on his STEM work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKDsAt"&gt;Google did not respond to further questions about what focusing on “STEM work” means. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UqOie8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3CSss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2aI4Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giR0Va"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
