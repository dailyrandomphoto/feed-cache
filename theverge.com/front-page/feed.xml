    <title>FCC reduces out-of-state prison phone rates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="phone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Qg4lsb33xYuaGoVcChD2G2PkE0=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69318064/phone1_1020.1419979655.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;phone&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eC5vuf"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously Thursday to lower some of the rates incarcerated people and their families pay to speak over the phone. For jurisdictional reasons, the measure only applies to interstate or international calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKH5vc"&gt;The Commission approved a measure that prohibits companies like Global Tel Link and Pay Tel Communications from charging families and incarcerated people more than 12 cents a minute in large prisons and 14 cents a minute in large jails for out-of-state calls. Previously, rates were capped at 21 cents a minute and single conversations could total several dollars. The action also caps international calling services for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyZXS6"&gt;“Recognizing the exigent circumstances caused by the pandemic, we lower interim interstate rates for prisons and the largest jails,” Acting Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement Thursday. “This means that interstate rates will fall by more than a third for the vast majority of those who are incarcerated. For the first time ever, we cap international rates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OG2XtL"&gt;For years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/prison-phone-call-cost-martha-wright-v-corrections-corporation-america"&gt;criminal justice advocates have fought&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the exorbitant costs of phone calls in prisons. The FCC attempted to set similar rules lowering costs for &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/337593-court-strikes-down-in-state-prison-call-rates"&gt;intrastate calls in 2017&lt;/a&gt; but was overturned by a DC Circuit ruling. As a result, its current jurisdiction only applies to calls that cross state or national borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6yldd"&gt;A confluence of alleged “monopoly” power and lucrative financial arrangements between prisons and telecom companies are at the root of the expensive phone rates in prisons. In 2015, &lt;a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/income.html"&gt;the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; found that one-third of families go into debt due to high phone rates with incarcerated loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpwtDh"&gt;Lawmakers like Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Rob Portman (R-OH) have &lt;a href="https://www.duckworth.senate.gov/news/press-releases/duckworth-portman-booker-schatz-markey-and-king-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-address-predatory-phone-rates-in-criminal-justice-system"&gt;introduced legislation&lt;/a&gt; that would provide the FCC more authority to lower in-state prison phone rates, but it’s unclear if the bill will be passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHOqFE"&gt;“There is more we can do. Because as a matter of social justice we are not yet where we need to be,” Rosenworcel said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCCWT8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dvcG1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People are bidding millions for the first ride on Blue Origin’s suborbital crew capsule</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ng8ZFq4k7jyuZtRKCuAplhiN5UY=/263x0:3089x1884/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69317881/BlueOrigin_NS15_06_CapsuleDescent.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mWAE8b"&gt;Rich people are jockeying for a seat on Blue Origin’s first crewed New Shepard mission, bidding as high as $2.8 million for a ten-minute experience at the edge of space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YuOvvy"&gt;A single seat aboard the New Shepard crew capsule, dubbed the RSS First Step Crew Capsule, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420709/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-new-shepard-tickets-astronaut"&gt;went up for auction&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, starting with a sealed bidding round that drew “more than 5,200 bidders from 136 countries,” the company said in a statement yesterday. By Wednesday morning, when the auction’s open-bidding phase began, the highest bid was revealed: $1.4 million. It rose to $2.8 million by the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwZhXP"&gt;RSS First Step, a gumdrop-shaped pod with seats for six, is getting set to fly its inaugural crew sometime in the next six months, with one seat reserved for the winning bidder and the rest for company-selected passengers. Proceeds from the auction will go to Blue Origin’s &lt;a href="https://clubforfuture.org/"&gt;philanthropy&lt;/a&gt;, Club for the Future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XX4GcF"&gt;The company hasn’t revealed the ticket price for a seat — but through the auction, it’s getting a good idea of who the potential customers are and what they’re willing to pay. “Let’s say, the most active bidders, they’re gonna be very clear on our radar, so when we do go to open up those tickets, we’ll know who to go to contact,” Ariane Cornell, Blue Origin’s astronaut sales director, said earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JEwq1SgsFyi-4LtymTslfpDlYcw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528283/BlueOrigin_NS15_03_WindowView.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Blue Origin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;POV from inside Blue Origin’s suborbital crew capsule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PSiUcn"&gt;After this debut crewed mission in the coming months, more will follow, the company has said. From a desert in Texas, Blue Origin’s reusable 60-foot-tall New Shepard booster will launch the capsule roughly 65 miles into the sky past the Kármán Line, the internationally recognized boundary of Earth’s outermost atmosphere. The trip promises stunning views of Earth and the potential for passengers to experience the “&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/johnson/HWHAP/the-overview-effect"&gt;overview effect&lt;/a&gt;,” a feeling described by astronauts as a shift in awareness of Earth when seeing it from space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5IjeC"&gt;You’d need to drop a few stacks for that overview effect, though. The open-bidding phase for New Shepard’s seat closes on June 10th and enters a live, online auction round on Saturday, June 12th. “Participants must raise their bid limit by June 10 at 5 p.m. EDT to participate in the June 12 live auction,” a Blue Origin spokeswoman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HR12a6"&gt;The highest bid price is updated live on the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/"&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt;. The number increases in increments of 10 percent, according to a person working at RR Auction Company, the Boston, Massachusetts-based firm managing the auction for Blue Origin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymNoUB"&gt;The space company has test flown New Shepard 15 times so far without people on board, with the most recent flight serving as “a verification step for the vehicle and operations prior to flying astronauts.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get ready for a busy Atlantic hurricane season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nicaragua Prepares To Receive Hurricane Iota" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j6yupZOumAwIVbrsYEMhf6Cr3pY=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69317799/1286039153.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;nbsp;PUERTO CABEZAS, NICARAGUA - NOVEMBER 16: Palm trees blow by wind as Nicaragua prepares to receive hurricane Iota on November 16, 2020 in Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. Less than two weeks after being hardly affected by Hurricane Eta, villagers of Puerto Cabezas take precautions before landfall of Iota.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Maynor Valenzuela/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9aJmiq"&gt;The 2021 Atlantic hurricane season is shaping up to be busier than average. There’s a 60 percent chance of an above-normal season this year. Up to 20 named storms and as many as 10 hurricanes are expected, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/noaa-predicts-another-active-atlantic-hurricane-season"&gt;forecast&lt;/a&gt; published today by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). They also forecast up to 5 major hurricanes, which have&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;winds reaching 111 mph or higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srh3is"&gt;Hurricane season officially starts on June 1st. But for the first time this year, NOAA began issuing routine Tropical Weather Outlooks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22307511/atlantic-hurricane-season-start-two-weeks-early-may"&gt;two weeks early&lt;/a&gt;. More storms have developed ahead of the official&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;season in recent years, to the point where NOAA and the World Meteorological Organization are &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/hurricane-committee-discusses-record-breaking-2020-season-plans-2021"&gt;considering&lt;/a&gt; moving the official start date of the season up to May 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E2VaAo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“New normals” brought on by climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A6LF0R"&gt;This all reflects “new normals” brought on by climate change.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Every ten years, using data from weather stations, NOAA &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/new-us-climate-normals-are-here-what-do-they-tell-us-about-climate-change"&gt;updates the 30-year climate record&lt;/a&gt; it uses to determine what’s considered “normal.” Using that data, NOAA recently &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/average-atlantic-hurricane-season-to-reflect-more-storms"&gt;raised the bar&lt;/a&gt; for what’s considered a typical number of storms in a single season. The average is now 14 named storms and seven hurricanes in a season. Prior to that update, an average season had 12 named storms and six hurricanes. The new numbers reflect how much the world has already changed over the past decade, as well as technological advances that help meteorologists better detect storms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JkPik"&gt;“Now is the time to ensure that you have an evacuation plan in place, disaster supplies on hand, and a plan to secure your home quickly,” acting NOAA Administrator Benjamin Friedman said in a press briefing today. “It was a mere six months ago that the most active Atlantic season on record ended, and here we are now on the cusp of a new hurricane season.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAwWPQ"&gt;In true 2020 fashion, last year’s Atlantic hurricane season &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726487/2020-atlantic-hurricane-season-end"&gt;was terrible&lt;/a&gt;. Coastal communities reeled under repeated blows — Louisiana faced five named storms while Central America was hard-hit by Hurricanes Eta and Iota in quick succession. A whopping 30 storms grew strong enough to earn a name, and thirteen of those intensified into hurricanes. That was even more than the &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/extremely-active-hurricane-season-possible-for-atlantic-basin"&gt;“extremely active” season NOAA forecasted&lt;/a&gt;. They’d expected more storms because a climate pattern called &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ninonina.html"&gt;La Niña&lt;/a&gt; developed, which can lead to more hurricanes in the Atlantic. NOAA said that La Niña could develop again later in the season, although the agency doesn’t expect this year to be as bad as last season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="xqcLpF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Those trends raise the risk that these storms pose to people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j7W5Bq"&gt;The jury is still out on whether climate change makes storms more frequent — but there is &lt;a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/global-warming-and-hurricanes/"&gt;evidence that they’re growing stronger&lt;/a&gt;. Hurricanes are also &lt;a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/08/climate-change-is-causing-more-rapid-intensification-of-atlantic-hurricanes/?utm_campaign=Climate%20Signals%20Hurricanes&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=96891550&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_LJF2deWCaYUZclLL9HaaH6whOQ6hlphxMGhPyGuzDN_Znd7dxHa6N-XFGWi1P6LJQw-kVwNcIH0ZvnvreeVctQzsoNCcTYqIsUduhDin-2TZmfVU&amp;amp;utm_content=96891550&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;intensifying more rapidly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21560182/hurricane-strength-landfall-inland-climate-change-nature-study"&gt;keeping more of their strength&lt;/a&gt; upon making landfall. Those trends raise the risk that these storms pose to people, since they give communities less time to prepare and can reach farther inland. Tropical storms draw their strength from the sea’s heat energy. Hotter global temperatures translate to warmer seas and, consequently, more heat energy for storms to tap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTTbZx"&gt;Forecasts made last month by Colorado State University (CSU) and IBM’s The Weather Company also predicted a busy season. &lt;a href="https://tropical.colostate.edu/forecasting.html"&gt;CSU expects&lt;/a&gt; 17 named storms while the &lt;a href="https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2021-05-12-atlantic-hurricane-season-outlook-2021-may-twc"&gt;The Weather Company forecast&lt;/a&gt; 19. They both expect eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes to develop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gm1inr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMmDq0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer Swift 3X review: not quite swift enough</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Newer, but not quite better&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="csPE8T"&gt;Yep, this is a Swift. It has all the features that characterize Acer’s Swift line: a thin body, a lustrous Acer logo, a chassis so light it’s hard to believe you’re holding a laptop and not an empty shell. But the 3X is targeting a slightly different market from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21377208/acer-swift-3-review-2020-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Swift 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22256779/acer-swift-5-2021-review-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Swift 5&lt;/a&gt; for one reason alone: it has a discrete GPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8v9L0"&gt;Intel’s new Iris Xe Max, the company’s new discrete graphics card, is making its first appearance in an Acer laptop. With a starting price of &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11552143?sid=VergeAcer3XSwiftReview052021+&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.acer.com%2Fen-us%2Fswift-3x-laptop-sf314-510g-534z" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$899.99&lt;/a&gt;, the Swift 3X is both one of the lightest and one of the most affordable systems you can buy with discrete graphics. It’s not a system meant for intense gaming, though — the target audience is closer to amateur creators and students who work with photo and video for class. For this specific demographic, the Swift 3X makes sense. For anyone else, the 3X is a bit below its price point in enough other areas that there are likely better options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dLmdMY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10510065"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Swift 3X on a piano, open, facing away from the camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dg4QJqMbxs161kPMxwulA5OrqJo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525654/mchin_20190807_4585_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s kinda blue, right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8eXk3"&gt;The first thing you might notice about the Swift 3X is its interesting color scheme. The model I tested comes in a new “steam blue” color, which is a nice change from the sea of black and gray laptops that you’ll see in any public setting. There’s a bright blue hinge on the back with “Swift” printed across it as well, which will certainly make the device stand out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyZHjc"&gt;Weight, though, is the standout feature. The 3X weighs just 3.02 pounds and is 0.71 inches thick. As devices with discrete GPUs go, it’s an unusually portable machine. I brought the 3X on a weekend trip and could slip it into a packed backpack with no problem. It didn’t weigh me down at all. In terms of ports, you get a USB 3.2 Type-C Gen 2 with Thunderbolt 4 and DisplayPort, two USB 3.2 Gen 1, and an HDMI 2.0, as well as a combination audio jack. There’s a fingerprint reader below the arrow keys on the chassis, which worked well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="3BTOzp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10510055"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gJ91jh"&gt;The display is another standout feature. It looks great, with excellent colors and sharp details. What’s nice is that its matte finish, combined with Acer’s ComfyView technology, does a really excellent job of eliminating glare. Using the 3X outdoors was a mixed bag, though — I didn’t see my reflection, but the screen still wasn’t quite bright enough to comfortably use. (It maxed out at 274 nits in our testing — you want at least 300 nits to use a device in very bright settings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHal0L"&gt;That said, build quality is one area where the Swift 3X doesn’t quite measure up to competitors. Most of the chassis is aluminum, but it has a bit of a flimsy and plasticky feel. There’s noticeable flex in the keyboard and screen, which I don’t love to see in laptops over $1,000. And it’ll look like a bit of a clunker next to more expensive fare like Acer’s own Swift 5 — a big reason is that the bezels aren’t tiny (Acer claims an 84 percent screen-to-body ratio) and are visibly plastic. It also feels like a step down from some similarly priced devices like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21494523/asus-zenbook-14-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus Zenbook 14&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iA18EL"&gt;The keyboard and touchpad are functional but not my favorites. They’re a bit shallower and stiffer, respectively, than the best input devices you can find at this price. The touchpad is spacious enough but had significant trouble with palm rejection — my cursor bounced all over the place often while my palm was on the pad, and it sometimes interfered with my typing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hjdIW"&gt;Finally, this isn’t a machine I’d recommend for peripheral-free videoconferencing. While the microphones didn’t have any trouble picking my voice up, the webcam and speakers leave a lot to be desired. The 720p webcam is grainy and didn’t do well in low-light settings. (It doesn’t support Windows Hello facial login, either, though that’s not a crime at this price.) The audio is adequate for Zoom meetings, but I heard some distortion at maximum volume and had to turn the thing down. And I’d recommend an external speaker for anything more. When a friend and I tried to watch a YouTube video on the device, we had to lean in to hear the words clearly. Music has clear vocals, but bass is weak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNUZG2"&gt;The Swift comes loaded with DTS Audio Processing, which allows you to swap between presets for music, movies, and games, but there’s no preset for videoconferencing. I actually preferred listening to music on the movie preset, which seemed to have the best balance overall.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Swift 3X open on a piano, seen from the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rNPPTcLedwWUY22AI-TEnJD3Qhs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525655/mchin_20190807_4585_0004.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Swift 3X open on a piano from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/upr05O0ugmNx7BTiZMkgcuzqMPc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525656/mchin_20190807_4585_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power port, HDMI, USB-A, USB-C on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Swift 3X keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zjgydv8Yan5IZoB4sQ_cMgKxVvY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525657/mchin_20190807_4585_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Backlit keyboard and a precision touchpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="wj95CK"&gt;These are all compromises you’re making for the Swift 3X’s main attraction, which is its performance. In addition to the Intel graphics, my review unit is powered by Intel’s Core i7-1165G7. This quad-core chip powers many of the best ultraportable laptops on the market and should be capable of doing whatever general office tasks you need to do. It also enables a number of modern amenities, including support for dual-band Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.1, and Thunderbolt 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iv4Vls"&gt;My test configuration, which also includes 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, costs &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11552143?sid=VergeAcer3XSwiftReview052021++&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.acer.com%2Fen-us%2Fswift-3x-laptop-sf314-510g-767y%3Finternal_source%3Dus.acer.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,199.99&lt;/a&gt;. The $899.99 base model has a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. I imagine that most people in the Swift 3X’s target audience will want the more expensive model (for the extra storage if nothing else) unless they’re on quite a tight budget. But note here that you’re paying a premium for the GPU — an Acer Swift 3 with identical specs to my test model (which is basically this machine without the GPU) costs &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facnxa4kaa004.html&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeAcerSwift3XReview052021"&gt;$999.99&lt;/a&gt;, while an Acer Swift 5 (with no GPU, but a step up in build quality and a chassis that’s over half a pound lighter) is just $100 more at &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facnxa6saa001.html%3Fsterm%3D3sZzqlTt5xyLUbdwUx0Mo36dUkB2eSUlUWu02E0%26utm_source%3Drflaid68088%26sterm%3DXMv1pEWqFxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkB2ehw3IyB73U0%26utm_source%3Drflaid914099&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeAcerSwift3XReview052021"&gt;$1,299&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rcV3Yt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I only occasionally heard the fans spin up during my daily work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xeS2fT"&gt;The system does deliver, though. I used the Swift 3X to edit a number of photos with multiple other apps and tasks running in the background, and the device breezed through it without any slowdown or lag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBggj5"&gt;I never felt much heat, even when I was bouncing between over two dozen Chrome tabs — the bottom of the chassis got slightly warm, but that was the extent of it. I only occasionally heard the fans spin up during my daily work. The fold-under hinge creates some extra ventilation space, as do the dual copper heat pipes. You can swap to Performance and Silent fan profiles as well, though I didn’t find the Silent profile necessary given how quiet the Swift was on default settings. I did hear some annoying coil whine on Silent once or twice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVPrrQ"&gt;The Iris Xe Max GPU delivers entry-level graphic performance. The Swift 3X scored a &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=38713"&gt;313&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/PugetBench-for-Premiere-Pro-1519/"&gt;PugetBench&lt;/a&gt; for Premiere Pro, which measures a device’s performance on a number of Premiere Pro tasks. That means it’s a step above integrated graphics — it beats the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=29678"&gt;LG Gram 17&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=20088"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;, with the same RAM and processor, and it trounces both the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=35692"&gt;AMD-powered&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=37884"&gt;Intel-powered&lt;/a&gt; Surface Laptop 4. But it doesn’t beat the M1 integrated graphics in &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=38019"&gt;Apple’s MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s still a step down from midrange Nvidia graphics cards: the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=4693"&gt;Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; with a GTX 1650 Ti scored well &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=13321"&gt;above a 400&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The lid of the Acer Swift 3X seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oWoTvKKZ2NOYIGww5H22o371QFM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525658/mchin_20190807_4585_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel’s Deep Link technology provides better AI performance, per the company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qpwPX9"&gt;To get an idea of how these numbers translate to real-world tasks, we ran a five-minute, 33-second 4K video export. When comparing this machine to good ultraportables with Intel integrated graphics, you’re looking at a two- to three-minute improvement in export time with the Xe Max. The Swift 3X completed the task in eight minutes flat; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364183/lg-gram-17-2021-intel-11th-gen-iris-xe-graphics-performance-battery-review"&gt;Gram 17&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; both took over 10 and a half minutes, while the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review"&gt;AMD Surface Laptop 4&lt;/a&gt; took 16:33. The Swift 3X was even 15 seconds faster than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, though the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; finished the task in 7:39. Again, though, the Swift 3X is closer in performance to all of the Intel machines than to anything with a decent GPU — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; took just 4:23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Fk00j"&gt;Battery life was also a pleasant surprise, given the discrete GPU. I averaged seven hours and 51 minutes of continuous multitasking at around 200 nits of brightness. That’s comparable to the life span I got from the Swift with the same workload and better than what I got from the cheaper Swift 3. An unfortunately large amount of bloatware also comes preloaded onto this device (ExpressVPN, Norton Security Ultra, other various promotional stuff) so you may see better battery life if you take a few minutes to clean all that out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Swift 3X open on a piano seen from the front. The screen displays a blue, green, and white gradient." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EgnM6NLbj85thsg6AAe5gvd9-PQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525659/mchin_20190807_4585_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buy it for the GPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="OAG28t"&gt;The Acer Swift 3X offers more powerful specs than most laptops you’ll be able to find at its price point, with a standout display and battery life, and it manages to do so while being quite light and portable. It’s a step above machines with Intel’s integrated graphics, and a step below anything with a half-decent Nvidia GPU. That’s the clearest case in its favor — and if that sort of laptop is what you’re looking for, you may be uniquely suited to the 3X. The major competitor at this weight and price point I can think of is the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultra-Slim-i7-10510U-Innovative-Screenpad-UX434FLC-XH77/dp/B07YZ1MK99?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus ZenBook 14&lt;/a&gt;, which can come with an entry-level Nvidia GPU, but the chips in it are a generation old now, so we wouldn’t expect the same performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="022N8a"&gt;With that said, most other aspects of the chassis (the touchpad, the keyboard, the webcam, the speakers, the general build) aren’t quite up to par with other devices you can find at the $1,199 price point. I think you have to really want the GPU. If you don’t, but you’re shopping at this price point and are a fan of the Swift line, the Swift 5 offers better build quality, a thinner and lighter chassis, and a better keyboard and touchpad for just $100 more, with integrated graphics that are still pretty dang good. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acclaimed TimeSplitters franchise set to return under reborn Free Radical studio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LiDZBpDNQ_WreH_p8duj2t7wfQE=/40x0:541x334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69317366/new_timesplitters_game_580x334.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Cover art from the original &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters 2&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;released in 2002.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Free Radical Design&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Iv7W3f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters&lt;/em&gt;, the acclaimed PS2-era first-person shooter franchise, is being brought back to life by a newly reformed Free Radical Design, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/deepsilver/status/1395238772938264577"&gt;publisher Deep Silver announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Development is set to commence in the coming months after the new studio is built. The studio, which carries the same name as the original &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters &lt;/em&gt;developer, will be headed by Steve Ellis and David Doak, who founded Free Radical Design in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMUuJr"&gt;Deep Silver has been laying the groundwork for a new &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters &lt;/em&gt;game for several years. It &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/deepsilver/status/1029671005097283584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1029671005097283584%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2018%2Fgaming%2Fnews%2Fdeep-silver-acquires-timesplitters-second-sight-1202905883%2F"&gt;acquired the rights to the franchise&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, and in 2019 announced that it was &lt;a href="https://embracer.com/release/thq-nordic-ab-publ-publishes-interim-report-q1-april-june-2019-operational-ebit-increased-193-to-sek-204-million/"&gt;working together with series creator Steve Ellis&lt;/a&gt; to “help plot the future course for this franchise.” But today’s news, that the company is establishing a studio to bring &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters &lt;/em&gt;back, is a big commitment that increases the likelihood of a new game actually seeing the light of day. Not like the original &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters 4&lt;/em&gt; that was first teased &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2007-10-10-timesplitters-4-officially-official.html"&gt;way back in 2007&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t2AecE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A new Deep Silver Studio is coming - Free Radical Design &lt;a href="https://t.co/N5qTTcZfsW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/N5qTTcZfsW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Official Deep Silver (@deepsilver) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/deepsilver/status/1395238772938264577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O1pOV7"&gt;“To finally be able to confirm that the studio has been formed and that we have a plan for the next &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters &lt;/em&gt;game is incredible,” said Free Radical’s Steve Ellis. “While we cannot tell you anything more at the moment, we look forward to sharing information in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7npr1H"&gt;Free Radical’s &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters &lt;/em&gt;originally gained attention as a spiritual successor to Rare’s &lt;em&gt;GoldenEye&lt;/em&gt;, the seminal Nintendo 64 shooter. Free Radical’s founders all worked at Rare before starting the new studio. But over time, the &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters &lt;/em&gt;games have become regarded as classics in their own right. Their split-screen modes were especially beloved local multiplayer experiences, and it’s &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt; that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Nick Frost’s character Ed can be seen obsessively playing in &lt;em&gt;Shaun of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqpa5c"&gt;Unfortunately, after the release of &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters: Future Perfect&lt;/em&gt; in 2005, Free Radical followed it up with the abysmal PS3-exclusive &lt;em&gt;Haze&lt;/em&gt; in 2008, the last game it would release under its original name. A sequel to &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Battlefront II&lt;/em&gt; was also in development at the company between 2006 and 2008 but was canceled by its publisher, reportedly as it neared completion. &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; has a great &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-05-04-free-radical-vs-the-monsters"&gt;feature from 2012&lt;/a&gt; about the events that transpired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0XtLk"&gt;The studio would go on to be purchased and rebranded as Crytek UK, only to be shut down in 2014 and for its staff to &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/07/30/deep-silver-now-owns-homefront-new-studio-handling-development.aspx"&gt;transfer to Dambuster Studios&lt;/a&gt;. In case you’re wondering how a semi-complete port of &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters 2&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-12-homefronts-hidden-timesplitters-2-codes-date-back-to-the-original-source"&gt;ended up in Dambuster’s &lt;em&gt;Homefront: The Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, well, this is basically why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CjekwL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford teams up with South Korea’s SK Innovation to build EV batteries in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4KdqA4YnozxgBOrCWW1fMG_7tq4=/678x0:7997x4879/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69317293/22_16x9.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kng6TG"&gt;Hot off the heels of the public debut of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;F-150 Lightning pickup truck&lt;/a&gt;, Ford announced that it will form a joint venture with South Korea’s SK Innovation to manufacture batteries for electric vehicles at scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYQM7j"&gt;The two companies signed a memorandum of understanding to create a joint venture called BlueOvalSK that would manufacture batteries in the US. Ford has a preexisting relationship with SK Innovation, which supplies batteries for its Mustang Mach-E SUVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lQlWuJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;BlueOvalSK&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C4py0H"&gt;But now the two companies will plan on making those batteries together. For months, Ford has sought to gain more control over its supply chain as the race to produce more EVs for the growing US market heats up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLTMrW"&gt;SK Innovation recently lost a trade secret dispute with rival LG Chem that could hinder its imports to the US. (The companies &lt;a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ford-vw-battery-supplier-sk-innovation-said-to-reach-deal-to-avoid-import-ban-11618073730550.html"&gt;recently reached an agreement&lt;/a&gt; that could avert a possible import ban.) By making its own batteries in the US, Ford can avoid some of the conflicts that arise from sourcing batteries overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWTqUz"&gt;Last month, the company announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405470/ford-ev-battery-manufacturing-research-center"&gt;creation of Ford Ion Park&lt;/a&gt;, a global battery center of excellence” based in southeast Michigan. Ford said the purpose is to conduct research on how to go about making its own electric vehicle batteries. A team of 150 experts will work on ways to build EV batteries that are long lasting, quick to charge, and sustainable for the environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWF2Oz"&gt;Ford said that by 2030 it expects annual energy demand for its vehicles to be up to 140GWh annually in North America and up to 240GWh globally. Globally, battery production is expected to grow from 95.3GWh in 2020 to 410.5GWh in 2024, according to GlobalData, a data and analytics company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVQhnl"&gt;Ford will have to move more aggressively if it hopes to catch up to its competitors like Tesla and General Motors — both of which are working rapidly to localize their battery development in the US. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387129/gm-lg-tennessee-ultium-battery-factory-spring-hill"&gt;GM is building two battery factories&lt;/a&gt; with its partner LG Chem, while Tesla is in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451469/tesla-battery-day-news-announcement-elon-musk-updates-highlights"&gt;early stages of making its own “tabless” battery cells in-house&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;Volkswagen recently unveiled its own plan&lt;/a&gt; to build six “gigafactories” in Europe by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is letting anyone apply for verification for the first time since 2017</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tSHgR4XAc8zWN4hjzauErWzfbkc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69316929/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8XCysy"&gt;Twitter is &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/relaunching-verification-and-whats-next.html"&gt;relaunching its public verification program&lt;/a&gt;, allowing anyone to apply for a coveted blue check mark. The company also previewed potential changes coming to profiles and the upcoming label for automated accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fncb84"&gt;To make the grade for verification, users will have to meet Twitter’s &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/our-plans-to-relaunch-verification-and-whats-next.html"&gt;revamped verification criteria&lt;/a&gt;, which includes having an account of public interest that falls under one of six different types of categorizations as well as being &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts"&gt;“authentic, notable, and active.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yuFEzy"&gt;Here are the six categories of accounts that can qualify for verification:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="c0BcYi"&gt;Government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CkKYTj"&gt;Companies, brands and organizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nbVL5E"&gt;News organizations and journalists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Wr210u"&gt;Entertainment &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="G0b8sA"&gt;Sports and gaming &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="p7x0XR"&gt;Activists, organizers, and other influential individuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="EOyG4J"&gt;You’ll be able to apply for verification in the Account Settings tab at some point “over the next few weeks.” Once you’ve applied, Twitter says you can expect a response “within a few days,” but that timeline could open up to a few weeks depending on the volume of applications. All applications will be evaluated by humans, Twitter said in a briefing with journalists this week. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W2Yw1cjLWDZ1KWeF2h0Ca6zgdFc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526898/Verification_application_frames_together.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter’s new verification application.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CRqz2l"&gt;If you’re approved for verification, the blue checkmark badge will appear on your profile automatically. If Twitter doesn’t approve your application and you still think you qualify for verification, you can reapply within 30 days of the company’s decision. And if your account is &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; verified, you won’t need to reapply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSasvy"&gt;The return of Twitter’s public verification process has been a long time coming. The social network suspended the program &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/928654369771356162?s=20"&gt;in November 2017&lt;/a&gt; after it was widely criticized for verifying the account of a white supremacist. At the time, the company admitted that the purpose of verification had become confused. It was originally meant as a way to authenticate an account’s identity (“Yes, this is really so and so”), but over time the badge came to be seen as something like an endorsement by Twitter itself. Basically, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/10/16631774/twitter-verification-kessler-milo-abuse"&gt;it was a mess&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JSSZps"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verification originally launched in 2009&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xtqaos"&gt;The original verification program was launched by Twitter &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/a/2009/not-playing-ball.html"&gt;in 2009&lt;/a&gt; as a way of verifying the identities of high-profile users “at risk of impersonation.” But the process for verification was obscure and there was no obvious way to apply. That changed when Twitter opened up its verification program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/19/12227490/twitter-opening-verified-account-user-form"&gt;to the public in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewRz2M"&gt;When the public application program was paused in 2017, Twitter attempted to clarify its rules about which accounts are eligible for verification. A &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts"&gt;new verification policy&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in January 2021 with the six categories of accounts listed above that are eligible for verification. As per the January 2021 rules, accounts must have a verified email address or phone number, a profile image, and a display name to be eligible. Accounts may also lose their badge for “severe or repeated violation[s]” of Twitter’s rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FmsXC2"&gt;While the public verification program had been suspended, Twitter continued to manually verify certain accounts, like those &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1241155701822476288?s=20"&gt;publishing information about the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; or candidates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21011960/twitter-election-labels-2020-candidates-house-senate-gubernatorial-races"&gt;running in the US’s 2020 elections&lt;/a&gt;. And as part of Thursday’s announcement, Twitter says it plans to add more categories of accounts that can be eligible for verification later this year, including scientists, academics, and religious leaders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YzUJ4R"&gt;Alongside the new verification application, Twitter is also previewing changes it’s considering to profiles, including the addition of an About tab. The following image isn’t a final version of what these changes might look like, but they give you an idea of what Twitter is thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ub9F3UIFSclIUUTcz2nwxmWOezY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526912/About.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A potential design for an About tab for profiles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KZl760"&gt;One thing that Twitter &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; confirm will be coming to profiles is a dedicated pronouns field, but there’s no timeline as to when that might happen. Twitter joins other platforms in adding a pronouns field, including Slack, which began rolling one out on Wednesday, and Instagram, which added one last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJIbjX"&gt;Twitter also previewed its upcoming label for automated (aka bot) accounts. Twitter plans to ship this label sometime in July, Twitter’s product lead for profiles and identity, B Byrne, said in this week’s briefing. You can see what it looks like in this image:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nRgSKl0dSs_jOQSRWnvmMjvHGVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526929/Automated_Account_Profile.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A label for an automated account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DHZRiR"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187477/twitter-verification-badge-blue-checkmark-relaunch-process-new-rules"&gt;previously-announced label&lt;/a&gt; to memorialize people who have died will arrive later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s excellent WH-1000XM4 headphones are $90 off at eBay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of Sony’s 1000XM4 noise-canceling headphones on someone’s head." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2WXyLAFx01ysfxq4k-D2oMIGRds=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69316687/IMG_0625-1.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JHSQQc"&gt;About once a month, Sony’s flagship WH-1000XM4 noise-canceling headphones get a $72 price cut at a few retailers. But today, there’s a $90 discount happening at eBay that brings &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F284230046954%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeWH1000XM4Ebay052021%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F20%2F22445450%2Fsony-wh1000xm4-headphones-apple-siri-remote-galaxy-buds-plus-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the price down to just $260 for a new set in black&lt;/a&gt;. This excellent deal comes from eBay seller Pro-Distributing, which has a 98.9 percent positive feedback rating. Orders placed today should arrive next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QvNpO4"&gt;My colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Chris Welch reviewed this model&lt;/a&gt;, and the review title sums up what you need to know about the XM4 headphones: the best noise-canceling headphones get better. They look similar to the previous generation XM3, but the newer model has the ability to connect to multiple Bluetooth devices simultaneously and to pause music automatically when you take the headphones off, then resume once they’re placed back on your head. They’re improved in small but meaningful ways that make them worth upgrading to compared to the now-cheaper XM3 headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="isvALD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tz1htI"&gt;Apple’s brand-new, redesigned Siri Remote for the Apple TV is $9 off at Verizon. You can get one for $50 from the wireless carrier (via &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/20/deals-first-discount-siri-remote/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This one replaces the older style remote that has the glass-covered trackpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UhiPZb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10509961"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tn-fX96eR_5b9lex_3JWl0-94hI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137433/DSCF5554.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6cstJb"&gt;If you’re on the hunt for something more fitting for the warmer months than Sony’s over-ear headphones above, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus might be a better choice. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;These truly wireless earbuds are $100&lt;/a&gt; today at Amazon in red, white, black, or blue. This isn’t the first time that the Buds Plus have dropped to this low price, and outside of this sale it’s common to find them for around $110 or slightly more. Still, it’s an opportunity to have your pick at whichever color you want for a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0f9q0p"&gt;This model has great battery life, a lightweight and comfortable design, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;reviewer Chris Welch noted&lt;/a&gt; that their microphones are vastly improved for taking phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eINVUK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Shadow of the Colossus" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EDad4Lkit-P8x5YLiZgJH62zzc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10164935/38043101335_db8d53849b_o.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jzD9tu"&gt;Several retro and remastered games are discounted on the PlayStation Store — &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/1d32ca5f-2533-4ec0-aa70-a6a4bbeaed48/1"&gt;244 games in all&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking to boost your PS4 or PS5 library with some modern classics, head to Sony’s site for some very good deals. &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Colossus&lt;/em&gt; is half-price at $10, and &lt;em&gt;Shenmue I &amp;amp; II&lt;/em&gt; costs $7.50, to name some examples.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qX41UsX7-wdUrxc4UOT72luIP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13242923/DSCF0955.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KYgnO2"&gt;Google’s overpriced Pixel Stand Qi wireless charger for most modern Pixel phones is a little less costly today at Woot. It originally sold for $79, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13142105?sid=VergeWH1000XM4Ebay022021&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsellout.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fgoogle-pixel-stand-fast-wireless-charger" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but you can get one new for $38&lt;/a&gt;, which is comparatively a great deal. Wireless chargers for phones tend to cost far less than this, but fast 10W wireless charging for your Pixel phone can only happen on the Pixel Stand.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP’s new 16-inch Omen 16 has support for the latest Intel and AMD processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="HP Omen 16" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iPkkxySXefPUru1xlBzB38DUtDE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69316560/omen16.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rsD8Sy"&gt;HP made an almost overwhelming bunch of gaming announcements today, which include systems equipped with Intel’s 11th Gen H-series processors: a new 16-inch Omen gaming laptop and an updated 17-inch version, along with a new budget-friendly gaming laptop line called Victus. There is also a new Nvidia G-Sync-compatible monitor. Other major tech companies — such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22428604/razer-blade-15-gaming-laptop-mid-2021-intel-h-series-nvidia-rtx-3080-thin-15-inch-specs"&gt;Razer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429417/lenovo-legion-7i-5i-pro-gaming-laptops-intel-h-series-qhd-16-10-aspect-ratio"&gt;Lenovo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22428828/msi-gaming-laptops-creator-z16-m16-ge76-gs66-prices-specs"&gt;MSI&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22425078/asus-intel-zephyrus-m16-gaming-laptop-tiger-lake-h-chips"&gt;Asus&lt;/a&gt; — debuted their H-series-equipped laptops last week, but HP saved its news for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNBXzq"&gt;The Omen 16 (pictured above) has a 16.1-inch display and can be configured with up to QHD resolution using a fast 165Hz refresh rate. It’s got a 16:9 aspect ratio display (disappointing, since Lenovo and Asus have competing models offering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7"&gt;the more spacious 16:10 aspect ratio&lt;/a&gt;). You’ll be able to choose between AMD and Intel’s latest processors for this model, up to an AMD Ryzen 7 5900HX or an Intel Core i7-11800H, and each tops out at the RTX 3070 in the graphics department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5H9qDa"&gt;If you run with Intel and get at least the RTX 3060 for graphics, you’ll get a Thunderbolt 4 port as part of the deal. Otherwise, both the AMD and Intel models share some highlights in common, including an SD card slot and an HDMI 2.1 port for up to 4K output at 120Hz on supported displays. The Omen 16 can ship with a maximum of 32GB of DDR4 RAM clocked at 3,200MHz, and its battery tops out at an 83Wh capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9DNESW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Intel-based version with the RTX 3060 includes a Thunderbolt 4 port&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AxbZHt"&gt;The AMD and Intel models differ when it comes to how they handle storage. Both can have up to a 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD, but on the Intel configuration, the SSD runs at PCIe 4.0 speeds and has dual slots for RAID 0 storage. The AMD model is limited to PCIe 3.0 speeds, but that should still be fast enough for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8DEqL"&gt;HP has only shared the prices for the starting models of the Omen 16. The AMD model with a Ryzen 7 5800H processor, an Nvidia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423474/nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-60fps-gaming-laptops-features-specs-performance-price"&gt;RTX 3050 Ti&lt;/a&gt; graphics chip, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage, will cost $1,049.99. The Intel version that has the Core i7-11800H processor with the same storage and RAM, but with the RTX 3060 graphics chip, will cost $1,149.99. The Omen 16 is set to ship in June.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Omen 17 packs in a 17.3-inch display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="THQtIP"&gt;HP’s Omen 17 is a bigger, more powerful gaming laptop that isn’t as configurable when it comes to processors. This model supports Intel only, going up to the Intel Core i9-11900H. You can get it with Nvidia’s RTX 3080 graphics chip powered at 165W and with up to 16GB of video memory, which should ensure great gaming performance at QHD resolution. Its 17.3-inch display can be bumped up to QHD resolution at a 165Hz refresh rate, just like the Omen 16. This laptop starts at $1,369.99 and will also ship in June.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP Victus 16" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CQDWYOTykI5Q9GOkx0CdxoyBWJs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525781/victus16.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the Victus, you’ll be able to choose between blue, black, or white.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BuFrxB"&gt;A new addition to HP’s lineup of gaming laptops is the Victus, a more budget-friendly 16-inch model, also available in June, that will cost $849.99 with an Intel processor or $799.99 with an AMD processor. You’ll be able to configure this one’s processor and graphics up to Intel’s Core i7-11800H or AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800H processors, with up to Nvidia’s RTX 3060 or AMD’s Radeon RX 5500M GPUs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mz4MH"&gt;Memory and storage for the Victus is the same as for the Omen 16. You’ll be able to upgrade the Victus’ 16.1-inch display to QHD resolution at a 165Hz refresh rate, and the chassis comes in multiple colors (white, blue, or black). However, while HP talks a big game about the Omen 16 and Omen 17 having better airflow than before, resulting in lower running temperatures while gaming, the Victus might fall behind the more pricey Omen laptops in the cooling department. We won’t know how the Victus handles heat until we try it out ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="HP’s Omen 25i gaming monitor" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AvXcHrVbfjVmGaaBaG1d5l4636w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525788/omen25i.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HP’s Omen 25i gaming monitor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Vci181"&gt;Lastly, HP’s Omen 25i gaming monitor will cost $349.99 when it launches in July. It’s a 24.5-inch FHD IPS monitor that has slim bezels and adaptive sync to eliminate visual artifacts in games with AMD’s FreeSync Premium Pro and Nvidia G-Sync technology. Other notable features include a 165Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and a color-accurate picture with 90 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 gamut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrtMuv"&gt;HP has included some interesting features with this monitor, like a “Game Remaster” mode that uses filters to smooth over games that haven’t aged well and usually have jagged graphics. More impressive is its “Dynamic Crosshair” feature that can change color dynamically in order to remain easily visible when the contrast of your game’s scene changes. For games in which you’re going in and outdoors a lot, this could make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
