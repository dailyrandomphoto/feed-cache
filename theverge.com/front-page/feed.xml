    <title>Wyze announces $20 smartwatch with nine-day battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aXwGFHQqliyIUp1qNbuVQ9zo2m0=/351x0:4149x2532/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68067494/Two.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UfpKgF"&gt;Wyze, the smart home company best known for its range of budget internet-connected security cameras, has announced its debut smartwatch. The &lt;a href="http://wyze.com/wyze-watch.html"&gt;Wyze Watch&lt;/a&gt; will be available in two sizes — 44mm and 47mm — when it ships in the US in February 2021, and like the rest of the company’s lineup, it’s priced affordably at $20. Wyze’s announcement follows the release of the company’s first fitness tracker, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150549/fitness-tracker-wyze-band-alexa"&gt;$25 Wyze Band&lt;/a&gt;, earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VQcYM"&gt;The watch will ship with a fairly standard selection of smartwatch features, including blood oxygen monitoring, heart rate tracking, an IP68 water and dust resistance rating, nine-day battery life, activity and sleep tracking, and integration with Google Fit and Apple Health. However, the watch will also integrate with Wyze’s other devices; the company promises that it’ll support shortcuts to let you control products like its smart bulbs. It can also display your notifications, allowing you to read email previews and texts, though Wyze’s press release doesn’t explicitly say which mobile operating systems the watch works with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K0Y8dGFNTn1DFx_L7NmBQDbwVao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22129850/Six.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 47mm version of the watch (pictured) comes with a 1.75-inch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-kyqWxAdqlw15Zhc_1nayvsDbo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22129849/Three.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wyze Watch will ship in February.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0XNdT9"&gt;In terms of specs, the 44mm Wyze Watch has a 1.4-inch LCD display with a resolution of 320 x 320 and a 260mAh battery. The 47mm version has a 1.75-inch LCD display with a resolution of 320 x 385 and a 300mAh battery. Both have 16MB of storage. Neither offer GPS tracking, or support for voice assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZuITm"&gt;It’s hard to see Wyze beating out competition from the likes of Apple or Samsung when it’s pricing its debut smartwatch at just $20. But if it can deliver on its modest promises to offer a simple, functional experience, then the Wyze Watch could become an attractive first smartwatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1pvRw"&gt;The Wyze Watch is available to preorder starting today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s Oversight Board takes its first six cases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1OE-tT5XlBXC5W8V2Xq-VgEiUpM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68061385/acastro_180806_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b9TKRb"&gt;Facebook’s Oversight Board, an independent body that reviews Facebook moderation decisions, has &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/719406882003532-announcing-the-oversight-board-s-first-cases-and-appointment-of-trustees/"&gt;accepted its first cases&lt;/a&gt;. The six appeals involve content removed under Facebook’s hate speech rules, nudity ban, and misinformation policies. They’re now open for seven days of public comment, after which the board will determine whether the posts should have been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxeF7l"&gt;Most of the cases involve users outside the US posting non-English content — a known &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-languages-insight/facebooks-flood-of-languages-leaves-it-struggling-to-monitor-content-idUSKCN1RZ0DW"&gt;weak point&lt;/a&gt; for Facebook moderation — and at least two hinge on the nuance of someone publishing hate content to implicitly criticize it. One user posted screenshots of &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/30/malaysias-mahathir-post-on-french-killings-taken-out-of-context"&gt;offensive tweets&lt;/a&gt; from former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, for instance, allegedly to raise awareness of “horrible words.” Another post involved a user who shared an alleged Joseph Goebbels quote, but who appealed by saying they were comparing Goebbels’s words to a “fascist model” in US politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vx2pVL"&gt;Each case will be referred to a five-member panel that includes one person from the same region as the original content. These panels will make their decisions — and Facebook will act on them — within 90 days. The oversight board, whose &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-oversight/facebook-names-first-members-of-oversight-board-that-can-overrule-zuckerberg-idUSKBN22I2LQ"&gt;first members&lt;/a&gt; were announced in May, includes digital rights activists and former European Court of Human Rights judge András Sajó. Their decisions will be informed by public comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHxV82"&gt;Five of the incidents were submitted by users, who have appealed over 20,000 decisions since the option opened in October. The last was referred by Facebook itself and deals with coronavirus-related misinformation — one of the platform’s touchiest subjects. Moderators removed a video that criticized French health officials for not authorizing unproven COVID-19 treatment hydroxychloroquine, which the video inaccurately referred to as a “cure.” The company later submitted it as “an example of the challenges faced when addressing the risk of offline harm that can be caused by misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdJOTc"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has compared the Oversight Board to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20870827/facebook-supreme-court-mark-zuckerberg-content-moderation-charter"&gt;a Supreme Court for Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. It’s supposed to offer a fair appeals process for users who get their content removed — something that often feels missing on social networks, especially as they take stricter steps to remove false information or offensive speech. At the same time, it eases the pressure on Facebook to make moderation calls. Cases like the pandemic video decision, for instance, will set an independently decided precedent for when Facebook removes similar content in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibUJJF"&gt;The Oversight Board — similar to the US Supreme Court — is largely supposed to interpret policies, not make new ones. Facebook has said it may also turn to the board for policy recommendations in the future, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBRkWA"&gt;Many of Facebook’s problems involve the speed and scale of content moderation, not the exact nuances of interpreting its policies. The Oversight Board obviously can’t hear all the appeals cases, and we don’t know exactly how rank-and-file moderators will apply its rulings to everyday decisions. But it’s the start of a long-awaited experiment in managing Facebook (a little) more like a government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0rXAoZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams gets an overhauled calling interface, CarPlay support, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K2TUFgb6SUp_h-igzbSg3RJHMb8=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68058693/microsoftteamscalling.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2qZoZZ"&gt;Microsoft is overhauling its calling features inside Microsoft Teams today. A new calling interface will now show contacts, voicemail, and calling history in a single location. It’s designed to allow Microsoft Teams to more easily replace your desk phone, with built-in spam call protection, reverse number lookup, and the ability to merge calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyMqEd"&gt;Microsoft Teams users will also be able to transfer calls between mobile and desktop soon, allowing people to quickly move locations in the middle of an audio or video call. The Teams app will let people join without audio on an additional device, or simply transfer the call and end it automatically on other devices. Microsoft says this particular feature will be available in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gLcavWyrxelkRO0J7NYX_Cky9k0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22133229/microsoftteamscalling.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Microsoft Teams calling features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D7oSCK"&gt;People who regularly record meetings in Microsoft Teams will also see some new options. You’ll be able to record meetings to SharePoint or OneDrive, providing greater flexibility than being limited to Microsoft’s Stream service. That will also make it easier to share calls or transcripts with people outside a Teams organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RVOsY"&gt;Finally, Microsoft is also bringing CarPlay support to Microsoft Teams. This will allow cars with built-in CarPlay to control Teams and for people to use Siri to initiate or answer calls. It’s not clear when Microsoft Team will support Android Auto in the future, though.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Bomberman R Online is Stadia’s second totally free game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cdQ2D1DzBRlw-mU7rwD-cOTjw40=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68058577/super_bomberman_r_switch_screenshot05.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Konami&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s6IcmG"&gt;Heading into its second year, Google’s Stadia game streaming service is adding more games and making it easier to play without having to pay. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571699/google-stadia-destiny-2-free-to-play-game-chromebook-phone"&gt;The first free game released for the service was &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and now it has another multiplayer companion: &lt;em&gt;Super Bomberman R Online&lt;/em&gt; will become free today. All you need is a Stadia account, which is completely free. On Android or in the Chrome browser, you should be able to &lt;a href="https://stadia.com/link/aFu2pZmeQSnvPiZ16"&gt;click this link&lt;/a&gt; to launch the game now if you’re logged in to that account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8WUbk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bomberman &lt;/em&gt;is a particularly fitting title to make free, considering it’s got a 64-player battle royale mode that’s exclusive to Stadia, and its lobbies might have been difficult to fill if each player had to pay. Otherwise, it’s an updated 3D take on the bomb-laying and maze-navigating &lt;em&gt;Bomberman&lt;/em&gt; gameplay many players already know, which also released on the Nintendo Switch in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eIODQ0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CglZtgOmvqg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zQr1Ct"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575100/google-stadia-one-year-anniversary-cloud-gaming-cyberpunk-2077-launch-test"&gt;Stadia’s first year was difficult&lt;/a&gt;, primarily because of the upfront cost to play on your TV or phone and a long wait for the games and features that Google promised before the service launched. Adding &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; for free last month was a big step in the right direction. And while maybe not as well-known, &lt;em&gt;Super Bomberman R Online&lt;/em&gt; adds another option for players to enjoy without having to invest in Stadia’s subscription service, Stadia Pro, or purchase any games upfront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vu2X1g"&gt;Google says it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612848/google-stadia-400-games-200-developers"&gt;big plans for Stadia in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, so expect more features and (hopefully) free games in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ji7N0R"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla whistleblower Martin Tripp ordered to pay $400,000 to settle hacking case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zhkAIKAW-njRZwPssYynnV3SvF8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68054219/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tGDtXv"&gt;Martin Tripp, the former Tesla worker who has been embroiled in a bitter legal battle with CEO Elon Musk for over two years, was ordered to pay his former employer $400,000 after admitting to leaking confidential information to a reporter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvjoR9"&gt;The settlement is intended to bring an end to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263757/tesla-elon-musk-employee-hack-spying-whistleblower-gigafactory-martin-tripp-drugs"&gt;one of the more sordid stories at Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, in which Tripp, a former process technician, locked horns with the billionaire CEO over allegations that Tesla was wasting a “jaw-dropping” amount of raw material as it ramped up production of the Model 3 sedan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XeTnH4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The settlement is intended to bring an end to one &lt;s&gt;﻿&lt;/s&gt;of the more sordid stories at Tesla&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="szRtQi"&gt;Musk later accused Tripp of “sabotage” and personally ordered investigators to hack Tripp’s phone and spy on his messages. Tesla even misled local police about a potential mass shooting by Tripp at the company’s Nevada factory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEeBr9"&gt;But in the end, Tripp came out on the losing side. The payment is part of a proposed settlement to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17484030/tesla-sues-employee-hacking-theft-leaking"&gt;a lawsuit filed by Tesla in 2018&lt;/a&gt; alleging that Tripp hacked the electric car company’s system and transferred “gigabytes” of data to third parties. As part of the agreement, Tripp admitted to violating laws related to trade secrets and computer crimes when he &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-model-3-scrap-waste-high-gigafactory-2018-5?r=UK"&gt;told a &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; reporter&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla was wasting a significant amount of raw materials during production of its Model 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8XleL"&gt;Tripp also agreed to pay $25,000 to Tesla for continuing to reveal information about the company, despite being ordered to stop by a judge. Tripp had been publishing a large number of documents and videos online, including many under a confidentiality order in the case. In August, Tripp fired his lawyers and set about representing himself in the case. It was also revealed that a Tesla short seller, &lt;a href="http://www.cablecarcapital.com/"&gt;The Funicular Fund&lt;/a&gt;, was financing Tripp’s legal defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bOk1Aq"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/19/21446587/judge-dismiss-defamation-employee-tesla-leak-elon-musk-model-3"&gt;a judge dismissed Tripp’s defamation case&lt;/a&gt; against Tesla, in which the former technician accused the company of spreading false rumors about him. After Tripp filed for whistleblower status with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Musk emailed a reporter at &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-03-13/when-elon-musk-tried-to-destroy-tesla-whistleblower-martin-tripp?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; telling them&lt;/a&gt; a tipster had contacted Tesla to say that Tripp might “come back and shoot people,” at the Nevada Gigafactory. The local sheriff determined the threat was not real, but Tesla issued a press release, which was picked up by several media outlets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8SUGC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go watch this video about an AI system that can predict how proteins fold</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A diagram comparing an AlphaFold prediction with an identified protein shape, showing 99.09 percent Global Distance Test accuracy." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AVDQgynabdlgPnprYiR4bBFrd2U=/108x0:1262x769/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68052988/global_distance_result.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An AlphaFold prediction compared against an identified protein.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: DeepMind&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eUYngK"&gt;Within any living organism, there are thousands of different proteins, each with its own unique shape. For decades, the exact formation of those shapes has been a pain for scientists to figure out. How exactly does a protein, which starts as a string of amino acids, fold itself into the funky 3D shapes you might recognize from diagrams? AlphaFold, an &lt;a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphafold"&gt;AI from DeepMind&lt;/a&gt;, may have an answer. It can predict, with heretofore unseen accuracy, the shape a protein will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBzmn7"&gt;AlphaFold was put to the test in a global competition called Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction, or CASP, which DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis calls the “Olympics of protein folding” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg7WjuFs8F4"&gt;in a video&lt;/a&gt;. During the competition, systems like AlphaFold are given the amino acid strings for proteins with shapes that have already been identified through previous experiments but haven’t been published yet. Judges compare the protein shapes produced by the systems with what they know the shapes should be. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A gif of two rotating protein fold models made up of curls and swirling lines. AlphaFold’s predictions are overlayed on the models, with 90.7 GDT accuracy on the left and 93.3 GDT accuracy on the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MLV4q-2KKwiqnXtDBpqLL6LTmY0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22132319/AlphaFold_prediction_comparisons.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overlays of protein structures in green with AlphaFold’s predictions in blue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x6Pb2X"&gt;At the end of the competition, AlphaFold had the most accurate predictions of any CASP participant in its 25-year history by a wide margin. Even the predictions that weren’t accurate enough to be considered “competitive” with experimental results were only a few atom-widths off. The complete data still needs to be peer-reviewed and published, but the DeepMind team is excited about the results so far, saying in a blog post that they are “optimistic about the impact AlphaFold can have on biological research and the wider world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4DX4H"&gt;It can take years in the lab for scientists to identify the shapes of individual proteins. Neural networks like AlphaFold could help speed up biological research and drug development in the future. The AI method isn’t perfect yet, and it won’t be taking over for flesh-and-blood researchers anytime soon, but it could be a major step in the everlasting marathon of scientific advancement. To learn more about AlphaFold and to see a bunch of scientists and engineers getting giddy and fist-pumping over competition results, check out the video below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose adds swipe volume controls to QuietComfort Earbuds and Sport Earbuds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s-SrCqBMZVQwKFnEAD-c7xpLUno=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68050638/IMG_0723-1.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A5NCa7"&gt;One of the few complaints I had in my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507552/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-best-noise-cancellation"&gt;review of Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds&lt;/a&gt; was that they lacked onboard volume controls. Well, a few weeks after they went on sale, the company has now resolved that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojhIj6"&gt;In the latest update of the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bose-music/id1364986984"&gt;Bose Music app out today on iOS&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a new volume control option in settings. (Presumably this will be coming to the Android app imminently, as well.) Once you toggle it on, you’ll be able to swipe up and down on the right earbud to adjust how loud the audio is. This feature is available for both the QuietComfort Earbuds and less expensive Sport Earbuds. It’s something that was spotted in early user manuals for the earbuds but was removed before they shipped. I’m glad Bose has quickly moved to add this functionality, as it makes the premium earbuds more well-rounded when it comes to controls. And for Sport Earbuds owners, this means you won’t have to mess with your phone (or Siri or Google Assistant) in the middle of a workout or run if you need to change the volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdX1f1"&gt;Bose has also added an (optional) Spotify shortcut to its Noise Canceling Headphones 700. You can now set the headphones to launch Spotify on your mobile device with a tap and hold on the right ear cup. Other headphone makers, including Samsung, have previously added similar quick-access shortcuts to the popular streaming music service. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Windows Feature Experience Packs are smaller updates to Windows 10</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Windows 10 stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OmwbTtUAXoY-N4tK23JhTiNrFvE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68045021/mswindows1_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5LAMcR"&gt;Microsoft has started testing smaller feature updates for Windows 10 in the form of a Windows Feature Experience Pack. The branding appeared inside Windows 10 earlier this year, but Microsoft has only confirmed what the packs will be used for this week. The Windows Feature Experience Pack will be used to “improve certain features and experiences that are now developed independently of the OS,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/11/30/releasing-windows-feature-experience-pack-120-2212-1070-0-to-the-beta-channel/"&gt;according to Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NHHGJ"&gt;The first feature pack has been released to Windows 10 beta testers this week, and it includes the ability to use the built-in screen snipping app to paste screenshots directly into folders within the File Explorer. The pack also includes a split keyboard mode for 2-in-1 touch devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IQvz4h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Feature packs are for the smaller parts of Windows&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7hQuG1"&gt;Microsoft says feature packs will be delivered to Windows testers much like how existing builds and cumulative updates are delivered. It’s not clear how these feature packs will make their way to consumers and enterprises, though. Feature packs appear to be a new channel for Microsoft to update parts of Windows that aren’t directly controlled by the OS but also aren’t separate apps that are maintained through the Windows Store.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mq3UyTm8X11siUwYjzX45loIaWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22133704/5GjjfSu.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 10’s new built-in snipping tool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RRDZjn"&gt;It could mean we’ll see more regular minor updates to Windows 10 in the coming months and years ahead. Microsoft typically delivers two big Windows 10 updates per year, with one arriving around the April time frame and the other around October. The company has been using a Service Pack-style update model for some Windows 10 updates, including relatively minor changes in one of the updates and bigger changes in the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMEdWR"&gt;“By testing this process first with Windows Insiders, we hope to expand the scope and the frequency of releases in the future,” explains Microsoft’s Brandon LeBlanc. “Eventually, Windows Feature Experience Pack updates will get folded into the already existing servicing process for Windows 10 and delivered to customers that way through Windows Update.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fh7bJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offer noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-670" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725261146929567782" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725328034162471061" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $130 at all three retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yHjw-MSSOE9krvMa6cC9qYmHU9s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15993019/akrales_190327_3315_0004.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $140, which is what this pair of wireless earbuds are currently going for at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PYLT6DN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021%3Fathcpid%3D482532021%26athpgid%3DathenaItemPage%26athcgid%3Dnull%26athznid%3DPWVUB%26athieid%3Dv0%26athstid%3DCS020%26athguid%3D87fd69df-007-175fac8dc24c1a%26athancid%3Dnull%26athena%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OGXtAu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Uv43TD"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="AirPods Pro review: the perfect earbuds for the iPhone|73652" data-volume-uuid="c840e1e11" data-volume-id="73652" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-822" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt; Compared to the options above, Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality, noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The best deal right now is at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-18" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot, which has the Apple’s flagship earbuds for $190&lt;/a&gt;. If that deal sells out, you can currently get them at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724966188075813300" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $200. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrSHDHNRiQrX7uCuXdtZyYvmZKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this incredibly tough time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a Nintendo Switch (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a Switch Lite (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that are preowned or refurbished — will likely continue to sell out quickly during the pandemic. But we’ll do our best to keep this article up to date with the latest in-stock offers, and we’ll tell you when each offer was posted. When something gets sold out, we’ll try to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch Lite is the smaller, portable-only version of the console that comes in a few different color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li id="Lwy57E"&gt;

&lt;p id="o2G175"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out GameStop. Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html"&gt;Nintendo’s own online store where it sells refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Those have been sold out recently, but there’s no telling when it will restock the page with some repaired, refreshed consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqBPoZ"&gt;Oddly enough, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frover.ebay.com%2Frover%2F1%2F711-53200-19255-0%2F1%3Fmpre%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebay.com%252Fstr%252Fnintendo%26campid%3D5338421472%26toolid%3D20008&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21257643%2Fnintendo-switch-lite-how-to-buy-in-stock#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo has its own official seller page on eBay&lt;/a&gt;, which usually hosts refurbished Switch consoles, though it has been closed “until further notice” due to the pandemic. Still, that’s worth keeping an eye on, too.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can buy games on Switch cartridges or store several digital downloads purchased through the eShop on a microSD card.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a microSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SC7BZHR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=d9d13492d7a2383ae455b1e464853cbe&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $65&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074RNRM2B/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=ebcbe0aae0692190d419f2c892d31718&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A 400GB microSD card will cost you around $45&lt;/a&gt;, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2BZPIqmUqpLcZoV5GVxdxMULT3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9537475/akrales_171025_2091_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ulULMw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3ASPNV/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=03e07706174eba9d98e121bd33c717da&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A two-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Nintendo Switch is $8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l1NCcr"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2YZPQpf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TCPVHTM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=40eaf677c94a1341b4ed7beb385dbb06&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; three-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Switch Lite is $7&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=e9815cab861c6f59255b7b948189eef3&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $20 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KY69YFM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=a424685866013735203d8722ee49a601&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
