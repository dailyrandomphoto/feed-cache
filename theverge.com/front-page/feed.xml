    <title>WhatsApp will hide your ‘last seen’ status from strangers by default</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Ocq41MK2VZ91EjhSM1nGbWy9sk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266874/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gdFpBh"&gt;WhatsApp is rolling out a new privacy measure that hides your “last seen” status from people you don’t know or haven’t chatted with in the app (via &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-enabling-new-privacy-measures-to-protect-users/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Previously, WhatsApp set the feature on “Everyone” by default, allowing anyone on WhatsApp to see your status. WhatsApp’s new update limits the visibility of your status to the people you’ve added on the platform, and sets the feature to “My Contacts” by default instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e0R8XP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s a new security feature. Got this reply from support today. If the person has not got your number in their contacts, or you haven’t sent one message between you, last seen/online is no longer visible. &lt;a href="https://t.co/qLPtC6rPOA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qLPtC6rPOA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PsyColette     (@NiHaolain) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NiHaolain/status/1468281924057763849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9cK1lf"&gt;In a post on Twitter, a user explains that you may not be able to see other people’s statuses on the platform anymore, and also includes an email from what appears to be WhatsApp support that describes the new feature. “We’re making it harder for people you don’t know and haven’t chatted with from seeing your last seen and online presence on WhatsApp,” the email reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M8eSq1"&gt;The “My Contacts” option for your “last seen” status was already available, but it’s never been the default on the app. It’s also worth noting that WhatsApp already has a “Nobody” option as well, preventing all users from seeing your status. Your status on WhatsApp lets other contacts know when you were online last, or if you’re currently using the app. While this may seem like a harmless way to keep track of your friends and family (and vice versa), &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; points out that some third-party apps actually exploit this feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iGOPT"&gt;These apps can aggregate the statuses of certain users, which may enable some to keep a little too close of an eye on others using the platform. Turning on the “My Contacts” options prevents third-party apps from logging your online status, as an app isn’t considered one of your contacts, and therefore, it won’t be able to see your status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuetcX"&gt;This isn’t the only change WhatsApp is making to its “last seen” status. In November, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp-new-last-seen-privacy-option"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that the messaging app began testing an option, called “My Contacts Except ... which lets users hide their status from certain contacts. WhatsApp has also been working to bolster user privacy by introducing an option to make its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820138/whatsapp-disappearing-messages-by-default-24-hours-90-days"&gt;disappearing messaging feature the default&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJ6gt4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google starts rolling out major Pixel 6 update with camera and fingerprint sensor improvements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_scKM0uVXWY7xxH7o90HpDSMJvI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266864/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iCZjNT"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; are today receiving their most significant software update since Google released the phones in October. Last week, the company detailed &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/139017133/google-pixel-update-december-2021?hl=en"&gt;a very lengthy list of bug fixes and improvements&lt;/a&gt; that are included in the December update, which has now started rolling out to both devices &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/rfq63q/my_6_pro_is_downloading_december_update/"&gt;according to Redditors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3mLrf"&gt;Older Pixel devices already started receiving this update last week. But Google needed a bit more time to deliver the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro version since there are a ton of improvements directed at the company’s latest flagship phones. Google is also continuing to further polish and optimize Android 12 with this release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkRU8p"&gt;Headlining the list of changes are tweaks to the fingerprint sensor; Google promises “general improvements for fingerprint sensor stability and performance.” We’ll have to see whether unlocking the phones has gotten any quicker or more consistent after installing the update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqWtaD"&gt;There are also a handful of camera refinements that are specific to the Pixel 6 lineup. They include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="UEHG2V"&gt;General image quality improvements in camera preview / capture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Wzpor1"&gt;General improvements for camera stability and performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ljpIlA"&gt;General improvements for auto-focus response in certain capture modes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="omIKcy"&gt;General improvements for color consistency in viewfinder preview &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FIRNiW"&gt;Fix for issue causing blank viewfinder preview in certain conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="tUSrlr"&gt;Google doesn’t mention anything about reducing the amount of noise in videos captured on the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, unfortunately, so that issue might take more time to iron out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkLd9h"&gt;But the December update includes plenty more, like fixes for screen flickering and a bug that could prevent the display from switching its refresh rate as intended. There are a range of audio and Bluetooth bugs that’ve been resolved, and Google says battery performance and thermals “in certain conditions” have been improved across the entire Pixel lineup. If there’s a particular snag you’ve been running into, definitely look over Google’s list to see if it’s been fixed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWTTV8"&gt;Notably, this update is also required to get the full 23W wireless charging speeds from the new Pixel Stand 2 that’s just started shipping to buyers. To install the update on your Pixel 6 or 6 Pro, head to settings, scroll down to “system” and tap on that, and then select system update. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OSHA opens investigation into fatal Amazon warehouse collapse in Illinois</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tornado Hits Amazon Warehouse In Edwardsville, Illinois" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6CZCqbiAubIZ95caLgV70LN5WM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266775/1237162477.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y5LjNF"&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has opened an investigation into the collapse of an Amazon warehouse in Illinois that left &lt;a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/illinois/workers-killed-in-edwardsville-building-collapse-include-mother-of-toddler-army-veteran/article_51515e92-02e0-54d5-a7c4-d6dd3a27d02c.html"&gt;six people dead&lt;/a&gt;. The damage was caused by a tornado that swept through the area Friday evening, leaving a path of destruction across three states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFtYyH"&gt;In addition to the six people killed at the Amazon warehouse, 45 were rescued, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/12/technology/amazon-tornado-edwardsville.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which reported that local authorities had some difficulty determining how many people were in the facility at the time since many who work out of the warehouse are contractors for other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="txd01a"&gt;“OSHA investigates all workplace fatalities and we are supporting them,” Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmy9IS"&gt;As first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/13/osha-opens-probe-into-deadly-amazon-warehouse-collapse-in-illinois.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, OSHA will have six months to complete its investigation, issue any citations, and propose penalties if the agency determines safety or health regulations were violated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="raSK2H"&gt;Former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a tweet on Saturday that his “thoughts and prayers” were with the families of the workers who died. “All of Edwardsville should know that the Amazon team is committed to supporting them and will be by their side through this crisis,” Bezos &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1469849247042334721?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram’s new Reels Visual Replies are just another feature copied from TikTok</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ibl8NSfkaDCR-mfhRLtC5ard5P4=/246x0:1782x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266678/FGSDy6WVkAET_Cv.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It looks familiar...&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yVkHyP"&gt;Instagram has added another strikingly familiar feature to Reels: the ability to add a user comment to a video (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/instagram-now-lets-users-reply-to-comments-with-reels/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Now, if a user comments on a reel you’ve posted, tapping the “reply” button will let you add a sticker of the comment into a new reel, which you can then move around or change its color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ha61A3"&gt;As Twitter users pointed out in the comments of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1469444419656896515"&gt;Instagram’s announcement post&lt;/a&gt;, the feature is very similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22583435/tiktok-reply-video-comments-how-to"&gt;how TikTok lets you do video replies&lt;/a&gt;. As of now, it seems limited to just comments on your reels — I wasn’t able to make stickers out of comments on photo posts or comments on other peoples’ reels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JH6w_gX_rfkXcq_ln6UHiWbSElg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085390/Screenshot_20211213_122859.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tapping reply on a comment, then tapping the camera button adds that comment as a sticker in a new reel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JnCB8CZ6tVqG2TVVGLen4uY1FFY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085412/Screenshot_20211213_122841.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can then resize, move, or change the color of the comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jGUr9D"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;its launch in August 2020&lt;/a&gt; (when we called it “similar to TikTok”), Instagram’s tweaks and additions have made the two platforms feel more and more alike. The maximum time limit for Reels was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596530/instagram-reels-60-seconds-time-extension"&gt;bumped up a few times&lt;/a&gt;, reaching the one-minute mark in July (just after TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558856/tiktok-videos-three-minutes-length"&gt;raised its max length from one minute to three&lt;/a&gt;). Instagram also lets you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360544/instagram-reels-remix-tiktok-duet-feature-launch"&gt;“remix” reels&lt;/a&gt;, similar to TikTok’s “duet” feature, and it just recently added the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778073/instagram-reels-text-to-voice-effects-tiktok-creators"&gt;text-to-speech and voice effect features&lt;/a&gt; that have been a staple for TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utkAXW"&gt;Even if Reels Visual Replies aren’t original, it’s nice to see that Instagram’s adopting the feature. It’s a fun way to interact with your audience, and while it may not be the thing that gets creators to jump over from TikTok (it’s certainly not as enticing as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22777899/instagram-reels-bonus-program-35000-dollars-creators-tiktok-competitors"&gt;Instagram’s up-to $35,000 bonuses&lt;/a&gt; for posting Reels), it’s at least one fewer thing that’s missing from Meta’s version of the app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A tornado expert explains why last week’s twisters were so devastating </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kentucky: Aftermath of tornado in Mayfield" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xwmcfYiXJ5bnLfGdDyz5QkQVLrQ=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266652/1237200100.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QuVDXH"&gt;Meteorologists were&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrJeffMasters/status/1469700985102741507"&gt;shocked&lt;/a&gt; by the tornadoes that devastated the Midwest and Southern US over the weekend. The twisters, which struck during the evening of &lt;a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/211210_rpts.html"&gt;December 10th&lt;/a&gt;, plowed across multiple states with incredible ferocity much later in the year than most tornadoes usually hit. Entire communities were devastated, and at least &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/12/12/us/tornadoes-kentucky-illinois"&gt;90&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; lost their lives. Residents across Kentucky, Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Mississippi, Illinois are still recovering and searching for missing loved ones.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWDPFv"&gt;Tornadoes are still somewhat of an enigma to scientists. We know the basic &lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/ffc/torntext"&gt;meteorological ingredients&lt;/a&gt; needed to cause a tornado to form, as well as where and when they tend to appear. But what’s normal for the US — which sees &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/weather-atmosphere/tornadoes"&gt;more tornadoes&lt;/a&gt; than any other country on Earth — could be &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/12/11/tornadoes-climate-change/"&gt;changing&lt;/a&gt;, according to some &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2021/12/13/tornadoes-kentucky-climate-change-study/6478150001/"&gt;early&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aah7393"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the relationship between climate change and tornadoes is still &lt;a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/tornadoes-and-climate-change/"&gt;hazy&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists still need a better understanding of what is the perfect storm of conditions for triggering tornadoes so that they can suss out how things could change in a warming world.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9wU8rq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You really don’t want to see this outcome.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZM2Cw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with &lt;a href="http://people.se.cmich.edu/allen4jt/allen_homepage.html"&gt;John T. Allen&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of meteorology with a focus on tornadoes at Central Michigan University. He tells us what scientists are still trying to learn about tornadoes, and what we might expect in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6NKLT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxGoK5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As someone who’s studied tornadoes for a long time, what was running through your head as you were watching what happened over the weekend?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGtwxs"&gt;I’ll be honest, it’s never a pleasant thought. Having seen a few of these high end tornadoes in person and seeing the devastation that they leave behind, there’s a sense of powerlessness that comes from... you sort of know that it’s going to happen, but you can do very little about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spBBFW"&gt;In this particular case, part of you is just hoping that something changes in the storm: that it stops doing this and doesn’t hit a town or it misses a town to the south, or it misses that populated area. You really don’t want to see this outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4qPn6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made the tornadoes that struck over the weekend unusual?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQABRT"&gt;What I think has made this event stand out was a couple of particularly long-track tornadoes that stretch from Arkansas into Kentucky. One particular storm produced an extremely long-track tornado. We don’t know exactly how long that track was, but it will probably find itself in the upper echelon of the longest track tornadoes we have in history. Another aspect of that tornado was that it was particularly intense. We saw quite a number of fatalities associated with this tornado, had a number of towns absolutely devastated by it. So certainly, it will be one of those historic events that goes down in people’s memories and will be something that will be felt by those communities for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XO7aGc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Something that will be felt by those communities for a very long time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fqb3rZ"&gt;This tornado outbreak was certainly on the larger scale for December tornado outbreaks. We have had tornadoes previously in December, even on Christmas day you can have tornado outbreak if the conditions are right. So at least in terms of getting tornadoes in December, that’s not too surprising. The sheer number of tornadoes wasn’t overly large. We’re talking on the order of somewhere around about 30 tornadoes overall, we won’t know until the survey’s finished in the coming days.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQ0mCS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was there anything else that might have made this tornado outbreak especially dangerous, like its path or the fact that it happened at night when it’s difficult for people to see them coming?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9V6GId"&gt;This area is relatively highly populated, and that’s never a good thing when it comes to tornadoes. Out in the plains, the population is relatively sparse. It means that there are fewer places that are likely to be impacted. But when you’ve got a very long track like this, the chance of hitting something goes up. As you move into the southeastern United States, it increases exponentially. [Editor’s note: some &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-018-0048-2"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has also found a trend toward more tornadoes in parts of the Midwest and Southeast and fewer in the Great Plains, where they’ve been more common in the past.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OIZOua"&gt;Adding to that, we’ve got a tornado that’s late at night when people aren’t necessarily expecting it. That we’re not in what people typically think of as tornado season means that the overall vulnerability and chance that people may get caught unawares was much higher. Nocturnal tornadoes certainly have a disproportionate share of fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VwdVPP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions are already being raised around what can or should be done to prepare for tornadoes in the future. What do we know so far about how climate change might affect tornadoes in the US?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7v1wgt"&gt;It’s very difficult to say specifically for tornadoes. They’re very small-scale phenomena. And even on a daily basis, it can be quite difficult to predict whether a storm is going to produce a tornado or not. A lot of the research that has been done to date looks at the sort of ingredients, the conditions that could lead to tornadoes: warm, humid air, changing wind speed with height, which allows storm organization. And what we’ve found is that, at least for the future, there is definitely an increasing sort of length to the season. We’re seeing more potential for these tornadoes. The storms that produce tornadoes in the fall and winter and early spring are increasing up to &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021EF002277"&gt;25 percent&lt;/a&gt; per degree Celsius of warming relative to now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIe8An"&gt;We had an abnormally warm period — I mean, Memphis hit 80 degrees Fahrenheit on Friday, which was unusually warm for the winter. Storms rely on relatively warm, moist air near the surface to increase the available energy to basically produce strong updraft. So in this case, you get much stronger vertical motion in the storms and that tends to be a thing that we see favoring stronger storms which might produce tornadoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kk4INr"&gt;The other factor that comes in there, and one that doesn’t really change is wind shear. So if you think about clouds moving in different directions at different heights, that’s what wind shear is. What wind shear does is it allows the storms to sort of organize themselves into something that is more sustained. It lasts a lot longer. It’s not your typical everyday thunderstorm. This is a storm that, in this particular case, might have persisted for over seven hours. And those sorts of storms are known to be more frequent producers of tornadoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udnoVA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And how does a tornado form?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLvQJl"&gt;There are a lot of different mechanisms that we’re aware of that potentially could produce a tornado. Generally speaking, you need a supercell thunderstorm. That supercell thunderstorm begins to rotate at the mid levels and that process produces a downdraft that then causes rotation at the surface to become more intense, and eventually we refer to it as a tornado when it exceeds 50 miles per hour. But the exact mechanisms of tornado formation are still an open topic of scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfHSbP"&gt;In this case, we had multiple storms producing very strong and intense tornadoes. Usually about six or more is defined as an outbreak, although other metrics exist. Tornado outbreaks are associated with a large-scale synoptic system. This particular system ended up producing snowfall in the Dakotas. It produced strong winds through Michigan, about 60 miles an hour. That particular system, as it moved eastward, pulled warm moist air up from the Gulf of Mexico, which was running a little bit warmer than normal. That warm, moist air is juxtaposed with relatively cool air coming behind the system. The interaction of those and an upper-level system that moved in as well produces a large area over which the conditions are favorable. It pulls those ingredients together. And so in this particular case, we had a system that produced an unusually large area of favorable conditions, which is what allowed for long-track tornadoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yl5mzy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do meteorologists forecast tornadoes? And how much warning do we typically have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XghqAW"&gt;Warning times on average are in excess of 13 minutes. In this case, we had in excess of 20 minutes for Mayfield, one of the worst impacted locations. So there was certainly good anticipation of this particular event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7bcIv"&gt;In terms of forecasting the likelihood of tornadoes, it really comes back to those ingredient conditions which we talked about earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vK6Yq6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A question we’re still sort of trying to wrap our heads around.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4i5NSP"&gt;We have a whole suite of models we operate at our storm prediction center and other groups to basically predict the storms themselves and try and get an idea of will a storm form? How intense might it be? And we use that to formulate outlooks which are issued up to eight days in advance. The final outlooks are down to the day, then are proceeded by tornado watches. Tornado watches say, “the conditions are likely to get a tornado in the next few hours.” And then a tornado warning is, “the tornado was coming to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnV4Lx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are scientists still trying to understand about tornadoes?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;And what makes them difficult to study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BlXzG"&gt;Really pinning down why is it that a given scenario produces a tornado, I think, is a question we’re still sort of trying to wrap our heads around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ywFunh"&gt;It’s not uncommon to have field projects in which you’ve had extreme trouble actually getting out in the field to observe a tornado. At the same time, we’ve had other situations where we’ve had very good observations of these events. The challenge is that there are a lot of physical processes at very small scales that really matter for tornadoes. That small scale influence means that it’s very hard to actually identify which storm is going to produce a tornado. Which one is it? On the same token, is it going to produce a long-track, higher-scale tornado? Or is it going to produce a relatively weaker tornado? We don’t have great answers for that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4T3BU"&gt;We really do need a greater degree of field observations. We need more modeling studies to understand what’s going on. There’s a lot of science and research that needs to be done and those sort of things need federal support to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNYFLm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gH3Mua"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IsSiR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4KUfV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yO79gP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The MacBook Air with M1 processor is back down to $800 for today only</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air is fast" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vO1qpXj53nwSXQfxIsb8Wy2UZZM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266487/vpavic_4291_20201113_0380.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Air with M1 processor first debuted just over one year ago.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ak2488"&gt;The MacBook Air with M1 processor, our top pick for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;the best laptop of 2021&lt;/a&gt;, is currently &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcsdQZjSND" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 off at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This brings the popular laptop from Apple down to its historical low price of $799.99. We have often seen this MacBook Air discounted by $50, $100, and even occasionally $150, but this level of sale is much less frequent, and as good as it gets. Best Buy’s deal on the MacBook Air is only running for today — scheduled to expire when it strikes midnight on December 14th — or while supplies last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuNF5X"&gt;The configuration of MacBook Air on offer today is the late 2020 model with the Apple-made M1 CPU, outfitted with the base-level 256GB SSD and 8GB of RAM. You have your choice of colors from its three options of space gray, gold, and silver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOfFBV"&gt;There are few other laptops as capable in this price range as the MacBook Air, whether you’re dabbling in productivity and work, everyday home and on-the-go computer use, or even light content creation. Its battery life is also exceptional. The biggest knock against this laptop — dongle life aside — is the awful webcam quality. Though there are worse problems to have, especially if you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652783/best-webcam-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;put some of that money saved toward a webcam&lt;/a&gt; that is much better than the cameras built into any laptop. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 Darkplates made me want to grab Sony’s upcoming black faceplates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/imTMP55o_4ZjSYBlgRljV9UssZE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266463/jpeters_211213_4919_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My PS5 Digital Edition with the Darkplates 2.0.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;I now stan the PS5’s original design&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="VIKJDz"&gt;Sony has &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; announced official PS5 faceplates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22831965/sony-ps5-covers-faceplates-colors-new-controllers"&gt;in different colors&lt;/a&gt;, including red, pink, blue, purple, and — thankfully — black. But if you’re looking for an easy way to change up the PS5’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/6/11/21288541/playstation-5-ps5-sony-design-memes-roast-twitter-router-face-building"&gt;popped-collar aesthetic&lt;/a&gt;, you might want to check out Dbrand’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733642/dbrand-new-ps5-darkplates-sony-legal-threats"&gt;PS5 Darkplates 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, which are more rounded and add a grille on each side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uDWbh"&gt;Dbrand sent some to &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;and I’ve taken some photos of them on my PS5 Digital Edition so you can get an idea of what they might look like on your console. (Photos taken on my iPhone 12 Mini.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vKgO2hKn09BukQfECr9Idh80gg4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084990/jpeters_211213_4919_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what the Darkplates 2.0 look like head-on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9zkYmDtCKxfXWighxVV_p6bXn7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084992/jpeters_211213_4919_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a look when the console is laying horizontally. I’ve also applied a Dbrand matte black strip to the middle of the console, which is typically glossy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="556FEs"&gt;I really like the matte black finish on the Darkplates 2.0. I feel it isn’t quite as conspicuous as the PS5’s standard two-tone look, and it matches well with the Xbox Series X and the black Nintendo Switch dock. And similar to what my colleague Sam Byford observed with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306874/dbrand-ps5-darkplates-matte-black-hands-on-review"&gt;first version of the Darkplates&lt;/a&gt;, the plastic used for the Darkplates 2.0 feels sturdy — and I’m glad that’s the case since a set currently costs $59.05. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wd7GEWJK5tglHWU8Sle2OYLgYd0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084998/jpeters_211213_4919_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s my PS5 with Darkplates 2.0 next to my Xbox Series X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/joUAAImTp1ZhXEZO9R2xmtmiP78=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084999/jpeters_211213_4919_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, my TV stand is currently made of moving boxes. I’m working on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pIXe7D"&gt;I’m less of a fan of the big grille that’s on each Darkplate. Dbrand claims on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/ps5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt; that the grilles make the PS5 run cooler. But I haven’t personally run into any overheating issues with my console when using the original PS5 faceplates, so I can’t vouch for whether the grilles make a meaningful difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KGZnVQdHaDA9xhuowJj9gEZqznQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084993/jpeters_211213_4919_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The grille takes up a big chunk of the Darkplate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ou0Kjnvo_2MlFWJ-5z-s7kBY8iQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084991/jpeters_211213_4919_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a closer look at the grille, where you can see the removable mesh grille on the inside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6cyNm3"&gt;Like Sony’s official faceplates and the Darkplates 1.0, there’s also an Easter egg on the inside of the plates. Sony etched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture"&gt;PlayStation icon microtexture&lt;/a&gt; featuring the PlayStation symbols, and the Darkplates 1.0 had Dbrand’s twist on those icons. For Darkplates 2.0, Dbrand opted to inscribe a lot of binary. I asked Dbrand what it means, and it said the binary is excerpts of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22728936/dbrand-pulls-ps5-darkplates-from-sale-sony-threatens-legal-action"&gt;cease and desist letter Sony sent the company&lt;/a&gt; regarding Darkplates 1.0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/31SYX2k_vPGprjLHsUdYhTVh3fM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084995/jpeters_211213_4919_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s a lot of zeros and ones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EYQ5du"&gt;I expected to really like the Darkplates 2.0; I generally prefer black electronics, and I wasn’t a fan of the PS5’s design when it was announced. The color is great, but something about the overall look just isn’t clicking with me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdakOV"&gt;Maybe it’s the giant grilles. Maybe it’s how the Darkplates’ design exposes the light bar on the middle part of the console, which can be distracting depending on where I am in my living room. But maybe it’s just the fact that I’ve gotten &lt;em&gt;used &lt;/em&gt;to the original design of the PS5. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still ridiculous, but to me, it’s what the PS5 &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; — popped collar and all — and I’ll probably be picking up a pair of Sony’s new $54.99 color faceplates in black so I can keep the original look but with a darker color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rbz4O9"&gt;When asked for comment about Sony’s new PS5 faceplates, Dbrand pointed to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1470428336446967817"&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KQZaho"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Called it. &lt;a href="https://t.co/2xeHPI8Q0K"&gt;https://t.co/2xeHPI8Q0K&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/jJ3M7N6onG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jJ3M7N6onG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— dbrand (@dbrand) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1470428336446967817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

And of course, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22799382/chris-pratt-voice-super-mario-movie-nintendo-illumination-ceo"&gt;Chris Pratt is playing Mario&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738187/uncharted-movie-trailer-tom-holland-nathan-drake-mark-wahlberg"&gt;an&lt;em&gt; Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; movie&lt;/a&gt; is nearly here. Amid these heavy hitters comes the news that Netflix is ready to bring us another franchise as well: Mega Man&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the Capcom “blue bomber” who’s been blasting his way through retro side-scrollers since 1987 on the original NES. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqJ07b"&gt;Technically, a Mega Man movie’s been in the works &lt;a href="https://www.tracking-board.com/tb-exclusive-a-mega-man-movie-is-a-go-at-fox/"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt; at Chernin Entertainment, and it became a little more formal &lt;a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e181004.html"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt; when Capcom officially announced it’d be a live-action film (!) with Henry Joost and Rel Schulman, perhaps best known for &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1584016/?ref_=nm_knf_i1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catfish&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, attached to write and direct. But recently, that directing duo &lt;a href="https://www.supermarche.nyc/bio"&gt;revealed on their Supermarché company website&lt;/a&gt; that Netflix has picked up the picture (via &lt;a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/mega-man-capcom-live-action-movie-reportedly-coming-netflix/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comicbook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mega-man-movie-in-the-works-at-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k74y16"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Features in the works include: an adaptation of Capcom’s MEGA MAN for Chernin Entertainment and Netflix, which they wrote and are directing,” the site reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGe0Nk"&gt;Unfortunately, there’s no indication of how far along the movie is or when it might release. (&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; writes that sources say it’s very early in development.) But as some have pointed out, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/04/netflix-chernin-entertainment-producing-deal-peter-chernin-1202903133/"&gt;Netflix has a first-look deal with Chernin&lt;/a&gt;; perhaps Netflix saw something that it liked. Netflix and Supermarché didn’t immediately have comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tW2yMt"&gt;The gold rush to secure video game intellectual property for Hollywood adaptation goes far beyond the films and shows I’ve mentioned so far, of course, and Netflix has definitely seen the potential thanks to the performance of its&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/7/15938192/netflix-castlevania-review-animated-video-game-adaptation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series. Netflix has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403849/netflix-resident-evil-tv-series-original-live-action-announcement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252386/netflix-tomb-raider-kong-skull-island-anime"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows in the works, too, and is reportedly in development on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594569/pokemon-live-action-series-netflix-development"&gt;live-action &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt; as well. It generally sees a lot of potential in gaming, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587048/netflix-mobile-games-streaming-wars"&gt;even vis-a-vis snapping up film studios itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RyKXw8"&gt;Outside of Netflix, we recently had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22302819/milla-jovovich-monster-hunter-interview-captain-artemis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22398015/mortal-kombat-2021-movie-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; movies&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277372/the-last-of-us-ellie-game-of-thrones-bella-ramsey-hbo-lyanna-mormont"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; TV show&lt;/a&gt; for HBO, maybe a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22799583/mass-effect-bioware-tv-show-movie-amazon-studios-rumor"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect &lt;/em&gt;show for Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21311513/amazon-fallout-tv-show-prime-video-westworld-creators-bethesda"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fallout &lt;/em&gt;show that’s definitely for Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350484/sony-ghost-of-tsushima-movie-film-director-john-wick-sucker-punch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22153341/metal-gear-solid-movie-oscar-isaac-solid-snake"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid&lt;/em&gt; movie&lt;/a&gt; adaptations. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452272/jj-abrams-portal-movie-valve-half-life-2013-script-production"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; movie&lt;/a&gt; might even be happening someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUFyAH"&gt;We’ve come a long way since &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uwe_Boll"&gt;Uwe Boll&lt;/a&gt;, that’s all I’m saying.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Researchers trigger new exploit by renaming an iPhone and a Tesla</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jq_Odp_JHjg5eN4yTGSSA01siD8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266287/acastro_170629_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S9gPVK"&gt;Security researchers investigating the recently discovered and “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828303/log4j-library-vulnerability-log4shell-zero-day-exploit"&gt;extremely bad&lt;/a&gt;” Log4Shell exploit claim to have used it on devices as varied as iPhones and Tesla cars. Per &lt;a href="https://github.com/YfryTchsGD/Log4jAttackSurface/blob/master/pages/Tesla.md"&gt;screenshots&lt;/a&gt; shared &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chvancooten/status/1469340927923826691"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;, changing the device name of an iPhone or Tesla to a special exploit string was enough to trigger a ping from Apple or Tesla servers, indicating that the server at the other end was vulnerable to Log4Shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBgwtV"&gt;In the demonstrations, researchers switched the device names to be a string of characters that would send servers to a testing URL, exploiting the behavior enabled by the vulnerability. After the name was changed, incoming traffic showed URL requests from IP addresses belonging to Apple and, in the case of Tesla, China Unicom — the company’s &lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2014/08/29/investing/tesla-china-unicom/"&gt;mobile service partner for the Chinese market&lt;/a&gt;. In short, the researchers tricked Apple and Tesla servers into visiting a URL of their choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple device information screen showing name changed to log4shell attack string" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9CiTGhvWjcLo_v6eeSyFxtC2GKA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085291/log4shell1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Cas van Cooten / Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An iPhone device information screen with name changed to contain the exploit string.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zc5cRA"&gt;The iPhone demonstration came from a Dutch security researcher; the other was uploaded to the anonymous &lt;a href="https://github.com/YfryTchsGD/Log4jAttackSurface"&gt;Log4jAttackSurface&lt;/a&gt; Github repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLI6ry"&gt;Assuming the images are genuine, they show behavior — remote resource loading — that should not be possible with text contained in a device name. This proof of concept has led to widespread reporting that Apple and Tesla are vulnerable to the exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KoQIub"&gt;While the demonstration is alarming, it’s not clear how useful it would be for cybercriminals. In theory, an attacker could host malicious code at the target URL in order to infect vulnerable servers, but a well-maintained network could prevent such an attack at the network level. More broadly, there’s no indication that the method could lead to any broader compromise of Apple or Tesla’s systems. (Neither company responded to an email request for comment by time of publication.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="luPhIQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Log4Shell is all the more serious for being relatively easy to exploit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jFCQW3"&gt;Still, it’s a reminder of the complex nature of technological systems, which almost always depend on code pulled in from third-party libraries. The Log4Shell exploit affects an open-source Java tool called log4j which is widely used for application event logging; though it’s still not known exactly how many devices are affected, but researchers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1469289471463944198"&gt;estimate that it is in the millions&lt;/a&gt;, including obscure systems that are rarely targeted by attacks of this nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQiQpw"&gt;The full extent of exploitation in the wild is unknown, but in a blog post, digital forensics platform Cado reported detecting servers trying to &lt;a href="https://www.cadosecurity.com/analysis-of-initial-in-the-wild-attacks-exploiting-log4shell-log4j-cve-2021-44228/"&gt;use this method to install Mirai botnet code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhBv95"&gt;Log4Shell is all the more serious for being relatively easy to exploit. The vulnerability works by tricking the application into interpreting a piece of text as a link to a remote resource, and trying to retrieve that resource instead of saving the text as it is written. All that’s necessary is for a vulnerable device to save the special string of characters in its application logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHVHwX"&gt;This creates the potential for vulnerability in many systems that accept user input, since message text can be stored in the logs. The log4j vulnerability was &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/minecraft-and-other-apps-face-serious-threat-from-new-code-execution-bug/"&gt;first spotted in &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; servers, which attackers could compromise using chat messages; and systems that send and receive other message formats like SMS clearly are also susceptible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XeiN5"&gt;At least one major SMS provider appears to be vulnerable to the exploit, according to testing conducted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. When sent to numbers operated by the SMS provider, text messages containing exploit code triggered a response from the company’s servers that revealed information about the IP address and host name, suggesting that the servers could be tricked into executing malicious code. Calls and emails to the affected company had not been answered at time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2llowl"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html"&gt;update to the log4j library&lt;/a&gt; has been released to mitigate against the vulnerability, but patching of all vulnerable machines will take time given the challenges of updating enterprise software at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Universal Control won’t be coming to macOS Monterey until sometime this spring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8T_kPXe_J0aSmUGfYN4cUfZWmvc=/0x8:1630x1095/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266227/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_7.37.19_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vpqLBu"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523322/apple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo"&gt;Universal Control feature&lt;/a&gt; has been delayed again, with the company’s website updating today to note that the drag-and-drop feature won’t be arriving until sometime “this spring,” as spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleSWUpdates/status/1470468525613539334"&gt;the AppleSWUpdates Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIpYIX"&gt;Universal Control was originally announced alongside macOS Monterey and iPadOS 15 at WWDC back in June, but the feature — which promises to bridge Apple’s Mac and iPad devices, allowing users to use a single mouse and keyboard for both and to drag and drop content between the two — has yet to materialize in either macOS or iPadOS. Apple hasn’t even started offering Universal Control to developers or beta users to test yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kNcuje"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Universal Control on macOS Monterey works","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Nh2JJn"&gt;Apple had previously updated its website in October to indicate that Universal Control &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733044/macos-universal-control-later-this-fall-monterey-feature-delay"&gt;would be available “later this fall,”&lt;/a&gt; but with the official end of fall just a few days away, it seems that the company is no longer going to hit that estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1oyk3J9lwYF7uL2j0OVs-ksrusQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085160/Screen_Shot_2021_12_13_at_2.14.35_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mLD03M"&gt;Universal Control isn’t the only major feature to have missed the initial release for Apple’s 2021 software updates. SharePlay, one of the company’s marquee software features this year, wasn’t available at the launch of either iOS 15 or macOS Monterey (the feature only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22732647/apple-ios-15-1-download-release-available-now"&gt;arrived on iOS on October 25th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/apple-releases-macos-monterey-12-1/"&gt;just hit macOS today&lt;/a&gt;), while other more minor features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"&gt;also failed to make the cut&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
