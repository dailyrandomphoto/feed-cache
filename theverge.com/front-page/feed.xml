    <title>Lucid Motors’ $4.5 billion merger is being held up by spam filters</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9wSUZB"&gt;Lucid Motors is on the precipice of completing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;merger&lt;/a&gt; that will give the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302524/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-pif-investment-majority-shareholder"&gt;Saudi-owned&lt;/a&gt; electric vehicle startup $4.5 billion in fresh capital. But the deal is being held up, in part, by spam filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdO3iz"&gt;The California-based startup is merging with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC&lt;/a&gt;, called Churchill Capital IV that is already listed on the New York Stock Exchange. For the merger to go through, Churchill shareholders have to approve a number of proposals that outline the terms. That vote was supposed to close today, but Churchill &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/churchill-capital-corp-iv-to-adjourn-and-reconvene-special-meeting-of-stockholders-to-friday-july-23-2021-to-allow-stockholders-more-time-to-vote-on-one-remaining-required-proposal-for-the-business-combination-with-lucid-motors-301339577.html"&gt;extended the deadline to Friday&lt;/a&gt; because not enough shareholders have approved a key proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYVBN7"&gt;There are a few possible reasons why. The first is the spam filter issue. To participate in that vote, shareholders are sent a specific code. It’s possible, Churchill chairman Michael Klein said on a call with investors on Thursday, that some shareholders haven’t voted yet because these codes went straight to spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZQp3S7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“some of those emails may have gone into your spam folder”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QWnab9"&gt;“It should have been mailed or emailed to all stockholders. I know this is technical. And I know that some of those emails may have gone into your spam folder or otherwise. But it’s critical and important to vote and to have the tools to vote,” he said. “I need to remind you to check your emails, and check your spam emails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTgppZ"&gt;The other reasons have more to do with just how wild the stock market has gotten in the last two years. Churchill announced the merger in February, and in the months since, its shares have been one of the most heavily traded of all the SPACs on the market. Some of that comes from people really believing in Lucid Motors and its potential in the growing market for electric vehicles. But since the beginning of the pandemic there’s been an enormous influx of “retail traders,” everyday people buying and selling stocks on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574133/robinhood-meme-trades-dogecoin-ipo"&gt;apps such as Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;. Much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop and AMC&lt;/a&gt;, the more popular Churchill stock became, the more it may have looked like a good way to make some money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZveRYw"&gt;Since many of these retail traders are new to the stock market, they’re less likely to understand the vagaries of SPAC mergers. That’s fine; most people had never heard of SPACs before they took off last year. But if they simply bought what they thought was a hot stock, they may not even know about the vote in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="uG4s8V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Please, please vote”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cAVkBQ"&gt;“We welcome all of the new shareholders,” Klein said Thursday. “However, we need you to participate in the election process. In particular, if you are participating from the new trading platforms, the new apps that may not necessarily be directing you clearly to a voting service — we need your vote.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMoTFE"&gt;Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson made a similar plea. “I want to be super clear about this. I need you to vote for proposal two,” he said. “It doesn’t matter how large or small you are. Every single investor vote counts, we’re all in this. So whether you’re a Robinhood trader or managing your portfolio via a traditional brokerage, please, please vote.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6egLDW"&gt;Finally, since apps like Robinhood have lowered the burden to play the stock market, retail traders are more likely to turn around and sell the shares they buy instead of holding on through the merger. And this can make it hard for companies to know who owns their shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4hxqSm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some SPACs are having trouble running down shareholders&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1WHgW"&gt;Public companies use third-party services known as “proxy solicitors” who are supposed to keep tabs on shareholders so they can be reached when it’s time to vote on company matters. But this has gotten harder because so many people are trading SPAC shares, an employee of a company that recently merged with a SPAC tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. This person said the spreadsheet their company received from the proxy solicitor was full of disconnected numbers or old AOL email accounts. Even when the company was able to track down the shareholder to ask them to vote, there was a good chance that person had already sold their shares to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYi5fs"&gt;Klein and Rawlinson said they still expect the merger to close on Friday, and for Lucid Motors to take Churchill’s place as a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. And while they’re &lt;a href="https://spacinsider.com/2020/09/28/forum-merger-ii-secures-sufficient-votes-for-extension-following-delay/"&gt;not the first to run into trouble trying to round up enough shareholders&lt;/a&gt; to approve a SPAC merger, the $4.5 billion investment hanging in the balance makes this last-minute delay feel just a bit more precarious.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Banks, brokerages, PSN, the Steam Store, and more went down in massive internet outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Development of the police software VeRA" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LrC9o22AmhvhBOKzaNjc9Q595FU=/0x0:5334x3556/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617873/1233144145.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q5cq91"&gt;Many websites — including banking pages, brokerages, and gaming services — were affected for just over an hour Thursday, as part of a major internet outage. During the outage, consumers were unable to access services like Ally Bank, Fidelity, Sony’s PlayStation Network, Airbnb, and more. Several airline sites were also affected: Delta, British Airways, and Southwest’s sites were either down, or had important functionality like flight check-ins broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHK7wX"&gt;Many sites appear to be functional again after Akamai, a content delivery network that hosts much of the internet, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Akamai/status/1418251400660889603"&gt;started rolling out a fix to its service&lt;/a&gt;. “We are continuing to monitor the situation and can confirm this was not a result of a cyber attack on the Akamai platform” says Akamai in email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0Jqqi"&gt;It quickly became clear that Akamai was involved, with many websites attributing the outages to the CDN provider. Larger outlets included the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MTA/status/1418248990823534592"&gt;New York Metro Transportation Authority&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/1418249256519929856"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Times of India&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who tweeted that their service outages were due to Akamai. Cloudflare’s CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1418242657134944258"&gt;has chimed in&lt;/a&gt; to say that its service isn’t to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xdd26q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You may be unable to access several digital tools, including &lt;a href="https://t.co/1mbGGZApQy"&gt;https://t.co/1mbGGZApQy&lt;/a&gt; and MYmta, because of the global Akamai outage right now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the meantime, please DM &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NYCTSubway?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NYCTSubway&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NYCTBus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NYCTBus&lt;/a&gt; if you need any help.&lt;/p&gt;— MTA.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Some of our digital services are currently affected due to an outage at Akamai, our content delivery network. We are working to get our services back as quickly as we can.&lt;/p&gt;— The Times Of India (@timesofindia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/1418249256519929856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="KnLfD0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are aware that some customers may be experiencing issues with our platforms. We are working urgently on resolving the issues.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xx2P80"&gt;Gaming services were also hit hard by the internet issues. &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/playstation-network/"&gt;DownDetector reported&lt;/a&gt; a spike of over 40,000 users who were having issues with the PlayStation Network, and the Steam store also had functionality issues. DownDetector also reported issues with games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://status.playstation.com/"&gt;Sony’s PSN status page&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged an issue shortly before we published this post: “PlayStation Network services are up and running, but there are external, internet-wide issues that might affect your experience,” the company wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2SkQIRW_FoEwRpqI4w3btdB_dcI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733503/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some sites displayed error messages during the outage, and some fail to load all together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CvrHSa39_xvebyNZpBv4G3naPEQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733512/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_9.33.33_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://livemap.pingdom.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pingdom’s live map&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; shows that the issue was global.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8V9JD0"&gt;As far as more essential services, a number of banks’ websites also appeared to have been rendered non-functional during the outage, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABC13News/status/1418218123535142925"&gt;there were reports&lt;/a&gt; of 911 systems being down across multiple states. It is, however, unclear if the emergency services outage was related to the other web outages — the Sheriff’s Department of Grayson County, Virginia, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/GraysonCountySheriffsOffice/posts/"&gt;reported that&lt;/a&gt; its 911 outage stemmed from a fiber cut, which has now reportedly been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsrUTO"&gt;Outages like this show that, while the web is decentralized in theory, many major sites’ functionality is dependent on a handful of companies. In June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525820/fastly-outage-bug-customer"&gt;a single customer&lt;/a&gt; hit a bug that brought down Fastly’s CDN service — and Reddit, Twitch, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523953/twitch-reddit-down-fastly-outage-issues"&gt;went down with it.&lt;/a&gt; Problems with Amazon’s Web Services &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719396/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-down-internet"&gt;have also caused major outages&lt;/a&gt; in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s ‘about this result’ feature will now show why you got your specific search results </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HalrS1A1v1fMnsF6A4pySE1exbk=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618100/google.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mSL97G"&gt;Google is updating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22252443/google-about-this-result-information-search-results-wikipedia-vet-websites"&gt;its “about this result” feature&lt;/a&gt; for search results with an &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/learn-more-and-get-more-from-search/"&gt;interesting new addition&lt;/a&gt;: context about how and why the company’s algorithm landed on the specific results for the links that it surfaces when you search for things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIhlFj"&gt;The company added the “about this result” information box earlier this year as a way to help users properly vet sources that they weren’t familiar with using data sourced from Wikipedia. The menu — accessed by clicking the triple dots at the corner of a search result— pops up and tries to provide additional background information about a website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeXZck"&gt;The update that’s rolling out today, though, doesn’t add more context about websites that might appear in search results, but rather helps shine a light inward on Google’s algorithm and how it links search terms to specific sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zv3xwo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google adds ‘about this result’ information in search to help vet websites before you click","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22252443/google-about-this-result-information-search-results-wikipedia-vet-websites"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3xaHNQ"&gt;In an example provided by Google, a search for “how to cook fish in the oven” lands on a recipe from a site that included the words “how, cook, fish, and oven” and were related to other terms like “ingredients” and “recipe.” Google also does things like matching language and applying relevant geographic locations to help land on the specific result. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5dZ7K77H5DQj7tROku-2PmQPn9A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733303/how_to_cook_fish_in_the_oven.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KPSsu0"&gt;The company explains that the goal here is to help users who may not be as familiar with Google’s search system to understand a little bit more about what’s going on behind the scenes when they search and to use that knowledge to help them make better searches to find what they’re looking for in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4j8u6J"&gt;The updated results should be rolling out to users now. To start, it’ll be available for English language results in the US, but Google hopes to expand availability in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBEMC3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s when and how you can preorder the Playdate handheld</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KA5i-BnZ9lKM3ERV0sq928Gt7As=/0x2:1454x971/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618045/F558C979_3BAF_4B2D_ADC3_CDFC275FFA64.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZQoyjn"&gt;Playdate, the quirky new handheld with a black-and-white screen and a crank on its side created by Panic and co-designed with Teenage Engineering, will be available for preorder starting Thursday, July 29th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. &lt;a href="https://play.date/"&gt;You’ll be able to secure a unit through the site play.date&lt;/a&gt; for $179. It’ll start shipping later this year &lt;a href="https://help.play.date/shipping/"&gt;in select countries&lt;/a&gt;, though the company still doesn’t have a concrete release date for the portable device. You can also preorder the Playdate Cover accessory that can protect the device for $29. If you preorder, you’ll be charged immediately, but Panic says you can cancel at any time for a full refund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcP20e"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523929/playdate-preorder-game-lineup-dock-announced"&gt;Panic co-founder Cabel Sasser shared last month&lt;/a&gt; in a video update that “the sooner you order, the sooner you’ll get one, but we’re not going to close the door on you.” So, even if you’re a bit late to ordering, at least you won’t have to panic to get Panic’s Playdate. According to Panic, the first 20,000 or so units will ship toward the end of 2021, and orders after that will ship in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAa2Bq"&gt;In case you’re not familiar with this irresistibly cute handheld, it was announced in May 2019, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22351213"&gt;we just put up some in-depth impressions of the console and a few of its games&lt;/a&gt;. It’ll get new, exclusive games in waves called “seasons,” sort of like a TV show. For the first season, you’ll get two games every two weeks over a 12-week period. Panic is being cagey about game details (it hasn’t announced three of the 24 total games), but you can find some thumbnails below to somewhat get a sense of what’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dp5MiR"&gt;Levels of influenza and other non-COVID-19 respiratory viruses were at historic lows during most of 2020, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7029a1.htm?s_cid=mm7029a1_w"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There’s still very little flu circulating, but other viruses — including parainfluenza viruses and common human coronaviruses, which cause colds — are having an out-of-season resurgence in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggPiSY"&gt;Between October 2020 and May 2021, levels of the flu in the United States were at their lowest since 1997, the first year there’s flu season data available, the analysis found. There was very little flu reported &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/flu-has-disappeared-worldwide-during-the-covid-pandemic1/"&gt;all over the world&lt;/a&gt;, and experts think the protective measures people took against COVID-19 — masking, distancing — suppressed the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VrVpVS"&gt;The nearly nonexistent flu season this year might mean that this fall and winter’s flu season could be more severe, the CDC report warned. Because there wasn’t much influenza around, people may not have been exposed to the virus at the same rates they usually are. That could blunt the normal levels of immunity to the virus. “Lower levels of population immunity, especially among younger children, could portend more widespread disease and a potentially more severe epidemic when influenza virus circulation resumes,” the authors of the report wrote. That means it’ll be especially important for doctors and nurses to encourage anyone older than six months to get their flu shots this fall, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FVuWthy1mmfiNW2224tgavXi66k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22732927/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_9.29.55_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s an out-of-season uptick in parainfluenza viruses and common human coronaviruses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4subxw"&gt;The circulation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a virus that causes colds in adults but can be dangerous for infants, was also muted during 2020 and early 2021. Rates started to tick back up in April 2021, which is unusual — normally, levels of that virus peak in January. Parainfluenza viruses and common human coronaviruses followed a similar trend: levels were low through 2020 and then started to climb in February 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4gMNm"&gt;The public health measures used to slow the spread of COVID-19 likely helped suppress these viruses over 2020, and they bounced back as communities in the US started to lift some of those restrictions. It’s still not clear exactly how the flu and various cold-causing viruses respond to different strategies used against COVID-19, so the trends in these viruses might be unpredictable over the next year as efforts to fight the pandemic continue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSBpUg"&gt;“Clinicians should be aware that respiratory viruses might not exhibit typical seasonal circulation patterns and that a resumption of circulation of certain respiratory viruses is occurring,” the CDC report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IF7M23"&gt;The uptick in viruses that cause the common cold might also make it harder for people and their doctors to differentiate between COVID-19 symptoms and symptoms of other illnesses. During 2020, any cold- or flu-like symptoms were likely to be COVID-19 — it was one of the only viruses around. Now that other viruses are on their way back, the picture could be murkier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiobc5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EzbdOo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Playdate hands-on: a Game Boy from a different dimension</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Playdate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X1qXWsYoBJElN0iT8lzJjsrzoyY=/0x95:4000x2762/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618057/Playdate_model_shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Panic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A few days with Panic’s crank-powered handheld&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="i14rpl"&gt;If things go as expected, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578902/video-game-handhelds-steam-deck-switch-playdate-analogue-pocket"&gt;four new dedicated video game handhelds will launch this year&lt;/a&gt;. And each is primed to offer something different. The next Switch has a brighter, more vibrant OLED screen; Valve’s Steam Deck is a gaming PC in your hands; and Analogue’s Pocket handheld recreates the original Game Boy hardware while adding modern upgrades like a better LCD display and the option to connect to an HDTV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14HmIj"&gt;And then there’s the Playdate from Panic. Whereas the aforementioned handhelds are almost uniformly technological upgrades, the Playdate offers something much weirder. It looks kind of like a Game Boy that comes from an alien world. There are familiar elements, like a D-pad and face buttons, but many of its games are controlled by a crank that slots into the side. And those games are only available in black and white, and they’ll eventually be released as part of weekly mystery drops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9gY9h"&gt;It sounds strange and fascinating, and I had the chance to head into the PlayDate’s parallel universe over the last few days with a near-final version of the device. It definitely &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; weird — but that’s also what makes it exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqfqrc"&gt;The most striking thing about the Playdate is its electric yellow color scheme. It stands out in a world of smartphones that are mostly black slabs. It’s also a square, measuring at 76 x 74mm, as opposed to the more common rectangle, and it’s only 9mm thick. Basically, it’s tiny. About half the front is taken up by a glossy 400 × 240 display, with a shiny D-pad and A and B buttons below, much like on an original Game Boy. There’s also a home / menu button on the top right corner, a lock button on the right shoulder, and a headphone jack and USB-C port on the bottom. A tiny, yet surprisingly loud, speaker runs down the right side of the display. So far, nothing too strange, until you see the silver crank jutting out the side. The PlayDate’s crank is about an inch long, and when not in use its handle slots nicely into the side of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hBrwOmvXZ1ULdkGA6m4euMx6haU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22731082/Saturday_Edition.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturday Edition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7hdHNA"&gt;The company says that the version I played with is the final hardware (the software is still being tweaked) and it’s a great device to hold. The body of the Playdate has a nice matte texture that’s both comfortable and doesn’t smudge, while the buttons — and particularly the D-pad — are satisfyingly clicky. If you have big hands it might be a little cramped, as the pad and buttons are very close together, but I found it comfortable enough for long sessions. Most importantly, it’s fun and playful. This is clearly a device meant for playing video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlZnzQ"&gt;The display is similarly, uh, distinct. It’s crisp, yet is entirely black and white and has no backlight. It’s kind of like playing games on a high-end Kindle. It’s not reflective, as opposed to, say, a Switch. I had no problems playing games outside in the sun, even with games where the graphics were dark. In a nice touch, when the handheld goes to sleep, its display turns to a simple analog clock. No backlight is a bummer, but it at least means the Playdate has great battery life; Panic promises eight hours of continuous gameplay, and that proved about right during my short time with the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PNPFdr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The games were all drastically different from each other&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I2wDHG"&gt;My preview unit had four games included, and they were all drastically different from each other. Probably the most notable is &lt;em&gt;Crankin Presents: Time Travel Adventure&lt;/em&gt;, from &lt;em&gt;Katamari&lt;/em&gt; creator Keita Takahashi. It’s essentially a platform game about a guy who is constantly late for a date. In order to get there on time, he has to avoid floating butterflies, literal hurdles, and charging pigs. The twist is that you don’t control the titular Crankin directly. Instead, you move him back and forth through time. The game is controlled entirely with the crank, which you can use to either fast forward or rewind his actions, which are independent of the obstacles. So if a butterfly floats by, for instance, you’ll want to fast-forward Crankin to a point where he’s bent over smelling a flower, so the bug passes by safely. It took me a little while to figure out what to do, but once I grasped the concept the game became a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4uOWU"&gt;Elsewhere is &lt;em&gt;Lost Your Marbles&lt;/em&gt;, a mashup of a visual novel and a puzzle game. In it you follow a young girl named Prota who works at some kind of scientific facility that’s researching memory. I won’t pretend to understand it, but for some reason Prota is able to access certain memories by playing a classic ball-in-maze puzzle. It’s weird, but the crank is well-suited for it, as you rotate it to move the maze around the ball in search of a memory. &lt;em&gt;Lost Your Marbles&lt;/em&gt; also looks great, with big, bold character portraits that make the most out of the hardware’s limited capabilities, buoyed by some really silly and hilarious writing. It’s a fun, quirky remix of genres that feels right at home on the Playdate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NmS82gNmuHgotyH3tWlRoTIn8i0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22731085/Lost_Your_Marbles.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lost Your Marbles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xdBpSm"&gt;The most surprising game I played was &lt;em&gt;Saturday Edition&lt;/em&gt;. It was surprising because of how straightforward it is. It’s a classic point-and-click style adventure and it doesn’t utilize the crank at all (at least from what I played); instead, you use the D-pad and buttons to wander around a city, collecting clues and solving puzzles. It’s been stripped down just enough so that it feels comfortable to play with only two buttons, and the grainy visuals make it feel like a long-lost PC game. If nothing else, &lt;em&gt;Saturday Edition &lt;/em&gt;is a good indication that the Playdate will be home to more than just silly crank-controlled games. It works well enough for more traditional titles as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQIzCm"&gt;Rounding out the quartet is &lt;em&gt;Whitewater Wipeout&lt;/em&gt;, an arcade-style surfing game that I can’t say much about because I could not figure out the controls. From what I can tell, you’re supposed to use the crank to spin the board and ride a wave, but no matter how much I tried I couldn’t stay afloat for more than a few seconds at a time. It’s entirely possible this is a “me” problem, but it does show that the unique nature of the crank controls could lead to some steeper than usual learning curves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJANC2"&gt;The one thing I wasn’t able to experience with my Playdate is actually one of the most important aspects of the device: surprise. When the handheld finally launches, new games will be released in “seasons.” Essentially, over the course of each season a new mystery game will appear on your Playdate once a week. The release will be the same for everyone, making for a kind of unique appointment viewing-style experience. The full breadth of what the Playdate has to offer will rely a lot on what these games are like, as well as the communal discovery process. But a few days with the handheld has made me excited for what mysteries are in store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ekQhNz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22351234"&gt;Preorders for the Playdate open on July 29th&lt;/a&gt;, with the first batch of units expected to start shipping “towards the end of this year.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now use Edge’s password manager to log in to mobile apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G2-QbkbHLtEFf4kORiKbqOrvSuc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617967/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c0zO8a"&gt;Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/07/22/our-top-new-features-to-help-you-save-time-and-money-and-stay-safer-online-as-you-get-ready-for-back-to-school/"&gt;updating Edge on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; to allow the browser’s password manager to log you in to your mobile apps. The new release, technically Edge 92, also includes new password safety features through a password health dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KG3usG"&gt;The Edge mobile app should be able to use the browser’s password manager in a way that sounds similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;to other services like BitWarden or 1Password&lt;/a&gt;. Using your login credentials you’ve accumulated in Edge, you can easily log in to apps like Pinterest or Instagram, presumably with the autofill-type experience you’re used to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="309G1p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Edge has a lot more password features now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fljMV3"&gt;Microsoft already offered a universal password management feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178026/microsoft-authenticator-autofill-feature-password-manager"&gt;in Microsoft Authenticator&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed you to set it as a default autofill option in iOS or Android. Microsoft says that the mobile version of Edge will work the same way so that you can set it as an autofill option in iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YT-AM7tVLpIL-Tmm2cNxdQb8abk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733471/WIN_Edge_Password_Strength_16x9_en_US.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edge’s new password health dashboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3fUmK2"&gt;According to Microsoft, Edge can now also tell you if a password has been used on multiple sites and whether a new password is “strong” through a password health dashboard. Both features feel like table stakes things that should have been used across Edge already, but it’s great that they’re here now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1lJ7JsLLr4yz6WLfDIg0VRZVT9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733476/WIN_Edge_Outlook_Extension_16x9_en_US.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edge’s Outlook extension packs all the email and calendar you could want in a tiny drop down menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAZ4yf"&gt;For Outlook users, Microsoft now also offers &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/microsoft-outlook/kkpalkknhlklpbflpcpkepmmbnmfailf?hl=en-US&amp;amp;form=MO12IJ&amp;amp;OCID=MO12IJhttps%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoftedge.microsoft.com%2Faddons%2Fdetail%2Foutlook-as-edgechrome-ex%2Fkkpalkknhlklpbflpcpkepmmbnmfailf%3Fhl%3Den-US&amp;amp;form=MO12IJ&amp;amp;OCID=MO12IJ"&gt;an Outlook extension for Edge&lt;/a&gt; that lets you check your calendar and contacts and send email, all without opening a new tab or the Outlook app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMjjdT"&gt;You can download the new version of Edge now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnCLle"&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 22nd, 1:13PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added confirmation from Microsoft about Edge’s password manager features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic files new complaint in its antitrust suit against Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9zeJIDhl1hyW7gimA-xoGMJGPbE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617851/acastro_210429_1777_epic_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iEit1g"&gt;Epic has renewed its fight against mobile platforms’ app store restrictions, filing an update to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;antitrust case against Google&lt;/a&gt;. The filing adds mostly redacted details about Google’s alleged monopolistic behavior on Android, including banning Epic’s game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from the Google Play Store last year. The amended complaint comes soon after a judge officially linked the case with a recent multi-state lawsuit, which took aim at Google’s Play Store policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0ngV8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364325/gov.uscourts.cand.364325.156.0.pdf"&gt;Epic’s complaint&lt;/a&gt; builds on information gleaned from government antitrust probes and documents produced since the original suit. One addition, for instance, includes details revealed last year about “the close relationship that Google maintains with Apple,” including an agreement to pay &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/22/926290942/google-paid-apple-billions-to-dominate-search-on-iphones-justice-department-says"&gt;between $8 and $12 billion&lt;/a&gt; to be Apple’s default search provider. It also includes new information about Google’s supposed anti-competitive conduct, including its deals with phone makers and alternate app stores. Most of this information, however, has been sealed — leaving only hints about the claims that the case could hinge on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rD3oNZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The filing includes new details, but most are redacted&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5fv7mC"&gt;Google denied the claims in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “The open Android ecosystem lets developers distribute apps through multiple app stores. For game developers who choose to use the Play Store, we have consistent policies that are fair to developers and keep the store safe for users. While &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; remains available on Android, we can no longer make it available on Play because it violates our policies. We will continue to defend ourselves against these meritless claims,” said spokesperson José Castañeda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K8Ug8x"&gt;Among the new redacted information, Epic apparently describes its plans to launch &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on the Samsung Galaxy Store. “Google was determined not to let this happen,” the complaint says, so it offered Epic a “special deal” to launch on Google Play. When Epic rejected the deal, Google allegedly took other anti-competitive action, but the details of that action aren’t available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ddV8f"&gt;Google’s relationship with Samsung came under the microscope earlier this month when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;36 states and the District of Columbia sued Google&lt;/a&gt; for breaking antitrust law. The Epic complaint cites some allegations that were raised in that complaint, like a deal to turn the Samsung Galaxy Store into effectively a rebranded Play Store — something the new filing reveals was called “Project Agave.” Epic’s filing suggests that if the lawsuit proceeds, it will hinge partly on how Google responded to the prospect of an Epic-Samsung deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dqn29F"&gt;Outside these and other redacted claims, the complaint makes the same basic argument as Epic’s &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364325/gov.uscourts.cand.364325.1.0.pdf"&gt;original lawsuit in August&lt;/a&gt;. It says Google’s “open” Android ecosystem is still functionally monopolistic, preventing other app stores or sideloaded apps from competing on a level playing field with Google’s official Play Store platform. It’s seeking the ability to place &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in the Google Play Store with an independent payment processing system and an end to other allegedly noncompetitive actions — which, in its complaint, include the relatively long and onerous process for launching a sideloaded app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eBA2Ga"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We’re still awaiting a verdict in Epic v. Apple&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WbUmyO"&gt;Epic and Google were initially supposed to appear in a hearing about the future of the case today. But the parties agreed to push back the timeline while Epic filed an amended complaint. Judge James Donato &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364325/gov.uscourts.cand.364325.155.0.pdf"&gt;also agreed&lt;/a&gt; to consolidate early parts of the case with the state Play Store lawsuit. A &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364325/gov.uscourts.cand.364325.154.0.pdf"&gt;proposed schedule&lt;/a&gt; from earlier this month gives Google until August 20th to file a motion to dismiss, then sets a hearing on the case for October 14th. Google has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;previously disputed&lt;/a&gt; the legal complaints against the Play Store, saying Google’s platform “provides more openness and choice than others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQ66tU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic v. Google&lt;/em&gt; has moved more slowly than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;Epic’s lawsuit against Apple&lt;/a&gt;, which went to trial in May and awaits a verdict. &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; revolved around slightly different questions since, unlike Apple, Google does allow third-party apps or stores. So unlike on iOS, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; isn’t locked out of Android while the case proceeds; you can still download it directly from  Epic’s site. But both suits claim the platforms’ rules for developers are unfair and anti-competitive — and in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Google&lt;/em&gt;, Epic has found common cause with government antitrust watchdogs as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="osQt4p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1:20PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added comment from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google opens up Android Auto’s beta testing program  </title>

  &lt;p id="E2eXTW"&gt;Google is launching a new &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/androidauto/answer/10961485"&gt;beta tester program for Android Auto&lt;/a&gt;, giving users the chance to get early access to features if they’re prepared to put up with the potential instability of unfinished software. Android Auto has had a testing program, but attempting to sign up for it has shown a message warning that the program had reached its “maximum number of testers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kYgUT"&gt;“As a beta tester, you can help us build a better version of Android Auto. You can test how well new features work with your specific phone and vehicle in your part of the world,” Google says. “When you share your feedback, we’ll use it to help plan improvements for future releases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZLNvhJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can help us build a better version of Android Auto”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O4UluO"&gt;The announcement of the new beta program comes as Android Auto has just gone through one of its biggest expansions in years when it launched in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150166/android-auto-expands-countries-europe-africa-asia"&gt;dozens of new countries&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2020. Its wireless connectivity feature also recently got a big boost with news that any Android 11 phone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21377399/google-android-auto-android-11-wireless-phone-support"&gt;would be able to connect wirelessly&lt;/a&gt; to compatible vehicles.   Considering these enhancements, it’s not surprising that Google needs more beta testers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4lkrP8"&gt;To sign up, Google says you can head over to the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.projection.gearhead/"&gt;opt-in page&lt;/a&gt;, where there’ll be an option to “Become a tester.” Once signed up, the beta version of Android Auto can be downloaded from the Play Store. If the bugginess gets too much, Google says the link to opt out is &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.projection.gearhead/join"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;. Just remember to uninstall the beta app and re-download the stable version from the Play Store to leave the beta.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Wear OS 3 plans mean Android users should wait to buy a smartwatch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IdLQw53urY4_0NY58lzPjBBf_Bs=/127x0:1450x882/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617560/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_2.31.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ByVX0L"&gt;Google has finally given its new, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;unified smartwatch platform&lt;/a&gt; a name — and it’s an obvious one: Wear OS 3. That little detail was part of what may be a more contentious set of information about which current Wear OS smartwatches will be updated, when those updates will come, and what those updates will entail. On all three of those fronts, it’s not very good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpESVb"&gt;Google says that Wear OS 3 updates will start rolling out to a limited set of smartwatches in the “second half of 2022.” That’s quite a long way away, especially since we’re expecting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;first Wear OS 3 watches to be announced&lt;/a&gt; next month at Samsung’s Unpacked event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ew1vVq"&gt;Currently, the list of watches that could get the update “include Mobvoi’s TicWatch Pro 3 GPS, TicWatch Pro 3 Cellular/LTE, TicWatch E3 and follow on TicWatch devices, as well as Fossil Group’s new generation of devices launching later this year,” according to Google’s post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHqFY1"&gt;That leaves a lot of Wear OS watches out, including everything from Fossil and its associated brands. And that list also leaves all of Samsung’s Tizen-based watches out. They’re currently the best option for most Android users, but they now appear to officially have an expiration date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpM8gN"&gt;There’s no other way to put this: for Android users, it’s not a good idea to buy a smartwatch right now. Everything that’s available today either won’t be updated or won’t receive an update until late 2022. It’s the clearest and most direct example of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect"&gt;Osborne effect&lt;/a&gt; in recent memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yu7qvl"&gt;And to be even blunter, it may not be a good idea to buy watches that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; on that list, as there are further complications with that update. Google says that “in some limited cases, the user experience may be impacted” but declined to elaborate further right now. That could mean a lot of things, but a common experience with any computer is new operating systems feeling slow on older hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSeJl8"&gt;In an emailed statement, a spokesperson promised that Google would “provide more details in advance of the update so users can make an informed decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gj0eTA"&gt;Additionally, upgrading to Wear OS 3 will require a full factory reset, wiping any settings and data you might have on the watch. Most of that should be backed up to your phone regardless as Wear OS apps usually aren’t fully self-contained on the watch, but it’s still likely to be a hassle. And you likely won’t be able to just hit a restore button after the update to bring back your old watch settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2brmOO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Installing the update will require resetting the watch to factory state&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cIa2fZ"&gt;Google at least recognizes that many watch owners will not want to go through all that hassle, so it is offering a way to decline the update but still receive security patches. The company promises to continue to support the current version of Wear OS with updates and will offer security updates for “two years from device launch.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x84qui"&gt;The blog post is likely meant to get the bad news out of the way early so that the decks are cleared for Samsung’s Galaxy smartwatch announcements — not to mention rumors of a Google Pixel watch that may also be in the wings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGdh1z"&gt;After so many years of languishing, the next version of Wear OS will have a lot to prove. Although it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;announced this past May at Google I/O&lt;/a&gt;, we still don’t have a full picture of how it will actually work in real use. We know that it takes some elements from Samsung’s Tizen platform — like watchfaces — but that generally it’s more Wear OS than Tizen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pMZGz"&gt;What we have seen of Wear OS 3 so far is promising. Google says it will be faster than current smartwatches while also offering longer battery life. It should also offer a standalone Google Maps app, offline Spotify music, and integrated Fitbit activity tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jw5snE"&gt;All of which means that if you’re an Android user who wants a smartwatch, the best option you have right now is to simply wait until new Wear OS 3 watches are launched and reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;
