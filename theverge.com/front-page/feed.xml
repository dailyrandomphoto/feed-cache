    <title>Performing Hamlet in GTA Online is simply the best theater experience lockdown can offer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ed_00CdnQ4lsDpX84zQS6zEP2PI=/168x0:1517x899/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69466635/Screen_Shot_2021_06_17_at_3.10.56_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uV15rc"&gt;Plenty of actors can, I’m sure, cite plays they were in where the audience was bored, listless, or simply nonexistent. But few have had to contend with the challenges presented by performing in a public lobby in &lt;em&gt;GTA Online. &lt;/em&gt;That’s a shame, frankly, because it’s hilarious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyjHxg"&gt;A YouTuber by the name of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUCmwCCmU6D0tSYijfIpg8A"&gt;Rustic Mascara&lt;/a&gt; has been testing the limits of this bold new performance space, and, though I can’t explain exactly why, I find it amazing to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWRT1T"&gt;In one video (above), he performs a speech from Act II Scene ii, in which Hamlet explains to his friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern why exactly he is so very, very sad. In Rustic’s performance, this is prefaced by requests to nearby players that they please not kill him.  He gets as far as lamenting that the Earth itself “appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors” before being blown up by a rocket. He then respawns and continues with the extremely apt next line “What a piece of work is a man” before being killed again, moments later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaypDX"&gt;Honestly, this is Shakespeare as Shakespeare himself would have wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h21KZm"&gt;Another video (below) shows Rustic and a friend performing the play’s opening scene in &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt;’s own Vinewood Bowl. Again, things don’t exactly go smoothly, but there’s something incredible about watching the two characters (a pair of guards on night watch) reassure one another that they’ve heard “not a mouse stirring” as the sound of sirens and gunshots fill the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KUwfJH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/54sCXRvP3Y0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cTG6iV"&gt;That’s all we’ve really got from Rustic so far (there’s two other videos on his channel, but they’re not as good), though I hope his future attempts gather more support. &lt;em&gt;GTA Online &lt;/em&gt;has entertained players with heists and races, but what about incentivizing players to form roving theater troupes, each attempting to perform the classics while fending off rival gangs of gun-wielding actors? After all, a little bit of culture never hurt anybody. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring reportedly used LA cops as influencers to market its cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7UdHYb9JqE6X2SwDOk5gmjn2H6g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69466516/dseifert170808_1901_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A Ring doorbell equipped with a camera | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TK6EXl"&gt;Amazon-owned Ring used Los Angeles police officers as brand ambassadors for its security cameras, providing free products and discount codes in exchange for recommendations, the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-06-17/ring-influencer-marketing-los-angeles-police-department"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Ring gave at least 100 LAPD officers free devices, which helped the department create a network of surveillance cameras, making it easier to obtain video footage, according to the &lt;em&gt;LA Times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hZIGc"&gt;Ring ended Pillar, its police officer ambassador program in 2019, and a spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Friday that “the practices and programs in question do not reflect Ring today. We stopped donating to law enforcement and encouraging police to promote our products years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rG8Sx"&gt;The LAPD did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but a departmental review found that participating officers didn’t appear to have violated LAPD rules, according to the &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBi9QJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17059664/amazon-ring-acquisition-smart-home-security-cloud-cam"&gt;Amazon acquired Ring in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and has tried to establish that its home security cameras &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17953050/ring-ceo-jamie-siminoff-interview-smart-video-doorbell-security-police"&gt;can help reduce neighborhood crime&lt;/a&gt;. But according to a February 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/cute-videos-little-evidence-police-say-amazon-ring-isn-t-n1136026"&gt;NBC News investigation&lt;/a&gt;, many law enforcement agencies can’t actually attribute any crimes to being solved due to the assistance of a Ring camera. And of the arrests that were helped by Ring footage, many were for low-level nonviolent property crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycB9of"&gt;But police departments can ask Ring customers to provide them with access to camera footage; a January report from the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; found that Ring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22258856/amazon-ring-partners-police-fire-security-privacy-cameras"&gt;partnered with more than 2,000 police and fire departments&lt;/a&gt; last year, reportedly requesting footage for around 22,000 total incidents. Most of the requests ask users to voluntarily submit video, but police can obtain footage directly through parent company Amazon with a search warrant or court order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjibH6"&gt;And last summer during anti-racism and police brutality protests, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287287/los-angeles-police-department-ring-anti-racism-protest-video-surveillance-request"&gt;LAPD asked Ring customers to provide footage&lt;/a&gt; from their camera doorbells, according to emails obtained by the &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/lapd-requested-ring-footage-black-lives-matter-protests"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. “During the recent protests, individuals were injured and property was looted, damaged, and destroyed,” the LAPD wrote in one request, and it was seeking the footage “to identify those responsible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ckVuRw"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22465295/ring-public-agencies-request-for-assistance-feed-neighbors-app"&gt;Ring made changes&lt;/a&gt; to the way police and other public agencies can request video clips from camera owners in its Neighbors app. Agencies can no longer send individuals private requests for clips and can only request clips be sent to them via public posts viewable in the main feed of the Neighbors app. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/17/21141336/amazon-ring-cameras-spy-neighbors-police-nbc-news-intelligencer"&gt;Neighbors app is separate&lt;/a&gt; from the main Ring app and is more akin to local social networks like Nextdoor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdANB8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 17th 10:23AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added comment from Ring spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo thinks the Switch is well-placed for post-pandemic life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A1bJuQ9C7T8mqeK5RKH1daRPQBc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69466478/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CdScAf"&gt;The Switch is nearly five years old and facing increased competition from new and powerful consoles from Sony and Microsoft. But despite all of this, Nintendo’s E3 2021 presentation this week was arguably the highlight of this year’s event — even if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22456160/new-nintendo-switch-release-date-september-e3-announcement"&gt;the long-rumored Switch Pro&lt;/a&gt; failed to make an appearance. Nintendo showed off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533513/nintendo-switch-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-sequel-trailer-e3-2021-release-date-trailer"&gt;the much-anticipated sequel to &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22466240/nintendo-metroid-dread-side-scroller-e3-2021-switch"&gt;revealed that the mythical &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt; is launching later this year&lt;/a&gt;, and peppered in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535127/advance-wars-1-and-2-re-boot-camp-nintendo-direct-e3-2021"&gt;a handful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535212/nintendo-the-legend-of-zelda-ii-links-awakening-game-watch-handheld-release-date"&gt;of other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535183/mario-party-superstars-warioware-nintendo-direct-e3"&gt;announcements&lt;/a&gt; to excite fans. As always, the company continued to exist in its own world, divorced from the technological rat race that typically defines these debates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrzPt0"&gt;In fact, the launch of the PS5 and Xbox Series X appears to have had very little impact on Nintendo, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422451/nintendo-annual-earnings-switch-84-59-million"&gt;the Switch is selling as well as ever&lt;/a&gt;. Doug Bowser, president of Nintendo of America, believes the reason is simple: there’s still nothing else like the Switch on the market. While he notes that new console launches “bodes well for the industry,” Bowser tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the hybrid nature of the Switch means it still occupies “a unique position” that differentiates itself from more traditional consoles. And it’s a proposition that has proven to be surprisingly enduring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgEoHP"&gt;As with most gaming companies, the past year has been both a challenge and an opportunity for Nintendo. With everyone stuck at home, many turned to games like &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; as a form of escape or social interaction. The pandemic meant that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215786/video-games-covid-19-animal-crossing-among-us"&gt;more people were playing games&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21325659/game-developers-survey-coronavirus-gdc"&gt;conversely that games were more challenging to develop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kn6gn1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think the teams have adapted very well.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1A4Ytp"&gt;“We’ve seen video games really grow in terms of the number of people playing, and the amount of time that they’re playing overall,” Bowser says. “For us at Nintendo, our focus first and foremost has been keeping our employees safe, and ensuring that we’re providing safe environments for them to work within. And while there have been some challenges, what I can say is I think the teams have adapted very well, and it’s allowed us to be effective in the various environments where we may be working overall. I think the lineup that you’ve seen so far this calendar year bodes well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Owe0L9"&gt;Outside of an increased appetite for games, he says that there have also been some changes in player behavior during the pandemic. For starters, there’s been a change in who is playing games on the Switch. “Demographics are changing,” Bowser says. That includes more casual players, as well as more women playing on the Switch. (Bowser previously noted a similar audience expansion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20951926/nintendo-doug-bowser-interview-switch-lite-sales-3ds-support-consoles"&gt;when the Switch Lite launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.) Unsurprisingly, those new players are also spending a lot of time using online features. “&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; again fueled a lot of that,” says Bowser. “But it’s carried through and, for instance, even more recently &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; has been the source of a lot of online play overall for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYAU1v"&gt;He also adds that, despite its absence from the company’s E3 presentation, &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; remains a big part of Nintendo’s future. “While we didn’t talk about it [during the E3 Nintendo Direct], we absolutely have plans going forward to ensure the 33 million people who have islands out there have new and fun activities to engage with,” Bowser says. “Look for more to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HejZBH"&gt;Looking ahead, it’s likely those behaviors will shift again, as various places open up and stay-at-home restrictions are lifted. Bowser believes this will be yet another advantage for Nintendo. “I think that’s going to be really important as we emerge from this pandemic, and people are looking to engage in other activities, hopefully travel, vacations, etc.,” he says. “Nintendo Switch is one of those devices that they can take with them as they embark on various travels. The positioning we still think is incredibly relevant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqHUM6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxZ4Mr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2ia9X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super73 RX review: more dirt bike than e-bike</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Instant hype-beast status included&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="IkEgF3"&gt;The Super73 brand is instantly recognizable. With riders like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J02iZ3FvRoc"&gt;Casey Neistat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jackblack/status/1358219871880835073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1358219871880835073%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Febiketips.road.cc%2Fcontent%2Fnews%2Fceleb-favourite-e-bike-brand-super73-raises-20m-plans-new-models-eyes-european-market"&gt;Jack Black&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7552987/Justin-Bieber-takes-new-electric-bicycle-ride-Beverly-Hills-neighborhood.html"&gt;Justin Bieber&lt;/a&gt;, these souped up e-bikes have made a name for themselves as a trendy, future-ish way to get around. And I can confirm, in riding the latest Super73 model, the $3,500 RX, around NYC for over three weeks, it certainly attracts attention. It looks and rides more like a dirt bike than a bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TK0OxP"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Super73 v Juiced: Racing two extremely powerful e-bikes|102100" data-volume-uuid="9621959b1" data-volume-id="102100" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-199" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="9FUcds"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10610399"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QGtOkF"&gt;I logged nearly 200 miles on the Super73 in my three weeks with it. In short, I had a really great time cruising around on this bike. The Super73 RX has a 960 watt-hour battery that averaged 38 miles of range in Unlimited mode, the most motor-assisted of the four power modes. There are three other class modes in which RX can operate, including a full-pedal assist mode that Super73 claims can get you up to 75 miles of range. The included 5V charger can recharge the removable battery in three to four hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfElpq"&gt;There is a small monochromatic, circular LCD display on the left side of the handlebars that shows speed, range, pedal assist strength, and total distance traveled on the bike. There is also an app that can send turn-by-turn directions to this screen. The app is relatively basic and I ended up never using it aside from setting the bike’s class to align with my local city and state guidelines. There is also a 600-lumen front light and a rear light that is brake-activated, even when the lights are switched off.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4euLIxojaDdiObR14Z7KKtOVgqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662776/BFARSACE_210616_4636_16.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The frame of the Super73 RX is made f﻿rom aircraft-grade 6165 and 7071 aluminum alloy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LLJlLy"&gt;The RX’s single rear DC hub motor’s pick up is gradual, but once you are in the 20mph range it can really kick up to its top speed of 32mph in a hurry, and it peaks at 2000 watts of power. There are front and rear shocks that allow for preload, compression, and rebound adjustments. And when paired with the large, custom five-inch wide Super73 tires, the bike cruises over bumps, cracks, and potholes with ease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojZAHX"&gt;I do wish the throttle was a bit harder to press. When going over a bump, my hand would jump a bit which caused my thumb to also jump on and off the throttle and therefore cut some of the power to the motor. It even proved painful when I was on some very dry paths and a quick, accidental acceleration sent me one way as the bike skidded out the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8ZU28u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10609909"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1NxkFr"&gt;The frame of the Super73 RX is made from aircraft-grade 6165 and 7071 aluminum alloy. It feels very rugged. I kept a chain lock wrapped around the front of the frame, and even with it bouncing and slamming against the bike’s frame, no dents or scratches were left behind. There are also ample mounts for rigging accessories to almost any part of the frame and fenders on both tires. And there are a mess of wires on the front, semi-hidden behind a plastic plate, that then run through the frame to keep the whole bike looking clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztK2pp"&gt;All of these premium materials add up to a lot of weight. The RX is 80lbs of bike that you absolutely feel when you’re not using the hub motor to power it. I can’t imagine owning this bike and having to move it up any number of stairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQCCoC"&gt;I took the RX on a few dirt paths in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park, and this is really where you can feel the power of that 2,000-watt motor and front and rear suspension. There is very little this bike won’t go over or up. But again, this is where the RX feels more like an electric dirt bike than a bicycle and where being able to handle 80lbs of bike might get rough if you don’t know what you’re doing. With the low handlebars and pushed-back seat position, the RX doesn’t make for a comfortable pedaling experience either, and using this bike in pedal assist mode only is very uncomfortable.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; But when using just the throttle, the bike feels really powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A8o1jQhetCEJfrFl7OTyInTNz_4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662967/BFARSACE_210616_4636_20.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RX weighs 80lbs and rides like an electric dirt bike.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wnAHEcVJOmr2yFOLC4T96YxxqsQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662774/BFARSACE_210616_4636_14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The taillight is brake activated even when the running lights are powered off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_FBbxWAqNEYFoQhALRaHadnyigo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662771/BFARSACE_210616_4636_11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I installed $15 metal pegs for a second passenger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bA0m6z"&gt;The Super73 RX is as great to look at as it is to ride, and at $3,500 it better be. But its lack of built-in anti-theft features caused me great anxiety here in NYC. This bike is a total showstopper and therefore quite desirable. When parking it on the street, I would remove the 11.2-pound battery with the included key then lock it up using both a chain lock and U-lock. Even then, I would still be nervous about someone running away with it. I wish Super73 offered better theft protection options out of the box, like VanMoof, or made the bike only able to be powered via a key, like Juiced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uV5RxB"&gt;And while Super73 claims the battery can be recharged 1,000 times over, the one-year hardware warranty is confusing and currently most replacements parts are unavailable via the company’s site. It’s a big investment with little certainty that it will be easily repairable. But if you’re willing to risk all of that, and trust in the good parts Super73 uses on its e-bikes, then you will have an absolute blast busting around on this bike.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XEpuLmTimxX3s8MHN7vCY-g2D8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662775/BFARSACE_210616_4636_15.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super73’s RX comes with a 5V 2.8lb charger that is capable of charging the 960Wh battery in three to four hours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I4fucLtCz7ETshoIdS3tGvjdnS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662773/BFARSACE_210616_4636_13.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a small screen on the left side of the handlebars that shows speed, range, pedal assist strength, total distance traveled on the bike, and turn-by-turn directions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x0S7e5"&gt;Super 73’s RX is just as fun for running errands as it is to take on the trails, that is if you’re not pedaling and instead using the thumb throttle. It feels solid underneath you and can kick up to high speeds for long periods of time on a single charge. But this e-bike is far less of a peddling bike and way more of a throttle bike, which can be hard to get used to if you are coming from a biking background or looking to get any form of exercise while riding. It is also one of the more expensive models of e-bike within this spec range, so it will be important to have a clear purpose before investing in this electric dirt bike.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony opens PS5 beta program ahead of next major system update</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gtoASn"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; has received a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383288/sony-ps5-update-hdr-options-120hz-pc-monitor-support-features"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; feature updates since it launched in late 2020, but &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/06/17/sign-up-for-the-first-ps5-system-software-beta-program/"&gt;Sony shared today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s prepping to roll out a major system update later this year — and it wants you to test it first. You can register for it’s “first-ever” beta to try the new console software if you’re over 18 and live in the US, Canada, Japan, UK, Germany, or France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTYljR"&gt;Sony isn’t yet sharing what new features are coming in the beta, but it’ll divulge details in the coming weeks, it says. Could it be that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;PS5’s long-awaited M.2 SSD slot will get switched on&lt;/a&gt; for additional speedy storage, or will the console finally get variable refresh rate and 1440p support? You can already tell that I’m expecting a lot out of this incoming update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tn0f2t"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/8/13561008/microsoft-xbox-insider-program"&gt;Microsoft has allowed Xbox gamers to opt in&lt;/a&gt; to test upcoming software releases for years through its Insider program, and it’s usually where the company debuts visual updates to its dashboard and other under-the-hood features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvlbYw"&gt;If you’re interested, &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/ps5/ps5-beta-program-sign-up"&gt;you can sign up here&lt;/a&gt;, though you’ll need to be signed in with your PlayStation ID to register. Sony says that signing up for this beta means you’ll be considered for future beta releases. Anyone who opts into the beta can still restore their system to the latest official release before the testing phase ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KE5NeA"&gt;As always, there are risks involved with signing up to test beta software. The system might not behave normally in some cases, and you may want to double-check that all of your game saves are backed up — either locally or to the cloud via your PS Plus account.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SkoXe0"&gt;Just ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;Prime Day&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has begun its annual back-to-school promotion, including &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus-hed%2Fshop&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22538235%2Fapple-sale-airpods-macbook-ipad-anker-microsoft-surface-duo-android-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free AirPods when you purchase an eligible Mac or iPad&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a similar deal to last year’s offer, where the standard AirPods are offered by default, but at checkout you can upgrade to the model that includes the wireless charging case for $40, or the AirPods Pro for an extra $90. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmcEdD"&gt;As for what devices are eligible for the free AirPods on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus-hed%2Fshop&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22538235%2Fapple-sale-airpods-macbook-ipad-anker-microsoft-surface-duo-android-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s education site&lt;/a&gt;, it starts with the $499 iPad Air (latest gen with USB-C), moving up to the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;M1-touting iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. On the macOS side of things, Apple is offering AirPods with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; (13 or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features"&gt;Intel-based 16-inch model&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;the new iMac&lt;/a&gt; (as well as the previous-gen 21.5- or 27-inch models), and finally, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161358/mac-pro-review-apple-display-xdr-adobe-hardware-software-price-video"&gt;Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfjbFn"&gt;There aren’t an abundance of reputable tech accessory brands on Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536976/amazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon"&gt;with RavPower being among the latest to be delisted for fraudulent reviews&lt;/a&gt;. But Anker products are still available, and some of them are even discounted today. In this assortment, there are portable power banks, power banks that are also wall adapters, a wireless charger, Lightning cable bundles, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jSIUhd"&gt;Moving on to other deals, the unlocked version of Microsoft’s Surface Duo is still seeing fantastic price drops at Amazon. The folding phone with 256GB of storage (and compatibility with Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile) &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J3N1R8C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $732&lt;/a&gt;, down from $1,500. It costs about $50 less for the model with 128GB of storage. Frustratingly, the Surface Duo is still on Android 10 software, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366636/microsoft-surface-duo-android-updates-three-years-support-security"&gt;Microsoft promised three years of OS and security updates after launch&lt;/a&gt;. Whether you believe they’ll follow through or not, it could still be a good option for you if you want to multitask to your heart’s content or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22450941/microsoft-surface-duo-xbox-mobile-xcloud-cloud-gaming-dual-screen"&gt;do a bit of handheld xCloud gaming on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Veq2vk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10497909"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wsdbHH"&gt;I alluded to it earlier, but Prime Day 2021 is coming up fast, happening Monday, June 21st just after Father’s Day. We’re busy behind the scenes getting things ready, but we put together &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/22533316/prime-day-early-deals-tech-headphones-tvs-echo-dot-show-luna"&gt;a list of the best early deals&lt;/a&gt; that you can get right now — but only if you have a Prime membership. As you might expect, these deals focus mostly on Amazon’s own products, but definitely keep an eye out for new deals first thing next week, which will feature price cuts for way more brands. Here’s a tease of the best early deals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T1ruPM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Why it took Nintendo 15 years to make Metroid Dread</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OwWJc6esQdATmsHXiZJSjhJrjSs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465956/MD_Movie_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wc7Lyy"&gt;Around 15 years ago, Yoshio Sakamoto had an idea for the next mainline &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; game. Called &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt;, the game would feature longtime protagonist Samus Aran constantly pursued by some kind of all-powerful force. The idea was to instill fear in players with an enemy they couldn’t defeat. This was the same time that the Nintendo DS was becoming a breakout hit, but Sakamoto soon realized that the handheld wasn’t powerful enough for his ideas. “It was difficult to realize that concept with that hardware,” he said recently during a meeting with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="1t0lec"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:645329"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5uYF6d"&gt;Development on &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; stopped and started a few times due to these technical limitations, before eventually being shelved indefinitely. “We had put it on hold,” Sakamoto explains. Which is what made this year’s announcement at E3 such a surprise: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22466240/nintendo-metroid-dread-side-scroller-e3-2021-switch"&gt;not only is &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt; real&lt;/a&gt;, it’s coming to the Switch on October 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGr5Qo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; is the fifth main entry in the franchise — it was initially titled &lt;em&gt;Metroid 5&lt;/em&gt; during the E3 reveal — and the first since &lt;em&gt;Metroid Fusion&lt;/em&gt; in 2002. Like its predecessors, it’s a 2D side-scroller that combines action and exploration. Not only will Samus have to fight off hostile aliens but also find her way through a labyrinth-like planet full of secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MO2But"&gt;The main twist are new robots called E.M.M.I., predatory creatures that Samus isn’t strong enough to fight, forcing her to hide. They add an almost horror-like element to the game; Samus will have to be silent around them and can make use of technologies like a cloaking field to remain invisible. “I wanted to create something that was unsettling for players, and also would communicate this unfeeling-ness that’s inherent in something that’s robotic,” Sakamoto says of the machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tfAAUd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8NjCICl7dDo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nVh7fd"&gt;Sakamoto is serving as producer on &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt;, and he says that the time was finally right for a few reasons. One was more powerful hardware in the form of the Switch. The other is a partner. In 2017, Nintendo launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16291350/metroid-samus-returns-review-nintendo-3ds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid: Samus Returns&lt;/em&gt; on the 3DS&lt;/a&gt;, a remake of the Game Boy title &lt;em&gt;Metroid II&lt;/em&gt;. Development was handled primarily by Spanish studio Mercury Steam. “The reason that I actually met with them was in the hope that they’d be able to realize the concepts that I had for &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread,&lt;/em&gt;” Sakamoto explains. “In meeting with them, I got the sense that they were a team that we could work together with towards a singular concept, and realize this goal that I had in mind for &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwrFva"&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;Samus Returns&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; features 2D gameplay with 3D visuals, as well as much more fluid movement compared to earlier &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; games. Samus is quick and nimble, able to slide around and use counterattacks. She even has free aim like in &lt;em&gt;Samus Returns&lt;/em&gt;. Meanwhile, from the live gameplay demo I watched, the E.M.M.I. robots are appropriately terrifying, hunting down Samus with cold, calculated precision. For Sakamoto, watching it all come together so smoothly has almost made the long wait to realize his vision worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYXm75"&gt;“It’s really better than I imagined those 15 years ago when I had the idea for this,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat will let developers put their apps inside its TikTok copycat Spotlight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_9d6CHauSkcnDmMT1QVI7bNLDk=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465949/snapchatspotlight.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snapchat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D7VtyQ"&gt;Snapchat is making it easier for developers to use viral content to directly promote their apps. Today, it’s launching Creative Kit for Spotlight, which will allow app developers to give users the power to publish directly to Snapchat’s TikTok rival, Spotlight. At the same time, Snapchat users can browse content made on those apps and then easily navigate to download them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJjdxo"&gt;It’s a win-win for both parties: Snapchat gains more content on its platform while developers are rewarded with additional downloads if an effect or tool they launch goes viral. Developers can also set up hashtag topics that’ll tag this content, so they can track how well it’s doing, and viewers can see everything made with that effect. Snap says it won’t take any sort of cut from developers, even if their app requires a purchase to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JzEYhj"&gt;Initial partners include Videoleap and Beatleap by &lt;a href="https://www.lightricks.com/"&gt;Lightricks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsplice.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22536936%2Fsnapchat-spotlight-app-developers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Splice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://powder.gg/"&gt;Powder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/pinata-farms/id1461925824"&gt;Piñata Farms&lt;/a&gt;, among others. All these apps involve creation tools, and clearly, this is so people discover the app on the content it helped make — a real advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTYZ1z"&gt;Although this is just the start of apps using Snapchat as a distributor, it has the potential to send a sizable number of downloads their way — just like how Snapchat’s user base tends to pop when a particular filter goes viral. In 2019, Snap &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20707569/snapchat-snap-earnings-users-added-filter-gender-swap"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; between 7 and 9 million users joined its platform because of viral face filters, like one that made them look like babies. That same thing could happen for an app, which, in the long term, could change the dynamics between developers and traditional app stores.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Fluid Office documents are coming to life in Teams, OneNote, and more</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9LFEtR"&gt;The biggest change to Microsoft’s Office documents in decades is coming to life soon, as the company’s Fluid framework arrives in Microsoft Teams, OneNote, Outlook, and Whiteboard. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21260005/microsoft-office-fluid-web-document-features-build"&gt;first unveiled Fluid&lt;/a&gt; last year, showing how the framework allows blocks of Office content to live independently across the web. That idea is now becoming a reality, with collaborative content that can be copied, pasted, and shared with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sb75Gu"&gt;Instead of tables, graphs, and lists that are static and bound to specific documents, Fluid components are collaborative modules that exist across different applications. They will begin showing up in Microsoft Teams first this summer, embeddable in meetings and chats. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sOQkf-KVaQ-0GX0WqpULlkzyB8k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664522/fluidcomponents.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Fluid components roam across multiple apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gyaHIc"&gt;The launch of Fluid documents coincides with employees returning to their offices and the rise of a new hybrid work experience. “We were excited about going hard and fast with Fluid, and then the pandemic hit,” says Jared Spataro, head of Microsoft 365, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge. “&lt;/em&gt;So we largely put a lot of our energy onto Teams, and we think of Teams as the scaffolding that creates the connection, but now as we move back to hybrid, we increasingly believe we need more innovation in what I call the canvas that gets collaboration done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBlmxa"&gt;What Microsoft has created with Fluid is the biggest change to Office in decades. While Fluid seemed like a great future-facing concept &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21260005/microsoft-office-fluid-web-document-features-build"&gt;during its reveal last year&lt;/a&gt;, watching Microsoft demonstrate it this week has really highlighted how transformative this could be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohD5Fs"&gt;Every Microsoft Teams meeting will soon come with a built-in notes experience that’s collaborative. Notes will show up within a Teams meeting or in an Outlook calendar, and anyone on the invite can just start typing away in real time. If you add a task, it immediately syncs to your other tasks across Microsoft 365, and the meeting notes are automatically synced to your Outlook calendar where you can also edit them in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m-Mvc1AQlk-IDKrHBQuq6ezIN6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664532/fluidbeforemeetings.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fluid will work in meeting agendas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jyuvTT"&gt;“We want collaboration to be able to start before the meeting starts, so as soon as the invite goes out,” explains Ron Pessner, a director of program management working on Fluid at Microsoft. As the meeting notes in this particular example are live and real time, you can even copy them into an app like OneNote and you’ll still see everyone making edits to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GHDGk"&gt;This living Fluid component has the potential to shift how everyone gets work done across Microsoft Teams and Office. It’s impressively quick, with no sync time, just like Google Docs. Microsoft has had similar collaboration tools in Office for a while now, but they’ve been restricted to static documents and nothing on this level of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ncr52R"&gt;“We’re going to be launching the components in Teams this summer,” says Pessner. The meeting notes experience will be available in preview later this year, alongside some tests integrating it into the desktop version of Outlook. It’s likely as we see Fluid components roll out, they’ll appear first in Teams and on the web parts of Office before making their way to desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SQqnZYP4C1iz0drlHdTI6W8v9tM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664518/Whiteboard.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s updated Whiteboard app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q6M4Yn"&gt;Microsoft is also transforming its Whiteboard app into a canvas to host Fluid components. Whiteboard has long existed as Microsoft’s first big collaborative tool, and this summer it’s being overhauled with the help of Fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZDfKy"&gt;New collaboration cursors will appear in Whiteboard, letting you see coworkers’ additions to a document in real time. There’s even a new virtual laser pointer that you can use to get people’s attention, or reaction stickers to make the Whiteboard canvas feel a little more alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cWUVpO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/np9Tl-VcH3Q?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JdJHrD"&gt;Fluid components like tables or task lists can also be embedded into Whiteboard, and the entire app will now look and feel the same across all devices and platforms. With Whiteboard, you could almost use the app as a dashboard to watch colleagues editing Fluid components in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IMPOC"&gt;This is just the start of Fluid making its way to Microsoft 365, and we’re bound to see more over the course of this year and beyond. It will be particularly interesting to see how Microsoft integrates Fluid more deeply into both Teams and Outlook, the main communications tools used by businesses that rely on the Office suite. If Microsoft gets the integration of Fluid right, it will forever change the way documents are created, shared, and, ultimately, how work gets done.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams’ new front row layout arrives later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iaABIsgdGXr4kaRkjMuTRyD3dAc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465955/New_Content_Layout_for_Microsoft_Teams_Rooms_Front_Row_Give_participants_a_greater_sense_of_connection_with_Remote_attendees..0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams’ new front row layout.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RFUbPw"&gt;Microsoft has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447048/microsoft-teams-future-meetings-features"&gt;teasing its vision&lt;/a&gt; for the future of Teams meetings recently, and it’s now committing to making parts of it a reality this year. Front row is the official name for the new Microsoft Teams layout, which includes methods designed to bridge the hybrid work gap between those physically present in a meeting and remote participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5utVq"&gt;“Visually, this new layout moves the video gallery to the bottom of the screen so in-room participants can see remote colleagues face to face across a horizontal plane–similar to if they were in the same room,” explains Jared Spataro, head of Microsoft 365.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gM2CgqjJwtxx1bfk7hkVqUpJQws=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664544/New_Teams_Rooms_Video_Layout_Lets_People_Participate_on_Equal_Footing.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Front row is designed to improve hybrid work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6rAaxH"&gt;Microsoft will be using its new Fluid components to power this layout, with things like agenda, tasks, and notes all collaborative and updated in real time. The meeting chat will also be highly visible in this view, giving everyone equal footing to participate in the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5OS25"&gt;Alongside this new view, Microsoft is also tweaking how it manages video calls in Teams. New video layouts for Teams Rooms will utilize the larger screen real estate of monitors and screens typically found in meeting rooms to highlight remote participants more clearly. A similar redesign is coming to Teams on Surface Hub, too. A new meeting canvas with chat bubbles, live reactions, and all the latest Teams features will enter preview later this month for Surface Hub owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDKsbm"&gt;Microsoft Teams will also be updated with the new Whiteboard design that’s coming this summer. You can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22302185"&gt;read more about Microsoft’s Fluid components and Whiteboard plans here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
