    <title>AirPod Beanies bring back the infamous iPod Sock for a new generation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jT3MUK6RViekZh1ci_ayv2w8sEA=/0x26:1596x1090/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70047691/Screen_Shot_2021_10_26_at_12.17.24_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QBhx1W"&gt;The infamous iPod Sock is getting a successor of sorts from accessory company Native Union, in the form of the “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nativeunion.com%2Fproducts%2Fairpods-beanies&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F26%2F22746794%2Fairpod-beanies-apple-ipod-sock-native-union" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Beanies&lt;/a&gt;” — a cozy knit case where you can put your AirPods’ existing case for an added layer of protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlXMhG"&gt;For those of you who are a bit lost right now, a quick piece of history. Of all the products that Apple has made over the years, the iPod Sock definitely is one of them: a set of six colorful, two-tone knit sleeves that were designed to fit Apple’s various iPods for both style and protection. A bizarre piece of Apple’s history on par with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733198/apple-polishing-cloth-clean-devices"&gt;recent $20 screen cleaning cloth&lt;/a&gt;, the iPod Socks sold for the rather expensive (for socks) price of $29 for a pack of six. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sWeZzZKusvrRuuY7UmNXPrS9FhY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956843/Screen_Shot_2021_10_26_at_12.19.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original iPod Socks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3PUfPo"&gt;But thanks to their relatively universal size (because, again, they were basically just knit socks) and bright colors, the iPod Socks were relatively popular and stayed on shelves for almost a decade before Apple discontinued the product in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Yu8P8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nativeunion.com%2Fblogs%2Fnative-union-journal%2Fa-trip-down-memory-lane&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F26%2F22746794%2Fairpod-beanies-apple-ipod-sock-native-union" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Native Union’s remake&lt;/a&gt; aims to emulate the overall style of the original iPod Sock, with the chunky ribbed knitting, two-tone color scheme, and even the tag at the corner (albeit with the company’s logo instead of the Apple and iPod marks). Native Union has also updated the size, making them more appropriate for AirPods cases (more diminutive than iPods) and updated the hues for a trendier pastel lineup. The company also assures that the AirPod Beanies won’t impact wireless Qi charging and that they’ll universally fit all of Apple’s earbud cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VtOXJQ"&gt;The Native Union AirPod Beanies are sold in a pack of four for $19.99 and are available now from its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApjQlb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Seagate violated sanctions by selling hard drives to Huawei, says Senate committee</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Seagate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZnyDyooPZfAq5AdVwscMXC0lUI=/0x0:5300x3533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70047528/1010166416.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WPyuGg"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/437DD8B6-1F71-4BBF-ADB3-BC0B89C1CC1A"&gt;US Senate committee says&lt;/a&gt; manufacturer Seagate likely violated government sanctions by shipping hard drives to Chinese manufacturer Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nojpV"&gt;The Republican minority staff of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation released a report alleging Seagate ignored &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/17/tech/huawei-us-sanctions-hnk-intl/index.html"&gt;August 2020 restrictions&lt;/a&gt; on shipping semiconductor components to Huawei — a category the report alleges “likely includes hard disk drives.” The report orders Seagate to stop shipments to Huawei and urges the US Commerce Department to “prioritize” enforcement of the sanctions, which the Trump administration implemented after claiming Huawei &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/22/18634401/huawei-ban-trump-case-infrastructure-fears-google-microsoft-arm-security"&gt;posed a national security threat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0v5bCS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Seagate said in 2020 that the sanctions shouldn’t disrupt its shipments&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NlDzMg"&gt;Huawei has used Seagate, Western Digital, and Toshiba hard drives for its &lt;a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/09/09/huaweis-extraordinary-enterprise-storage-growth-rate-set-to-peak/"&gt;growing external storage business&lt;/a&gt;. The report says Western Digital and Toshiba ceased shipments after the sanctions, which banned companies that operate in the US from selling some products to Huawei without a license. But &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/the-curious-case-of-storage-devices-and-huawei"&gt;Seagate said&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 that it didn’t believe it needed such a license for its hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rcv8Te"&gt;Congressional Republicans publicly &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-senator-asks-firms-about-sales-hard-disk-drives-huawei-2021-05-11/"&gt;grilled hard drive companies&lt;/a&gt; about Huawei earlier this year. The report says that Seagate officials confirmed in October 2021 that it hadn’t applied for a license to sell to Huawei, and while the officials said they had stopped shipping hard drives to Huawei, they didn’t say exactly when the shipments had stopped. Citing documents and industry reports, the report concludes it was “common knowledge within the storage industry” that Seagate continued them well after the August rules took effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32o7TK"&gt;The report claims Seagate reaped a windfall by ignoring the sanctions on Huawei. “Seagate’s stock has increased nearly 86 percent since the rule went into effect,” the report notes. “The initial incline began around October 2020, soon after the effective date, as Seagate purportedly continued shipments to Huawei as its sole American supplier of hard disk drives.” It also concedes that the chip shortage may have raised stock prices across the board, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZFltZ"&gt;A Seagate spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/seagate-broke-export-curbs-by-supplying-huawei-senate-republicans-say-11635254101"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company “complies with all laws applicable to its business and operations, including export control regulations.” It declined to comment specifically on its relationship with Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZgE2Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM will start making Chevy Bolts again on November 1st</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5CUlQWU-wmYYRh2ic8mUeVMFhPo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70047439/akrales_170313_1481_A_0069.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Cm0Pw"&gt;General Motors will start making Chevy Bolts again on November 1st, after shutting down production in late August following a global recall of the electric vehicle due to battery fire risk. The production restart at the company’s Orion assembly plant in Michigan will last for at least two weeks, &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/gm-resume-limited-2022-chevy-bolt-production-mich-plant?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, though GM isn’t saying what will happen after that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSanX8"&gt;The production restart will come just a few weeks after GM announced that battery supplier LG agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722317/chevy-bolt-recall-paid-lg-electronics-gm-costs"&gt;foot the $2 billion bill for the recall&lt;/a&gt;. And it comes at a time when global supply chain shortages have most of the auto industry dealing with way more customer demand than it can handle — which has also been driving &lt;a href="https://europe.autonews.com/sales-market/global-ev-sales-boosted-europe-china-chip-shortage-analyst-firm-says"&gt;more people than usual to buy EVs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jwEqsQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM recalled all Chevy Bolts ever made in August&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QL0npG"&gt;GM first issued a recall for 2017 to 2019 model year Bolts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; after a handful of reports of battery fires. It announced a purported preventative fix for the problem in May 2021, which involved installing software that would monitor for early signs of a fire in the battery pack. But by July, two more vehicles caught fire that had the new software, causing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590210/chevy-bolt-new-recall-battery-defect-fire-risk-fix"&gt;GM to recall those same Bolts again&lt;/a&gt;. In August, GM recalled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634721/gm-recall-chevrolet-bolt-battery-fire-fix-problems"&gt;all model year Bolts&lt;/a&gt; — including the two new versions that hit the market this year — as it worked with LG to fix the underlying problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wz7nc0"&gt;That problem had to do with the manufacturing process of the LG batteries that power the Bolt, which was making it possible for two specific defects to appear simultaneously in the cells. If and when those two defects are present, the risk of a fire goes way up, especially for owners who repeatedly drain the battery to almost zero and charge back up all the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5qhhyW"&gt;GM and LG started making what they believe are defect-free battery modules earlier this month. Most of them are earmarked for replacing the modules in the 140,000-plus recalled Bolts, but Tuesday’s announcement could be a sign that the companies are getting closer to having enough batteries to handle the recall while also getting the 2022 Bolt and Bolt EUV back on dealer lots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mg3TgC"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Let’s discuss how we’re reviewing the 2021 MacBook Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New MacBook Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yeTrLJK_8hXfnuq2KUKW75Ms_zc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70047367/akrales_211020_4803_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MvWd3T"&gt;It is morning. The birds are chirping, a coffee percolator is bubbling, keyboards are clacking, and an Apple startup chime is ringing. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Dieter Bohn, Nilay Patel, and Monica Chin are also walking into the recording studio to chat about the new iteration of &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ijMxKKdfSBM"&gt;Apple’s MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmCGxS"&gt;And that is what you can listen to today. On Tuesdays for the remainder of the year, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s flagship podcast &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will be featuring additional new episodes, with each focused on a specific topic usually discussed on our regular Friday shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DVBf9o"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP5619071766&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ok5W64"&gt;On a typical &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, you may hear a bit about the behind-the-scenes activity that goes along with reviewing something like the iPhone or a VR headset. Today’s show dedicates a morning to pulling back that curtain to share what we’re thinking about when reviewing a new product for &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FvJ2iC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744023/macbook-pro-2021-m1-pro-m1-max-impressions"&gt;The 2021 MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; is a great subject for this sort of discussion. Everything is redesigned, including the body, the keyboard, the screen, the camera, the processor, and one could even argue the ports. There’s a narrative we’re seeing where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733328/apple-macbook-pro-ports-professional-specs"&gt;Apple listened to some complaints&lt;/a&gt; and needs of their customers. It’s also a good example of how emotional of a journey it is to test battery life on devices lately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAAkwC"&gt;In this episode, you’ll hear Monica, Nilay, and Dieter walk through their approach to reviews— from finding the angle, to testing, to figuring out an accurate score — all in the context of Apple’s newest laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0zQGu"&gt;You can listen here or in your preferred podcast player for the full discussion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One of our favorite budget webcams is 40 percent off right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Modern Webcam" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2DXdA23cX-Av9VpVMF03zi2rO5k=/20x0:2020x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70047353/akrales_210831_4734_0069.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Microsoft Modern Webcam features HDR and a modest design that looks subtle atop a monitor.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vk1AFM"&gt;We may still be living day to day with supply constraints, chip shortages, and shipping delays, but we’re thankfully past the time of scalped prices for webcams as folks quickly shifted to working from home and Zoom-everything. Now there are even some great deals on a pair of webcams ripped right from our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652783/best-webcam-camera"&gt;best webcams&lt;/a&gt;: the Microsoft Modern Webcam and the Logitech C920S Pro HD Webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxEHBa"&gt;Microsoft’s Modern Webcam is seeing the bigger discount, with a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedailydeal102621&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fmicrosoft-modern-webcam%2F8v9brt858dg8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$28 discount direct from the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; knocking the price to just $42, down from its usual $70. This is the lowest price around for this small webcam, which features a built-in privacy shade that easily slides over the lens. The Modern Webcam is perfect for any Windows 10 or 11 user, with 1080p resolution at 30 frames per second and nicer color fidelity thanks to HDR. Support for macOS is possible, but only for video as the microphone is off by default and requires Windows software to activate it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fWR7l8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730545"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GhuaYv"&gt;Our next webcam may not be receiving as big of a discount, but we consider it to be the best webcam for most people in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652783/best-webcam-camera"&gt;our buying guide&lt;/a&gt; and it’s available at a discount from more retailers. The Logitech C920S Pro HD Webcam is currently $10 off at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRWp34rDB9" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flogitech-c920s-pro-hd-webcam%2F-%2FA-76168087&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals102621" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fwebcams%2Fc920s-pro-hd-webcam.960-001257.html&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals102621" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;direct from Logitech&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $60. It also features 1080p resolution at 30fps output and helps brighten up any dimly lit environments. It comes with a detachable privacy shade, dual microphones for improved audio, and full macOS support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cc9WVe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730538"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="78iYYN"&gt;Now, moving from the streaming of your face on video calls to the streaming you might prefer: on your TV. Roku’s Streaming Stick 4K, complete with HDR and Dolby Vision, is just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09BKCDXZC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$40 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now. That’s $10 off, saving you 20 percent off the regular list price. The Roku Streaming Stick 4K is small enough to hide behind your TV and its simple remote supports voice control. For added flexibility, the stick is also compatible with Apple’s AirPlay for direct streaming, and for added performance, the USB power cable contains a 802.11ac MIMO dual-band Wi-Fi receiver. Roku bills this as long-range Wi-Fi, so the Streaming Stick 4K should maintain a better signal when used in the further reaches of your home. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="khvs6y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g9mtLb"&gt;When it comes to the smart home, sometimes it is more efficient to smarten up a “dumb” appliance than to invest in a whole new product. Thankfully, this bundle containing a Google Nest Mini and a GE Smart Plug does just that. With the second-gen smart speaker, you can use Google Assistant to control power to whatever you plug into the smart plug. You can give any old lamp a smart timer, or allow your router to power cycle without having to walk up to it — or better yet, your in-laws’ router (we’ve all been there). Google’s pint-sized Mini doesn’t sound great, but it’s significantly better when mounted to a wall. For a limited time, &lt;a href="https://lowes.sjv.io/c/482924/897039/12374?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lowes.com%2Fpd%2FGoogle-Nest-Mini-2nd-Gen-Google-Assistant-in-Chalk-Smart-Plug-Bundle%2F1003163360&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals102621" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lowe’s is offering the convenient bundle for just $25&lt;/a&gt;, which is a steal compared to its retail price of $60. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our second-gen Google Nest &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/smart-home-reviews/nest-mini-review-2/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mini review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden appoints Jessica Rosenworcel to lead the FCC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="FCC Hearing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aeYBMbaZFnF3CQqnitE2mF3wVk4=/0x1:5501x3668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70047341/1144011213.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="73g4KE"&gt;President Joe Biden named acting Federal Communications Commissioner Chair &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183201/fcc-commissioner-coronavirus-pandemic-connectivity-homework-gap-vergecast"&gt;Jessica Rosenworcel&lt;/a&gt; to officially head the agency on Tuesday, propping her up as the administration’s leader to tackle broadband expansion and net neutrality. Biden also nominated progressive advocate Gigi Sohn as the third Democrat for the bench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZ2BLp"&gt;The decision comes late into Biden’s term, beating out both former presidents Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon who nominated their FCC chairs well into September of their first years. If confirmed by the Senate before December, the FCC’s 2-2 deadlock would end and provide Democrats with a majority to push forward Biden’s telecom agenda. But it’s unclear if senators plan to move on Rosenworcel and Sohn’s confirmations before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HHGXs"&gt;Without a majority, current Democratic commissioners Rosenworcel and Geoffrey Starks have their hands tied when it comes to implementing Biden’s agenda. In July, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569869/biden-executive-order-right-to-repair-isps-net-neutrality"&gt;Biden signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; urging the FCC to restore Obama-era net neutrality rules and to take up other measures to promote broadband competition, including requiring companies to provide transparency into pricing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UCf9VV"&gt;Both Rosenworcel and Sohn broadly support the reinstitution of net neutrality. Sohn, who founded the left-leaning tech non-profit Public Knowledge, previously advised former Chair Tom Wheeler during the initial net neutrality fight. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22391609/net-neutrality-ed-markey-live-event-sign-up-broadband-infrastructure"&gt;At a May &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;, Sohn suggested that the FCC regulate broadband even further under new net neutrality rules, urging the agency to enforce new pricing principles and make it easier for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397778/biden-infrastructure-broadband-digital-divide-municipal-networks-republicans"&gt;states and localities to build out&lt;/a&gt; their own broadband networks to compete with larger providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRCE1T"&gt;Rosenworcel and Sohn have butt heads before on certain broadband and cable policy measures. In one instance, Rosenworcel cast a tie-breaking vote to shut down an Obama-era attempt to make the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/18/11046948/fcc-cable-box-set-top-vote"&gt;cable set-top box marketplace&lt;/a&gt; more competitive. Sohn was one of the primary backers of this policy initiative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5ubUF"&gt;Over the last year, numerous lawmakers and civil society organizations have led letters and campaigns supporting both Rosenworcel and Sohn to head the agency. In July, &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/regulatory/fcc-composition-remains-murkier-than-ever-says-nsr-analyst"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fierce Wireless &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Sohn was initially in the running to lead the agency, but her nomination was later pulled after reportedly being met with intense Senate opposition. In September, over two dozen senators &lt;a href="https://tcpaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rosenworcel-Support-Letter.pdf"&gt;penned a letter to Biden&lt;/a&gt; calling on him to appoint Rosenworcel as permanent chair. The letter was signed primarily by Democrats, but notably, more progressive senators, like Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Ed Markey (D-MA), were not included. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuBOMc"&gt;Sohn’s nomination to be commissioner is still a welcome gesture to progressives who have seen significant wins at ancillary agencies like the Federal Trade Commission over the last year. Biden previously appointed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;tech antitrust pioneer Lina Khan&lt;/a&gt; to lead the FTC and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315224/tim-wu-net-neutrality-antitrust-big-tech-biden-administration-national-economic-council"&gt;hired Tim Wu&lt;/a&gt;, a net neutrality and tech antitrust advocate, as a top economic adviser in the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bb4GsO"&gt;As Rosenworcel and Sohn’s nominations progress, Republicans will likely use future confirmation hearings to cast doubt on the administration’s plans to reimplement net neutrality. Since the Trump FCC, under Chairman Ajit Pai’s leadership, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/11/17439456/net-neutrality-dead-ajit-pai-fcc-internet"&gt;rolled back the rules in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, conservatives have argued that rulemaking never led to any nightmare scenarios previously predicted by Democrats and progressives. These include ISPs like AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon blocking certain lanes of traffic for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTRARd"&gt;In October 2019, a federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20898779/fcc-net-neutrality-court-of-appeals-decision-ruling"&gt;upheld the Pai FCC’s decision&lt;/a&gt; to roll back net neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 695 is a faster mid-tier 5G chip </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1B47So8WeprgfbhVA4f5tvv-msE=/429x0:7179x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70047174/QRD_4_pack_version_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0YuLPV"&gt;Qualcomm is announcing a pile of new Snapdragon chips today across its mid- and entry-level product lineups: the Snapdragon 778 Plus, 695, 680, and 480 Plus, offering more options to device manufacturers when it comes to picking the best processor for a phone — and, in theory, more choice for customers when they’re looking to buy one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmwdyA"&gt;The most notable new chip is the Snapdragon 695, which replaces the Snapdragon 690 in Qualcomm’s lineup. Unlike the old model, the Snapdragon 695 will support both mmWave and sub-6GHz versions of 5G, which should help improve data speeds even on cheaper phones (which have thus far tended to skip out on offering mmWave support). There’s also a  considerable boost in performance: Qualcomm promises a 15-percent improvement in CPU performance and up to 30 percent faster graphics rendering compared to the 690. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aHBHoZ-Yq7XABrPd_RkEMPbGILs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956497/QRD_4_pack_version_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kQ7CQr"&gt;There’s also the curious addition of the Snapdragon 680 — a new LTE-only SoC that’s built on the same, more modern 6nm process as the 695. It’s not quite up to par with the new 5G chip that Qualcomm announced, but rather is intended to help fill the gap in Qualcomm’s lineup for companies that still are looking for 4G-only devices (which can help cut costs in regions that don’t have 5G deployments yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JBVQM"&gt;The other two chips are refreshed versions of existing modes. There’s the Snapdragon 778G Plus, an enhanced version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442830/qualcomm-snapdragon-778g-5g-m-2-reference-design"&gt;standard 778G model&lt;/a&gt; that the company announced earlier this year, and the Snapdragon 480 Plus, which upgrades the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;existing Snapdragon 480&lt;/a&gt;. Both models promise boosted performance compared to their non-plus counterparts, although the gains are small. The 778G Plus, for example, sees its CPU go from 2.4GHz to 2.5GHz, while 480 Plus boosts clock speed from 2.0GHz to 2.2GHz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1hK5k"&gt;The four new chip platforms are all expected to launch later in Q4 2021, with partners HMD, Honor, Motorola, Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi all expressing interest in using at least some of the new Snapdragon chips. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft working on Windows 11 SE and low-cost Surface Laptop to take on Chromebooks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X9u18OHcv4JYO_Zgyacz1BMVvd8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70047073/akrales_170502_1637_0519.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XnwgJx"&gt;Microsoft is about to compete even more directly with Chromebooks. The software giant is reportedly preparing to launch a new low-cost Surface Laptop aimed at education markets, specifically K-12, alongside a new edition of Windows 11 named Windows 11 SE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmwPq5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-building-116-inch-low-cost-laptop-designed-k-12-education-markets"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the upcoming Surface Laptop could also be named Surface Laptop SE and will likely include an 11.6-inch (1366 x 768) display, with Intel’s N4120 Celeron processor and up to 8GB of RAM. This budget laptop is designed for K-12 students and to be as low cost as possible, with a single USB-A and USB-C port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KsobE3"&gt;While Microsoft has used the SE moniker for Windows versions before (hello Windows 98 SE), Windows 11 SE won’t be a second edition of Windows 11. Instead, it’s expected to be more like the S versions of Windows 10, which are designed for low-cost devices to compete with Chromebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n-K50kGaY2W9vNQi0NQDssZ26oc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11932071/vpavic_180803_2796_0088.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Go was designed for education, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O1PXRj"&gt;If this edition of Windows 11 is truly aimed at the education market, then it may need to borrow some of the ease of use features from Chrome OS. While Microsoft has been trying to compete with Chromebooks for years, Windows still lacks a simple way for educators to wipe and reuse laptops for classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4Z06i"&gt;It’s not clear when Microsoft plans to launch this new Surface Laptop, nor Windows 11 SE. &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t offer any dates on when to expect a potential announcement or launch. Microsoft previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/7/17657174/microsoft-surface-go-review-tablet-windows-10"&gt;launched the Surface Go&lt;/a&gt; with S Mode, and it was aimed at the education market starting at $399 without the necessary $99 keyboard. It sounds like this Surface Laptop SE will be hitting a price point below $400 to compete with Dell, Lenovo, and HP that all ship similar Chromebook-like devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Kids’ new monetization policy could defund consumeristic videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N1swq_OHwPERLFsYRvkrBhympAs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70046925/acastro_180202_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P85I9Q"&gt;YouTube is making it harder for kids’ videos that it deems “low quality” to qualify for monetization (via &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-low-quality-demonetization-kids-video-194733880.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The platform outlined its updated policies &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/our-responsibility-approach-protecting-kids-and-families-youtube/"&gt;in a post on the YouTube Blog&lt;/a&gt;, noting that channels with “made for kids” content will need to abide by &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392#kids-quality&amp;amp;zippy=%2Cquality-principles-for-kids-and-family-content"&gt;a stricter set of guidelines&lt;/a&gt; if they want to stay in the YouTube Partnership Program (YPP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rqd41d"&gt;Its policies are meant to discourage kids’ content creators from pushing out videos that it describes as “heavily commercial or promotional” or if it encourages “negative behavior or attitudes.” If a channel violates these guidelines, YouTube may suspend them from YPP. Meanwhile, any individual videos that break the rules will lose advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KHMgv1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If a channel is found to have a strong focus on low-quality ‘made for kids’ content, it may be suspended from the YouTube Partner Program”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HMtb7N"&gt;YouTube’s new guidelines could impact a number of channels, including one of the biggest kids’ channels on YouTube: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChGJGhZ9SOOHvBB0Y4DOO_w"&gt;Ryan’s World&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14031288/ryan-toys-review-biggest-youngest-youtube-star-millions"&gt;Ryan Kaji is a 10-year-old YouTuber&lt;/a&gt; whose videos garner millions of views. At this time of writing, his channel currently has 30.8 million subscribers. Kaji’s massive popularity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575169/youtube-ryan-world-amazon-show-animated-nickelodeon-ott-streaming"&gt;has landed him a show on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22152447/ryans-world-roblox-level-youtube-ryan-kaji"&gt;a virtual world on Roblox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5LcWm"&gt;A large number of Kaji’s videos revolve around unboxing toys, as well as showing off toys that Kaji has helped create. It’s definitely what one would describe as “consumeristic” — which is what YouTube says it’s trying to cut down on. YouTube says that it has “reached out to potentially impacted creators” to help them prepare before the policies go into effect in November. If Ryan’s World wants to remain one of the most popular YouTube channels for kids, it may need to make major adjustments to the kind of content it puts out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gFsuai"&gt;The most recent major change to kid-focused content took place in early 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21051465/youtube-coppa-children-content-gaming-toys-monetization-ads"&gt;when YouTube banned targeted advertising, comments, and some community features&lt;/a&gt; for kids’ videos. Just this February, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298179/youtube-supervised-experiences-content-levels-children-parents"&gt;YouTube rolled out “supervised experiences”&lt;/a&gt; to help parents gain more control of what their older children watch.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;You will punch your way to a much higher heart rate. | Supernatural&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bCt7cJ"&gt;Supernatural, the &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;-like VR app for the Oculus Quest and Quest 2 that gets you to work up a sweat by beating targets with virtual bats, has added another way to wreck a target: your fists. Boxing is the latest workout introduced on Supernatural and like the original bat-oriented “Flow” workout, it works up a sweat while being fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJeiqr"&gt;Supernatural Flow is sort of like &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt; crossed with high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Each workout can last from seven minutes to an hour, and there’s an enthusiastic coach shouting encouragements in your ear and guiding you through the session as you dance, lunge, squat, and murder targets with your VR bats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uD2SUm"&gt;The problem with Supernatural, at least for me, is that you can plateau. The workout, like HIIT, is hard on the knees and it's easy to get stuck doing workouts that get the heart rate up but don’t actually build your cardio health or muscle. I started cycling and lifting weights to push myself more and give my knees a rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UZnf3c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Is VR the next frontier in fitness?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22379859/vr-virtual-reality-fitness-work-out-supernatural-chris-milk-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Fqc5R4"&gt;Crucially, neither of those things were happening in the Supernatural app. Since Supernatural launched in April 2020, it’s added two additional workouts — Guided Meditation and Recover (stretching) — but they felt less like a reason to strap on the headset and dive in than the original Flow workout. Boxing, which launches today, is the third new workout and the first intended to get the heart pumping like the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hix5T5"&gt;VR boxing to get buff isn’t new. &lt;em&gt;Thrill of the Fight&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Knockout League&lt;/em&gt; on Oculus Quest both have enthusiastic fans who use them for cardio. But like &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber,&lt;/em&gt; those are games being used for working out. Boxing in Supernatural is very much a workout first. Black and white targets fly at your face and you’re meant to hit black targets with your left hand and white ones with your right. The targets look different depending on if you’re supposed to jab, uppercut, or toss a hook at them. Glowing bars twirl toward your face to force you to tilt left or right or do a full bob and weave to avoid them. The coach has you stretch for about thirty seconds to a minute both before and after the core workout. They also tell you when to change up your feet position to ensure you’re working out your left and right sides equally, and they tell you when to get ready to block a blow with both hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w5Urgi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mLBQWsX5bk4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aZgWx5"&gt;The workouts available before launch were limited to just 13 minutes max. After that first one, I told my co-workers it had given me a good sweat but hadn’t done much else due to how short the workout was. Then I woke up the next morning and my arms and shoulders called me an idiot. Heart rate-wise, the average beats per minute in the boxing workout were about 10bpm higher than in the regular Supernatural workout — and my knees didn’t get as angry with me. I could definitely see using this regularly as a warm-up before weight training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fkge4s"&gt;But I don’t know if this would be a good supplement for people who regularly box to keep fit. When I did a slower-paced low-intensity workout, I had no problem keeping great boxing form, but faster-paced workouts absolutely wrecked it. I went from feeling like I knew how to throw a punch to flailing like I was in a fight with my brother when I was 10. I didn’t miss a lot of targets, but I’m also positive my punches would have landed on a heavy bag like the gentle flutter of a butterfly wing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKIsJh"&gt;Thankfully, I have no interest in going to a boxing gym — heck, I don’t really want to go to a regular gym either. And Supernatural, despite its inability to stop bad boxing habits, gives me the feeling of a gym without all the smells and potential for COVID-19 exposure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVovFN"&gt;Boxing is available on Supernatural starting today. Supernatural is available for a free, month-long trial. After that, you’ll either need to pay $18.99 a month or $179 a year to get access to new workouts, which are available daily.&lt;/p&gt;
