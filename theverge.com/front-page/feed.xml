    <title>Philips Hue Wall Switch Module review: smart-ish, at last</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make any wall switch Hue-smart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="hSUqCE"&gt;You’ve undoubtedly run across taped light switches like the one pictured above if you’ve ever spent time in Airbnbs. Hell, maybe you have some of these in your own smart home. No judgement, we’ve all been there, which is why I just installed a Philips Hue Wall Switch Module in my own house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QO1dfW"&gt;Many smart home fans can trace their obsession back to the very first Hue lightbulbs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/29/3570322/philips-hue-led-customizable-bulb-apple-store-home-automation"&gt;launched back in 2012&lt;/a&gt; as an Apple Store exclusive. But Hue bulbs, like all smart bulbs, come with a few catches. First, they require a constant source of power to function. That means you’ll lose control over that fancy Hue bulb hanging above your kitchen table just as soon as someone flicks off the light switch. To solve this, many people disable the switch mechanism with tape or a dummy wall plate, only to realize that physical controls are useful when you or your housemates and guests can’t be bothered to yell a command or pull out a phone. So they buy a Hue remote control and tape it to the wall. This comedy of errors is then repeated over and over until they have a house full of mismatched wall switches and legitimate concerns about life priorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaGxVn"&gt;There’s a small cottage industry of aftermarket solutions for this, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18629735/lutron-aurora-dimmer-hue-lights-smart-price-specs-features"&gt;Lutron’s Aurora dimmer&lt;/a&gt; that sits on top of a light switch. But Philips has never addressed it directly, until now. The new $39.95 Hue Wall Switch Module solves these issues by making most existing wall switches Hue-smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tv5c2x"&gt;Note that I said &lt;em&gt;Hue-smart&lt;/em&gt;, not smart. That’s because the switch you rewire to the Hue Module can only control Hue lightbulbs, not regular inexpensive lights like other smart switches. Nevertheless, it caters to fans of both smart lights and smart switches by offering the benefits of both, so long as they can stomach the cost and ecosystem lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9KXlhr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10511587"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SixME4"&gt;The Wall Switch Module from Signify-owned Philips Hue is a much simpler device than it first appears. Basically, it’s a buttonless Zigbee remote control for Hue lights. You add buttons by wiring the Hue Module to a standard household light switch. The switch + Hue Module works as a Hue remote control whether tucked inside the wall or not since the Hue Module is powered by a single CR2450 coin battery (included). That allows you to make sure the Hue Module and switch are working properly with your Hue setup before connecting everything back to the wall. It also means that you’ll have to have to disassemble everything at some point in the future to replace the battery, but not for at least five years, according to Philips Hue. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ia7kqkI8HsJvLwtWuxr8s7TIkBo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530165/Hue_switch_test.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The battery-powered Hue module can be tested before installing it inside the wall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ssEW2e"&gt;I was able to install a Philips Wall Hue Switch Module behind the existing switch in my laundry room in about fifteen minutes. The steps were quite simple, but you’ll need enough empty space in the wiring box behind the switch to accommodate the 4.3 x 1.0 x 3.8 cm (0.51 x 0.39 x 1.5 inch) Hue Switch Module. You should also be comfortable working with household electricity — if not then find someone who is or call an electrician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kDAehj8XlCiz5ZpZdrVi-oInppQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530170/verge_IMG_7358_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything included with the Hue Wall Switch Module. It might look complicated but it’s not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eqbt5x3w1q7_ziGEQhTg6FB4ktE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530198/verge_IMG_7214__1__2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hue Switch Module wired to my wall switch and the old household wires rerouted into the orange wire connector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lvyeSK"&gt;Installation is straightforward with the help of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GC41Ws8c5Y"&gt;videos tutorials supplied by Philips Hue&lt;/a&gt;. After shutting off the power at my circuit breaker, I removed the switch assembly from the wall. I then disconnected the two electrical wires connected to my rocker switch and rerouted them into a tiny Hue-supplied wire connector to close the circuit and ensure my lightbulb socket is never without power. I then plugged a Hue-provided wire-pair into the Hue Module and back to the light switch at the same locations where the two household wires were removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9TSDz"&gt;The Hue Switch Module is added to the Hue app and Hue Bridge (required) like any Hue light or accessory. After assigning the Module to control the Hue bulb in my laundry room, all that was left was to tuck the Hue Switch Module into the wall box and remount the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRJQdb"&gt;The Hue Module can be assigned to control multiple Hue lights in a Hue-defined room or zone, or just one Hue bulb in my case. The switch can be set to function as a simple on/off, or to cycle through predefined Hue scenes assigned to one, two, or three presses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x7Vm4uZlmHgeMmkg00qlCj8ocPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530188/Hue_app_scenese.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hue app allows button presses to be assigned scenes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6JU0SY"&gt;Scenes didn’t work too well on my rocker switch since a “press” is only registered after both an on / off motion, meaning I’d have to toggle the switch up, down, up, down, up to toggle the scene assigned to the third press. And since my laundry room doesn’t require mood lighting anyway I went with the simple on / off toggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rL0nFe"&gt;The Philips Hue Wall Switch Module solves the issue of someone flipping the light switch and rendering the smart bulb useless. Although it does occasionally miss a beat causing the switch to reverse orientation. Over the weeks I’ve had it installed, I noticed that flipping the switch up turns the light on some days and off on others. That means the module failed to trigger the light somewhere along the way despite it being installed smack in the middle of my relatively small house which is blanketed in a strong Zigbee signal created by ten other Hue lights and plug-in accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l3r9NN"&gt;To test the failure rate I flipped the switch on and off 100 times with a one-second gap in between. The light failed to respond appropriately five times, translating to a failure rate of 5 percent. It’s not a big deal unless you’re a stickler in such matters. I for one, believe that when a switch is in the up position the light should always be on, just as toilet paper should be unrolled toward the user and bathmats are for drying wet feet. These things are not negotiable in my house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5MLPk"&gt;The Hue app also can’t be configured so that the Wall Switch Module automatically turns off a light after a set time period. That would be ideal for my laundry room, which is really a closet that’s only used a few minutes at a time to load and unload laundry. As such, after a few weeks I ended up adding a motion sensor from Aqara to the room to automatically turn off the light when motion is no longer detected. (You can also stick to the Hue ecosystem and use a more capable $39.99 Hue motion sensor instead.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkoiJQ"&gt;Other notables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jg82Gv"&gt;The module has two inputs allowing it to control two single switches or one unit with a double rocker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="b44jTP"&gt;The module also works with push-button switches which have the advantage of making lights dimmable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8UhgcC"&gt;The module turns the lights on and off smoothly, not suddenly with a flash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="G5bGoj"&gt;So, now I have a $14.99 Hue bulb, $39.95 Hue Wall Switch Module, and $15 motion sensor to replace the 99 cent LED bulb I was using previously. That’s a total cost of $70 to automate a simple task and save a bit of energy all because I failed to teach my kids how to turn off a $1 light bulb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8cKU6x"&gt;Was it worth it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vB69uA"&gt;That depends. If you’re like me, and you can afford to be irrationally excited about smart lighting and actually enjoy the hours spent configuring open-source tools like HomeBridge to run on a Raspberry Pi, then yes, it’s worth it. For everyone else it’s a bit complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4ecm6"&gt;The Philips Hue Wall Switch Module has the power to unite two opposing camps of home automators who, unsurprisingly, have serious religion when it comes to the primacy of smart bulbs vs. smart switches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSUwK7"&gt;Smart bulb zealots tout the control they have over the color and dimming options of their lights. Hue bulbs, for example, are compatible with Apple’s adaptive lighting feature allowing Hue lights to be automatically adjusted for cooler colors during the day and warmer colors at night. That’s nice, but there’s still that issue with switches killing the power. Smart switch zealots, meanwhile, enjoy an endless selection of inexpensive decorative faceplates and switch types to choose from, along with cheap standard bulbs. But they’re limited to toggling the power or dimming the light, not changing its color or discretely controlling different bulbs on the same circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DFUSuY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Hue Module is a bridge between smart lighting and smart switches, with benefits of both&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D0WmYr"&gt;The Hue Module neatly bridges these two worlds, offering the benefits of both. The downsides are some increased complexity for smart bulb zealots (who often end up buying physical remotes anyway) and increased cost for smart switch zealots. It’s a particularly attractive option for anyone that can afford to be heavily invested in the Philips Hue ecosystem of high-quality feature-rich devices that work across every major smart home platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ErsAP"&gt;The Hue Module is not for you if you’re looking to make regular cheap light bulbs smart. For that, there are a plethora of alternatives. I have a bunch of Z-wave switches and dimmers from Duewi installed, for example, but several Zigbee solutions are also available that sit behind your existing switches just like the Hue Module. Aqara, for example, makes inexpensive (and sometimes hard to find) in-wall switch modules (&lt;a href="https://www.aqara.com/en/single_switch_T1_with-neutral.html"&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.aqara.com/en/single_switch_T1_no-neutral.html"&gt;without&lt;/a&gt; neutral) that make existing switches smart, but are powered from the mains and work with any standard light, unlike the Hue Module. You could even step things up with &lt;a href="https://www.lutron.com/en-US/Products/Pages/StandAloneControls/Dimmers-Switches/DimmersSwitches.aspx"&gt;Lutron&lt;/a&gt;’s excellent switch and dimmer replacements if you can afford them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="x9qv0Y"&gt;If you’re already invested in Hue, or want to be, then the Philips Hue Wall Switch Module does two things well. It neatly solves the issue of unresponsive bulbs connected to wall switches that has long plagued Hue smart lights, while letting you reap the benefits of both smart lights and smart switches. The Philips Hue Wall Switch Module is available now in Europe for €39.95 / £34.99 and arrives in the US in late June for $39.95.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Office for Android finally gets a dark mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZmcmkryGRdEvJKYLE_xQzpc2FLs=/84x0:1346x841/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69321839/Office_for_Android___Dark_Mode.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RJ3vxt"&gt;Microsoft is finally adding a dark mode to its Office app for Android. While the Office app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143517/microsoft-office-app-android-ios-release-download-word-excel-powerpoint"&gt;has been available on iOS and Android&lt;/a&gt; for more than a year, only the iOS version has included built-in dark mode support until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2iasD"&gt;“It’s been a highly requested feature by many of our customers,” &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/introducing-dark-mode-in-microsoft-office-for-android/ba-p/2352070"&gt;admits Sourab Nagpal&lt;/a&gt;, a product manager at Microsoft. “Many people prefer using Dark Mode as they find it provides a more comfortable visual experience for reading and working on mobile devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLVDzI"&gt;The latest Office app for Android will now automatically enable dark mode if you’ve set that as a system preference on your Android device. Dark mode can also be toggled from the home tab in the Office app. Microsoft says it’s rolling out dark mode for Office on Android over the coming weeks, so it might not appear for all users instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KZstA"&gt;Microsoft’s Office app for Android combines Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into a single application. It also includes quick actions like scanning PDFs, or even capturing whiteboards, text, and tables into digital versions. You can download Microsoft’s Office app for Android &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.officehubrow"&gt;from the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dating apps are encouraging users to get vaccinated with the promise of more matches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gjc2j2vemh8RAiyBQkBeOpFlzws=/61x0:4567x3004/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69321688/Tinder_COVIDStickers_Overview.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tinder’s profile vaccination badges.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tinder&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="97pZSi"&gt;A group of the USA’s biggest dating apps are encouraging users to get vaccinated, just in case the health benefits weren’t reason enough. New features will range from badges for users to show their vaccination status, free premium features for vaccinated users, and links to vaccination resources like the &lt;a href="http://Vaccines.gov"&gt;Vaccines.gov&lt;/a&gt; website. The apps taking part in the scheme include Match Group’s Tinder, Hinge, Match, OKCupid, BLK, Chispa, and Plenty of Fish services, as well as Bumble and Badoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EY6DQP"&gt;The aim is to encourage users to get vaccinated, with the implied promise of more matches and hence more dates. The announcement cites research from OKCupid suggesting that people who either are, or plan to be, vaccinated get 14 percent more matches. Some apps will even let users filter matches by vaccination status. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UleogWTtgsd43eB_IpSu82CXLqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530213/Hinge_Covid_Vaccine_Badge_Horz.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hinge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A mockup of Hinge’s vaccination indicator.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="haYAo9"&gt;Specific features will vary by app. Tinder is giving out free premium features to vaccinated users, adding pro-vaccine profile stickers, and incorporating links to vaccination resources. Bumble and Badoo will offer similar vaccine profile badges, and complimentary premium credits to vaccinated users. Hinge is also giving out normally paid-for features, and is encouraging users to share their vaccination status on their profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZKQFf"&gt;What’s unclear at the moment is how the apps plan to verify that users who claim to be vaccinated have actually received a jab. Many of the apps, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21077423/tinder-photo-verification-blue-checkmark-safety-center-launch-noonlight"&gt;such as Tinder&lt;/a&gt;, already offer verification features, so theoretically they already have systems in place to verify similar information. We’ve reached out to the group for confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEMgS3"&gt;At the time of writing, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-vaccinations-tracker.html"&gt;vaccine tracker&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports that 48 percent of people in the US have received at least one dose of the vaccine, while 38 percent are fully vaccinated. President Biden has set a target of getting 70 percent of adults in the country their first shot by July 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is shutting down Prime Now and folding two-hour deliveries into its main app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hYZC8YqdqX1ryEAHPmG01xizMl0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69321638/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iLZyeO"&gt;Amazon is shutting down its standalone Prime Now delivery app, with its speedy two-hour delivery options moving exclusively into the company’s main app and website, the &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/prime-now-finds-a-new-home-on-amazon"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Prime Now services have already moved into the main app in India, Japan, and Singapore, while in other countries Amazon is already directing Prime Now users into its main app and website via a pop-up, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/amazon-is-shutting-down-its-prime-now-fast-delivery-app.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;. The standalone Prime Now app and website will be retired by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPfhrL"&gt;Originally launched in 2014, Prime Now was designed to offer deliveries of essential items within hours rather than days for Prime members. The service was initially available in just a small number of cities, but has since expanded to over 5,000 locations around the world, &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; notes. Writing in a blog post, Amazon’s vice president of grocery Stephenie Landry said shutting down the separate app will “make this experience even more seamless for customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qy4izV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon says it will be “even more seamless for customers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JzAStT"&gt;Two-hour delivery options from Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods have been available on the main Amazon site and app in the US since 2019, but the company says third-party partners and local stores around the world will be moved onto its main service by the end of the year. These include local stores like Bartell’s in Seattle, Morrisons in Leeds, or Monoprix in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qYApN"&gt;Today’s news follows Amazon’s announcement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220331/amazon-pantry-discontinued-prime-grocery-delivery-services"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt; that it would be discontinuing its Amazon Pantry service and making those household goods and groceries available through the main Amazon website. It’s also been rebranding its Go Grocery brand as Amazon Fresh, &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-rebrands-amazon-go-grocery-amazon-fresh-closes-seattle-area-store-near-microsoft-hq/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeekWire &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Between the moves, Amazon is consolidating and simplifying its sprawling array of grocery delivery services.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jw8QBm"&gt;Yesterday &lt;em&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/em&gt; released CAD renders of what is supposedly Google’s next flagship phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446078/google-pixel-6-pro-leak-specs-camera-screen"&gt;the Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and now the noted leaker has followed up with details and images of the smaller model, &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-6-renders-design-exclusive/"&gt;posted at &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The so-called Pixel 6 looks like it’ll adopt the same distinctive design as the Pro, with one colorway featuring orange and white sections broken up by a glossy black bar that houses the camera bump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27MzEy"&gt;You’ll find one fewer camera in that bump, according to the leak — it’s said to be a dual-camera setup, presumably a regular wide and an ultrawide. The 6 Pro, on the other hand, appears to include a periscope telephoto lens. Both phones are depicted with a single centrally aligned hole-punch selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wKCqlx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A 6.4-inch display without curved edges&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="On1SQc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt; says that the Pixel 6 has a 6.4-inch display with flat edges, unlike the curved 6.67-inch panel used in the 6 Pro. The 6 reportedly also has wireless charging, an in-display fingerprint sensor, and bottom-firing stereo speakers, with dimensions of 158.6mm x 74.8mm x 8.9mm. The &lt;em&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/em&gt; renders match up with designs shown off by &lt;em&gt;Front Page Tech&lt;/em&gt;’s Jon Prosser &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzupAfbY8a4"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2e31s"&gt;There’s no word on exactly when the Pixel 6 will launch, but Pixel phones do have a habit of leaking (or even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18663172/google-pixel-4-camera-sensor-design-official-photo"&gt;being announced by Google&lt;/a&gt;) well before their eventual release date, so we could well be waiting until fall. At this point, it’s almost a surprise that leakers managed to beat Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352032/google-pixel-5-4a-5g-price-release-date-specs"&gt;to the punch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWRPbb"&gt;Google has also said it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;planning to release a Pixel 5A phone&lt;/a&gt; later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kensington’s $399 StudioDock won’t fit the new, slightly thicker 12.9-inch iPad Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L1t1l2OADILkzW4pksRMRx4_UTk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69321578/DSCF7579.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tmzK2w"&gt;Kensington’s StudioDock, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22333551/kensington-studiodock-review-ipad-desktop-dock-accessory"&gt;high-end $399.99 desktop hub for the iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; that was released earlier this year, isn’t compatible with the new 12.9-inch model hitting stores today. A representative for Kensington confirmed the news to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying it’s because the new iPad Pro is 0.5mm thicker than the 2018 and 2020 models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ezaBH"&gt;The StudioDock uses a rotatable magnetic mounting plate to secure the iPad when it’s plugged in over USB-C, expanding its connectivity with extra USB-A, ethernet, and HDMI ports. Although the only difference between the StudioDock versions for the 12.9-inch and 11-inch iPad Pro is the size of that mounting plate, Kensington says it won’t be user-replaceable. Instead, the company plans to release an entirely new SKU to fit the 2021 12.9-inch iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2AUaAU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Kensington StudioDock turns your iPad into a tiny iMac","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22333551/kensington-studiodock-review-ipad-desktop-dock-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NUKh4H"&gt;The new 11-inch iPad Pro should be unaffected, because its dimensions are the same as last year’s model. The 12.9-inch version, however, is slightly thicker because it uses a new, more advanced display with Mini LED technology. Apple itself has warned that its 2020 Magic Keyboard “may not precisely fit” the 2021 12.9-inch iPad Pro due to this difference in thickness, although we found it worked fine in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhUgUb"&gt;No such luck for the StudioDock — you’ll need to buy a whole new one if you want to upgrade your iPad. This wasn’t entirely unforeseeable, and I warned of the possibility when reviewing the StudioDock in March because new iPad Pro models did seem overdue. But the incompatibility is unfortunate for such an expensive product, especially since it was only just released.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart’s accessibility features try to make a hectic game easier to play  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YHjSwL-33uL562j70q_QLegSZ6w=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69320356/RACRA_Juggernaut_Legal_scaled.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iOIPLG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278233/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-ps5-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings alternate realities to the beloved PlayStation franchise on June 11th, and along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431256/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-ps5-interiew-tech-ray-tracing-ssd"&gt;leveraging the PlayStation 5’s SSD&lt;/a&gt;, Insomniac Games &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/1395407201355845633?s=20"&gt;announced new accessibility features&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday that build on the studio’s recent work and address the limited options presented in the earlier PS4 &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xx1Nma"&gt;As an action platformer, &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt; often requires multiple types of movement: You’ll shoot through waves of oncoming enemies while running around a level, and quickly shift to jumping across floating platforms, and using various gadgets to fly, swing, and now reality-warp through stages. &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; seems to keep those core mechanics but adds even more potentially sensory-overloading visuals, from cracks in reality to exploding fragments of buildings. All of which makes the new features Insomniac is adding all the more welcome. You can get a taste of what &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;actually plays like in the demo below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TXCUbi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GffelVJeGws?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n1wnDd"&gt;That occasionally hectic gameplay of the earlier game can be fun, but without customization options for controls — as noted &lt;a href="https://dagersystem.com/disability-review-ratchet-and-clank/"&gt;in this accessibility review&lt;/a&gt; — it could also make the game hard to play for people with disabilities that impact fine motor skills. Along with full controller remapping, &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/360061494611-What-Accessibility-options-does-Ratchet-Clank-Rift-Apart-feature-"&gt;addresses the issue in a few ways&lt;/a&gt;, like how you can repeatedly fire one of the game’s various weapons with a button press instead of squeezing a trigger. The game can also automatically switch between targets, and correct your aim, if for instance flying enemies give you trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CIh2s"&gt;For movement, &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;includes features to make flying in the game easier to control, automatically leveling off your glider so you don’t nose dive, and an “Off-Screen Ledge Guard” which should save you from falling off ledges you can’t see if you’re distracted while smashing robots. There’s also an option to assign all of your movement controls to a single button so you don’t have to hit jump and swing on different parts of the controller.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YmeNBdmORva10uJTr-j5tyUPqoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528495/RACRA_toggles.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The various toggles in &lt;/em&gt;Rift Apart.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YGgCVd"&gt;Visually, &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;also allows you to tone down the game’s striking, but over-the-top visual effects. You can adjust all the obvious settings like contrast and field of view, but the game also smartly uses a visual shading system similar to what developer Naughty Dog used in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21274923/the-last-of-us-part-2-accessibility-features-naughty-dog-interview-ps4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to help make things legible. You can apply colored shaders to your character, any of the enemies in game, even interactable objects to make things easier to visually track and find. The game also offers a similar array of adjustments for changing the size of the in-game HUD and button prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_i0SiMNklVieAvPw5J_WCWua2KQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528607/RACRA_contrastmenu02.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Insomniac Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visual shaders can help provide contrast, visibility, and make it easier to track things if you’re color blind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dD7rG6"&gt;As part of this new generation of consoles, Sony appears to be trying to be a bit more mindful of the various accessibility issues that can come up while playing. It’s been praised for offering software accessibility options &lt;a href="https://caniplaythat.com/2020/11/06/ps5-accessibility-review-can-i-play-that/"&gt;on the PS5 by default&lt;/a&gt;, like a built-in screen reader, but the real way you can see how things are changing is by looking at the developers Sony owns, works with, and publishes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UseOX"&gt;Insomniac Games and Naughty Dog clearly seem focused on making their games more accessible. Insomniac’s been building up to this over time as well; the company took special care to add &lt;a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/360052412831-What-Accessibility-options-does-Marvel-s-Spider-Man-Miles-Morales-feature-"&gt;a wide range of accessibility features&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549085/spider-man-miles-morales-review-ps5-ps4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when that game launched with the PS5. The real trick with accessibility options, though, is standardizing them across the board, which seems like it might at least be starting to happen with these Sony exclusives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iul33Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;launches June 11th on PS5. You can see &lt;a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/360061494611-What-Accessibility-options-does-Ratchet-Clank-Rift-Apart-feature-"&gt;an exhaustive list&lt;/a&gt; of the accessibility options Insomniac is building into the game by visiting its website.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One of the US’s largest insurance companies reportedly paid $40 million to ransomware hackers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VVGlo5vtTy7Iri4My15JFspF-eA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319980/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Nmb6K"&gt;CNA Financial, one of the largest US insurance companies, paid $40 million to &lt;a href="https://threatpost.com/cna-hit-novel-ransomware/165044/"&gt;free itself from a ransomware attack&lt;/a&gt; that occurred in March, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/cna-financial-paid-40-million-in-ransom-after-march-cyberattack?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The hackers reportedly demanded $60 million when negotiations started about a week after some of CNA’s systems were encrypted, and the insurance company paid the lower sum a week later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9S8zmS"&gt;If the $40 million figure is accurate, CNA’s payout would rank as one of the highest ransomware payouts that we know about, though that’s not for lack of trying by hackers: both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396283/apple-schematics-leak-ransomware-quanta-supplier-leak"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341642/acer-ransomware-microsoft-exchange-revil-security"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt; had data that was compromised in separate $50 million ransomware demands earlier this year. It also seems like the hackers are looking for bigger payouts: just this week we saw reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443933/colonial-pipeline-ransom-4-million-hack-gas-shortage"&gt;Colonial Pipeline paid a $4.4 million ransom to hackers&lt;/a&gt;. While that number isn’t as staggering as the demands made to CNA, it’s still much higher than &lt;a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/featured/average-ransomware-payouts-shoot-up/"&gt;the estimated average enterprise ransomware demand in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fbvm5p"&gt;Law enforcement agencies &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-payment/"&gt;recommend against paying ransoms&lt;/a&gt;, saying that payouts will encourage hackers to keep asking for higher and higher sums. For its part, CNA told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;that it wouldn’t comment on the ransom, but that it had “followed all laws, regulations, and published guidance, including OFAC’s 2020 ransomware guidance, in its handling of this matter.” In &lt;a href="https://www.cna.com/web/wcm/connect/96a7c7dd-96d1-41cc-8a0c-25604bfc2898/Security-Incident-Update-5-12-21.pdf?MOD=AJPERES"&gt;an update from May 12&lt;/a&gt;, CNA says that it believes its policyholders’ data were unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPg36v"&gt;According to&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, the ransomware that locked CNA’s systems was Phoenix Locker, a derivative of another piece of malware called Hades. Hades was allegedly created by a Russian group with the &lt;em&gt;Mr. Robot&lt;/em&gt;-esque name Evil Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLBWWu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg wrote that the ransomware used against CNA was a derivative of one created by Evil Corp; we initially suggested it was Evil Corp’s original ransomware instead. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pearXi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqyspG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack’s newest feature will help me remember to pause notifications before calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nrhi205WN4uoQ9frnFmE2twly2U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319828/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G3NGDD"&gt;Slack has added a small but very welcome new feature: when you’re setting a status, you can check a box in that same menu to pause notifications for as long as that status is up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eCgCQ"&gt;I discovered the checkbox on Thursday while preparing for an interview. When I do interviews or calls, I like to set a status to tell my colleagues what I’m up to and then turn off Slack notifications so I’m not distracted by pings or mentions. Previously, though, pausing notifications required clicking into a second menu — and I’d sometimes forget to turn them off. This new checkbox has the benefit of saving me a bit of time and helping me remember to pause notifications when I need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTBaxH"&gt;Slack tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this feature is rolling out now, so you might not have it just yet. If you want to see if you do, go to the “Set a status” menu, type something in the “What’s your status?” field, and then look under the “Clear after:” menu. You should see a checkbox titled “Pause notifications.” Check that, and when you save your status, you won’t get notifications while the status is live.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZpVbO_wENTOVbELEhq1lxeqiVks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529269/Screen_Shot_2021_05_20_at_2.24.59_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slack’s new checkbox to pause notifications right from the status menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EuuRZV"&gt;There’s been a fair amount of Slack news within the last day or so. Earlier on Thursday, Slack had an outage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446007/slack-down-outage-messages-trouble-loading"&gt;that lasted for more than an hour&lt;/a&gt;. And on Wednesday, Slack introduced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444705/slack-pronouns-field-profiles"&gt;pronouns field for profiles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="uWg8lN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430644/blizzard-overwatch-2-livestream-twitch-youtube"&gt;Blizzard’s two-hour &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2 &lt;/em&gt;stream&lt;/a&gt; showed off the best look yet at the much-anticipated sequel to the competitive team shooter. And while there’s still no release date, the studio did show off plenty of new information about the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5jdU1"&gt;Chief among those is one of the biggest changes to &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; in the game’s history: the sequel will be shifting the default PvP multiplayer mode from six-on-six matches to five-on-five games. Within the current role queuing system, that translates to cutting out a tank character on each team, which will now consist of two support, two DPS, and just a single tank character. &lt;/p&gt;

Lucio-Oh’s! &lt;a href="https://t.co/8gFxkyN2Ny"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8gFxkyN2Ny&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1395471785492111367?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3isScZ"&gt;The explanation behind the changes is to both simplify and shake up &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s combat and meta, which tends to calcify toward tank-centric plays, specifically based on utilizing shielding mechanics from characters like Reinhardt or Orisa. In &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;, tank characters are getting some big buffs to make them more powerful (and to help compensate for the lack of a second tank). Reinhardt, for example, is getting a second Firestrike attack, while Winston’s Tesla coil cannon is getting a ranged alt-fire mode. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tFwHf5"&gt;The goal is to help shift &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s combat away from hiding behind / healing tanks and to give the rest of the team more room to spread out, flank, and focus on objectives (instead of just trying to keep the tanks alive). One less tank also means that players have to be smarter about the maps, utilizing cover and creative flanking angles instead of just rolling down the main path in a shield fortress. It’s a big change to the game, one that exemplifies the approach that Blizzard is taking here in terms of trying to keep things fresh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xPYVBU"&gt;The stream also showed off other new aspects in the upcoming sequel, including a better look at the cleaner UI for &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; (which, among other changes, makes it easier for support characters to track teammates they’re healing), new character designs, and other tweaks that are planned for character abilities (like Mei, who won’t be able to fully freeze opponents anymore).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3IH4F"&gt;The development team also showcased several new maps. There was a better look at the upcoming Toronto map, which had been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943766/blizzard-overwatch-2-sequel-announcement-blizzcon-2019"&gt;announced alongside &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2 &lt;/em&gt;back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but also a trio of new maps: New York, featuring a futuristic Grand Central station; Rio, which has a nightclub for the EDM hero Lúcio; and Monte Carlo, set on a winding racetrack. &lt;/p&gt;
