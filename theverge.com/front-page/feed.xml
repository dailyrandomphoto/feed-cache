    <title>Ariana Grande is headlining Fortnite’s next concert series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xwyvkRrEXYcbClHY6Zai8Ndyv-k=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69663897/Ariana_x_Fortnite_Key_Art_3.15.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LpUwK6"&gt;Last week, Epic Games teased that a “record-breaking superstar” would be performing in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599908/fortnite-rift-tour-concert-series"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; upcoming Rift Tour concert series&lt;/a&gt;, and now we know that the mystery performer is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1421894007697952775"&gt;none other than Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22YDkD"&gt;The five-show concert series kicks off August 6th at 6PM ET, and shows will run through August 8th. (&lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-presents-the-rift-tour-featuring-ariana-grande"&gt;You can find the full schedule here&lt;/a&gt;.) Epic recommends being ready in-game 60 minutes before any of the performances so that you can jump into the Rift Tour playlist when it goes live 30 minutes ahead of showtime. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; events have filled up in the past — I personally missed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21291458/fortnite-device-event-agency-explosion-water-storm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; “The Device” event&lt;/a&gt; in-game because I signed on too late — so I’d recommend showing up early to the Rift Tour shows just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eLfyLw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="et" dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rifttour?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#rifttour&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;august 6-8&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FortniteGame&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Mlf5Xpl9HO"&gt;https://t.co/Mlf5Xpl9HO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/pTgLJ7e67O"&gt;pic.twitter.com/pTgLJ7e67O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/1421893658689814531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I5e5Mw"&gt;As for what you can expect from the shows? “Building on and incorporating other celebrated &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; moments, the Rift Tour will begin with experiences that pair popular tracks with moments based on elements from the game,” &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/ariana-grande-steps-into-the-metaverse-as-the-headliner-for-fortnites-rift-tour"&gt;according to Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;. “Players will be able to travel side by side with their friends on a journey to magical new realities where &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and Ariana collide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orBgKT"&gt;Epic will also be selling a skin based on Grande as part of its Icon Series, which features real-world celebrities like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22570612/lebron-james-fortnite-skin-release-date"&gt;LeBron James&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21065235/ninja-fortnite-skin-announced-stream-tyler-blevins-available-date"&gt;Tyler “Ninja” Blevins&lt;/a&gt;. Grande’s skin will go on sale August 4th at 8PM ET, meaning you can show up to Grande’s concert dressed as Grande, and you can get a preview of the skin and a backpack based on her &lt;a href="https://arianagrande.fandom.com/wiki/Piggy_Smallz"&gt;actual pet pig, Piggy Smallz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBjRi_UNY8o"&gt;in this teaser video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uFDrYb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBjRi_UNY8o?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rB6Wvs"&gt;If you attend the concert, you’ll also get a special umbrella glider. Players who subscribe to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612524/fortnite-crew-subscription-chapter-2-season-5-price-release-date"&gt;monthly &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Crew subscription&lt;/a&gt; will get some exclusive bonuses for attending, including a rainbow variant of the concert umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ptdx3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; past concerts have been massively successful — more than 10 million people watched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234980/fortnite-marshmello-concert-viewer-numbers"&gt;Marshmello’s in-game concert in February 2019&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233946/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-record-breaking-player-count"&gt;more than 12 million people attended&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott’s surreal &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; performance in April 2020&lt;/a&gt;. It seems likely that Epic will be aiming to up the spectacle with this latest concert, and we’ll have to wait and see what the combination Grande’s performance inside of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22519431/fortnite-season-7-superman-flying-saucers-aliens"&gt;currently alien-themed world&lt;/a&gt; could bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5Eqeo"&gt;Grande’s performance &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-20-huge-fortnite-leak-points-to-upcoming-ariana-grande-concert"&gt;was rumored in July&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-05-04-fortnite-planned-metroid-crossover-ariana-and-lady-gaga-concerts"&gt;documents unearthed as part of Epic’s case against Apple&lt;/a&gt; also revealed that Epic was planning a concert with the megastar. The event seems to have been in the works for quite some time — according to a June 2020 document from the case, a Grande concert was in the works for that October. At the time, a J Balvin concert was set for that September, which ended up happening a month later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21525028/fortnite-fortnitemares-halloween-event-jbalvin-concert"&gt;as part of the game’s Halloween event&lt;/a&gt;, while a still-unannounced Lady Gaga concert was planned for that December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RryrLs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 1st, 2:48PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added description from Epic Games about the performances.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jungle Cruise earned a third of its opening revenues from Disney Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DKc9Mf8X5WLbVP1oPCIrfKCp9PM=/103x0:1198x730/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69663835/g_junglecruise_18970_1_bb702394.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt in Disney’s &lt;/em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="crska5"&gt;Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt; debuted in theaters and as a Disney Plus Premier Access title this weekend, and early revenue totals from the entertainment giant show that streaming accounted for a third of the film’s revenues, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/jungle-cruise-box-office-disney-green-knight-1234991247/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sunday’s &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt; numbers mark the second time Disney has released figures for a movie offered as part of the Premier Access program, which lets Disney Plus subscribers pay $30 to stream certain films the same day they hit theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4NTGZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise’s&lt;/em&gt; $30 million is half of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572613/black-widow-disney-plus-premier-access-theaters"&gt;$60 million &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; earned on Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; over the same period following its early July debut, but &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise’s&lt;/em&gt; Disney Plus revenue represented a bigger slice of the total revenue pie than streaming did for &lt;em&gt;Black Widow’s:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise’s&lt;/em&gt; $30 million was about 33 percent of its $91.8 million total, while &lt;em&gt;Black Widow’s&lt;/em&gt; $60 million was about 27 percent of &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/black-widow-disney-revenue-game-changer-1234980611/"&gt;its $218.8 million total&lt;/a&gt;. Premier Access was also an option for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354593/mulan-release-date-disney-earnings-warner-bros-tenet-theaters"&gt;2020’s &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315306/disney-raya-and-the-last-dragon-southeast-asian-media"&gt;March’s &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22400212/cruella-review-disney-plus-emma-stone-101-dalmatians"&gt;May’s &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but Disney hasn’t shared figures for those movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wBo7cH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The numbers arrive just days after Scarlett Johansson’s lawsuit over Black Widow&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HP63Kw"&gt;The new numbers also arrive just days after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;Scarlett Johansson’s major lawsuit against Disney&lt;/a&gt;, which alleged that Disney reneged on a promise to release &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; exclusively in theaters. The lawsuit is perhaps the biggest pushback yet against the direct-to-streaming model — &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; director &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168881/denis-villeneuve-christopher-nolan-anger-hbo-max-streaming-att"&gt;Denis Villeneuve blasted WarnerMedia&lt;/a&gt; in December after the studio announced it would release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;all of its 2021 movies simultaneously on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/amc-is-pissed-1845804062"&gt;theaters weren’t a fan of that move, either&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbPEC3"&gt;While WarnerMedia has already announced plans to release 10 Warner Bros. films &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590727/hbo-max-warner-bros-films-hbo-max-2022"&gt;day-and-date in theaters and on streaming services in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, Disney hasn’t announced any Premier Access titles that may follow &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elite students are debating hot-button issues on an invite-only TikTok clone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/foOi8WK2cGa90FmG5DZ4faenTK8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69663095/VRG_4679_Polemix_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ari Liloan for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;To combat online polarization, Polemix aims to make young people ‘listen to the outside’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="PPaNzb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap c-end-para" id="V0DW5A"&gt;At a glance, the video looks like a TikTok. But toward the bottom, where a TikTok’s caption would be, are two large buttons. One reads “Respect But Disagree.” The other reads “Convinced By You.” Across the top is a question, written in white: “Should Dems pack the Court?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmeBE2"&gt;“Hell no,” declares a young woman, whom the app labels “Naomi, Political Science” onscreen. “If Republicans are elected in the future, they’re now going to be more likely to stack the court as well.” Swipe up and “Brian, Founder, Oxford Political Review” appears to express an opposing viewpoint. “As much as I believe Democrats ought uphold norms of civility or neutrality and all that, in theory, look: The reality is it’s dirty, and it’s time we fight back,” Brian declares. Brian’s video is the top-voted video on court-packing, having earned a combined 17 “Respect But Disagree” and “Convinced By You” votes since its posting. Naomi’s video is in fourth place, with four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of a video on Polemix. A person stands in front of a white wall. Above them is the text “Should Dems pack the court?” with the hashtags #Yes #Yes#WhenTheyGoLow#WeGoLow. On the left of the screen are three buttons for “Share”, “Results”, and “My Point”.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brian says, “Hell yes.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of a video on Polemix. A woman sits in front of a blue and yellow wall. Above her is the text “Should Dems pack the court?” with the hashtags #YNo #court.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Naomi says, “Hell no.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t8U4h9"&gt;This is Polemix, a new, exclusive app aimed at promoting free discourse among young people. As the world’s biggest social networks continuously battle misinformation and draw controversial lines between dangerous and appropriate speech, the founders of Polemix believe they’ve found a better solution: a free market of ideas, with selective admission. So far, the app has attracted a young community that’s eloquent, outspoken, and passionate about the app’s stated philosophy. But it has also served as a microcosmic experiment with online debate culture in concentrated form, and a real-world demonstration of the caveats required to bring such a lofty ideal to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="S5b17g"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RLcKAP"&gt;“Naomi” is Naomi Panovka, a rising third-year student at McGill. “Brian” is Brian Wong, a Rhodes scholar studying politics at Oxford. The two were selected earlier this year as part of a group that Polemix’s founders refer to as “Leaders” — 40 elite young people who were tasked with building the app’s community while driving its early dialogue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lT39al"&gt;“It was people who are quite passionate about public speaking in general, who cared about discourse,” Panovka says. “People who they thought would be good representatives.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twdC2K"&gt;There was no formal application to become a Leader — the founders hand-picked the group through their networks. Per Polemix’s website, the cadre includes “some of the world’s top thinkers.” The founders describe them as “very carefully selected university leaders.” In practice, the vast majority of the &lt;a href="https://polemix.co/leaders"&gt;listed group&lt;/a&gt; are decorated high school and college debaters. Panovka competed for Canada’s national team in high school and has reached the finals of over 10 university-level competitions; Wong was a semifinalist at the 2020 world championships. The group is diverse when it comes to race, gender, and nationality, but famous universities are heavily represented. Cambridge, Oxford, LSE, and Yale all make several appearances on the list and can claim a majority of the listed Leaders as students or alumni.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDdOLg"&gt;College debate was formative for Polemix founder and CEO Ian Sielecki. He competed during his time as a student at Cambridge and has organized public debates for the Athens Democracy Forum. Sielecki has long felt that social media could learn from the college debate scene; he sees Polemix as a tool to combat online echo chambers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxHItX"&gt;“Social networks, by the way they operate through their algorithms, they only give you content that you already agree with, which means they radicalize you,” says Sielecki. The idea behind Polemix, he says, “was to create, inspired from the magic of debating, a conceptual landscape in which people would hear, listen to the outside by design.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the Explore tab on Polemix. Three questions are listed: Should human gene editing be legal, did COVID leak from a Wuhan lab, and is Facebook killing people?" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X2cNbZ53TmaULCYXcEnahz4W7zM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733730/213278797_253097286306085_4313126787021908776_n.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Polemix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Polemix’s “Explore” tab, you can scroll through various questions that have been debated in the past.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the Start Debate tab on Polemix. The user is prompted to “Write a question here.” Below is a notice that reads, “Only leaders are able to start debates,” and a Next button that isn’t functional because the criteria hasn’t been met." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZFASeGMO730upZ_NsqHJs9Tq8GY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733731/215567958_161507885951476_8632556073972102321_n.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Polemix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you aren’t a Leader, you can’t create new questions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oNDGaG"&gt;Early on, Sielecki and his team identified young people as their target audience. Specifically, “young people passionate about something,” according to Ismaël Emelien, Sielecki’s co-founder. Emelien isn’t a college debater, but rather a cofounder of France’s En Marche political party and a former adviser to French President Emmanuel Macron. But he feels that Sielecki’s frustrations map to the global political landscape. “People just ... can’t listen to the other side anymore,” Emelien says. “This is the first thing we need to fix in real life. The way to do that is to target young people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEtJ3g"&gt;Polemix’s interface borrows a lot from TikTok — swipe down for a new video, everything capped at 30 seconds — but the content couldn’t be more different. Every Polemix video features a person making an argument for or against a preset list of questions, from “Will Federer win Wimbledon?” and “Is Canada superior to America?” to “Does Instagram objectify women?” and “Is physician-assisted suicide unethical?” As a user scrolls, they’re shown videos for each question in groups of up to four: a “Hell Yes,” a “Hell No,” a “Hell Yes,” a “Hell No.” They can vote, or scroll, accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMlY79"&gt;The algorithm takes both “Convinced By You” and “Respect But Disagree” votes into account when prioritizing the videos you see. As Sielecki notes, “The Respect But Disagree is quite important for your video to be popular.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bcUEKv"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nbw2Bo"&gt;Every social media platform grapples with harassment and outright hate speech, but Polemix walks a particularly difficult line because its explicit goal is to celebrate differences of opinion. The app does have an explicit rule against hate speech: “Hate is for losers” is its slogan, one that Sielecki emphasizes in pitching the app, and one that was attractive to some of the initial members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O3Yogs"&gt;“The idea is to welcome people from every side of every controversial question. We will have people from the Trump administration, from QAnon making videos,” Emelien says. “That’s not a problem for us, as long as it is expressed in respect for the rules of Polemix, meaning it’s not hateful.” He emphasizes that “the people watching this video will be exposed, by design, to the other side arguing against those videos ... That’s our remedy.” (Of course, that also means a user won’t necessarily see a representative sample of opinions. “Has #MeToo gone too far?” has 10 “Hell No” responses and just four “Hell Yes” responses, but a scrolling user will still see two of each — arguably giving more contrarian views an easier path to exposure.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the statistics for a question on Polemix: “Do public figures have a right to privacy?” A graph labeled “Convinced votes” shows 64 percent Yes and 36 percent No. A graph labeled “People showing Respect” shows 43 percent Yes.

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Polemix’s list of debatable questions. Each leader is credited for their question. Questions include: Is it cruel to have a baby today (by Samuel Hvitse), Is Jagger greater than Lennon (by Judith Goldenthale), Should the US be more socialist (by Matt Caito), Should we abolish prisons (by Sharon Chau), Are the Tokyo Olympics a dangerous idea (by Roshan Melwani), and Should NCAA athletes be paid?" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p4KxN7_eptmdO-WA1DewxFJK48I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733739/217511736_600116368043527_1559460927487504693_n.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Polemix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When creating a new video, you’re prompted to select a question from a preset list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SEdiQu"&gt;The other tool reining in the discourse is the questions users are asked to respond to, which set the tone for the conversations that follow. For Polemix’s first few months, only Leaders have been able to create new questions, a major privilege that sets them apart from the rest of the community. Many of the Leaders are acquainted through the debate community and discuss new questions behind the scenes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CcvE6"&gt;Sielecki and Emelien agree that some questions are so conducive to bigotry as to be off-limits; debates about “race science,” no matter how respectful, would be a no-go. Asked how the team goes about drawing that line, Sielecki replied, “It’s relatively clear what racism is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKQKjM"&gt;But the app has touched on just about every controversial issue you might think of, and some questions that have gotten the green light would likely be in a gray area, if not over the line, for progressive circles on and off the internet. “Should Cosby be left in peace?”, “Is Pride Day still necessary?”, “Should IQ tests be mandatory?”, “Is JK Rowling transphobic?”, “Has political correctness gone too far?”, “Is America racist?”, “Did COVID leak from a Wuhan lab?”, and “Did religion get homosexuality wrong?” have all been debated on Polemix since the app’s founding. Even with safeguards in place, founders who endorse these questions are drawing an ideological line, however unconsciously — one that puts a high degree of trust in their community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot from Polemix’s website showing four people beneath the heading “Leaders of all opinions and generations.” Below the pictures appears a question: “Are you afraid to listen to the other side?”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7jYjLlQ_Q3Ht4Akk5JrNemUShM8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733742/p6.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Polemix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaders and their accomplishments are advertised on Polemix’s website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iLg4Kx"&gt;So far, Polemix has mostly avoided the right-wing lurch many might expect from a platform focused on quick-twitch debating. As of this writing, a “Hell yes” is winning “Should we tax to eliminate billionaires?” and “Should we have a universal basic income?”; a “Hell No” is winning “More restriction on immigration?” and “MLB too woke?” A “Hell Yes” is winning “Should we abolish prisons?” and “Should we abolish the police?” by a significant margin. None of the users I spoke to seem to have remotely right-wing political beliefs. Wong describes themself as “a hardcore progressive.” And the users I spoke to universally love Polemix’s environment and find the community supportive and engaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3RmZG"&gt;“It’s Reddit meets Twitter, but instead of Twitter trolls and Reddit downvoters who swarm you, you’ve just got high-quality or relatively high-quality discourse,” says Wong, who spends one to two hours on Polemix every day. “I’ve very rarely, if at all, seen any content that’s reminiscent of hate speech.” Sielecki and Emelien say they’ve had very few issues with trolls so far. “One out of every thousand is a hater,” Sielecki estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxGK2Q"&gt;Amanda Timerman, who’s not a leader (she learned about Polemix at a party), says the app’s intellectual community is “therapeutic” for her. “Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, everything there, it’s like the minute you say something ... you’re going to be immediately judged,” Timerman says. Polemix, she feels, is “really and truly a safe space ... It really makes me feel good, and it makes me feel really self-confident to have an opinion on things that normally I wouldn’t discuss.” She added, “It’s like my own personal talk show.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSiH14"&gt;The prospect of young people hosting their own talk shows online isn’t always a recipe for enlightened discourse, as the swamp of online debate challenges demonstrates. The spectacle of those challenges has proven to be a good way for influencers to build hype and attract new audiences on platforms like YouTube and Twitch, but the debates themselves often take a back seat to clout-chasing. As popular Twitch commentator Hasan Piker put it in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22556239/hasan-piker-twitch-gore-vidal-steven-crowder-sam-seder-h3-podcast-ethan-klein"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;“[I]t’s just pseudo-intellectual wrestling. It’s sport, and it’s not productive ... People just want to beat their opponent, so they’re not necessarily ideologically shifting anyone. Instead, the 20 percent of the audience that is maybe malleable gravitates toward whoever the top-dog debater is.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JbCK8k"&gt;For Polemix, the challenge is to succeed where YouTube and Twitch have mostly failed: essentially, to build a platform where trolls don’t win. Polemix’s founders are confident in their algorithm, and so are the users I spoke to. “A lot of the social media debates that you see online — vitriolic, bitter, vicious, surly. It’s just not polite,” Wong says. But on Polemix, “It’s just people talking. And people talking humanely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJxrnP"&gt;But Polemix is still invite-only, with only 2,500 users (and a waitlist of “a couple of thousand,” per Sielecki), and it’s not clear how well the platform will fare if the reins are loosened. The founders are in the process of rolling out question-setting privileges to more users, and new Leaders will need to meet a minimum threshold of video views and votes. Emelien and Sielecki also plan to start adding more users soon — they recently offered invitations to all participants in the 2021 university world championships. They don’t, however, know if or when they’ll be letting the masses in. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot from Polemix’s website. The text reads “Convince me if you can: Polemix brings together the world’s brightest youth and global leaders from both sides of any polarizing question. By invitation only.” Below are links to download the app if you have an invitation code, and to join the waiting list if you don’t. To the right are two phones playing Polemix videos." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/et-lPudOyfQLyJuPHTngntyAP-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733750/p7.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Polemix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Polemix brings together the world’s brightest youth.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5iUww7"&gt;“We ensure that we have quality every step of the way,” Sielecki says. “We’re not going to grow massively just to grow, without taking care of the safety that the ecosystem offers to users and the quality of the content that is being created.” In other words: there’s no timeline yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwFawg"&gt;Among Leaders and members, there are some doubts about whether Polemix will be able to court non-debaters as it grows. Some members are nervous about changing the community’s character. “Right now, it kind of feels like I’m in a little cocoon,” Timerman says, though she’s aware that “the only way to grow is to eventually open it up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="n7n1JL"&gt;But Wong is confident enough in the community’s passion and values that they’re not worried about trolls. For them, the floodgates can’t open soon enough. “I’m very excited,” they say. “I can’t wait until we have unleashed the kraken.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Latest IDC numbers reiterate Apple’s dominance of tablet market</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air has the same design and shape as the 11-inch iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hM3dNfax2EBfkBmyopTGAlbm7YM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69661644/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U4Zfn1"&gt;Earlier this week during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596120/apple-q3-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;Apple’s earnings&lt;/a&gt; call, CEO Tim Cook said that the iPad had experienced its most successful June quarter in nearly a decade. And now &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48120621"&gt;IDC is out with its latest worldwide shipment figures&lt;/a&gt; that underline Apple’s commanding lead over the tablet competition. After refreshing the iPad Air in 2020 and launching an upgraded iPad Pro earlier this year, Apple is next expected to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels"&gt;update the iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycfd5d"&gt;IDC estimates that Apple shipped 12.9 million iPads in the second quarter. Its nearest competition is Samsung, which hit 8 million shipments. Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;Galaxy Tab S7 tablets&lt;/a&gt; offer fantastic hardware and punchy OLED screens, but they remain hamstrung by Android’s less-than-stellar selection of tablet apps. Lenovo, which continues to release well-received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598860/lenovo-flex-5-chromebook-review"&gt;Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Chrome OS tablets&lt;/a&gt;, took third with 4.7M units shipped, and Amazon came in fourth with 4.3 million Fire tablet shipments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AqYqGq"&gt;Both PC and tablet shipments have surged over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic as people have adapted to working from home and remote education. IDC’s figures reveal that Chromebook shipments have grown 68.6 percent year over year and reached 12.3 million units shipped in the second quarter. “While this wasn’t a record quarter for Chromebooks, it wasn’t far off the prior two quarters, which shattered previous highs,” IDC wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67AyqS"&gt;But IDC does point to a possible slowdown in sales for Chromebooks and tablets due to ongoing chip shortages and an easing of consumer demand as more people return to the workplace or classroom. Apple has said that supply constraints could be detrimental to iPad sales in the coming months, and the iPhone might be affected as well. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google pairs Stadia Controller and Chromecast as $100 ‘play and watch’ bundle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ul9QntN82eMgI0V1MIcBvANVgDg=/39x0:1821x1188/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69661331/Screen_Shot_2021_07_31_at_12.43.56_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xywYVd"&gt;Google has recently been selling a combo-package of the Stadia Controller and 2020 Chromecast as a limited-time promotion. But &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/30/stadia-controller-chromecast-google-tv-package/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company has now made the pair a permanent bundle that it’s calling the “play and watch” package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvIth5"&gt;For $99.99, you get both the controller and streaming dongle. That’s a savings of $19 compared to buying both products separately. Google is also promoting the Chromecast ethernet adapter as a recommended accessory; if you want the absolute best Stadia experience, it’s probably a smart buy — and it’s a mere $9.99 ($10 off) when purchased alongside the bundle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7PknS"&gt;In an effort to clear out inventory of the old, puck-shaped Chromecast Ultra, Google is discounting its &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/stadia_premiere_edition?hl=en-US"&gt;Stadia Premiere Edition bundle&lt;/a&gt; yet again to $79.99. I’d definitely recommend the newer Chromecast with Google TV over the older one. The streaming experience is much richer and more comprehensive on the newer device. But if you’re strictly using it as a gateway to Stadia, the $79.99 deal might be worth hopping on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEiWcO"&gt;Remember that Google’s game streaming service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522416/google-stadia-chromecast-tv-nvidia-shield-android-devices-list-date"&gt;now supports select Android TV&lt;/a&gt; products as well. So if you’ve got a TV running that software, all you really need to get going is Google’s controller or a compatible third-party Bluetooth gamepad. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thanks to the Rickroll, ‘Never Gonna Give You Up’ hits 1 billion YouTube plays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo of Rick ASTLEY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8tAylZJ29DTAFX3fXTtrB1vRRx0=/0x0:2661x1774/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69661138/85355127.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Bernd Muller/Redferns&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0sSB6w"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"&gt;official video&lt;/a&gt; for Rick Astley’s 1987 hit “Never Gonna Give You Up” has surpassed 1 billion plays on YouTube. The song became a lasting part of internet culture thanks to the Rickroll meme and reached the impressive milestone a couple days ago. Astley took to the video’s comments to share his gratitude, saying “amazing, crazy, wonderful!” In a video posted to Instagram, he added “the world is a wonderful and beautiful place, and I am very lucky.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rE9AtU"&gt;With some songs having crossed &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk"&gt;as many as 7 billion views&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, the 1 billion club isn’t quite as prestigious as it once was. But the achievement goes to show the staying power of the Rickroll prank. The video hit daily views of 2.3 million on April Fools Day, according to &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9607871/rick-astley-never-gonna-give-you-up-video-billion-views/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Just in the past couple years, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21138550/fortnite-rickroll-new-emote-never-gonna-give-you-up-rick-astley"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; emotes&lt;/a&gt; and fan-made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22289657/never-gonna-give-you-up-4k"&gt;4K remasters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vctDWy"&gt;Back in 2008, the man himself &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL-hNMJvcyI"&gt;Rickrolled the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade&lt;/a&gt;. The meme was also put to excellent use when the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDs7KkGcQ6M"&gt;San Diego Padres trolled the Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; just as fans thought they were about to belt out the chorus to “Sweet Caroline.” If you’ve got other prime examples, the comments section awaits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joVsmq"&gt;I’m curious what the average watch time is for “Never Gonna Give You Up.” After being duped, how many people have closed out the window in aggravation within seconds of hearing the drum intro and synths coming in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="874YsE"&gt;Astley celebrated joining the billion plays club by releasing a limited, &lt;a href="https://rickastley.tmstor.es/?lf=f8891a33f848b3f0690358b04f4f6543"&gt;already-sold-out&lt;/a&gt; run of 7-inch blue vinyl pressings of the quintessential ‘80s jam. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telegram’s group video calls can now have up to 1,000 viewers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/moIVKgHFAindUOothSOS02MVO8E=/0x25:2006x1362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69660642/Screen_Shot_2021_07_31_at_10.02.08_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Telegram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sL4whk"&gt;Telegram has announced &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/video-1000"&gt;the latest new features and improvements&lt;/a&gt; making their way to the popular messaging app. Video is the focus this time around. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551652/telegram-adds-group-video-calling-chat"&gt;launching group video calls last month&lt;/a&gt;, those sessions are now able to tally up to 1,000 viewers. The maximum number of people able to participate and broadcast to the video call remains at 30, but you can have quite the audience now for “anything from online lectures to live rap battles,” according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYioAW"&gt;Video messages will also now come through at a higher resolution, and you can tap them for a larger view of the clip. When recording your own video messages, Telegram says that audio from your device will now keep playing as you do so, “so you can now sing along to your favorite songs or reply without pausing your podcast.” You can now zoom in when recording with your phone’s rear camera, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cr7RLM"&gt;Other additions include screen sharing for one-on-one video calls (with audio from the device of whoever’s broadcasting), the option to auto-delete messages after a month — the longest option &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301393/telegram-auto-delete-messages-widgets-andoird-ios-update"&gt;was previously a week&lt;/a&gt; — and more precise drawing. Telegram has also spruced up the user experience with animations for the passcode screen and when you send messages on Android; iOS users already got these message animations in a previous update. For the full list of changes, head over to &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/video-1000"&gt;Telegram’s blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>K-pop’s fandom platforms are changing what it means to be an idol</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6lsCxyBrHQ7kvucqQYFMCy9KkK4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69660335/VRG_4679_KPOP_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ari Liloan for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Digital fan clubs are turning into single-purpose social networks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="8AEgCl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Pc6nDb"&gt;Fandom has changed a lot since I was a kid. As a tween, I had no hope of getting in touch with celebrities I adored like Britney Spears and Whitney Houston. Now, I’ve not only spoken with some of my celebrity favorites on social media, but I’ve even fought with a few. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UhspD"&gt;The technology of fandom is changing, too. Parasocial relationships — a largely one-sided relationship between a fan and a public figure they feel close to due to social media — are everywhere online. And the companies behind some of the biggest acts in K-pop are pioneering a new way to monetize them. They’ve developed online platforms to help K-pop fans feel as though they have direct access to their idol favorites. That access helps shape the way these fans interact with the idol as a form of friendship &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; how they engage with other fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UHHumY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Three main platforms now stand out: Universe, Weverse, and LYSN&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nYQ8AO"&gt;Before the rise of social media accounts and company-run platforms, most fans for Korean artists basically were locked into direct engagement through &lt;a href="http://www.thekrazemagazine.com/latest-updates/2020/3/15/fancafes-and-why-they-are-such-a-headache"&gt;fancafes&lt;/a&gt; — a kind of digital fan club that often required fans to prove their knowledge of a particular artist before gaining access to artists. Initially hosted on platforms like social networking site &lt;a href="https://www.kakaocorp.com/page/service/service/DaumCafe?lang=en"&gt;DAUM&lt;/a&gt;, these fancafes allowed fans to connect with idols directly, and they could become even more intimate when connected with the official paid fan club memberships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar0Ejm"&gt;While the DAUM fancafes for many idols are still up and running, there has been a shift away from them over the past two years, especially for English-language fandoms. In their place, several companies have created new social apps for their artists, entirely bypassing third-party platforms like Twitter or Facebook. Three main platforms now stand out: NCSoft’s Universe is used by a wide range of groups managed by companies outside of the &lt;a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2021/03/30/entertainment/kpop/SM-entertainment-JYP-entertainment-YG-entertainment/20210330160916443.html"&gt;Big Four&lt;/a&gt; of Korean pop music and includes features like a “private messaging” service, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/3/3/22311645/deepfake-ai-k-pop-stars-ncsoft-universe-music-industry"&gt;exclusive music&lt;/a&gt;, and mildly controversial AI-generated voice calls with idols. HYBE’s Weverse is home to mega-groups like BTS and TXT and structured more like the DAUM fancafes. Finally, there’s SM’s LYSN, which includes the truly innovative Bubble app that has found a way to give K-pop groups all of the benefits of Twitter DMs, without many of the problems.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbTsFt"&gt;SM is a K-pop-producing powerhouse behind groups like TVXQ and the cyberpunk girl group Aespa. Its platform, LYSN, first launched in 2018 as an “interest-based fan community.” It was a relative failure before the 2020 introduction of its Bubble&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;idol instant messaging service, which &lt;a href="https://www.koreaboo.com/news/heres-much-money-sm-entertainment-made-fans-application-lysn-bubble/"&gt;kicked profits into the stratosphere&lt;/a&gt;. With the different versions of Bubble, fans can contact their favorite idols through partially private messaging, paid for on a subscription basis. The app is designed to look like a one-on-one chat window, but the reality is more like a massive group chat, with the idol &lt;a href="http://www.lysn.com/en_US/faq/21129452"&gt;dropping in messages for thousands of fans at once&lt;/a&gt; and seeing replies as they come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TC99md"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It can feel like you are receiving a personal, private message from the idol.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vEIqr5"&gt;Areum Jeong, assistant professor of humanities at Sichuan University-Pittsburgh Institute, says the apps offer fans a real chance to strengthen their relationship with their current favorite idols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpO5ij"&gt;“Fans are fully aware that it is technically a group chat where the idol will receive messages from thousands of fans, although fans cannot see the other fans’ messages,” says Jeong. “Even so, fans enjoy receiving messages where the idol shares his / her daily life and thoughts. And at times, it can feel like you are receiving a personal, private message from the idol because the interface gives an illusion of a 1:1 chat, and some idols will send messages that cater to intimate feelings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjjGZy"&gt;That faux-intimacy can be a powerful force for fans who use these platforms regularly. “I like using Weverse specifically because I love seeing member interactions in a seemingly authentic way,” says Leigh, a fan of idol group Seventeen who connects with the group through Weverse. “It is fun to see members in basically a glorified group chat that, from time to time, it feels like I am an observer of, but most of the time, I feel like I am a participant in.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="P6PStU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The relationship between BTS and ARMY never feels one-sided.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lqhl0O"&gt;Part of the appeal is that fans can feel as though they’re seeing a different, more personal side to the idol they’re following on less direct platforms like Twitter or Instagram. For Nicole Santero, a PhD student currently doing research on the culture on BTS’s massive international fan base ARMY (and who runs &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ResearchBTS"&gt;the @ResearchBTS Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;), it’s all about the connections that fans can make in their interactions with the artists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLciOV"&gt;“The relationship between BTS and ARMY never feels one-sided. What has stood out about Weverse is how BTS is so active and often responds directly to fans on the app,” says Santero. “That makes Weverse even more appealing, and there is definitely this greater intimacy and closeness formed between artists and fans through these types of interactions. Knowing that BTS could potentially see your posts makes the experience even more meaningful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3DEvw"&gt;These company-run apps don’t just offer fans the ability to receive comfort from the artist. For some fans, the appeal is in getting to offer support when an artist is going through a health issue, a scandal, or simply when they’re bored on their rare downtime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbSC3Z"&gt;For Maxim, an Australian Stray Kids fan who’s been using the Bubble app for six months, it’s been a mix of good times and bad times. “The Great Hyunjin Incident of ’21 was a bit of a tumultuous time for that whole band / fandom, and I do admit that I sent a little buck-up message of encouragement through to Felix,” he said, referring to group member Felix. “Other times, I’ve replied to messages when Felix asks for recommendations and try to sneak my taste onto his agenda. Again, there’s genuinely no way to know if he ever sees it. Would he even watch &lt;em&gt;Yuri on Ice&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Sk8 the Infinity&lt;/em&gt;?” (I think he probably would.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7Ujjd"&gt;Unlike past fan clubs for other celebrities, there’s no guarantee that what happens on company-run apps will stay on those apps. In fact, due to the medium to low quality of in-app translation services to translate from Korean to English, there are &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tamarherman/2020/08/20/the-unpaid-labor-of-k-pop-fan-translation-twitter/"&gt;translation accounts&lt;/a&gt; for many of the artists across these platforms that focus exclusively on Weverse / LYSN and Bubble / Universe. If an idol’s fan base is small or poorly organized outside of the company-run platform, they may have fewer translation accounts. However, that doesn’t stop fans from sharing memes, artist-uploaded selfies, and clips from livestreams everywhere that they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PxWf9"&gt;There can be a hard edge to that intimacy. “As more fans than ever view themselves as active consumers, they can be unreasonable or even hostile,” says Jeong. Fans of rookie idol group Enhypen have been &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ikrd/k-pop-group-enhypen-fandom-racism"&gt;dealing with a fractured fandom&lt;/a&gt; following a member potentially saying the n-word, and much of the conflict between fans stems from interactions on Weverse. Fans on the platform tried to hide violent and racist posts from the artist using an in-app feature for inter-fan communication and ended up attacking Black fans speaking out about the incident and then about the harassment they were facing. Within hours of the initial wave of harassment, Black fans of the group took to Twitter and TikTok to share what they were seeing and how people were talking about them — especially in the face of continued silence from the group, their management, and Weverse moderation. The app they’d been using to connect with other fans and the idols themselves was no longer the safe space it had been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6od9Rm"&gt;Still, none of these engagements would have been easy 10 years ago, and most would have been flat-out impossible 10 years before that. These platforms offer an entirely new way for celebrities and their fans to interact, building on conventional social media platforms but increasingly distinct from them. And for better or worse, it’s changing what it means to be a fan — or an idol — online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dd1sTZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tc9A40"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: You might want to avoid the gobs of Halo Infinite spoilers Microsoft just leaked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7JvSqgRyyr1wHNYz5sTHMpSMzU0=/9x0:1805x1197/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69659239/haloinfinite.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jjNZiO"&gt;If you’re invested in the story of Master Chief, Cortana, and the fate of the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; universe, you might want to keep your head down and start muting some keywords on social media until &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;arrives later this year — because vast spoilers for the game’s entire story are now floating around on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15LuYi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: we’ll be keeping this post spoiler-free, though&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCXB8a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; creative director Joseph Staten &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joestaten?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1421244308766674947%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F30%2F22602811%2Fhalo-infinite-story-spoiler-leak-cortana-technical-preview"&gt;confirmed on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft accidentally leaked “a small number of Halo Infinite campaign files” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597498/halo-infinite-multiplayer-technical-preview-beta-july-29th"&gt;when it launched the game’s first multiplayer beta yesterday on July 29th&lt;/a&gt;, saying they “can ruin the campaign experience for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Leaks like this are painful for the dev team and can ruin the campaign experience for everyone. So please, keep you eyes peeled for spoilers and don't spread them if you see them.❤️ 2/2&lt;/p&gt;— Joseph Staten (@joestaten) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joestaten/status/1421244308766674947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="ykslJx"&gt;As far as we can tell, that’s no exaggeration — we found a plaintext dump on the web with over 800 strings of text that appear to be from &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s campaign. They seem to describe both your in-game objectives, and basic descriptions of the plot, all the way through the end of the story. (At least one of them literally describes a plot twist.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gcSJB"&gt;We’re not linking to the strings, though they’re not terribly hard to find if you really want to spoil the campaign. But if, instead, you’re trying to keep spoilers away, might we suggest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21144097/twitter-mute-tweets-word-name-tag-how-to-settings-phone-desktop"&gt;our guide on how to mute words on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o25dBQ"&gt;In lighter &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; news, developer 343 Industries recently revealed &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-has-drop-weapon-button-so-dont-kill-me-t-1847386144"&gt;you’ll finally have a “drop weapon” button&lt;/a&gt;, hopefully leading to fewer randos teamkilling you just to claim your sniper rifle.&lt;/p&gt;
