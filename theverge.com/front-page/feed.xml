    <title>Toyota to reduce production in Japan and North America due to chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K5Dv2a"&gt;Toyota said Thursday that it would &lt;a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/35741389.html"&gt;reduce production&lt;/a&gt; in Japan and North America due to a shortage of semiconductor chips, a sign that even the best-run supply chains are being affected by the shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKGkL0"&gt;In Japan, the automaker will reduce production by 40 percent later this month and into September, which will affect most of its production lines, the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/toyota-succumbs-to-chip-shortage-and-shuts-factories-11629372702"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;; planned reductions in North America will be between 40 and 60 percent in August. The reductions mean Toyota will produce between 60,000 and 90,000 fewer vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1epYY8"&gt;“Due to COVID-19 and unexpected events with our supply chain, Toyota is experiencing additional shortages that will affect production at most of our North American plants,” the company said in a statement. “While the situation remains fluid and complex, our manufacturing and supply chain teams have worked diligently to develop countermeasures to minimize the impact on production.” The company does not expect the disruptions in production to affect staffing levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NG6awS"&gt;“We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers and suppliers,” the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xRZbmw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The chip shortage will likely get worse before it gets better ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="highcharts-trriauc-0"&gt;Toyota is the latest automaker to alter its production plans because of the semiconductor shortage caused by COVID-19 related slowdowns at chipmakers’ plants. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/vw-says-might-have-cut-production-further-due-chip-shortage-2021-08-19/"&gt;Volkswagen also said Thursday&lt;/a&gt; it may have to cut production because of the chip shortage, and both &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/08/gm-cutting-production-at-several-plants-due-to-chip-shortage.html"&gt;Ford and General Motors said&lt;/a&gt; in the spring that they were idling or extending shutdowns at several of their North America plants. Tesla, meanwhile, said in July that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;rewriting its vehicles’ software&lt;/a&gt; to support alternative chips. But Tesla CEO Elon Musk said during an earnings call that “the global chip shortage situation remains quite serious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kmf901"&gt;Toyota had been mostly shielded from the chip shortage up to this point; as the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;noted in May, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/auto-makers-retreat-from-50-years-of-just-in-time-manufacturing-11620051251?mod=article_inline"&gt;Toyota made adjustments&lt;/a&gt; to its famously efficient supply chain to try to adapt. But with the delta variant of the coronavirus leading to an increase in infections globally, chip production will likely remain slow.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google secretly had a giant gaming vision that includes bringing games to Mac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8e0lvTg4_7XY1PRHup94yeOgtro=/0x0:1211x807/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69748239/google_gameplan_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zaoG72"&gt;Apple’s Mac has long been an afterthought for the video game industry, and few think of Google as a games company — despite running Android, one of the biggest game platforms in the world. But Google had a plan to change those things in October 2020, according to an explicitly confidential 70-page vision document dubbed “Games Futures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RrPgnN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sweetheart deals and plastic knives: all the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22375277"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Iraou7"&gt;The “need-to-know” document, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22375277"&gt;caught up in the discovery process&lt;/a&gt; when Epic Games hauled Apple into court, reveals a tentative five-year plan to create what Google dubbed “the world’s largest games platform.” Google imagined presenting game developers with a single place they can target gamers across multiple screens including Windows and Mac, as well as smart displays — all tied together by Google services and a “low-cost universal portable game controller” that gamers can pair with any device, even a TV.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mZy9GLr6fCUNgghkErs3OX53uB0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22791941/google_gameplan_3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vFQrG7E0LzrmFGqhDXNZL7B7op0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22789006/universal_controller_mobile_google.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3OwgTi"&gt;There’s some reason to be skeptical that this document reflects Google’s true direction: “Brought to you by ‘partially funded’ and ‘i have a dream’ productions,’” an early slide reads. And we know that Google lost some of its gaming ambition this February, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"&gt;when it decided to pull the plug on its original game studios&lt;/a&gt; for Google Stadia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sUaId"&gt;And yet, the heavily redacted document suggests that to start down this path, Google would first bring “emulated, native and streamed games” to Windows, something that no longer sounds far-fetched: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;Microsoft just announced in June that Android apps are coming to Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;, admittedly with Amazon’s Appstore as the initial partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXm8DU"&gt;If Google is actually going in this direction, you can get a glimpse of what to expect in the full 70-page document embedded below. It includes how Google would try to establish its Play Games brand as an “indie game destination,” bring roughly 100 of “the best of Android mobile games” to PC, require developers to support controllers and multiple platforms, and mandate minimum prices so it can attract “super-premium” games to the platform. There’s a lot that hasn’t been redacted, and it’s ambitious stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AgOw0J"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21044018-2025-2021-google-vision-game-plan-multiplatform/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="2025-2021-google-vision-game-plan-multiplatform (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="920" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WPcOJB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSimNR"&gt;And if you’d like more where that came from, you can find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22375277"&gt;our whole list of the best emails from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gK6mbQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMJaps"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUwYyq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBHoBD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new Foundation trailer has some serious ‘Game of Thrones but in space’ energy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/htOt2NDjRXJQdtwzpsiCqOGmHiw=/0x32:1828x1251/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69748186/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_8.52.49_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="miQG7D"&gt;Apple has released &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4QYV5GTz7c"&gt;a new trailer for &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, its upcoming epic sci-fi show for Apple TV Plus based on Isaac Asimov’s series of novels, and I’m getting some serious “&lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;but in space”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;energy from it. There are vast (space) vistas, a sweeping soundtrack, numerous shots of people making very serious faces, and dramatic proclamations that wouldn’t be out of place in an early episode of &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="B82vBj"&gt;“Wars will be endless.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OZiHUh"&gt;“Martyrs tend to have a long half-life.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DRso2D"&gt;“Change is frightening. Especially to those in power.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DDrqms"&gt;And you know what? That’s fine with me. For me, nothing has replicated the excellence of the first few seasons of &lt;em&gt;Game of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Thrones. &lt;/em&gt;Their gripping action, shocking twists, and captivating power struggles made every episode feel important, and I eagerly anticipated each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RovptT"&gt;Based on this trailer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553852/foundation-trailer-apple-tv-plus-premier-date"&gt;and the last one&lt;/a&gt;, Apple seems to be going for a similar vibe with &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;, and I’m looking forward to watching the show for myself to see if it recaptures that &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; magic. (If you’re looking for a short explainer about the &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; novels, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17223728/apple-foundation-trilogy-isaac-asimov-tv-show-david-goyer-josh-friedman"&gt;we’ve got one in this article&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="918P0x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; premieres on Apple TV Plus on September 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The pandemic revealed the health risks of hospital ransomware attacks  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MO5WESGeHfxxsYORf4dNbrV1D48=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69748110/acastro_180109_1777_0003_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A natural experiment in Vermont helped show the impacts&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="81dPMw"&gt;In late October 2020, the University of Vermont Health Network was hit by a ransomware attack. The system couldn’t access electronic health records for &lt;a href="https://healthitsecurity.com/news/uvm-health-brings-ehr-back-online-one-month-after-ransomware-attack"&gt;nearly a month&lt;/a&gt;. Every computer at UVM Medical Center was infected with malware. Hospitals in the network &lt;a href="https://threatpost.com/cyberattack-uvm-health-network/161059/"&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt; chemotherapy and mammogram appointments, just as COVID-19 cases in the United States started to tick upward in what would become an enormous winter wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hn4juj"&gt;Intuitively, cyberattacks on hospitals seem like they’d be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18293817/cybersecurity-hospitals-health-care-scan-simulation"&gt;dangerous for patients&lt;/a&gt;. Shutting down computer systems shuts off access to patient scans, can lock physicians out of tools they need to provide care, and creates backlogs in the operating systems. But despite years of attacks, there’s very little data on whether those disruptions actually caused harm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RRyU4"&gt;The specific circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, though, gave experts an opening to see what the UVM attack meant for patient care. Because hospital systems were already strained caring for COVID-19 patients, any additional stressors — like a ransomware attack — could be seen more clearly. So, when a team at the United States’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) scrutinized the data, they were able to show that patients did worse in hospitals navigating a cyberware attack than in hospitals that didn’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YdWeeD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We should stop pretending that there is no harm to human life from cyber attacks”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lIVMQx"&gt;The findings, which are still unpublished, should help push back on any groups hesitant to say that cyberattacks are dangerous for patients, says Josh Corman, a senior adviser to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568397/covid-vaccine-cybersecurity-cisa-task-force"&gt;CISA&lt;/a&gt;, the federal agency that advises on government and private sector cybersecurity issues. “We should stop pretending that there is no harm to human life from cyber attacks,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vZ7R8Z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data gaps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sAnHti"&gt;Data in the field is so thin that experts turn to marathons to make the argument that cyberattacks will harm patients. They often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18293817/cybersecurity-hospitals-health-care-scan-simulation"&gt;point to&lt;/a&gt; one particular bit of research: &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa1614073"&gt;a 2017 paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; that looked at emergency care during marathons in the United States. The study found people who had heart attacks during a marathon were at higher risk of death within a month than people who had heart attacks on other days, likely because it took longer for them to get the care they needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIKw6G"&gt;It’s not a perfect analogy, but like marathons (which close roads and cause delays for ambulances), ransomware attacks can force hospitals to divert ambulances or delay treatments. It’s one of the clearer pieces of evidence available. It has been hard to get a good picture of the same phenomenon during ransomware attacks because the numbers tend to be so small, says Mark Jarrett, chief quality officer at Northwell Health in New York. “You really need an approach that looks at data across the country, so you can get a large enough denominator that you’ll be able to get a numerator that really means something,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9ecZ3"&gt;Hospitals also tend to be tight-lipped about ransomware attacks. They &lt;a href="https://www.nj.com/business/2019/12/hackensack-meridian-hospital-chain-confirms-ransomware-attack-last-week.html"&gt;sometimes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21482304/ransomware-outage-hospital-chain-cybersecurity"&gt;go days&lt;/a&gt; before announcing that systems are down because of a cyberattack, and often &lt;a href="https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/cybersecurity/data-breaches/news/21153617/six-weeks-later-new-yorks-samaritan-health-still-recovering-from-malware-attack"&gt;don’t share&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/scripps-health-still-grappling-with-impact-of-may-1-ransomware-attack/"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.villages-news.com/2021/06/03/new-coo-takes-over-as-ransomware-attack-cripples-the-villages-hospital/"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; about the impact an attack is actually having on day-to-day operations. It would likely be a challenge to convince an organization to agree to any investigation into the impact of an attack on its patient care, says Sung Choi, assistant professor at the University of Central Florida department of health management and informatics who studies healthcare cybersecurity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hcrHHU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re very careful about releasing data on mortality, because that links directly to the reputation of the hospital”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vVDvqQ"&gt;“They’re very careful about releasing data on mortality, because that links directly to the reputation of the hospital,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9p3bIv"&gt;There hasn’t even been a close analysis of the potential health harms from the 2017 WannaCry cyberattack, which downed computers across the United Kingdom’s National Health Service and threw the system into chaos, Corman says. Just looking at stroke patients should give a sense of what the harm might have been, he says — if people having a stroke don’t make it to a health facility that can handle the emergency quickly, they’re more likely to have a bad outcome. During a few days of the WannaCry attack, there were no stroke centers open in London. “The official line is that no one died. It strains credulity,” he says. “There’s such a palpable, visceral reluctance to admit that we’ve lost lives because of cybersecurity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aODhm8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecting the dots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrDHod"&gt;The pandemic gave Corman and his team at CISA an opening to get a clearer picture of the harm caused by ransomware attacks. The work started with its analysis of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/14/us/covid-19-death-toll.html"&gt;excess death&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic. Excess deaths, which count the number of deaths above normal during a given time of the year, help outline the true toll of an event like a COVID-19 outbreak — it helps show COVID-19 deaths that may have not been counted in the official toll, and how many people may have died because of disruptions in their care during the chaos of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzAEdB"&gt;The team was interested in trying to figure out ways to predict when there might be excess deaths regionally or nationally. Normally, when hospitals get overburdened because of a local emergency, they’re able to divert ambulances, reschedule surgeries, and lean on the other healthcare resources in the community. There’s slack in the system to make that possible. Eventually, they might reach a point where they weren’t able to provide adequate care to the people they were treating, but it would take a long time to reach that point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgwxX8"&gt;But during COVID-19 outbreaks, every hospital was under stress. “No one could absorb anything,” Corman says. “Regions could shift through this more quickly.” They’d reach a point where there were too many patients to handle faster than normal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnmmnZ"&gt;In their analysis, the CISA team figured out that once an area had a certain percentage of intensive care unit beds filled, they were more likely to start to see excess deaths two, four, and six weeks later. It was an inflection point — a strong indicator that the area was approaching a capacity issue that would tip over into higher death rates, Corman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zDLhDC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was a natural experiment in the state”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OYIxQB"&gt;With that metric in mind, the CISA team looked at the excess death data in the state of Vermont during the UVM ransomware attack. “It was a natural experiment in the state,” Corman says. They found that during the same time period, with the pandemic going on in the background, hospitals affected by the ransomware attack reached that inflection point earlier than unaffected hospitals and remained there longer. “You’re reaching that danger zone where you’re going to see excess deaths two, four, and six weeks later more quickly,” he says. “Water is wet, fire is hot, and we can now tell that cyber disruption introduces degraded or delayed patient care.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mX6DWB"&gt;Data scientists working on the project also think Vermont was the best-case scenario, Corman says — in other states with poorer overall health, the effect might be more dramatic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbNtGt"&gt;The UVM Medical Center did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w48rAi"&gt;The pandemic created an environment where the CISA team was able to see the impact of ransomware more easily — excess deaths were already so high that the trends and patterns were easy to pick out. The same patterns, though, likely hold true outside of the pandemic, Corman says. A ransomware attack puts stress on a hospital system, delaying care, which could lead to bad outcomes. The impact may be less dramatic when there isn’t another emergency, but experts could use the same framework to scrutinize ransomware attacks at any time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vpkpqk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a quantitative picture of how ransomware affects patient health could help spur organizations dragging their heels on cybersecurity into action&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yhVD38"&gt;The CISA analysis is still ongoing and circulating through the federal government, and Corman isn’t sure when the final conclusions will be published. But having a quantitative picture of how ransomware affects patient health could help spur organizations dragging their heels on cybersecurity into action, Northwell Health’s Jarrett says. “Patient safety should always be driven by data, so having the data will make a big difference.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1A00a"&gt;Data from CISA could be a good first step. Jarrett hopes there could also be analysis of harm to patients who don’t necessarily die, but who have worse health outcomes because of delays in their care. “Not everyone dies, thankfully,” he says. But a heart attack patient who isn’t seen quickly enough could have permanent damage. “Your health going forward is not going to be the same level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="1zofjk"&gt;Any hospital facing down a ransomware attack should do their own analysis of what went wrong and what the implications were for patients, Jarrett says. “Clinicians in general tend to think of this as an information technology issue, and it really isn’t. It’s a patient safety issue.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC says Facebook has been a monopoly ‘since at least 2011’ in amended antitrust complaint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SycXJmpiUoH2WDxxj3-g3fucw3w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747985/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="auMO0T"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission has filed &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21045875-facebook-revised-ftc-complaint"&gt;an amended antitrust complaint against Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that the company violated federal antitrust laws with its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp. The new complaint is a more detailed version of a charge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court"&gt;dismissed by the court in June&lt;/a&gt; for insufficient evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iF9MNw"&gt;“Facebook has today, and has maintained since 2011, a dominant share of the relevant market for US personal social networking services,” the complaint alleges, citing time spent and active-user metrics on the daily and monthly scale. “Individually and collectively, these metrics provide significant evidence of Facebook’s durable monopoly power in social networking services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AF60pB"&gt;Facebook has until October 4th to issue a legal response to the complaint. In a post on Twitter, Facebook’s corporate account said the company was reviewing the complaint and “will have more to say soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BV6VIb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook has today, and has maintained since 2011, a dominant share of the relevant market”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oW3sSj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization"&gt;First filed in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;, the FTC alleges that Facebook’s acquisitions of competing networks gave it monopoly power over social network services in the US. But the following June, the court dismissed the complaint, finding that the commission had failed to provide sufficient evidence that Facebook had monopoly power in social networks. However, the court gave the FTC an opportunity to file an amended complaint that addressed the concerns, eventually setting the deadline &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-ftc-asks-more-time-file-amended-complaint-facebook-case-2021-07-23/"&gt;for August 19th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udBnmO"&gt;Together with the amended complaint, the FTC also made clear that chair Lina Khan will continue to play an active role in the case. In July, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;called on Khan&lt;/a&gt; to recuse herself from the agency’s lawsuit against the company based on her, based on her legal scholarship. “For the entirety of her professional career, Chair Khan has consistently and very publicly concluded that Facebook is guilty of violating the antitrust laws,” the company said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUFGhK"&gt;That effort appears to have been unsuccessful. “As the case will be prosecuted before a federal judge, the appropriate constitutional due process protections will be provided to the company,” the agency said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leah_nylen/status/1428380607957045250?s=20"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ufWtUE"&gt;In particular, the new complaint contains a more rigorous definition of personal social networks, the market in which Facebook holds the alleged monopoly. The new complaint explicitly distinguishes Facebook from services like TikTok, which broadcast content, but do not provide an explicitly social space. The FTC’s definition also excludes services like Twitter and Reddit that share information among communities with specific interests but “do not focus on connecting friends and family.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xa7VJ5"&gt;The complaint cites a number of internal messages to establish that Facebook understands this difference, although the specific content of the messages is redacted in the public version of the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wc6gfc"&gt;“Facebook... has been the dominant provider of such services since at least 2011,” the complaint concludes. “Further, Facebook Blue and Instagram are the two largest personal social networking services in the United States.” By the FTC’s definition, Facebook’s only significant competitor in the space is Snapchat, although defunct providers include Friendster, Myspace, Google+, and Path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RT9H6J"&gt;Once that market is defined, the complaint relies heavily on attention metrics to establish Facebook’s dominance — particularly monthly active users (MAUs), daily active users (DAUs) and time spent on-site — citing similar cases in Australia, Germany and the United Kingdom that have based their claims on those metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHeB7L"&gt;One weakness of this approach is that both Facebook and Instagram can serve multiple functions, raising the possibility that some of the metrics are in fact reflecting use of Facebook as a photo-sharing service, messaging platform, or other non-social purpose. But the FTC claims Facebook’s advantage by those metrics is so dominant as to swamp any alternative uses of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORVYi6"&gt;“Even if one were to assume, &lt;em&gt;arguendo&lt;/em&gt;, that half of the time that U.S. users spend on Facebook Blue and Instagram was not in fact spent using personal social networking services,” the FTC reasons, “Facebook would still have maintained a dominant share of the U.S. personal social networking market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KYyQk"&gt;In a particularly striking turn, the new complaint also makes the case that Facebook’s continued success in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal (and associated settlements) show’s how implacable the company has become. “Facebook’s ability to harm users by decreasing product quality, without losing significant user engagement, indicates that Facebook has market power,” the complaint reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSoJ9M"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Tesla’s AI day event </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zFPgb1hWmFA6kP1Emyr-uc25Ov0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747879/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZDnSUn"&gt;Today is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22627101/tesla-event-ai-day-rumors-elon-musk-what-to-expect"&gt;Tesla’s AI Day&lt;/a&gt;, a sequel of sorts to the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18510828/tesla-elon-musk-autonomy-day-investor-comments-self-driving-cars-predictions"&gt;Autonomy Day&lt;/a&gt; event held in 2019. The event, which will be held at Tesla’s headquarters in Palo Alto, CA, &lt;a href="https://livestream.tesla.com/"&gt;will be livestreamed for the public&lt;/a&gt; starting at 5PM PT / 8PM ET (though the event may not actually begin until closer to 5:30PM PT). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O23w6E"&gt;We don’t have a lot of details about what will be announced, but based on the invitation, we’ll get a keynote address by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, hardware and software demos from Tesla engineers, test rides in the Model S Plaid, and “more.” Musk has also tweeted that the “sole goal” of the event is to lure experts in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence to come work at Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YriMOi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla has been holding events to highlight certain technologies that the company views as essential to its future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yZD9Yb"&gt;Tesla usually holds around two public events a year. This year, we got the Tesla Model S Plaid launch event in June, and now AI Day. Over the past few years, Tesla has been holding events, not to unveil new products, but to highlight certain technologies that the company views as crucial to its future development. Last year, Tesla held its first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21450840/tesla-battery-day-production-elon-musk-tabless-range-cathode-cobalt-plaid"&gt;Battery Day event&lt;/a&gt;, at which it discussed plans to drive down the cost of battery development with the goal of producing a $25,000 electric car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tfSJ58"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What to expect from Tesla’s AI day event","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22627101/tesla-event-ai-day-rumors-elon-musk-what-to-expect"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ywbAs5"&gt;AI Day is expected to pick up on the themes first introduced during Autonomy Day, which include the manufacturing of Tesla’s own silicon computer chips to power it’s Full Self-Driving advanced driver assistance feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXcb56"&gt;This AI Day comes at an awkward time for the company. Earlier this week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;investigating Tesla’s Autopilot&lt;/a&gt; for the nearly dozen incidents in which its cars crashed into emergency vehicles. Two Democratic senators also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630954/markey-blumenthal-ftc-lina-khan-tesla-full-self-driving-musk"&gt;called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate&lt;/a&gt; Tesla’s marketing practices for potentially misleading information. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Battery power capacity in the US grew big time in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Electric Cooperative Connexus Energy Builds Minnesota’s First Large-Scale Energy Storage System" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PVor0NaPIkGzDpZ47Cxa1cUOFLs=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747812/1031531618.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qibmO"&gt;2020 was a big year for big batteries in the US, which is crucial for getting grids to run on more renewable energy. Power capacity — a measure of how much power a battery can instantly discharge — for large-scale batteries grew at an unprecedented pace in the US last year, according to an annual &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/electricity/batterystorage/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released this week by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HmkjbJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;2020 smashed the previous record set in 2018&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NcHGs2"&gt;2020 smashed the previous record set in 2018 for the biggest growth in power capacity in the US with 489MW of large-scale battery storage added. That’s more than twice what was added in 2018. By the end of last year, there was 1,523MW of large-scale battery power capacity in the US. For comparison, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.sunpower.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fcs-solar-star-projects-fact-sheet_0.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F19%2F22632172%2Flarge-battery-power-capacity-us-grew-2020" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;largest solar farm in the US&lt;/a&gt; has a capacity of 579MW and can generate enough electricity for about 255,000 homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ao0swK"&gt;That’s all good news for renewable energy, but way more batteries are needed to clean up the electricity grid. “It’s great that it’s growing. But by the scale of the grid, it’s still a pretty small drop in the bucket,” says Gerbrand Ceder, a professor of materials science and engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. For perspective, Ceder says, the total battery power capacity in the US at the end of 2020 is still “no bigger than one or two big power plants.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="u4dA3T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Still a pretty small drop in the bucket”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LYIFEK"&gt;Batteries store renewable energy so it can be used when winds lull and sunlight dims. They’re also a clean &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KQEt5QqPXU"&gt;alternative to fossil-fueled “peaker plants”&lt;/a&gt; that come online periodically to provide extra juice when there’s high demand. Big batteries can also step in when a disaster knocks another power source offline. So on top of cutting down greenhouse gas emissions, they can make the grid more reliable and resilient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYDsrm"&gt;Electricity is currently responsible for a quarter of &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions"&gt;greenhouse gas emissions in the US&lt;/a&gt;. But a clean grid could tackle emissions from other sectors like transportation and heating as cars, homes, and buildings go all-electric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e868RZ"&gt;The Biden administration has set a target of making the power sector “carbon pollution-free” by 2035, in an effort to slow down the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;already catastrophic effects&lt;/a&gt; of climate change. That can be achieved by turning to renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Or the goal could potentially be met through a combination of renewables plus more controversial carbon-free energy from nuclear plants and fossil-fueled power plants paired with technology that captures carbon dioxide from their emissions. But with concerns about the cost, safety, and pollution from nuclear energy and carbon capture strategies, many environmental advocates hope batteries can ensure that there’s a bigger proportion of renewable energy feeding the grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="10g4JL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery storage costs have tumbled&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iPbtt7"&gt;Battery storage costs have tumbled 72 percent since 2015, the EIA found, which helps explain why the vast majority of large-scale battery storage power capacity available today only came online within the past six years. Electric vehicles have helped drive down lithium-ion battery costs in the power sector, according to Ceder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcJ5mf"&gt;As costs fall, battery power capacity is forecast to grow quickly in the coming years. There’s 10,000MW of large-scale battery storage on the way from now until 2023, according to what utilities have reported to the EIA. That’s ten times the capacity there was in 2019, and most of it will be paired with solar power generators.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New test brings Reels to Facebook in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vw7IIBu85S66RPrxpBN4NAYlab8=/1x0:2047x1364/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747533/facebookreels.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FaJ78t"&gt;Facebook in the US is going to look slightly more like TikTok for some users. Today, the company announced that it’s testing Facebook Reels stateside, which will bring the short-form, TikTok-like videos to the platform. These will show up for some users in the News Feed and within Groups, where people can watch them together. (The company is already testing this in India, Mexico, and Canada, and the US limited rollout is just an extension of that test.) As part of this test, Instagram users will also be able to cross-post their reels to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQPzK6"&gt;People can watch and create reels from the Facebook app, and the feature is designed to give people a way to “express themselves, discover entertaining content, and to help creators broaden their reach.” As justification for the test, Facebook says nearly half of time spent on the app is dedicated to watching videos, and that Reels is growing “especially quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yG05R4"&gt;Of course, the remaining question is whether people will dedicate time to making this type of content, specifically for Facebook. Facebook’s competitors, like Snapchat, have paid people to do so, with Snap at one point spending $1 million per day to incentivize creation for its Spotlight feature. YouTube also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429350/youtube-shorts-fund-video-payments-tiktok-competitor"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its Shorts Fund, which will see the company pay out $100 million throughout the next year to creators who make content for its TikTok competitor. Facebook has said it’ll spend $1 billion on Facebook and Instagram creators through 2022, but adds today that it’ll also “roll out additional bonus programs and seed funding” in the coming months, particularly aimed at Facebook Reels. If anything can get people to make content, it’s the promise of a potentially big payout. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bird’s new electric bike looks like a VanMoof, and you can buy it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JOa7dvbK3ONJOkWD_U_R-7_CzgQ=/0x1:2468x1646/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747472/Bird_Bike_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pL41Q1"&gt;Shared electric scooter company Bird is branching out into new two-wheeled vehicles, namely electric bikes. A few months after it introduced its first shared e-bike, the company announced that it would also offer its own e-bike for sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="te7Fvp"&gt;The bike, dubbed Bird Bike of course, has a 500W rear hub motor, a Gates carbon belt drive, pedal- and throttle-assisted power, and the relatively modest sticker price of $2,299. Design-wise, the bike looks very similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof’s popular e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;, with a slightly elongated top tube and embedded front and rear lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7P65L1"&gt;Bird, which was the first company to introduce shared electric scooters in a US city, has always flirted with the idea of e-bikes. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20926658/bird-scoot-electric-moped-la-cruiser-specs-speed"&gt;first rolled out its Scoot-branded electric mopeds&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles in 2019 but was forced to pause the Cruiser program because of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="952etA"&gt;Last May, the company announced that it was going public by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428864/bird-electric-scooter-spac-public-valuation"&gt;merging with a SPAC called Switchback II&lt;/a&gt;. In its &lt;a href="https://www.bird.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bird-Investor-Presentation.pdf"&gt;pitch to investors&lt;/a&gt;, the company included an image of a shrouded bicycle next to several graphs charting the meteoric rise in e-bike sales in the US. “Coming soon,” the graphic promised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CpkEsX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the Bird Bike looks to be a more powerful option compared to the shared e-bikes the company plans on rolling out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2FCZSw"&gt;Based on the spec list, the Bird Bike looks to be a more powerful option compared to the shared e-bikes the company plans on rolling out to select cities in the US and Europe later this year. The rear-hub motor is made by Bafang and will come in 500W (for the US) and 250W (for Europe) configurations. The 36v / 12.8Ah battery is removable for easy charging and, based on the power setting, should provide up to 50 miles of range. Using pedal assist, the bike can reach a top speed of 20mph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PYSDFO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10709218"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vNzJ50"&gt;The Gates carbon belt drive, which is quickly becoming a popular choice among bike manufacturers, is a cleaner alternative to the derailleur and chain ring and requires less maintenance. The tires, which are made by Kenda, are puncture resistant. And the bike can be connected to the Bird app via Bluetooth, where customers can turn the lights on or off and see the battery range and miles ridden. (This information is also available on the bike’s LCD panel display on the handlebars.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qHpAX"&gt;The bike comes in two colors, stealth black and gravity gray. It’s also available in a step-over and a step-through frame type. The company says it expects the bike to be “broadly available” this fall in the US and Europe. Bird also is one of the few shared scooter companies to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448941/bird-air-electric-scooter-announce-price-specs"&gt;sell personally owned scooters as well&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZvI6K"&gt;Bird’s decision to add e-bikes to its product lineup coincides with Lime’s recent moves to expand its own fleet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409409/lime-electric-moped-nyc-price-announce"&gt;such as with the addition of electric mopeds&lt;/a&gt;. While both companies are mostly known for their electric kick scooters, there is a growing sense among micromobility providers that the more varied your vehicle lineup is, the better your chances are at becoming a financially soluble business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KL34fX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vvJynN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9hf8Z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox game The Vale transports you to a medieval world through sound</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Title screen of The Vale, showing Alex, the player character, holding a sword and shield as she stands in shadow in front of a dark, red-tinted landscape." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zyP5O70DhQAHe56jwQ-pAD08wWg=/37x0:3637x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747442/TheVale_Title_Landscape.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Title screen of The Vale: Shadow of the Crown.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Falling Squirrel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kd0Lp6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vale: Shadow of the Crown&lt;/em&gt;, an audio-based adventure game by indie studio Falling Squirrel, is available on Xbox and PC today for $19.99. The game was developed in collaboration with the Canadian National Institute for the Blind, and made for and tested by blind and low-vision players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhHICz"&gt;Players navigate a medieval setting as Alex, the blind second heir to a kingdom, who is on her way to the borderlands when her caravan is attacked by enemy soldiers. Left on her own, Alex has to travel the land, find weapons, learn spells, and fight enemies without sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsenFo"&gt;Besides menus, which are presented in text and through audio description, the only visuals in &lt;em&gt;The Vale &lt;/em&gt;are colored specks that float across a black screen. The behavior of the specks changes based on what’s happening in different scenes; they’ll turn blue and fall during rain or imitate floating embers when Alex comes across a burning village. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSaNq2"&gt;Without visual information, the player has to listen to the sounds of the environment when moving around. The gameplay relies on 3D audio, so headphones are required. You move in the direction of clanging metal to find the smithy, or toward little squeaks and nibbles to find rats to squash in the inn’s basement. During combat, you raise your shield or swing your sword to the right, left, or forward depending on where you hear the enemy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j143yx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ACFQ7WlXF9c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="It10hh"&gt;I played about an hour of &lt;em&gt;The Vale &lt;/em&gt;on PC. I’m not blind, but I found several of the gameplay elements refreshing. I get overwhelmed easily by games that introduce lots of controls up front, so it was nice to have a voice in my ear explaining which buttons to press and when. It was also handy to be able to close my eyes when the rain animation started making me motion sick, something I can’t do in most games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNIeDg"&gt;The voice acting and sound design are lively, serving both as narrative tools and navigational cues. When choosing between side quests, you make your decisions based on vignettes of conversations, rather than reading through walls of text. Certain elements like inventory management and weapon upgrades are simplified in a way that doesn’t sacrifice the game’s RPG feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KFHeJ"&gt;There are a few things that could make &lt;em&gt;The Vale&lt;/em&gt; more accessible, like remappable controls and captions. While it’s made for people with visual impairments, and makes strides in that area, there are players with both low vision and other disabilities who would benefit from those options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSUMss"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vale&lt;/em&gt; is hopefully a sign of more blind accessible games to come. Immersive, engaging games that forgo conventional game mechanics mean more variety for all kinds of players. &lt;/p&gt;
