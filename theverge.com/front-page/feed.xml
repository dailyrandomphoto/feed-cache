    <title>Apple is appealing the Epic Games ruling it originally called a ‘resounding victory’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MLqbF_7rzq06FAtpQZR2811Ubok=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69972129/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HXBaCg"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business"&gt;potentially billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; and some control over the App Store at stake, Apple has filed for an appeal of the ruling in its major trial against Epic. While Apple largely won that case (the company went so far as to call the ruling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667769/apple-epic-lost-lawsuit-verdict-ruling"&gt;a “resounding victory”&lt;/a&gt;) with Judge Gonzalez Rogers ruling in favor of Apple in nine of the ten claims Epic brought against the company, it did lose on one important point: the judge found that Apple violated California’s anti-steering rules, and demanded that Apple let developers link to outside payment systems. That policy would have taken over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;, but it may be pushed out beyond that — and it seems that’s the point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzMH0j"&gt;As part of the appeal, Apple is asking for a stay to prevent the company from having to implement the new anti-steering rules, arguing that it “will allow Apple to protect consumers and safeguard its platform while the company works through the complex and rapidly evolving legal, technological, and economic issues.” And the company’s arguments there are pretty revealing if we’re reading the document right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yxijeu"&gt;For instance, Apple claims that the new anti-steering rule is unnecessary because the company had already agreed to delete the offending section of its App Store Guidelines in the &lt;em&gt;Cameron v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;settlement, but that’s news to us: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;at the time&lt;/a&gt;, Apple only agreed to “clarify” that app developers were allowed to communicate with consenting customers, not link to outside payment systems, something widely seen by developers as a red herring. At the time, Apple didn’t say anything about deleting a section of its App Store Guidelines entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yPUaOe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple and Epic both lost today","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667769/apple-epic-lost-lawsuit-verdict-ruling"},{"title":"The future of the App Store depends on the difference between a ‘button’ and an ‘external link’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"},{"title":"What comes next for the App Store?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671574/epic-apple-app-store-new-rules-meaning-ruling-decision"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fPZLBZ"&gt;It also seems like Apple is genuinely afraid that the court order &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; force them to open up the App Store to alternate payment mechanisms, despite what some Apple pundits have claimed. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"&gt;A button might actually be a button&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="32fHay"&gt;Links and buttons to alternate payment mechanisms are fraught with risk. Users who click on a payment link embedded in an app—particularly one distributed through the curated App Store—will expect to be led to a webpage where they can securely provide their payment information, email address, or other personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2k0SHS"&gt;Apple goes on to argue that if it were forced to allow app developers to link to external payment systems, it wouldn’t be able to protect users from fraud: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="07eXrO"&gt;While Apple could examine the links in the version of the app submitted for review, there is nothing stopping a developer from changing the landing point for that link or altering the content of the destination webpage. Additionally, Apple currently has no ability to determine whether a user who clicks on an external link actually received the products or features she paid for. Apple already receives hundreds of thousands of reports each day from users, and allowing links to external payment options would only increase this burden. In essence, the introduction of external payment links, particularly without sufficient time to test and evaluate the security implications, will lead to the very same security concerns that Apple combats with the use of IAP more generally, which the Court agreed were legitimate, procompetitive reasons for the design of the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="MWuSv8"&gt;The company even cites a blog post from (and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s story about) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714677/apple-in-app-payment-competitor-paddle-epic-ruling"&gt;Paddle, a would-be rival to Apple’s in-app payments that emerged after the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;ruling&lt;/a&gt;, using it to illustrate one possible threat to consumers. Not because of its lower fees, of course, but because “In contrast to Apple’s strict rules surrounding privacy, that developer intends to provide access to user email addresses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSOivG"&gt;Other arguments are raised as well, which you can read in full in the document embedded at the bottom of this post. Overall, the company says that the “precipitous implementation of this aspect of the injunction would upset the careful balance between developers and customers provided by the App Store, and would irreparably harm both Apple and consumers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCH4s7"&gt;Apple also cites a previous case, &lt;em&gt;Ohio v. AmEx&lt;/em&gt;, as evidence that transaction platforms like the App Store can promote competition despite steering restrictions. (AmEx doesn’t double as a software marketplace, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ay66qJ"&gt;It’s important to note that Apple has only filed for appeal; we don’t know if the court will grant the appeal — and the stay— just yet. When the ruling originally hit in in September, Apple said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671736/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-case-ruling-appeal-decision"&gt;at the time&lt;/a&gt; that it hadn’t decided whether to appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xc5yqh"&gt;For its part, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667208/epic-games-appeal-apple-judge-rogers-ruling-court"&gt;Epic announced its intent to appeal&lt;/a&gt; on the same day Judge Gonzalez Rogers issued her order and permanent injunction against Apple. It was clear from the beginning that Epic wasn’t happy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My new favorite Twitter account just posts classic clips of SNL hosts introducing the musical guest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7mufD9k3LYKu7FHt-9pYz5MqWt4=/0x0:597x398/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69971858/Screen_Shot_2021_10_08_at_2.31.36_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sean Penn introducing LL Cool J on Saturday Night Live.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/snlhostsintro/status/1446297346136940550" target="_blank"&gt;@snlhostsintro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Erdz0K"&gt;The highlight of my Friday so far has been the discovery of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snlhostsintro"&gt;@snlhostsintro Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, which posts old clips of Saturday Night Live hosts introducing the musical guest. While the account isn’t new to everyone — it was created in September and already has more than 37,000 followers — I felt it was my duty to write about it because it posts some absolutely magical time capsules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58DyL4"&gt;Here’s a tame one to start, to give you an idea of the format: former US vice president Al Gore &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snlhostsintro/status/1443312858054344706"&gt;introducing Phish&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k3nNkv"&gt;But how about Sean Penn, with a casually-yet-confidently undone bow tie, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snlhostsintro/status/1446297346136940550"&gt;introducing LL Cool J&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vCk50G"&gt;Here’s Bernadette Peters &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snlhostsintro/status/1446281173399793664?s=20"&gt;introducing The Go-Go’s&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WRtr1U"&gt;And Christine Baranski &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snlhostsintro/status/1443672902012833821?s=20"&gt;enthusiastically introducing&lt;/a&gt; the notoriously downbeat band The Cure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1I4s59"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3Epkkc"&gt;I also love Nathan Lane doing perhaps the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snlhostsintro/status/1436582941174337539"&gt;most metal SNL musical guest introduction ever&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r4idoK"&gt;Part of the magic of the account is that there’s no context posted with any of the tweets. Whenever I click a new video, I &lt;em&gt;cannot wait&lt;/em&gt; to see who the host is going to introduce and how they are going to introduce them. The cognitive dissonance between the host and the band can be delicious — I can’t imagine &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snlhostsintro/status/1446271668788236296"&gt;John McCain and The White Stripes&lt;/a&gt; were all that chummy backstage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fFmNzc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/Fab3Neo3mp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Fab3Neo3mp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— SNL Hosts Introducing the Musical Guest (@snlhostsintro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snlhostsintro/status/1446271668788236296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T6szrJ"&gt;The account is almost surely inspired by the massive popularity of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/craigweekend"&gt;@CraigWeekend&lt;/a&gt;, which posts the same video of Daniel Craig introducing The Weeknd &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CraigWeekend/status/1444071879455776773"&gt;every Friday&lt;/a&gt;. While that account has nearly 500,000 followers and seems to fill up my timeline weekly, Craig only recently learned of the existence of the meme during &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/movies/daniel-craig-no-time-to-die.html"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wReaV8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As we are speaking, it’s a Friday afternoon, and I am about to see my social media feeds populated with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/03/style/craig-weekend-daniel-craig.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a video of you declaring it to be the weekend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Has the popularity of this gotten back to you in any way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzbVF4"&gt;No, what is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9oiPn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a clip of you from that “Saturday Night Live” you hosted, introducing the Weeknd with almost a sense of relief. People just like to post that clip as a way of ushering in the weekend.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUD1Yd"&gt;They do? It’s amazing. I don’t know what that is, but thank you. That’s lovely. I suppose I’d have to have social media to know what that was all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VjMUFh"&gt;We’re still waiting for this week’s @CraigWeekend post, so it just doesn’t feel like the weekend yet. But if you want to get excited for the weekend now, here’s last week’s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YwGYIK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/K0dlMofctj"&gt;pic.twitter.com/K0dlMofctj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ladies and gentlemen, the weekend   (@CraigWeekend) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CraigWeekend/status/1444071879455776773?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Facebook is trying to stop the sale of Amazon rainforest land on its Marketplace</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Large estate land management in Amazon rain forest,..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fCefAUBz4cNqyGi0hM1pNBH8MdA=/0x0:3504x2336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69971768/1235080881.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ricardo Beliel/Brazil Photos/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kqXEDb"&gt;Did you know you can sell land on Facebook Marketplace? No? Neither did I. Did you know people were trying to sell land in the Amazon rainforest on Marketplace? Again, neither did I! Selling land in ecological conservation areas is typically illegal and can have negative impacts on the flora, fauna, and people living there, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/curbing-amazon-land-listings-on-marketplace/"&gt;so Facebook announced Friday&lt;/a&gt; that it’s changing its commerce policies to explicitly prohibit the sale of protected land on Facebook and its Instagram and WhatsApp platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABHzYn"&gt;Facebook’s announcement comes after &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56168844"&gt;a February BBC investigation into its Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; that found people illegally sold large plots of land in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest on Facebook’s Craigslist alternative. The plots were frequently sold without an official land title designating ownership, driven by the deforestation of the Amazon caused by the Brazilian cattle industry, the BBC found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UOzuwz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Amazon is no longer for sale (on Facebook)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P46KPc"&gt;The social network didn’t want to independently stop the illegal sale of land in the Amazon initially because Facebook’s “commerce policies require buyers and sellers to comply with laws and regulations,” the company told the BBC in February. Now several months (and scandals) later, Facebook is taking a harder stance. “Listings may not promote the buying or selling of animals or animal products, or land in ecological conservation areas,” &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/policies_center/commerce/animals"&gt;Facebook’s updated policy reads&lt;/a&gt;. The company also plans to cross-reference listings against a database of protected land to identify anyone that violates its policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rc18X"&gt;The move is ultimately a good one, even if it's delayed. It’s just the timing that makes it strange. In the last few weeks, Facebook’s dealt with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;leaked research&lt;/a&gt;, a whistleblower &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;actively calling out&lt;/a&gt; the company’s supposed hypocrisy, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;a major global outage&lt;/a&gt;. Stopping the sale of the Amazon rainforest is just a strange cherry on Facebook’s shitty, multi-week sundae.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says outage affecting Instagram, Messenger, and more has been fixed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uoblHBIDaBQyhHx9ouY4ncr03RY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69971030/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0RYsoW"&gt;Facebook says it has fixed an outage that lasted for about two hours across some of its services on Friday. The outage, which Facebook says was caused by a configuration change, impacted Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and Workplace and affected people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6RsiDZ"&gt;“We’re so sorry if you weren’t able to access our products during the last couple of hours,”  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Facebook/status/1446585486605160448"&gt;Facebook said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. “We know how much you depend on us to communicate with one another. We fixed the issue — thanks again for your patience this week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hxDk4"&gt;The outage follows a massive one on Monday, which took down Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Oculus for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;nearly six hours&lt;/a&gt;. In an explanation posted the day after, Facebook said the backbone connecting the company’s data centers around the world &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710963/facebook-dns-bgp-outage-backbone-maintenance"&gt;was inadvertently shut down&lt;/a&gt;. The outage was extensive enough that it even broke &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709575/facebook-outage-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;internal systems used by Facebook employees&lt;/a&gt;, forcing them to turn to company-provided Outlook accounts to communicate instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TaZmd1"&gt;Friday’s outage was not related to the one that took place Monday, Facebook says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCz60d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 8th, 5:24PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Updated to reflect that the outage has been fixed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If you want to use the Apple Watch Series 7’s new fast charging, make sure to use the cable in the box</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TFzmi6Ppf8-Ek9wq06qiHdRiaw8=/74x0:820x497/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69971643/Capto_Capture_2021_09_14_01_24_25_PM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KhEdj0"&gt;One of the best features on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt; is its newly added fast charging system, which Apple claims is 33 percent and capable of charging the watch to about 80 percent charge in about 45 minutes. But if you want to take advantage of the fast charging, you’ll need to make sure to use the charger that comes with the Series 7, which is a brand new “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMLWJ3AM%2FA%2Fapple-watch-magnetic-fast-charger-to-usb-c-cable-1-m&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22716294%2Fapple-watch-series-7-fast-charging-cable-magnetic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Magnetic Fast Charger&lt;/a&gt;” that’s different from the old model (which doesn’t offer similar charging speeds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQsaH0"&gt;The old USB-C charger and the new model look identical from the outside, but only the new cable can charge the Series 7 at full speed (assuming you’ve got a USB-C charger that can put out the proper wattage, that is — Apple recommends its own 20W USB-C charger, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6tihBM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Make sure to actually use the cable that comes with the Series 7&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wRBb8G"&gt;And while Apple has already stopped selling the old USB-C charger that doesn’t offer fast charging on its site, they’re still available from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Magnetic-Charger-USB-C/dp/B07XR9TYQ1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;other retailers like Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, so you’ll want to make sure you’re buying the right one if you’re looking to pick up a spare. It also means that if you own an existing Apple Watch charging dock or stand that has a built-in charger, you won’t be able to take advantage of the faster charging available on the Series 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lquMvi"&gt;Of course, none of this matters if you own an older Apple Watch: even if you’re using the proper fast charging cable, the fast charging technology still needs a Series 7 watch to work. As Apple’s website notes: “Fast charging is only compatible with Apple Watch Series 7. Other models will have regular charge times.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Reader is still defunct, but now you can ‘follow’ RSS feeds in Chrome on Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mYh3waDQNxFaVXh14kN9NjB_EAE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69971416/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uexd8M"&gt;Google Reader &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/13/4101144/google-shuts-down-reader-rss-aggregation-service"&gt;is still defunct&lt;/a&gt;, but its spirit lives on in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445284/google-rss-chrome-android-feature-test"&gt;a “follow button”&lt;/a&gt; for Chrome that Google first started experimenting with in May. The RSS tracking feature was limited to the experimental Canary versions of Chrome on Android, but today the company has started enabling it on stable versions of the browser, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/__apf__/status/1446503789586894850?s=20"&gt;according to Adrienne Porter Felt&lt;/a&gt;, a director of engineering on Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4biG0"&gt;You can follow a site through the browser’s three-dot menu to subscribe to its RSS feed and have it update in your Chrome app. Sites you’re following will appear in a tab called “following,” which sits along Google’s “for you” tab of recommended articles. The feature isn’t out yet on iOS, so I’m not able to check it out on my phone, but Felt shared some screenshots of what it looks like on Android so you can get an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Ca4WRly8AspM6-JbzS7iiyil4Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911040/ChromeFollow.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/__apf__/status/1446503789586894850?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;Adrienne Porter Felt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Follow button aggregates content from an RSS feed into cards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="btggla"&gt;It’s not clear how many people already have access to the new feature by default, but you can enable it yourself by entering chrome://flags in your address bar and turning it on under web feed, Felt writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rkNRQ"&gt;The Chrome follow button is currently a mobile-only feature (iOS and desktop versions &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/__apf__/status/1446555070892429316?s=20"&gt;are coming&lt;/a&gt;), which will surely disappoint some Google Reader power users. Still, it’s at least nice to see Google keeping the RSS fire alive in some fashion. It makes the Chrome app even more crowded in terms of features, but if you were looking for a free, low-fuss way to keep up with some of your favorite sites, it seems like Google is once again willing to be that option.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the Pixel 6 Pro get put together and taken apart in leaked videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0wXTaRqWvq9cZdQUukvQ1RJdRk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69971161/Screen_Shot_2021_10_08_at_12.13.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3zxb5Jpipk" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hNrvow"&gt;While Google has already shared a lot about its upcoming Pixel 6 Pro flagship, including its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;bold exterior design&lt;/a&gt;, two new videos posted to YouTube reveal what Google will probably never show us: what it looks like on the inside, how to put it together, and how to take it apart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhnrc3"&gt;The two videos, which appear to be used for training purposes of some kind, show how to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3zxb5Jpipk"&gt;assemble&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECzp5bU2aQI"&gt;disassemble&lt;/a&gt; the Pixel 6 Pro. It seems unlikely that these were intended to be released publicly, as they are extremely focused on showing specific steps for how to put together and take apart the phone, don’t include any voiceover, and have a mishmash of low-quality graphics, text, and music. That being said, the videos are still worth checking out, as they are a fascinating step-by-step look at how a smartphone actually gets put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qSeo9W"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ECzp5bU2aQI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dThEuc"&gt;The videos also hint at some Pixel 6 Pro features Google hasn’t confirmed publicly yet. The assembly video mentions a connector for an ultra wideband chip, and both videos show separate steps specific to an mmWave SKU and a sub-6GHz SKU, which backs up information found in &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/20/pixel-6-and-6-pro-hit-fcc-with-wi-fi-6e-support/"&gt;recent FCC filings&lt;/a&gt;. And multiple clear shots reveal that the phone has a beefy 19.26Wh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WaDSVR"&gt;I have to say I have never seen a teardown this detailed hit the web ahead of the launch of a phone, perhaps making this a new high bar in the ongoing saga of Google smartphones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/23/21398008/pixel-5-google-leak-rumor-specs"&gt;leaking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21450764/google-pixel-5-design-specs-leak-hardware-software-camera"&gt;ahead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452607/pixel-4a-5g-spec-leak-similar-pixel-5"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/18/20868935/google-pixel-4-xl-rumors-leaks-specs-details-colors-cameras-soli"&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/8/17953626/google-pixel-3-xl-leaks-last-minute-pink-sand-color-ai-camera-features"&gt;official&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/8/17953626/google-pixel-3-xl-leaks-last-minute-pink-sand-color-ai-camera-features"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="1M7Bq5"&gt;Google is set to reveal more about the Pixel 6 lineup at an event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;on October 19th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The six-figure Mercedes-Benz EQS gets a 350-mile range rating</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wXXHg0_bkMqzkmizQ6tWZNbuA3M=/86x0:4877x3194/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69970795/2020_11_28_Image_20C0714_021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Mercedes-Benz&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XqvnGm"&gt;The all-electric Mercedes-Benz EQS is chock full of luxury and tech features. Now we know it will be competitive with some of its six-figure rivals in regards to range, as the official estimates are &lt;a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1133824_2022-mercedes-benz-eqs-tops-out-with-a-350-mile-epa-range-rating-trailing-tesla-and-lucid"&gt;finally in&lt;/a&gt; from the Environmental Protection Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtizIB"&gt;The agency says the rear-wheel-drive version should get around 350 miles on a full battery. Buyers of the all-wheel-drive version should expect a little less, around 340 miles. That’s roughly even with Tesla’s new triple-motor Model S Plaid, which the EPA says is good for about 348 miles &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/18/tesla-model-s-plaid-348-mile-epa-rated-range-21-inch-wheels/"&gt;on a full charge on 21-inch wheels&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla says the Model S Plaid on 19-inch wheels should get closer to 400 miles, but that claim hasn’t been evaluated by the EPA just yet. A dual-motor Long Range Model S is supposed to eclipse 400 miles, though that car has apparently been delayed in favor of the Plaid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="OZwNnM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mercedes-Benz EQS will cost over $100,000 but is still cheaper than an S-Class","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686248/mercedes-benz-eqs-electric-vehicle-price-cheaper-s-class"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GDvrEq"&gt;Audi’s E-Tron GT — which is built on the Porsche Taycan’s electric drivetrain — is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274376/audi-etron-gt-rs-electric-car-specs-price"&gt;likely to be rated for even less&lt;/a&gt;, somewhere in the mid-to-low 200-mile range. The only EV that easily eclipses the EQS’s range figures is the Lucid Air. That sedan received a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22675936/lucid-motors-air-range-epa-rating-tesla"&gt;whopping 520-mile rating from the EPA in September&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruCIJi"&gt;A big question with the EQS when it goes on sale in the US later this year will be whether buyers cross-shop against these other EVs or if they want a Mercedes-Benz and happen to choose electric. If it’s the latter, there’s an extra incentive in that the EQS’ starting price is actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686248/mercedes-benz-eqs-electric-vehicle-price-cheaper-s-class"&gt;less than that of the gas-powered S-Class&lt;/a&gt; it will probably one day supplant. While an extra 100-plus miles of range would always be nice, getting into the mid-300s should be plenty for most buyers’ daily and weekly needs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OaNqWaV5j4cx0WB5BjSpqEwDxr4=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949627/Apple_watch_series7_availability_stainless_steel_10052021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 features larger screens.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WAQ6pp"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;new Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; Series 7 was announced alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s the final device of Apple’s new fall products to launch. This newer model sits atop Apple’s current lineup of smartwatches, which still includes the SE and Series 3 rounding out the line. Featuring a slightly revamped design and larger display, the Series 7 comes in either a 41mm (up from 40mm) configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm (up from 44mm) configuration — each with optional cellular radios if you want to pay for service with your carrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMTfvS"&gt;After Apple’s initial announcement billed them for release “later this fall,” we now know &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;the new models are set to release on October 15th&lt;/a&gt;, and you can &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder them now through Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfKhcuwgnDQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-7-gps%2F-%2FA-84736576%3Fpreselect%3D77640209%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fapple-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-7%2F3944_1229722_1890925_1696849_6549129&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LuD92a"&gt;What’s new&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="roSEq8"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 prominently features that new, larger display that stretches the screen closer to the edges for a more full-bleed aesthetic and showing more actionable information at once. It has a slight curve at its farthest edges, though Apple says the watch is overall more durable thanks to a 50 percent thicker glass cover and IP6X rating for better dirt and sand resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RLkrZ"&gt;New watch faces exclusive to the Series 7 promise to put that extra screen real estate to work, while the watch maintains a physical footprint that is close to its predecessor. Apple has also improved charging speeds, including a new USB-C wireless magnetic fast charger with the watch that it claims will offer up to a 33 percent quicker charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lttaJ7"&gt;On the software side, the Apple Watch Series 7 runs watchOS 8, supports a full swiping keyboard for text input, is compatible with new workouts, and maintains all the health-tracking features found on prior iterations: sleep tracking, heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, and fall detection that now registers during workouts. There is plenty to take advantage of if you’re in the market for a new Apple Watch and prefer to have Apple’s latest and greatest iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

Let’s break down all that there is to offer here before we dive further into specific configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ixNYqI"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yBbMqA"&gt;You can preorder your preferred configuration directly from Apple or a variety of retailers right now, with the earliest orders shipping on October 15th. The main options for you to decide on, aside from your preferred color, are size and connectivity. The base Apple Watch Series 7 configuration is a 41mm, GPS-only model that retails for $399. The 41mm version with a cellular connection runs $100 more at $499. If you have a larger wrist or prefer bigger screens, the 45mm GPS-only model is $429, while its cellular-equipped counterpart climbs up to $529. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CYcjeM"&gt;Preorder all sizes, colors, and configurations at Apple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ybj2aF"&gt;If you want an Apple Watch with your pick of the litter for bands — standard, premium, or fixed-length — then Apple has the most on offer. It’s the only place you can order an Apple Watch with custom-sized solo loop straps, though be sure to use the size guide. Shipments are initially expected for October 15th, however, select models won’t ship until early to mid-November. If you opt for in-store pickup at an Apple Store, it might still be the 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Iin96H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1oQQDo"&gt;Preorder at Best Buy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UewUYo"&gt;Best Buy’s site is indicating that the base 41mm GPS model will arrive on release day, while some other configurations with cellular connectivity are to be expected around October 25th. The retailer has all colors available for the size and connectivity of your choice, each with a matching sport band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6zF2jz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797140"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="r0rafV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qmXurY"&gt;Preorder at Walmart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5PezQJ"&gt;Walmart has a variety of anticipated shipping dates for preorders. All preorders are expected to ship by October 15th, though, some individual configurations have delivery dates ranging from the 15th to the 21st. Oddly, the red, 45mm LTE model notes a shipping date of October 11th, though we would advise not putting too much confidence in its accuracy. There can sometimes be errors in retailer listings as soon as a product is put up for sale, which is often corrected later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h4THAO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797290"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="5A8W7H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797296"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h2Dlds"&gt;Preorder at Target&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eWiJze"&gt;Target lists each and every color and configuration of the aluminum Apple Watch Series 7 as shipping by the release date of October 15th. This can always change on the fly, but it is worth considering if you want to get your new watch as quickly as possible. Target RedCard members will also receive free shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NR6Vib"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797306"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="kSl7XQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797315"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uoprLg"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7 from phone carriers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3dbtKG"&gt;Most major phone carriers in the US offer the cellular Apple Watch Series 7 for preorder, which can help if you prefer to purchase the smartwatch on a monthly installment plan that you might already have for your phone. For the cellular models, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11557999?sid=VergeAppleWatchSeries7100821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fconnected-smartwatches%2Fapple-watch-series-7%2F%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13761603?sid=VergeAppleWatchSeries7100821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fwearables%2Fapple-watch-series-7-41mm-green-aluminum-clover-sport.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-7-41mm%3Fsku%3D194252566381&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; all offer the Series 7 in each of its sizes and colors at the same starting price as Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdxgiN"&gt;Apple has confirmed that when you &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch%2Faluminum-case&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy a cellular-equipped Apple Watch Series 7 through its own store&lt;/a&gt; and activate it on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100009682-14498937?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fshop%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sprint / T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, you will get $100 back.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VH7yJz"&gt;More premium case options and custom configurator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="T46tsH"&gt;Apple has also offered the latest top-end watch in additional case materials for years. This generation is no different, with the Series 7 available in &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch%2Fstainless-steel-case&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;stainless steel starting at $699&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch%2Ftitanium-case&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;titanium starting at $799&lt;/a&gt;, as well as band options from luxury fashion boutique Hermès. The easiest way to preorder these is directly from Apple, as it carries the most options and not all retailers sell the more luxurious watches — though &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfKhlKGfOGa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-stainless-steel-series-7-gps-cellular%2F-%2FA-84783483%3Fpreselect%3D77640146%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fapple-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-7%2F3944_1229722_1890925_1696849_6549129%3Fsort%3Dprice_high&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; do have some stainless steel models available for preorder. Most people opt for aluminum, which offers the same functionality at a lower price, but the premium models have a unique fit and finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NR4t55"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fstudio%2Fapple-watch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Studio&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s own online boutique for creating exact custom Apple Watch configurations, makes a return for the Series 7. If you prefer an Apple Watch in a particular combination of size, finish, color, and band, you can make your selection and pay the configured price directly from Apple. This is the only way to order one of the popular solo loop straps with your Apple Watch, as those fixed-length straps are only sold through Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This iPhone 13 case adds what the phone was always missing — a candy launcher</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZvQwDjQwcpWnaum9SmBD2GhMXhc=/213x0:2130x1278/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69970698/Screen_Shot_2021_10_08_at_10.34.53_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vOXkPc"&gt;No matter how much Apple hypes Ceramic Shield — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509008/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-mini-displays-ceramic-hardened"&gt;the special glass mixture introduced with the iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt; — and the build quality of the metal and glass sandwich that is the modern iPhone, expensive phones need cases. Maybe you ordered one alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;your new iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, but if you didn’t, may I propose an exciting and undeniably useful option — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX46nzE9wmw"&gt;a giant case that rockets hard candy&lt;/a&gt; into your mouth (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-perfect-iphone-13-case-holds-a-bunch-of-candy-and-s-1847825950"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTtUK1"&gt;YouTube creator and inventor Matty Benedetto is responsible for the DIY case, which he calls the Candy Catapult. It’s 3D printed from flexible TPU filament with a hard candy container back for your poison of choice, be it M&amp;amp;Ms, Skittles, or Reese Pieces (only sickos would mix all three). To actually launch the candy out of the case, Benedetto added a pinball machine-esque spring-loaded plunger. It’s hard to gauge just how hard it launches its little sugary missiles, but it definitely seems strong enough to send a piece of candy clear across the room.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDDmDGco2eD9u6gy6eIIBJQCbAI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910798/gif__1_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Candy Catapult works!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g924kt"&gt;My first thought watching Benedetto’s video is not relief that I suddenly have a way to dispense with my industrial-sized bag of lozenges (no help needed there) but really excitement over the other possible things one could launch from it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6kyZmu"&gt;I’m really just wondering how quickly this becomes a weapon with metal ball bearings in it. Is it launching it hard enough to break a window if you were to swap candy with something more... damaging? Some things are perhaps best left unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
