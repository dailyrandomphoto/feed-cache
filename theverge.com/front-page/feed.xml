    <title>Biden signs executive order calling for semiconductor supply chain review</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks On Lives Lost To Covid-19" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kD3njk4f_gprF1Jqgc5oS5sdmH0=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68866371/1231330766.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ekuCQk"&gt;President Biden signed an executive order Wednesday addressing growing concern over a global semiconductor shortage hampering the production of goods like automobiles and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnZ0SG"&gt;The White House’s executive order directs the federal government&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to conduct 100-day reviews of supply chains in four sets of products, including computer chips and large capacity batteries, like those used in electric vehicles, according to administration officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPS5p1"&gt;“This is about making sure the United States can meet every challenge we faced in this new era of pandemics, but also in defense cybersecurity, climate change, and so much more,” Biden said at a press conference Thursday. “The best way to do that is by protecting and and sharpen and America’s competitive edge by investing here at home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNlhx7"&gt;The chip shortage was a result of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order"&gt;a number of factors&lt;/a&gt; created by the coronavirus pandemic. As more of daily life moved online, consumer electronics manufacturers saw an increase in demand for products like laptops. Production of chips also slowed down in part because of the pandemic, and former President Trump’s trade war with China made it more difficult for US companies to work with Chinese chip producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrttfz"&gt;This resulted in companies like Apple, AMD, Sony, and Qualcomm raising concern over shortages over the last few weeks, including parts for iPhones and consoles like the PlayStation 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bQ2zyv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Semiconductors play a critical role in enabling the products and services that fuel our economy”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sdj2Fi"&gt;Earlier this month, lobbying groups for the auto, telecommunications, and technology industries &lt;a href="https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CHIPS-multi-assn-letter-feb-18-2021_1.pdf"&gt;called on the White House&lt;/a&gt; to work with Congress to provide additional funding for domestic chip research and production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xbu682"&gt;“Semiconductors play a critical role in enabling the products and services that fuel our economy, contribute to American innovation, and enhance our national security,” the groups said in a letter to Biden last week. “Given the central role of semiconductors, strengthening the US position in semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing is a national priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhAwap"&gt;In a press conference Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said that Congress &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-democrats/top-u-s-senate-democrat-directs-lawmakers-to-craft-bill-to-counter-china-idUSKBN2AN2HJ"&gt;would be working to draft a legislative package&lt;/a&gt; to “outcompete China and create new American jobs” as well as making new investments in the US semiconductor industry. Schumer said he’s looking to bring these items up for a floor vote in the Senate this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfRknH"&gt;“Right now, semiconductor manufacturing is a dangerous weak spot in our economy and in our national security, that has to change,” Schumer said on Wednesday. “We cannot let China get ahead of us in chip production.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOfHY2"&gt;Outside of the semiconductor supply chain, Biden’s order also calls for similar reviews into the defense, public health, biological preparedness, information communications technology, transportation, and energy and food production sectors, the administration officials said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkfMCn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 24th, 4:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has been updated to reflect that President Biden has signed the executive order.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch composer Yuzo Koshiro play his iconic chiptunes through an NEC PC-88</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DmerScADZw2XK-fVPUV7FufAOMw=/0x15:2094x1411/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68869995/koshiropc88.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/yuzokoshiro" target="_blank"&gt;Yuzo Koshiro / Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IhAdtE"&gt;It’s not hard to listen to your favorite video game soundtracks online. Just load YouTube or some other music streaming services, and search there. But that experience pales in comparison to hearing (and seeing) that music played through the hardware it was originally composed on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lx2LCt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yuzokoshiro"&gt;Legendary gaming composer Yuzo Koshiro&lt;/a&gt; has been posting nostalgia bombs on Twitter, playing songs that he made for games like &lt;em&gt;Streets of Rage, Streets of Rage 2&lt;/em&gt;, and the 8-Bit Game Gear and Sega Master System versions of &lt;em&gt;Sonic The Hedgehog. &lt;/em&gt;And he’s playing them using an NEC PC-88, the 39-year-old PC that was a popular gaming platform in Japan, as well as Koshiro’s machine of choice for creating music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="naFRGA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="ja" dir="ltr"&gt;Recorded SOR2 Go Straight from PC88FA headphone out. No EQ and compression. -14.5LUFS.&lt;br&gt;If you want the best sounding of SOR, nothing can beat the PC88. &lt;br&gt;88FAのヘッドフォンアウトがなかなか良い音していたのでベア2 Go Straightを録音してみました。やはり実機が一番良い音です   &lt;a href="https://t.co/Je4nmUBKaW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Je4nmUBKaW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Yuzo Koshiro (@yuzokoshiro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yuzokoshiro/status/1362778079383359495?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Bu5P1"&gt;Listening to the tunes is fun, especially if you’ve played the games, but these videos are even better than going to a concert. You get to watch a storied music-maker play his tunes through hardware that’s likely very difficult and expensive to find currently. I like the little gadgets he uses to make loading files and navigating easier. There’s just a tiny monitor on top of the PC-88 instead of a gargantuan CRT monitor from another era, and the music is being loaded into the PC through a controller and interface that helps it recognize the SD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HNAOmI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Have you ever known GG/SMS Sonic music was made with PC88? I made most of my PSG-leveled music (GG, MSX, etc.) with it. It couldn't use all the DCSG functions but was comfortable and fast. This video plays all the song's intro including unused tracks running through. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LOpImRZbJ6"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LOpImRZbJ6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Yuzo Koshiro (@yuzokoshiro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yuzokoshiro/status/1364128000699101186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fuwmkr"&gt;Koshiro obviously has a lot of experience in composing music, but it’s his knowledge of programming in BASIC that helped him get comfortable using something like the PC-88 to express his musical talents. I learned that about him in this extensive Red Bull Music Academy interview he did a few years ago, which I’ve embedded below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit is down for many as GME goes up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/48uGJF85_cX_2QhxOeXqNULwC6M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68869818/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wKiCQy"&gt;Reddit’s status page &lt;a href="https://www.redditstatus.com"&gt;currently shows a major outage&lt;/a&gt;, and many of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s staff are unable to load it. Loading the site results in a blank white page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJqxR7"&gt;The site seems to have gone down after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop stock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299795/gamestop-stock-up-reddit-wallstreetbets-gme-pump"&gt;shot up 100 percent&lt;/a&gt; in late hours of trading. One of Reddit’s most controversial communities, r/WallStreetBets, has championed the stock and was intensely active after the surge. At the moment, it’s unclear if the two are related, but the subreddit seemed to be getting &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/b_fung/status/1364679012279279616?s=20"&gt;a lot of heavy traffic&lt;/a&gt; right before the site went down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="IBhOjm"&gt;The company has tweeted that it’s identified the issue, and is starting to recover. The site is now accessible to some &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staff, but not others.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Showtime’s live-action Halo TV show is now a Paramount Plus exclusive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/flwTEFjknQhEYwjxUkJV4JtUzfY=/425x0:2018x1062/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68869828/Screen_Shot_2019_03_18_at_4.04.49_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft/343 Industries&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xta8sR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17514578/halo-tv-series-showtime-microsoft-xbox"&gt;Showtime’s upcoming &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; TV series&lt;/a&gt; is getting a new home — the live-action adaptation of the popular sci-fi shooters will now debut exclusively on the relaunched Paramount Plus streaming service when it arrives at the beginning of 2022, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/halo-tv-series-latest-paramount-plus-move-1234698703/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DdFkGB"&gt;There have been a few attempts at adapting &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; to live action (including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/6/7164047/ridley-scott-halo-nightfall-thoughts"&gt;the less-than-stellar &lt;em&gt;Halo: Nightfall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), of which the Showtime series is the latest. It’s been in the works since 2018 and promises to actually focus on the star of the series: Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, the armored star of the series more commonly known as Master Chief (played by &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt;’ Pablo Schreiber.) The show will also see Jen Taylor return to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21561137/halo-tv-show-cortana-recast-jen-taylor"&gt;reprise her role as Cortana&lt;/a&gt;, Master Chief’s AI companion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcYojm"&gt;“We were on the hunt for signature shows beyond the &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; franchise on CBS All Access and were thinking, what could be a defining series for Paramount+,” David Nevins, who serves both as the chief creative officer at CBS  and the CEO of Showtime, said to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;. “&lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; always fit the bill but seeing it, we felt it would work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SCXjQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;was originally intended to release in 2021, but the show has since been delayed due to a pause in production caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLAGTl"&gt;Paramount Plus is the relaunched version of CBS All Access, which will combine content from the recently remerged CBS and Paramount together into a single streaming service. &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; joins other marquee titles for the service, including &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; shows like &lt;em&gt;Picard&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Discovery&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;SpongeBob SquarePants&lt;/em&gt; spinoff &lt;em&gt;Kamp Koral, &lt;/em&gt;and the Godfather making-of drama &lt;em&gt;The Offer&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop stock just jumped 100 percent, and WallStreetBets is ecstatic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6rLP8jm679fDmmaj51vrK1Qfx1o=/0x44:1309x917/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68869822/EvBPaphWgAMG2yi.5.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EWwFJ5"&gt;GameStop is up... again, by a lot. Before market close on Wednesday, the video game retailer’s shares started to soar, and GME just closed at $91.71 — up nearly 104 percent for the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URaR34"&gt;It’s the highest the stock has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266684/gamestop-stock-gme-down-dip-falling-wallstreetbets-reddit"&gt;since it fell back down to Earth&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the month following the unprecedented, Reddit-fueled rally that sent it as high as $483 a share. Over the course of the afternoon, trading on the stock was halted &lt;a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/122951/gamestop-gme-stock-halted-twice-as-shares-jump-over-100-today"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UGdeOH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&amp;amp;src=ctag&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;$GME&lt;/a&gt; +100% &lt;a href="https://t.co/qIWLTfveHq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qIWLTfveHq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1364678010209771529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NKzzpN"&gt;It’s not exactly clear what’s happening here. But one group is celebrating: r/WallStreetBets. The community of retail investors is ecstatic at the results and hailing the jump as proof that the GME rollercoaster ride isn’t over yet. There’s so much interest in the community, it seems, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299822/reddit-down-gme-up-wallstreetbets-stocks"&gt;that it’s currently buckling under the load of incoming traffic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CjSmrD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;What you see right now when sorting r/WSB by new &lt;a href="https://t.co/IVp21gjf2V"&gt;pic.twitter.com/IVp21gjf2V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brian Fung (@b_fung) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/b_fung/status/1364679012279279616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xXVY8W"&gt;A number of events this week may be contributing to the rise. For one, GME advocate Keith Gill, known online as Roaring Kitty or by his more profane handle u/DeepFuckingValue, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukXQGBpXaVM"&gt;testified last week&lt;/a&gt; in a House Financial Services Committee hearing on the GameStop rally, in which he pleaded his case as an everyday investor who simply liked the stock. Late last week, Gill doubled his holdings in GME to 100,000 shares, worth at the time about $4 million, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-shares-surge-after-reddit-legend-keith-gill-doubles-down-11614008117"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hM3DjD"&gt;Gill’s willingness to double down on his GameStop enthusiasm could be one factor explaining the stock rise today, but it’s certainly not the only one. GameStop’s former chief financial officer Jim Bell &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22298108/gamestop-cfo-resign-reddit-wall-street-bets-gamestonks"&gt;announced his resignation&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sources-gamestop-cfo-pushed-out-by-board-2021-2"&gt;sudden departure &lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;now reports&lt;/a&gt; may been less than amicable after the company’s board of directors “lost faith” in the executive. That could be fueling investor enthusiasm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Cx8nH"&gt;And lastly, and most inexplicably, Chewy founder Ryan Cohen — the GameStop board member whose interest in the company helped facilitate its skyrocketing stock price — tweeted a photo of a McDonald’s ice cream cone with a frog emoji for a caption. What could this possibly have to do with a new soaring GME stock price? Who knows. But at this point, I’m willing to believe anything. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ViacomCBS touts nearly 30 million global subscribers just before Paramount Plus launches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kYb2JUUFQR5vGSdKcb2YGmziVUU=/142x0:1083x627/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68869719/cbs_all_access.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3G8PiH"&gt;With CBS All Access morphing into Paramount Plus in just over a week, the company is announcing a new subscriber milestone for its streaming platforms: nearly 30 million global subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KmGzR0"&gt;The company also has 19.2 million subscribers domestically across its platforms, CBS All Access and Showtime. Pluto TV has 43 million monthly active users globally, and 30.1 million domestically. ViacomCBS CEO made the announcement ahead of today’s Paramount Plus event as part of its fourth quarter earnings. The last time CEO Bob Bakish previously reported subscriber numbers in November, noting that CBS All Access and Showtime had a combined subscriber base of 17.9 million subscribers domestically, up 73 percent year over year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4LIl6"&gt;Comparatively, some of ViacomCBS’s biggest competitors are lightyears ahead. Disney Plus is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278874/disney-plus-94-9-million-subscribers-q1-2021-earnings"&gt;closing in on 100 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, and Netflix has a global subscriber base of 203 million customers. While both those streaming services are in international territories, US-focused platforms like HBO Max and Peacock are also seeing growth. The first has 17.2 million activations, with the latter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253988/peacock-nbcuniversal-comcast-streaming-broadband"&gt;touting 33 million users&lt;/a&gt; (although it’s unclear how many are paid subscribers). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7Cr7L"&gt;Executives are hopeful that adding in the suite of Viacom networks previously unavailable at scale on CBS All Access — including Nickelodeon, BET, MTV, and Comedy Central — will give more potential customers a reason to subscribe. For those already subscribed to the service, including those who use it for news and sports purposes, having the suite of networks may provide even more of a reason to stay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VMjXk"&gt;Paramount Plus is ViacomCBS’s rebranded entry into the streaming space. After Viacom and CBS merged again in 2019, the unified company set out to find a way to use its entire breadth of programming and franchises to make a true competitor to Netflix, Amazon, HBO Max, and Disney’s empire (Disney Plus and Hulu). The new streaming service will have more than 20,000 TV episodes and films from across its various brands, including BET, CBS, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, and Paramount Pictures, alongside some aspect of live sports and news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUmOlN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OMUzf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGyqu7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEkwp7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5a9MT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gigabyte’s Aorus 15G is great at gaming, but not much else</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Singularly focused but cool under pressure&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KBDSr3"&gt;Gigabyte’s refreshed Aorus 15G for 2021 has a subtle, all-black design that takes a page from the company’s more svelte Aero lineup of creator-focused laptops. It’s a nice upgrade, but there aren’t many other changes from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21201164/gigabyte-aorus-gaming-aero-creator-laptop-intel-10th-gen-core-i9-i7-processor-oled"&gt;last year’s model&lt;/a&gt;, for better or worse. It offers the same wide variety of ports (including the all-too-rare full-size SD card reader), and impressively, Gigabyte fit an excellent 15.6-inch display into a 14-inch wide chassis. But at the same time, the keyboard is cramped and the nostril webcam is awkward to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXCE9b"&gt;There are some other swings and misses, but it nails what it’s really focused on: gaming. The bump up to Nvidia’s RTX 3070 graphics chip inside is the biggest change, and it helps this thin-and-light gaming laptop run most games beyond 60 frames per second, crossing the bar for reliably smooth gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTDPuq"&gt;That kind of performance is great — and not necessarily a given just because a laptop has this graphics chip. Manufacturers can set its power level to balance performance and efficiency as they see fit. So, despite having a compact chassis, I was surprised to see it perform better with games than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22276367/asus-tuf-dash-f15-2021-intel-core-i7-nvidia-rtx-3070-review-gaming-laptop-specs-price"&gt;Asus TUF Dash F15&lt;/a&gt;. It’s generally much quieter, too. Gigabyte found the sweet spot, and if you plug in an external mouse and keyboard, this machine is a blast to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7qzsva"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10359594"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RYXX41"&gt;The $1,799 configuration Gigabyte provided for review has the aforementioned Nvidia GPU, Intel’s 10th Gen Core i7-10870H with eight cores, 32GB of RAM, a 512GB NVMe SSD, a 99Wh battery, and its 15.6-inch 1080p display with a 240Hz refresh rate is Pantone-certified for color accuracy with 100 percent coverage of the sRGB color gamut. This isn’t Gigabyte’s top-of-the-line model, but it’s close. The step-up config for $200 more has the RTX 3080 and double the storage. A more affordable $1,499 model with the RTX 3060 is also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="bDeNs4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10359583"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c18vkG"&gt;Even though, technically, a laptop with the RTX 3070 is middle of the road between Nvidia’s low- and high-end graphics chips, it can deliver fantastic results. Gigabyte’s Aorus 15G would probably like to credit its gimmicky built-in Microsoft Azure application that automatically optimizes performance with AI, but it’s capable out of the box with default settings. There wasn’t a huge difference in gameplay with or without the Azure app running, nor when I set the GPU and CPU to boost in Gigabyte’s pre-installed Aorus Control Center app. That’s fine by me; the less tweaking required, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdzX2W"&gt;Getting right into game performance, &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt;’s built-in benchmark running on ultra hit a steady average of 66 frames per second, dropping to just 44 frames per second at the lowest. &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; running at ultra settings with medium ray-traced shadows ran at an average of 93 frames per second. Bumping up the ray tracing to ultra knocked it down to 69 frames per second, which is still a smooth experience. None of these results come close to taking full advantage of the fast-refreshing screen, but older or less demanding games should be able to hit far higher frames per second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gigabyte Aorus 15G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZjFZ2piFceoetDUNjJ6_93JxNAQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315766/cfaulkner_210216_4410_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Games and everything else look fantastic on the Pantone-certified IPS display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gigabyte Aorus 15G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ojqmwMeRI1Krb89AitmdiLXgp5I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315768/cfaulkner_210216_4410_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having the webcam placed below the screen feels like a prank every time I use it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="faJZBB"&gt;Outside of benchmarks, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; running at ultra ray tracing settings was easily my highlight testing the Aorus 15G. This machine had little issue keeping the game running above 50 frames per second in a more barren or enclosed environment, and it rarely dropped below 40 frames per second in crowded outdoor environments — again, that’s with the most demanding graphical settings cranked up (ultra with every ray tracing setting and DLSS on). The performance here will make a lot of people happy. I was also impressed by Gigabyte’s cooling system, which keeps things surprisingly quiet and cool under pressure. This is the rare gaming laptop you can actually keep safely on your lap while gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gigabyte Aorus 15G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AtnSxMZDOHagrbE1UpLKlS0ZTx4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315761/cfaulkner_210216_4410_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The numpad is nice to have, but this is one cramped keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gc6Sw0"&gt;I’m fascinated with Nvidia’s new RTX 30-series graphics chips. Not just because they’re good, but because they sometimes provide wildly different results depending on the laptop they’re in. For instance, in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;MSI GS66 Stealth&lt;/a&gt;, its RTX 3080 delivers very similar performance to the chip inside of Gigabyte’s laptop here, even though it should blow it away. The reason is because this chip has a higher clock speed and power draw than what’s inside of MSI’s laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kMcsfR"&gt;Specifically, this 3070 tops out at a 105W power draw with 1,290MHz clock speed, whereas the 3080 in question is at 95W maximum power and 1,245MHz clock speed. In short, you’re getting a lot of power in this thin $1,799 machine. Paying $200 more for the Aorus 15G with the RTX 3080 might not get you &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;that many more frames per second, as it also has a 105W maximum power draw but a slightly slower 1,245MHz clock speed. You might know all of this info, but you might not. Nvidia requires manufacturers to share it, though some of them are still being cagey about it. For the record, Gigabyte is one of the more transparent companies about its GPU specs. I’m &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;keeping tabs on other manufacturers right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gigabyte Aorus 15G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nNzHZ0T4bT-UkvmG2N0UgZqp15Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315767/cfaulkner_210216_4410_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bezels are thin, measuring at 3mm thick per side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bxISGk"&gt;Outside of gaming, the Aorus 15G is unfortunately a less convincing product. It’s able to run my usual workload flawlessly, consisting of Affinity Photo, about 10 Google Chrome apps, Slack, and Spotify. Given the specs inside, I expected this. What came as more of a surprise is that they don’t translate so well to video production. During an Adobe Premiere Pro test that exported a five-minute, 33-second 4K video, it took about seven minutes each time to render.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wkQp1O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10359586"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jq8kfk"&gt;There are several other trade-offs that might give you pause if you need a laptop as much for productivity as you do for gaming. The typing experience is fine but not helped by the cramped keyboard layout. It has a tiny trackpad, and its nostril-gazing webcam didn’t cut it for me. Also, Gigabyte claims up to eight hours of battery life, but I averaged around six hours per charge. The new Asus TUF Dash F15 excels at all things Gigabyte didn’t quite land and costs less, but its lack of a webcam is a huge red flag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="wqX2EL"&gt;This is a fantastic machine if all you want to do is get 60 frames per second (and often, better than that) in most of your games without tweaking many settings. Doing that for under $2,000 is an achievement worthy of praise. But if you care less about mobility and having a thin form factor that Gigabyte’s Aorus 15G provides, MSI’s GP66 Leopard takes the RTX 3070 even further. Its thicker, heavier chassis affords the chip even more headroom to get better performance in games — for the same $1,799 price, no less.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tubi inks anime streaming deal with One Piece studio Toei Animation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RdJ5QokJon2Jq95mbp354-V_uYM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68869207/acastro_210224_1777_toei_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4o0etp"&gt;Tubi, the free streaming service run by Fox Entertainment, has struck a deal with Toei Animation to bring some of the studio’s work to the platform. The deal includes six &lt;em&gt;One Piece&lt;/em&gt; TV specials that will come to the streaming service as well as episodes from anime shows including &lt;em&gt;One Piece&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Slam Dunk&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Dr. Slump&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrkLkA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Slump &lt;/em&gt;is an anime adaptation of a manga done by Akira Toriyama, the creator of &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball&lt;/em&gt; (which the show sometimes crosses over with). According to the press release, the version on Tubi will be the first time the show has been available to stream in the US with English subtitles. Looking up the show online shows how hard it’s been to access, with &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbz/comments/3txdvf/what_is_the_best_way_to_watch_drslump/"&gt;fans talking about a not-well-done DVD release&lt;/a&gt;. Having it available to stream, especially for free, should make it easier for hardcore &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball &lt;/em&gt;fans to get a taste of some of its creator’s earlier work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIcda4"&gt;The full list of content in the deal includes episodes from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OrXB4d"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;One Piece&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gx6af9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saint Seiya: Saintia Sho &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eMp0so"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saint Seiya: Hades &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HBDRa6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ge-Ge-Ge No Kitaro &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qfAv9c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slam Dunk &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Wd34Td"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Sump &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ua3Ck5"&gt;As well as the six &lt;em&gt;One Piece &lt;/em&gt;TV specials:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xdly9V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;3D2Y&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7LiqgP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Episode of Sabo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YjQKRb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adventure of Nebulandia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qO93l2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heart of Gold&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="F9a00G"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Episode of East Blue&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1Nvr0y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Episode of Skypiea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="QufEzZ"&gt;If you’ve been meaning to watch anything from the list, keep an eye on Tubi. The shows should be available soon for free — but as always, they’ll come with ads. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NgdgGi"&gt;AMD has announced &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Radeon/status/1364636388453470210?s=20"&gt;a new hardware event for next month&lt;/a&gt;, where the company plans to unveil the next GPU in its Radeon RX 6000 line of cards. The presentation will air on March 3rd at 8AM PT / 11AM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GuR8A"&gt;Like other GPUs in the RX 6000 series, this new model will use the RDNA 2 architecture, including real-time, hardware-accelerated ray tracing and variable rate shading. AMD’s announcement of a new GPU presentation comes just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280277/nvidia-rtx-3060-graphics-card-release-date-time"&gt;one day before sales kick off for Nvidia’s affordable RTX 3060 GPU&lt;/a&gt; at select retailers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On March 3rd, the journey continues for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RDNA2?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#RDNA2&lt;/a&gt;. Join us at 11AM US Eastern as we reveal the latest addition to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AMD?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AMD&lt;/a&gt; Radeon RX 6000 graphics family. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5CFvT9D2SR"&gt;https://t.co/5CFvT9D2SR&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/tUpUwRfpgk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tUpUwRfpgk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Radeon RX (@Radeon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Radeon/status/1364636388453470210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DF7cxi"&gt;AMD debuted the Radeon RX 6000 line of graphics cards in late October, with the GPUs serving as a direct competitor to Nvidia’s RTX 30 cards. Currently, the RX 6000 consists of three GPUs: the flagship RX 6900 XT, the $649 RX 6800 XT, and the RX 6800, which is the most affordable of the trio at $579.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLNpbG"&gt;With the announcement of a new RX 6000 card coming, we anticipate that, like other GPUs in this series, it will sell out &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt;. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;AMD  told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that within the first quarter of 2021, it expects to sell more of its own RX 6000 cards through its website, which is bittersweet news considering the RX 6000 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;has been difficult to buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="2CdM4i"&gt;Woot is offering the best sale price we’ve seen yet on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931329/beats-solo-pro-review-noise-canceling-on-ear-wireless-headphones-features-price"&gt;Beats Solo Pro&lt;/a&gt; noise-canceling headphones. Normally $300, the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/VergeBeatsSoloProNoiseCancellingSale02242021/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/beats-solo-pro-noise-cancelling-headphones-new-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;light blue and dark blue color options are $150 new&lt;/a&gt;. These headphones come with a one-year manufacturer warranty directly through Apple. The lowest price we’ve seen previously is around the $170 mark, depending on the color you’re interested in. The Solo Pro headphones are compatible with Android and iOS, but they shine brighter on iPhone, since they have the H1 wireless chip and “Hey Siri” hands-free controls. The downside for Android owners used to USB-C is that they recharge through a Lightning connector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="6ah3iA"&gt;If you’re looking to cover all of your audio needs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21279609/ultimate-ears-hyperboom-party-bluetooth-speaker-review"&gt;Ultimate Ears’ huge Hyperboom&lt;/a&gt; Bluetooth speaker is $59 off at Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8B9NV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing $341&lt;/a&gt;. I reviewed it last summer, and it was a joy to be able to blast music loudly, indoors or outdoors, rain or shine. It’s big, like a bit bigger than the Xbox Series X that it’s similar is shape to, and it’s heavy, too. In addition to being able to play music from multiple Bluetooth sources at once, you can charge a phone from it and even use it as a stand-in home theater speaker with its digital optical audio port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="prcnlV"&gt;February 24th is &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt; day, celebrating the day that FBI agent Dale Cooper (played by Kyle MacLachlan) ventured into the fictional town of &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt; in the Pacific Northwest for the first time. I was hoping to be overwhelmed with deals on various Blu-ray collections, but there aren’t many. This one loops in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W3RQCQG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Blu-ray discs of the original series and the newer series for $56&lt;/a&gt;. If you still buy physical media and are a fan of iconic, weird TV that has inspired the likes of Remedy’s &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake &lt;/em&gt;games, among many other things, these are good to have.&lt;/p&gt;
