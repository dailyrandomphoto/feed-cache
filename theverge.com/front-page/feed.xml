    <title>High-speed internet could be coming to Antarctica</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Overhead photo showing McMurdo Station in Antarctica" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1eW4h36sPit0HSiA-Ye7CamrBfA=/0x3:7360x4910/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183859/McMurdo_2.12.13_a_HR.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;McMurdo Station in Antarctica | United States Antarctic Program&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4WGZKV"&gt;On a volcanic rock just off the coast of Antarctica, McMurdo Station is abuzz with scientific research this time of year. Run by the US National Science Foundation, the station sees up to 1,000 visitors in the Antarctic summer from October to February, who travel here to conduct research on topics ranging from climate to ocean science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCAZXs"&gt;But despite its central role in Antarctic research, McMurdo is lacking something most scientists working at 21st-century laboratories take for granted: high-speed internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eAwdmR"&gt;McMurdo sits on the only continent that doesn’t have a high-speed fiber optic cable connection to the rest of the world. That could soon change, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJxJ8R"&gt;Earlier this year, the NSF began seriously exploring the possibility of building a fiber optic cable that would travel along the seafloor from Antarctica to neighboring New Zealand or Australia. The idea was first raised a little over a decade ago but lost traction as other projects took priority. If this latest effort to modernize Antarctica’s internet is a success, scientists say it would transform both research and daily life on the frozen continent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5jIrG"&gt;“It would change the fundamental experience of living in Antarctica,” said Peter Neff, glaciologist and assistant research professor at the University of Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i5tBvYRx_hM7W8xDlBrDBygyR60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037567/Notional_McMurdo_NZ_Cable_Route_Showing_existing_subsea_cables_11_23_2021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A proposed high-speed fiber line could connect McMurdo Station to New Zealand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yu4x9P"&gt;Today, researchers working in Antarctica rely on low-bandwidth satellites to communicate with the outside world. Compared with a typical rural household, the amount of bandwidth available per person at McMurdo is limited, says Patrick Smith, technology development manager at the NSF.  Researchers often have to store their data on hard drives to physically bring back home rather than exporting it for their colleagues to analyze in real time. This creates a bottleneck that slows scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JNsRTl"&gt;In late June, the NSF sponsored a&lt;a href="https://www.pgc.umn.edu/workshops/antarctic-cable/"&gt; three-day workshop&lt;/a&gt; that brought together US and international researchers to discuss the transformative potential of a fiber optic cable to Antarctica, including how it will impact research, education, and the well-being of those who spend time at McMurdo Station. In October, &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ao4Hz6-bBheFMpGSR4nMvSZJ9kHpjj0o/view"&gt;workshop organizers released an extensive report&lt;/a&gt; highlighting key points, potential routes, and how the fiber optic cable could be harnessed to collect additional scientific data in this remote realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hS2Q4"&gt;Participants at the conference said daily life and research at McMurdo Station would change in myriad ways if a fiber optic connection became available. Researchers could livestream daily operations instead of relying on archival recorders, weather forecasting could be improved, satellite images could be analyzed in real time, cybersecurity could be advanced, and project participation could be broadened beyond those conducting the research in the field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kd3w4J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Having that type of interactivity allows for people to imagine themselves in that situation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="feJbIz"&gt;In addition to analyzing data more efficiently, the physical presence of the cable could make it possible to collect new kinds of data. For instance, the fibers in the cable could be used to collect seismic data via&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a new technique called&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-11986-4"&gt;distributed acoustic sensing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt; Sensors could be added to the cable to make continuous observations of temperature and pressure in Antarctica’s Southern Ocean, a key site for understanding how quickly climate change is unfolding. The Southern Ocean is poorly observed, Neff says, and as temperatures rise, such continuous observations in real time could greatly improve scientists’ understanding of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgciwu"&gt;Beyond the research opportunities, faster internet would make it easier for station visitors to get in touch with their family, their colleagues outside of Antarctica, and the broader public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QX2Bs0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re looking at this as a transformative opportunity”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HheyFc"&gt;“Having that type of interactivity allows for people to imagine themselves in that situation and see what that work is like day to day,” says Antarctic filmmaker Ariel Waldman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mq1Szr"&gt;In 2018, &lt;a href="https://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/4398"&gt;Waldman traveled&lt;/a&gt; to Antarctica for five weeks to film life under the ice through NSF’s Antarctica Artist and Writers Program. Waldman said that having faster internet will make a big difference for science communication because it will allow communicators to interact with people outside of Antarctica in real time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5u76R"&gt;Although a high-speed internet connection could offer many benefits, some scientists also worry about how such a change will impact the culture in McMurdo Station. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ross Island Earth Station antenna being placed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/01BsPLWDObCFkEfPh507FU6LNGA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037579/2021Nov16_RIES_dish_placement_2_HR.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;United States Antarctic Program&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ross Island Earth Station, an antenna intended to supply satellite internet to McMurdo next year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sLQkf2"&gt;“Another important conversation is how it would change the way that the community functions,” Neff said. Antarctic research stations are tight-knit communities because of their isolation, Neff explained. Full connectivity could change a lot, including how researchers interact with each other and how focused they are on fieldwork versus events back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ALla7"&gt;The next step in making Antarctica’s high-speed internet upgrade a reality is a formal desktop and engineering design&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;study that NSF will be conducting with assistance from the Department of Defense. Completing that study, which will include pricing out the cable and related infrastructure, studying the route, and developing a schedule for getting everything installed, is a key milestone. After that, NSF will decide whether to proceed with the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbGC0r"&gt;“Improving the communications will remove some burdens, make it a lot easier for [people] to be deployed in the field, and extend the experience to folks that couldn’t deploy,” Smith said. “We’re looking at this as a transformative opportunity.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mozilla is ending support for its Firefox password manager sync app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xbiPAZmQwP2QtUFHvyRxsF6DaEQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183796/acastro_200207_3900_firefox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YdbjfI"&gt;Mozilla announced last week via a &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/end-of-support-firefox-lockwise"&gt;support article&lt;/a&gt; that its Firefox Lockwise password manager app will reach end-of-life on December 13th. The final release versions are 1.8.1 (iOS) and 4.0.3 (Android) and will no longer be available to download or reinstall after that date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2iaUX"&gt;What started in 2018 as a small &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla-lockwise"&gt;experimental mobile app&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/10/17552242/mozilla-firefox-lockbox-ios-password-manager-experiment"&gt;Lockbox&lt;/a&gt; ended up bringing a way to access saved passwords and perform autofills on iOS, Android, and desktop devices to a small but enthusiastic following of Firefox fans. The app was also later adapted as a Firefox extension. It seemed like it was apt to stick around for the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Three screenshots of the Firefox lockwise app showing features" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R8yAGW30IDQHsR-nYS2qw0CQBVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037958/Firefox_lockwise.001.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The login screen for the Lockwise app in iOS advertises Mozilla’s other active products like Mozilla VPN and Firefox Monitor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hjpU78"&gt;The support article recommends that users continue accessing passwords using the native Firefox browsers on desktop and mobile. In an added note on the support site, Mozilla suggests that later in December, the Firefox iOS app will gain the ability to manage Firefox passwords systemwide. The note alludes to Mozilla adopting the features of Lockwise and eventually integrating them into the Firefox browser apps natively on all platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOJibr"&gt;With many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363424/mozilla-layoffs-quarter-staff-250-people-new-revenue-focus"&gt;layoffs&lt;/a&gt; last year, it's no surprise Mozilla continues to streamline the projects it keeps on its plate. The company, over the years, took down the team building the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/2/14486812/mozilla-shutting-down-connected-devices-group"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt; behind the defunct Firefox phone, shut down its &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/what-happened-firefox-send"&gt;file transfer tool&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/1/9832148/mozilla-proposes-splitting-off-thunderbird-email-client"&gt;spun off&lt;/a&gt; its Thunderbird email platform.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday laptop deals 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DmgfRt-2sXFIcBDHMsslkFiVs1k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183676/vpavic_052011_4016_0042.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5aO9CW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are often thought of as times to stock up on smaller investments on the cheap, like headphones, games, and other gadgets you may not have wanted to pay full price for. But it’s also a great time to save on big-ticket items, like that laptop you’ve maybe had your eye on. The shopping holidays have brought some seriously good discounts on laptops, whether you’re keen on sticking with Mac, or you want a Windows PC. Both often come in very slim designs, but for people who don’t mind a heavier laptop, we’ve included some gaming laptop picks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UADRPQ"&gt;The kinds of deals you can get on laptops vary depending on the retailer, so that’s how we’ve split up the deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TflOti"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"},{"title":"The Oculus Quest 2 comes with a free $50 gift card through Saturday","url":"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/11/21/22789487/oculus-quest-2-vr-headset-50-gift-card-black-friday-promo"},{"title":"Win a mystery bag from The Verge jam-packed with free stuff","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22771977/mystery-bag-sweepstakes-gear-tech-entry-rules-black-friday-2021-holidays"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="TsME5p"&gt;Best Buy’s best laptop deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar1B52"&gt;Apple’s MacBook Air with the M1 processor is $150 off at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3RoIuL8ib" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; starting Wednesday, November 24th. This will bring the starting price down to $850 for the base model that has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="nKDdM8"&gt;Several models of Microsoft’s Surface Go 2 are discounted, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3RsGTE97D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;we recommend the 8GB / 128GB model that’s just $399.99&lt;/a&gt;. That’s an impressive $150 discount. Note that you’ll need to purchase a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3Rubet26I" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Type Cover separately&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kRtndY"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3Ru5RcAZc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The 15.6-inch Samsung Chromebook 4 Plus is just $199&lt;/a&gt;, which is $100 off its usual $299 price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gfEE7I"&gt;Many Surface Pro 7 models are discounted. Our recommended model is the configuration that includes &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3RweJ6ZjV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage for $699 &lt;/a&gt;($200 off). Note that this Surface also doesn’t include a Type Cover, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3RyIlOumZ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;those run for $129 and up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1MTqnV"&gt;Google’s Pixelbook Go is seeing a slight price drop, and the base configuration below that we recommend is just $599. This is one of the best Chromebooks you can buy, and compared to some others, it has a great typing experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="EzwkqD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873327"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="87JY8c"&gt;If you want an even better screen than the Pixelbook Go, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3RL8VuWpD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Chromebook that has a vivid 4K touchscreen is just $599&lt;/a&gt;, down $400 from its original $999.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3DKHNg"&gt;Another appealing 4K-equipped laptop, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3RXPQMhUY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo’s Yoga 9i, is $1,349&lt;/a&gt;, a steep $400 price cut from its original $1,749.99 price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PHTZLk"&gt;Several of Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 4 laptops are discounted by $150, and if you ask us, we recommend the Ryzen-equipped ones over the Intel models. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3R0ueCNkt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This model&lt;/a&gt; with an AMD Ryzen 5 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD costs $1,049.99 instead of $1,200.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="69ZUMb"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3R1IXWCwp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell’s 2021 G15 gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt; with an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU, Nvidia’s RTX 3050 Ti graphics chip, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD costs $879.99, down $270 from its original price. This is a great price for an entry-level gaming laptop, and it also has a 120Hz refresh rate display.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Rnl9em"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3R5IQGSZC" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G15 gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt; is $1,549.99, $350 off $1849.99. This is our favorite gaming laptop for the cost, packing in a QHD display, a fast AMD Ryzen 9, and Nvidia’s RTX 3070, among other impressive specs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Apple sues NSO Group for attacking iPhones with Pegasus spyware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l-EGsMPxGf0PtaoDncVOe6B8NEA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183455/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oJFqiU"&gt;Now Apple has followed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20938676/whatsapp-nso-group-spyware-hack-encrypted-chat-lawsuit"&gt;WhatsApp and its parent company Meta&lt;/a&gt; (formerly known as Facebook) in &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-sues-nso-group-to-curb-the-abuse-of-state-sponsored-spyware/"&gt;suing Pegasus spyware maker NSO Group&lt;/a&gt;. Along with promising new information about how NSO Group infected targeted iPhones via a zero-click exploit that researchers later dubbed ForcedEntry, Apple says it’s “seeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO Group from using any Apple software, services, or devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ck7oLY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple: NSO agreed to the iCloud Terms of Service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rpQ3TQ"&gt;Senior VP of software engineering Craig Federighi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761724/apple-craig-federighi-ios-sideloading-web-summit-2021-european-commission-digital-markets-act"&gt;didn’t mention sideloading this time&lt;/a&gt; but says in a statement, “State-sponsored actors like the NSO Group spend millions of dollars on sophisticated surveillance technologies without effective accountability. That needs to change...Apple devices are the most secure consumer hardware on the market — but private companies developing state-sponsored spyware have become even more dangerous.” Apple and WhatsApp aren’t alone in their push against NSO Group in court, as last year, tech companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22194930/microsoft-google-cisco-vmware-internet-association-amicus-brief-nso-group-spyware-whatsapp-facebook"&gt;including Microsoft and Google filed a brief supporting Facebook’s lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYaPnj"&gt;Pegasus spyware is designed to let governments remotely access a phone’s microphones, cameras, and other data on both iPhones and Androids, according to Apple’s press release. It’s also designed to be able to infect phones without requiring any action from the user and without leaving a trace, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"&gt;reports that came out earlier&lt;/a&gt; this year from a journalistic coalition called the Pegasus Project and Apple’s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0UK4TH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The lawsuit is a “stake in the ground” for Apple&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hmGje8"&gt;Apple’s senior director of commercial litigation Heather Grenier says in a statement to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/23/technology/apple-nso-group-lawsuit.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the lawsuit is meant to be a “stake in the ground, to send a clear signal” that the company won’t allow its users to suffer “this type of abuse.” Part of Apple’s argument &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/Apple_v_NSO_Complaint_112321.pdf"&gt;laid out in the complaint&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) is that NSO violated Apple’s terms of service because the group created “more than one hundred” Apple IDs to help it send data to targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8cZ79H"&gt;The Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because, on information and belief, they created more than one hundred Apple IDs to carry out their attacks and also agreed to Apple’s iCloud Terms and Conditions (“iCloud Terms”), including a mandatory and enforceable forum selection and exclusive jurisdiction clause that constitutes express consent to the jurisdiction of this Court&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="znIVpi"&gt;In Apple’s complaint, it breaks down how the attack worked — using the Apple IDs it created, NSO would send data to a target via iMessage (after determining that they were using an iPhone), which was maliciously crafted to turn off the iPhone’s logging. That would then let NSO secretly install the Pegasus spyware and control what was being collected on the phone. Apple says that the specific vulnerability that NSO was using was patched in iOS 14.8, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22672352/apple-spyware-gateway-iphone-software-update-nso-pegasus"&gt;you can read more about here&lt;/a&gt;. The summary is that NSO was sending files that exploited a bug in how iMessage rendered GIFs and PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E62I1t"&gt;Apple says in its press release that, thanks to improvements it’s made to iOS 15 security, it “has not observed any evidence of successful remote attacks against devices running iOS 15 and later versions.” When the Pegasus Project was publishing its reports in July, Amnesty International said that the latest versions of iOS (at the time iOS 14.6) were susceptible to attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K40P9H"&gt;For more information about the reporting done on Pegasus, its capabilities, and its potential targets, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"&gt;see our explainer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The company says it’ll distribute $10 million (plus any damages it wins from its lawsuit) to groups working on counter-surveillance and pledges in its press release to give free “technical, threat intelligence, and engineering assistance” to Citizen Lab, a group of researchers that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22672352/apple-spyware-gateway-iphone-software-update-nso-pegasus"&gt;were involved with the Pegasus Project&lt;/a&gt; and that helped Apple discover and patch NSO’s exploits. Apple also says it’ll do the same for other organizations “where appropriate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ozzFC"&gt;NSO was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761565/nso-group-pegasus-spyware-entity-list-us-government-human-rights"&gt;recently added to the US Entity List&lt;/a&gt;, which limits the ways American companies can sell or provide their technology to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Polestar’s Precept concept becomes Polestar 5 electric sedan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qA0XDTbxz-kpN_r2sfbNZn2buFM=/269x0:1450x787/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183497/640858.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7D6CGE"&gt;Polestar teased its gorgeous sedan concept, the Polestar Precept, giving it a new name — Polestar 5 — and a 2024 production date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5mli6"&gt;The company first revealed the Precept in concept form back in February, with sporty intentions, a software system powered by Google’s Android, and an interior chock-full of sustainable material. This week, Polestar posted a video in which we got the closest look at the new car yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hhLR7q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company first revealed the Precept in concept form back in February&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hr9wRb"&gt;Polestar, which started out as the performance sub-brand of Volvo, has emerged as one of the more interesting EV companies on the market. The company, which is jointly owned by Volvo and Volvo’s parent company, Geely, recently announced plans to go public by merging with a special acquisition company, or SPAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmnv0c"&gt;Polestar has only released two vehicles so far: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16487290/polestar-volvo-hybrid-electric-revealed"&gt;the $155,000 hybrid coupe Polestar 1&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;all-electric fastback sedan Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt;. The Polestar 3, an electric crossover SUV, is expected to be revealed in late 2021. The fourth vehicle is also expected to be an SUV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSc2Lv"&gt;The Polestar 5 is a four-door sedan with a hatchback in the rear. The company is calling it “an electric performance 4-door Grand Touring car,” which likely will mean it will compete with other luxury EVs, like the Tesla Model S, Mercedes-Benz EQS, Audi E-tron GT, and Lucid Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Svd4mS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GmVsIdWZknA?rel=0&amp;amp;start=3" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nymueh"&gt;Polestar declined to release most of the relevant specs, including price, battery size, range, and motor configuration. For what it’s worth, the Polestar 2 sports a 78kWh battery pack, which enables 291 miles (470 kilometers) of range. The electric motor puts off 408 horsepower, allowing for a 0–60 time in under five seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bn31Kv"&gt;When it was first released in concept form, the company laid out the Precept’s environmental bona fides: interior panels and seat backs are made out of “flax-based composites”; seats that have been “3D-knitted from recycled PET [or polyethylene terephthalate] bottles”; bolsters and headrests made from recycled cork vinyl; and carpets made out of reclaimed fishing nets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsxAc1"&gt;Polestar also has teased a deeper integration of Android Automotive, Google’s native infotainment system, in the Precept. The sedan will recognize the driver as they approach the car and automatically ready their favorite applications and settings. Google Assistant would recognize more languages, including local accents, and be capable of more natural conversations. Polestar also imagines video streaming becoming a bigger component of the in-car experience — while parked or during charging, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

The 5S model also has an option for 12GB of RAM, but there’s currently no option to order that one on either site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPN40o"&gt;On the higher end of the scale, the 5S Pro packs 18GB of RAM and goes for $1,299 on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09LY8HYYX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobileadvance.com%2Fasus-rog-phone-5s-pro-6-78-fhd-2448x1080-hdr-144hz-display-6000mah-dual-cell-battery-64mp-13mp-5mp-triple-camera-with-24mp-front-camera-18gb-ram-512gb-storage-5g-lte-unlocked-dual-sim-cell-phone-phantom-black%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F23%2F22798615%2Fasus-rog-5s-gaming-phone-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mobile Advance&lt;/a&gt;. Just keep in mind that while you can get the 5S in both black and white, the 5S Pro only comes in black.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mZHAH4"&gt;Both gaming phones have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550723/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-cpu-ai-performance-mwc-2021"&gt;the Snapdragon 888 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which should offer a small boost in performance when compared to the standard Snapdragon 888 that the Asus ROG Phone 5 and 5 Ultimate come with. The 5S and 5S Pro also offer an improved 360Hz touch-sampling rate, as opposed to 300Hz in previous ROG Phone 5 models. Other than that, the phones offer similar specs to the Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate, such as a 6.78-inch display, 144Hz refresh rate, 6,000mAh battery, and a 64MP camera, which you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;check out in our full review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gke8ig"&gt;Before arriving in the US, the ROG Phone 5S and 5S Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630283/asus-rog-phone-5s-pro-gaming-smartphone-android-price-release-date-features"&gt;initially went on sale in Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; in August, later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765036/asus-rog-phone-5s-pro-europe-launch-price-release-date-features"&gt;reaching European markets&lt;/a&gt; in early November.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Audi RS E-tron GT review: electric extravagance </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WlUHRJl2OdBDMotVWmDCXtSod8w=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183398/pesposito_211027_4857_0018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Phil Esposito / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;But for $140,000, is it worth it?  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KPcBLA"&gt;I won’t mince words: the 2021 Audi RS E-tron GT is hands down one of the best electric cars I’ve ever driven. It’s gorgeous, sophisticated, incredibly powerful, but it is also very, very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4bc19"&gt;The E-tron GT is the perfect example of why sometimes it pays to be part of a global conglomerate like the Volkswagen Group. Rather than try to cram its pre-existing EV architecture into a sportier package, Audi simply borrowed the one used by its sister company Porsche for its first all-electric sports car, the Taycan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJvABf"&gt;The result is everything an electric sports sedan is supposed to be: fast, opulent, and a bit stubborn in its adherence to traditional design. While some electric cars are just high-end computers in the shape of a car, the Audi E-tron GT is interested in being a car first. There’s no oppressively huge touchscreen, no undercooked semi-autonomous safety system, nothing that should give anyone with a big enough bank account any reason to pause before clicking “yes” on a purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mzjFgr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;fast, opulent, and a bit stubborn in its adherence to traditional design&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mgvF7T"&gt;Some would argue that the E-tron GT is just a rebodied Taycan, and they’d be totally right. And what’s wrong with that? The Taycan is also a fantastic electric sports car. They were developed alongside each other and share an impressive 800-volt architecture that enables quick charging. The E-tron GT’s dual electric motors — one in the front axle and one in the rear — enable between 522 and 637 horsepower depending on the model and an innovative two-speed transmission that makes for breathtaking take-offs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0TXN5"&gt;But all that elegance and power don’t come cheap. The Audi RS E-tron GT, which starts at $140,000, is more expensive than the Taycan, the Tesla Model S, &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;the Mercedes-Benz EQS. It’s also pricier than the Audi RS7, which is a luxurious speed demon in its own right. As far as I can tell, it’s more expensive than most luxury EVs, a segment that is growing rapidly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5GoaWd"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Audi E-Tron GT|104334" data-volume-uuid="15f13832b" data-volume-id="104334" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-511" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="csao1W"&gt;Grandly touring &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="Z61WdM"&gt;Normally, when I get a loaned vehicle, I try to integrate it into my everyday life: taking the kids to school, groceries, errands, etc. But the E-tron GT demanded a different tact. It’s not that I couldn’t bring myself to sully the backseat with a car seat or let my kids wipe their dirty sneakers on the seatbacks. Rather, it was because the E-tron GT is a sophisticated driving machine and demands to be treated with respect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gc9iT"&gt;Stand on the accelerator, and you can see why. The RS E-tron GT boasts 440kW, or about 590 horsepower, and in overboost mode, that number jumps to 637 horsepower. It can sprint to 60mph (100 km/h) in 3.3 seconds — not as quick as 2.2 seconds boasted by the Taycan Turbo S, but certainly impressive when you consider the E-Tron GT weighs over 5,000 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOXtQv"&gt;I’ve driven enough EVs that the thrill of near-instantaneous torque has lost a bit of its shine. Nonetheless, the RS E-tron GT managed to get my blood pumping every time I stomped on that accelerator: the skittering sound of fall leaves blasting out from under the back 21-inch tires, and then a whoosh as I was shoved back into the leather seats. (Artificial leather and microfiber are also available as an option.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rM32fN"&gt;The steering felt accurate, and the slight body roll felt necessary to give the driver a good sense of the road. The RS gets torque-vectoring and rear-axle steering as standard, while base model owners will need to cough up an extra $6,000 for those features. The wedge-shaped body handled itself ably on especially curvy roads, and the brakes were extremely efficient at hauling the Audi down from speed — which is good because, when driving this car, you tend to use the brakes a lot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NGxz7Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the brakes were extremely efficient at hauling the Audi down from speed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E4Drdn"&gt;Unlike some competitors, Audi doesn’t offer one-pedal driving that is typically offered in most EVs. The maximum regenerative braking, which is activated by plus- and minus-paddles on the steering column, doesn’t slow the car down that much. The result is an electric sedan that drives imperceptibly from a conventional gas-powered one, which could help win some fans who are skeptical about shifting to battery power but may disappoint fans of one-pedal driving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSQiIq"&gt;One of the neatest features is the ability to adjust what Audi calls the “listener experience,” which is another way of describing the artificial sounds the car makes at low speeds. Electric cars are legally required to make an external noise so other road users can hear them coming. Audi took what could have been a dull task and made it quirky. Among the sound samples used were a model helicopter and a didgeridoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RL6UDy"&gt;It’s not impossible to pick out the sonic nuances while driving the E-tron GT, but the overall effect is kind of lost. You’re left with a digital whirring sound that is not that dissimilar from a variety of other EVs I’ve driven recently. And my brain is not so far gone as to prefer it over a V10 engine roar. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are two charging ports, one on either side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="0UAU2N"&gt;Charging ahead&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="e56j72"&gt;When charging the Audi RS E-tron GT, you inevitably run into the same problems as you would with every electric car that isn’t a Tesla: the lack of a proprietary network of EV chargers. That said, the E-tron GT doesn’t lack in options. There are connections for alternating current on both sides, and on the right, there is also a connection for direct current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzMEku"&gt;Audi advertises 232 miles of range on a full battery, which falls far short of other similarly priced luxury EVs, like the Model S (412 miles), EQS (350 miles), or Lucid Air (520 miles). I didn’t tackle any steep hills, so presumably, the E-tron GT’s battery drained at a normal rate while I had the vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A16cwd"&gt;Audi claims that its 800-volt system enables ultra-fast charging. Just five minutes on a high-speed charging network like Volkswagen’s Electrify America, and the E-tron GT will recover 100 kilometers, or 62 miles, of range. As always, the company is assuming a rate of charge that typically exceeds what most chargers, even fast chargers, actually dole out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z-jm7Hp1Y_sk4vdEkeHz_eE7ekw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22978043/ahawkins_211028_4857_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audi does not have its own charging network, like Tesla.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OXGl8a"&gt;It took several days of driving to drain the battery below 40 percent. I charged it once at home using the 120-volt outlet in my garage, only adding a couple miles of range after a full eight hours of trickle charging. I also charged it at a public DC fast charger, where it took 42 minutes to charge from 45 percent to 80 percent. That was at a 45kW rate — less than half the advertised top rate of 150kW. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5ovWg"&gt;It should be noted that Audi does not have its own charging network, like Tesla. But the automaker is offering a couple of workarounds, including three years of complimentary DC fast charging through VW’s Electrify America. (There’s that synergy again!) Audi E-tron GT customers can also get discounted in-home charging installations through a partnership with EV charging provider Qmerit. Still, it won’t be enough to assuage any of the charging anxiety many EV-hesitant car buyers experience.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a lot of carbon fiber in this car.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="wWa2zw"&gt;Hop inside&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="pPmUhC"&gt;To step inside the E-tron GT is to enter a familiar world. There’s a touchscreen display &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;physical buttons for the HVAC system. The air vents are real air vents. There’s a center console, gear stalk, and other physical touchpoints that may seem quaint in an EV world dominated by Tesla. This is not an aggressively minimized EV interior, nor is it one designed to overwhelm the senses. Sure, there’s a lot of carbon fiber — maybe too much? — but the overall look and feel of the interior is sleek and compact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDdgu0"&gt;Front-seat space is generous, but the cockpit is noticeably narrow, and the view out the back window is limited. I think I may have pulled a muscle trying to get in and out of this car, thanks to the low height and smallish door openings. The RS model comes with black leather sport seats with red stitching, which really hug your body and are designed with 14 different adjustable settings, climate control, massage functions — you name it. The steering wheel was covered in a soft suede that was absolutely dynamite to touch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UCinfr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Front-seat space is generous, but the cockpit is noticeably narrow&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="53XclI"&gt;One of the odder features is the inclusion of a touch-sensitive knob to control the volume on the center console between the seats. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/reviews/2022-audi-rs-e-tron-gt-review/"&gt;Tim Stevens from &lt;em&gt;Roadshow &lt;/em&gt;likens it&lt;/a&gt; to the infamous click-wheel on an iPod, and I have to agree. But while he found it awkwardly placed, I grew to really like it, to the point where I missed it while driving other vehicles. Of course, you can still control the volume from the steering wheel, but it seemed like a nice touch for passengers who may want to skip tracks or adjust the volume without having to futz with the touchscreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YsQR8dByyeYY9gtjaXEXvNBO8uA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22978041/ahawkins_211027_4857_0011.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Audi RS E-tron GT is an incredible car to drive, full stop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mLfSuR"&gt;The base model E-tron GT comes with a glass roof that can’t be opened and isn’t tinted enough to block the sun. The RS version that I drove, however, swaps that out for an all-carbon-fiber roof. The vehicle already tips the scales at 5,000 pounds, so it seems like Audi went with the carbon fiber to save a little bit of weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qL1v7Z"&gt;The 10.1-touchscreen runs on Audi’s totally serviceable MIB3 software, which wirelessly supports both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. One of my favorite features was the backup camera, which includes a 3D rendering of the vehicle to help navigate those especially tight parking spaces. Otherwise, the infotainment system was pretty bland. I liked the built-in nav system — the directional cues were easy to follow, and the map itself wasn’t overly cluttered — but considering it runs off of a Google API, there was no compelling reason not to just run Google Maps through CarPlay instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="IYxC5O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the infotainment system was pretty bland&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xBzPjX"&gt;I was not impressed with the parking assist feature that is supposed to guide the vehicle into a parking space with limited input from the driver. The interface was opaque, and eventually, I gave up on trying to make it work. The driver-assist system was fine, though you’ll have to pay $2,250 to get advanced features like lane-keep assist and adaptive cruise control. And why would you want some software driving your RS E-tron GT for you anyway? &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audi is entering a very crowded segment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="saTVaB"&gt;A crowded segment&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="8zJrd7"&gt;It’s been nearly a decade since the Tesla Model S kicked off the EV race with its graceful blend of technological efficiency and addictively fun driving style. Since then, the rest of the auto industry has piled into the luxury EV segment, bringing their own unique style while trying to improve on Tesla’s well-established issues with fit-and-finish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3xwgP"&gt;In addition to the refreshed Model S Plaid (released this year), we’ve got the Mercedes-Benz EQS, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/14/13628872/jaguar-ipace-concept-electric-car-suv-unveiled-la-auto-show-2016-photos"&gt;Jaguar I-Pace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range"&gt;Porsche Taycan&lt;/a&gt;, which is the spiritual cousin to the E-tron GT. Other vehicles slated for imminent release include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;Cadillac Lyriq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335807/bmw-i4-sedan-ev-m-performance-range-photos"&gt;BMW i4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357789/lexus-lf-z-electrified-concept-car-ev-toyota-electric"&gt;Lexus LF-Z&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429319/lucid-motors-air-electric-sedan-price-specs-range-reveal"&gt;Lucid Air&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9uqHJA"&gt;The luxury electric market is clearly in overdrive, and the RS E-tron GT is the latest example of the type of sophisticated driving machine you can get with enough money in the bank. It doesn’t beat Tesla on range, nor does it do much to improve on the Taycan, which comes in a slightly less expensive package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xTGFru"&gt;What it does offer is a design that is exclusively Audi. It’s a polished, villainous entrant to the luxury EV market, and it sets the stage for more to come.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic scoops up Rock Band creator Harmonix</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gi0pwL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; maker Epic Games has announced its latest acquisition: Harmonix, the studio behind iconic music games like &lt;em&gt;Guitar Hero&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rock Band&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W03BBV"&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.harmonixmusic.com/blog/harmonix-is-joining-the-epic-games-family"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Harmonix said that support for existing games like &lt;em&gt;Rock Band&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fuser&lt;/em&gt; would continue. The studio also explained its plans to expand into — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;what else?&lt;/a&gt; — the metaverse. “Now, we’ll be working with Epic to once again challenge expectations as we bring our unique brand of musical gaming experiences to the metaverse, and we couldn’t be more excited,” the blog post reads. As part of this, Epic says that the studio will “develop musical journeys and gameplay for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XVn6TZ"&gt;Music has become an increasing focus for Epic, following the big success of virtual concerts inside of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt;. And according to the company, scooping up Harmonix fits into that musical focus. “Music is already bringing millions of people together in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, from our emotes to global concerts and events,” Alain Tascan, Epic’s VP of game development, said in a statement. “Together with the Harmonix team, we will transform how players experience music, going from passive listeners to active participants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PU99Vt"&gt;Epic has made a number of high-profile acquisitions in the game development space over the last few years, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525842/epic-games-psyonix-acquisition-rocket-league-fortnite-unreal-deal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; studio Psyonix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309569/epic-games-fall-guys-mediatonic-acquisition-buying-announce-deal"&gt;Mediatonic, the team behind &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Ysdobu3Dq5hfr7-QRZnyVxadrk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079139/Early_Black_Friday_Deals.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, many retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score a great deal before it sells out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nypGAV"&gt;Latest deal highlights:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bbnT9I"&gt;The black configuration of Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 2 is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-True-Wireless-Cancellation/dp/B085LVV8R7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to just $167 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, its best price to date. Normally $300, the excellent noise-canceling earbuds offer great ANC performance, customizable controls, and sound that can nearly match that of a premium pair of noise-canceling over-ear headphones. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230931/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review-earbuds-headphones-sound-specs-battery-life-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6O5W6j"&gt;Sideclick’s Universal Remote Attachment adds more functionality to your Roku streaming player remote and makes it possible to control Blu-ray players, soundbars, TVs, and more with a single remote. Right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3TymSJkl9" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can buy it for $15&lt;/a&gt; instead of $30.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="txfke0"&gt;The Nintendo Switch version of &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;, easily one of the best games of 2020, is &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1191364/9383?subId1=VergeEarlyBlackFridayDeals112321&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHades-SuperGiant-Games-Nintendo-Switch%2F132303441&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Walmart for just $20&lt;/a&gt;, down from its usual sale price of $35.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pr5JBX"&gt;If you’re looking for a cheap entertainment device, Samsung’s 32GB Galaxy Tab A7 is &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1204229/2092?subId1=VergeEarlyBlackFridayDeals112321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsamsung-galaxy-tab-a7-10-4--34--display-32gb-storage-tablet---gray%2F-%2FA-81915442" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale for $150 at Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="lwMndD"&gt;Right now, Amazon is discounting all sizes of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, the LG C1. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model is on sale for $1,097&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,297, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is selling for $1,297&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $1,797&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, all sport several features gamers will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, and support for HDMI 2.1. Best Buy is offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWewqARCyb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same discounts&lt;/a&gt;, except with 30 days of FuboTV Pro and three months of Apple TV Plus, as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV, a camera accessory that brings wide-angle video chats to your TV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="MqKN84"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="E5gVG7"&gt;Amazon is also discounting various sizes of Samsung’s The Frame, a unique kind of TV that functions both as wall art and an HDR-compatible QLED. Right now, for example, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,498&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $998&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. The TV offers a decor-friendly design while also displaying customizable images when somebody’s in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into a smart 4K TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and a 120Hz refresh rate. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeAej60sy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is matching this deal&lt;/a&gt; as well, and including 30 days of FuboTV Pro as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="jNcvZm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="mExVb6"&gt;This 70-inch LG TV may only feature midrange specs, but Best Buy has brought it down to its lowest price ever. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTimnyrsb7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG NanoCell 75 series TV is down to just $750&lt;/a&gt; for a limited time, a staggering $450 off the list price. The 4K panel is powered by LG’s WebOS smart platform, which offers a solid array of streaming services and includes HDR10 for vivid picture quality. The 75 Series also comes equipped with three HDMI ports and ARC compatibility, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2, which allows you to cast content from your Apple device to your TV. It may not be as impressive as an OLED TV, but $750 for a 70-inch panel is still a solid value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="YkAdjB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10835005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="wcr0Gl"&gt;Naturally, Amazon is offering some great discounts on its own products, taking between $140 and $150 off the Omni Series (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;) and 4-Series 4K Fire TVs (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08SVZ775L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QB66R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lDDnQ9"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on streaming devices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="qcHKiS"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K, which just launched in September, is selling at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Froku-streaming-stick-4k-2021-streaming-device-4k-hdr-dolby-vision-with-voice-remote-and-tv-controls%2F-%2FA-52709600%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayTechDeals111921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vrWZYkTQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is offering the streaming device for just $30. The 2021 model is faster, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, which means you can use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="xfNVil"&gt;This accessible Roku alternative from Google features support for Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, and the current sale at the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/chromecast_google_tv?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1JKx5U7SD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has brought the Chromecast with Google TV down to $40, saving you $10 off the regular price.

You can even cast media from your phone through the Chromecast app. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ADYgqg"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on laptops and tablets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="c5Ol71"&gt;The Lenovo Yoga 9i remains one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687992/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-pro-8-hp-spectre-macbook-air-creator-laptops-compare-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our favorite alternatives to the Microsoft Surface line of ultrabooks&lt;/a&gt; and, right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThlWBLJhS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is offering the slick 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; for $1,350. While this model received a similar discount a couple of months ago, it still remains a solid value. The foldable laptop boasts some impressive specs, too, with an 11th Gen Core i7 CPU, 512GB of storage, and Iris Xe integrated graphics. This hardware, paired with a 4K touchscreen display and a garaged stylus, makes the 9i a great choice for creators.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="nisc5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10689258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1BiPh2"&gt;HP’s 15.6-inch laptop with Windows Home in S Mode is on sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3sBxrPIx7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $330&lt;/a&gt; instead of $500. This particular model features 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i3 processor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9kKV5j"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Chromebook-Celeron-Processor-Gigabit/dp/B07XL4JHXR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 11.6-inch Galaxy Chromebook 4&lt;/a&gt; is now on sale for $180 instead of $250 at Amazon. This particular model includes 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eNqjUh"&gt;The Dell XPS 15 ultrabook is currently enjoying a solid discount. &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-14349898?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Fxps-15-9510-laptop%2Fsmx15w11p1c6700p%3Fpreview%3Doff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has reduced the price of this particular configuration to $2,199&lt;/a&gt;, taking $396 off the usual price tag. This is the best deal we’ve seen on this laptop so far, with some retailers charging as much as $2,600 for the same configuration. This model boasts some impressive specs with an 11th Gen Core i9 CPU and an RTX 3050 Ti graphics card, not to mention 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Our reviewer, Monica Chin, liked the 16:10 display and snappy keyboard, even though the XPS 15 tended to get a little hot under load. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="vAdouM"&gt;The latest model of the Dell XPS 13 takes what made last year’s model so great and makes it better. During its Black Friday sale, &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-12578053?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops-and-notebooks%2Fxps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fsmx13w11p2c3100p" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has marked down this configuration to $1,369&lt;/a&gt;, taking about $260 off the regular MSRP. While not quite the same configuration, aforementioned reviewer Monica Chin described the Dell XPS 13 as the company’s “best-in-class 13-inch ultraportable laptop.” This particular configuration comes equipped with an Intel Core i7-1195G7, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. While the integrated Iris Xe GPU doesn’t have enough juice for gaming, this lightweight laptop is remarkably versatile and remains a powerful choice in the 13-inch laptop class. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21310825" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

The 2021 iPad Pro is also a speed demon thanks to Apple’s M1 chip and comes with welcome features such as a Mini LED display, Thunderbolt connectivity, Wi-Fi 6 support, and Face ID, which allows you to unlock the device with just a glance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

That’s one of the lowest prices Amazon has ever sold them for. As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the comfortable headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound while providing 17 hours of playback per charge.

While this phone doesn’t come packaged with a complimentary pair of earbuds like some other models, you do get a free 11-inch Chromebook.

This is the only model currently on sale that doesn’t net you any extra goodies, but it’s a solid value regardless. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

While all eyes are on the new Pixel 6, we still stand by the Pixel 5A as a solid and affordable entry. Featuring one of the best cameras available in a midrange smartphone, the 5G-compatible 5A also comes equipped with 128GB of onboard storage, IP67 water resistance, and improved battery life. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

The list of items the sale covers is robust, and includes everything from board games, to craft supplies, to some of the latest video games. If you can think of a faster way to fill your stockings this holiday, we’d like to hear it. &lt;/li&gt;

Normally $250, you can pick up both peripherals for $170 for a limited time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bE0eBv"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="OnH62Q"&gt;The older GoPro Hero8 Black often retails for $300 on its own, but &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoPro-HERO8-Black-Dual-Battery-Charger-Bonus-Battery%2F199369934&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is offering a bundle that includes the popular 4K action cam for just $249&lt;/a&gt;. Other retailers offer &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3ssYV7eRw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the camera alone for $250&lt;/a&gt;, so this bundle is the better value. It includes a dual battery charger and a total of three batteries, so you’ll never run out of juice. This rugged digital camera is perfectly suited for capturing fast-moving action wherever and whenever it happens. The HyperSmooth technology provides an amazing level of image stabilization, while the LiveBurst feature automatically records anything that happens two seconds before and two seconds after your shot. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="6WQkzQ"&gt;The latest GoPro, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1658382-REG%2Fgopro_chdhx_101_hero10_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero10 Black&lt;/a&gt;, is currently selling at its lowest price ever. Normally $500, B&amp;amp;H is now selling the popular action cam for $450. The Hero10 Black boasts all the amazing features found on its predecessor — which we once called the “biggest, baddest action camera out there” — and more, like a new processor that allows it to shoot in higher frame rates and upload videos to the cloud while charging. It’s also compatible with Hero9 accessories, meaning those looking to upgrade won’t necessarily need to purchase new add-ons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The bundle includes the 20MP, 4K-capable camera as well as a wireless shooting grip and a 64GB memory card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Vh1LyO"&gt;Other great deals happening now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dfpgis"&gt;A great companion to any streamer or podcaster, the Blue Yeti microphone is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $100&lt;/a&gt;, matching one of its best prices to date. The Yeti can conform to a number of recording environments thanks to the Blue VO!CE software, which allows you to change pickup patterns, modulate, and otherwise fine-tune your audio. The mic comes packaged with its own stand but is also compatible with a wide variety of booms and mic arms if that's more your style. The current discount applies to the black, blue, grey, and silver models, meaning you’ve got a variety of styles to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

Western Digital claims up to sequential read / write speeds of 1,050MB/s and 1,000MB/s, respectively, and the deal also includes a USB Type-A adapter in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GlKjia"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Niantic and a crypto debit card company made an AR game where you earn Bitcoin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot from the Niantic/Fold app Fold AR." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L-K1yZudSGdGIvUoJxgMQPQNlYU=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183191/AR_Marketing_Subway.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jJSUpu"&gt;Have you ever played &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; and thought “I wish this game let you earn small amounts of Bitcoin by engaging with internet finance memes and a cryptocurrency debit card system”? If so, I don’t believe you, but I have good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwj6i9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fold AR&lt;/em&gt; is a new augmented reality game from &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; developer Niantic and the financial company Fold. The game — which a press release dubs part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;the metaverse&lt;/a&gt; — is very loosely modeled on &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;but themed around cryptocurrency. As explained by Fold CEO Will Reeves, it runs with the metaphor of “mining” Bitcoin. So instead of capturing cute monsters, the central mechanic involves finding cubes of binary code and tapping them like &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; blocks until they reveal a prize.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshots from the Niantic/Fold game Fold AR" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mpq-PbtNYiOnberG3ZsMiLEm9ko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037575/AR_UX_Walkthrough.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0y8ycM"&gt;The prizes include Bitcoin in the denomination of Satoshis, a very small unit currently worth around 1/20th of a penny. They also include power-ups for Fold, which already gamifies card purchases through an app that lets you spin a wheel and win Bitcoin rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkScWT"&gt;Unlike &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; and other Niantic games, though, &lt;em&gt;Fold AR&lt;/em&gt; (which is launched from inside the Fold app) is not currently set in a world full of virtual places that correspond to real-world locations. Instead, the game spawns a block between 1 and 50 feet away from the player every 10 minutes, mirroring the rate of real Bitcoin mining. The team hopes to launch other features beginning early next year, potentially including a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching"&gt;geocaching&lt;/a&gt;-like multiplayer system that lets you hide Bitcoin for friends to find, as well as some form of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;non-fungible token, or NFT&lt;/a&gt;, system based on Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8o9D56"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The app is supposed to make Bitcoin feel more tangible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bPMdvD"&gt;Reeves says the goal is partly to make a virtual currency feel real by creating an AR setting for it. The game is filled with cryptocurrency and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22774719/rivian-ipo-meme-stock-tesla-reddit-wallstreetbets"&gt;meme stock&lt;/a&gt; in-jokes, featuring mechanics with names like “Diamond Hands.” But it’s supposed to appeal to both cryptocurrency newcomers and existing fans — “This is a wonderful experience to share with people,” says Reeves. It’s also reminiscent of the &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/5f593804-331d-4e99-81d2-4998a69b76b3"&gt;financial gamification&lt;/a&gt; found in non-crypto investing app Robinhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OoFvcM"&gt;More broadly, &lt;em&gt;Fold AR&lt;/em&gt; is part of a trend called “play to earn” that gives players cryptocurrency rewards instead of purely in-game currency. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725083/axie-infinity-sky-mavis-blockchain-economy-game-pokemon"&gt;NFT-based play-to-earn game &lt;em&gt;Axie Infinity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has spawned a complicated economy over the past few years, although that seems far less likely here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUTmJM"&gt;Reeves suggested that Niantic might look at &lt;em&gt;Fold AR&lt;/em&gt; features — including the play-to-earn system — for inspiration. However, he said that there was no official roadmap for anything like adding financial features to any existing Niantic game. He also didn’t disclose precisely what parts of the game Niantic developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qu7U0a"&gt;In a statement, Niantic’s Megan Hughes said that “games always help us push the boundaries of technology and allow us to incubate some of our most audacious thinking, but we see incredible opportunity in multiple categories, including payments.” It’s not a totally new turn for the studio — &lt;em&gt;Ingress&lt;/em&gt; featured advertising partnerships &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/5/3954598/google-ingress-augmented-reality-game-partners-with-duane-reade"&gt;with Duane Reade and JambaJuice&lt;/a&gt;, among other companies. But with Niantic also increasingly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22768925/niantic-lightship-developer-platform-john-hanke-pokemon-go"&gt;focused on AR glasses&lt;/a&gt;, it could offer a sign about what kind of experiences that might involve.&lt;/p&gt;
