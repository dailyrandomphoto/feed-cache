    <title>Amazon goes quiet on its Twitch-based Pac-Man game, but Bandai Namco says it’s still in development</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon Games and Bandai Namco&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rnmAeI"&gt;In May 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266881/pac-man-live-studio-playable-on-twitch-june"&gt;Amazon announced &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an interesting new version of &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man &lt;/em&gt;that you’d be able to play right inside Twitch. The game was set to release that June — but recently the company removed all traces of it from the Amazon Games website. Nearly a year after &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; was supposed to debut, its status remains a mystery — though developer Bandai Namco says the game is still in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SePP7C"&gt;Right now, &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt;’s page on the Amazon Games website &lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/games/pac-man-live-studio"&gt;shows a 404 error&lt;/a&gt;, but the Wayback Machine has an archived version of the filled-out webpage &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210407014742/https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/games/pac-man-live-studio"&gt;from April 7th&lt;/a&gt;. This archived version lists a release date of “coming soon” — many months after the original June launch date. And Wario64, who you might know as one of the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/microsoft-new-gaming-console-545e87c5-0a6f-4384-8b69-dbded2737e01.html#:~:text=Wario64,worse"&gt;best video game deal-finders on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, reported that the site wasn’t working &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1383552847120257024"&gt;as recently as mid-April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dQoHaS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10505133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tmT7cS"&gt;There is a live page for the game on Pac-Man’s &lt;a href="https://pacman.com/en/games/livestudio.php"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;, which says &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; is “coming soon” and lists Bandai Namco as the developer and Amazon Games as the publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvrXLN"&gt;There’s also a live Twitter account, @&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playpacmanlive?lang=en"&gt;PlayPacManLive&lt;/a&gt;, that has only &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1263642826018971651"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1280317322842931201"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1290349893421211648"&gt;handful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1290350207553564672"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1290350895025143809"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt;. The latest is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1295162966736695297"&gt;from August 16th, 2020&lt;/a&gt; (in reply to a tweet from an account that no longer exists) saying that “we’re getting closer to having all the pellets in place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A3DCbe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're getting closer to having all the pellets in place, and coffee breaks activated. We greatly appreciate your patience.&lt;/p&gt;— PAC-MAN LIVE STUDIO (@PlayPacManLive) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1295162966736695297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ewPnZ2"&gt;After this story was originally published, Bandai Namco shared the following statement, saying that the game isn’t ready just yet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="xozNgh"&gt;Amazon is a great partner and helped us with the heavy lifting on Twitch integration, testing and westernization. &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; was intended to be part of &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man’s&lt;/em&gt; 40&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Anniversary celebration, but the game is not quite ready to launch yet. We are working to determine a launch date now, and hope to have news to share soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5ExYxX"&gt;But it’s still not clear why the game is no longer listed on the Amazon Games website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hivyrY"&gt;Amazon’s game development studio has had a rocky history.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Hero shooter &lt;em&gt;Crucible&lt;/em&gt; launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21246923/amazon-crucible-relentless-studio-free-to-play-launch-date-may-20"&gt;last May&lt;/a&gt; but was put back into closed beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308638/amazon-game-studios-crucible-closed-beta-failure-relentless-studio"&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt; and eventually canceled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. The studio also canceled a &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; online roleplaying game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/17/22389533/amazon-canceled-lord-of-the-rings-game-tencent"&gt;in April&lt;/a&gt; after a contract dispute with Tencent. (Amazon is still working on its &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/amazons-lord-of-the-rings-will-cost-at-least-465-million.html"&gt;extremely expensive &lt;em&gt;Lord of Rings&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt;, however.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHQ9wH"&gt;And open-world MMO &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon Games’ current marquee title (and, I should add, the only one listed in &lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/games"&gt;the Games section&lt;/a&gt; of the studio’s website), was delayed for the third time from a spring 2021 release to August 31st &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285810/new-world-amazon-delay-august-2021-release-date"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="RRqMbI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10505115"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rgW81Q"&gt;Despite the cancellations, the company recently reiterated support for game development. In response to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-29/amazon-game-studios-struggles-to-find-a-hit?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;damning &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report from January&lt;/a&gt; describing problems at the studio, incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy shared a memo internally, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/andy-jassy-next-amazon-ceo-says-he-s-committed-to-making-video-games?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;also reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, stating the company’s continued commitment to gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUJBEn"&gt;“Some businesses take off in the first year, and others take many years,” Jassy reportedly wrote. “Though we haven’t consistently succeeded yet in AGS, I believe we will if we hang in there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NeFvPD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 18th, 12:13PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Bandai Namco and made changes to reflect that the game is apparently still in development.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is helping games about high heels and long nails go viral</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xP8l3uRcG1ZxzLpKWtHbXwT-lfw=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69305649/HighHeels_1_0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;There’s now an assembly line of ‘baddie games’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="eQVAk3"&gt;One night in January, I was scrolling through TikTok with the bottomless human need for content when a video urged my glassy eyes awake. It was a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@isaiahbaca_/video/6919037106161585414?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowtWMs0%2Bcc5kwB%2BvD4Vl7zFh23ty5G8%2FV1gcO30OHn08KwEmzMJHjnV6Fh9mLCAG1LGgA%3D&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAsnRtH4NmKnrIUH0lfirtlf8o9H0mLiBx-kT_mIufohUsVbqAVyuXSdBwG3lU09k1&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_item_id=6919037106161585414&amp;amp;share_link_id=93F08AFD-4599-443D-8D00-9CC2ADE0BC4F&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;timestamp=1619927298&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=dd7g5ak540h11k&amp;amp;user_id=6844705173010957318&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;_r=1"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; for hypercasual phone game &lt;em&gt;High Heels!&lt;/em&gt; made from an original video by TikTok user &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@isaiahbaca_?lang=en"&gt;Isaiah Baca&lt;/a&gt;. He proclaimed that he had “found a game for baddies.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhImqb"&gt;A “baddie,” if you’re not familiar with the term, is essentially a hot, independent girl. According to one of the &lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Baddie"&gt;oldest&lt;/a&gt; Urban Dictionary entries for “baddie,” from 2006, one of the ways that you could use “baddie” in a sentence is to say, “Wow, that girl is a baddie.” So, checks out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ui35lf"&gt;Baddies aren’t your typical phone game demographic. But watching the addictive, repetitive premise of &lt;em&gt;High Heels!&lt;/em&gt; unfold, you kind of see what Baca means. The game, by Turkish developer Rollic Games, is as simple as its genre necessitates. You play as a continuously sashaying woman, stacking high heels to get over obstacles that progressively eliminate your heels. Occasionally, you slide down a platform while doing the splits and clapping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlzEnK"&gt;Although I mostly forgot about &lt;em&gt;High Heels! &lt;/em&gt;until I started getting more TikToks for different-but-very-similar hypercasual games, it went viral. Most of the thousands of comments lauded the developer’s use of a genuine TikTok as an ad, laughed about the game’s use of the splits (it’s pretty good), and asked (in all caps) what the name of the game was. Just like with &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/brand-twitter-jokes-history.html"&gt;Brand Twitter&lt;/a&gt;’s strange but often successful imitation of relatability, the perceived authenticity of &lt;em&gt;High Heels! &lt;/em&gt;brought it relevance. According to a mid-April &lt;a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/data-and-research/76319/app-annie-zynga-high-heels-breakout-mobile-game-of-q1-2012/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Pocket Gamer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;High Heels!&lt;/em&gt; was one of the biggest mobile game debuts for the first quarter of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMdXdi"&gt;It also unintentionally spearheaded a new genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="SUvax9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@gameluffy_/video/6949211859383766278" data-video-id="6949211859383766278" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@gameluffy_" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gameluffy_"&gt;@gameluffy_&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;See the end &lt;a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp"&gt;#fyp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="❤️❤️" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F"&gt;#❤️❤️&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="tiktokgame" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tiktokgame"&gt;#tiktokgame&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="funny" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/funny"&gt;#funny&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="JustAddBriskZero" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/JustAddBriskZero"&gt;#JustAddBriskZero&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="AerieREAL" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/AerieREAL"&gt;#AerieREAL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="GetCrocd" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/GetCrocd"&gt;#GetCrocd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ Chug Jug With You - Leonz" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Chug-Jug-With-You-6942942200548296706"&gt;♬ Chug Jug With You - Leonz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HpsXqJ"&gt;Some recent “baddie game” titles include: &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gameluffy_/video/6949211859383766278?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgow7vUFKIF0bPZEvj5vS6oTQgAt0ahXNDHIVPqSga9xSXNNIKaH6MOGG32RVVFrhQbZGgA%3D&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAsnRtH4NmKnrIUH0lfirtlf8o9H0mLiBx-kT_mIufohUsVbqAVyuXSdBwG3lU09k1&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_item_id=6949211859383766278&amp;amp;share_link_id=846ED183-5A69-4E13-A8DD-D366EDB8EAA1&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;timestamp=1619928990&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=dd7g5ak540h11k&amp;amp;user_id=6844705173010957318&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;_r=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squat Master&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where sitting on various conveyor belt items will either inflate or deflate your character’s butt; &lt;em&gt;You Go Girl&lt;/em&gt;, which involves posing a character as she twists down an infinite &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@someteeheeroblox/video/6952675630072876290?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowGoM58IqivaQ2Bgmqbecsva5Extm3zecmySO6vo8XxTfxX12o3wkYsopEZbwAT2Z1GgA%3D&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAsnRtH4NmKnrIUH0lfirtlf8o9H0mLiBx-kT_mIufohUsVbqAVyuXSdBwG3lU09k1&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_item_id=6952675630072876290&amp;amp;share_link_id=104ACE67-1358-4753-8172-882E4AFE1A9A&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;timestamp=1619929202&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=dd7g5ak540h11k&amp;amp;user_id=6844705173010957318&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;_r=1"&gt;pole&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@antonio_cuciniello/video/6943284851315395846?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowFABAmijii2WfDFoEqRmZxnu%2FoQ9z4VBdt2NJj%2BZBgGzUmOuqZebEbbbFSR7LOZuVGgA%3D&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAsnRtH4NmKnrIUH0lfirtlf8o9H0mLiBx-kT_mIufohUsVbqAVyuXSdBwG3lU09k1&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_item_id=6943284851315395846&amp;amp;share_link_id=EFC6CA1A-C1E4-4D2A-96A0-A47E5EDA6C8B&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;timestamp=1619929291&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=dd7g5ak540h11k&amp;amp;user_id=6844705173010957318&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;_r=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nail Woman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is the nail version of &lt;em&gt;High Heels!&lt;/em&gt; with the added bonus of, if you pass a shirtless boy character, Nail Woman’s nails cut him in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vc2GM1"&gt;A lot of the conversation surrounding these TikToks are the same. Users declare the games to be “baddie games” or what video games made by Gen Z would be like. They are also heavily associated with the queer community, not only because queer users tend to play them but also for other signals, like LGBT &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@aaronbeattie_/video/6919232127087299842?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgow%2BORA4HfKt0pAbOIT2wONh2CkqWtbdRvp4ar6UAbqUJI3C4ZLi1af%2BQf42pWsG8yqGgA%3D&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAsnRtH4NmKnrIUH0lfirtlf8o9H0mLiBx-kT_mIufohUsVbqAVyuXSdBwG3lU09k1&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_item_id=6919232127087299842&amp;amp;share_link_id=001B3FB8-3B75-4FF2-AC5C-00A33A97B8B3&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;timestamp=1619931388&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=dd7g5ak540h11k&amp;amp;user_id=6844705173010957318&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;_r=1"&gt;hashtags&lt;/a&gt; and strategic music choices, namely sped-up versions of Nicki Minaj’s “Megatron” and Lil Nas X’s “Call Me By Your Name.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqNNBQ"&gt;The aesthetics of the games themselves also gesture at queerness and online culture more broadly. A lot of “baddie games” are centered on exaggerated gender performance, much like drag or ballroom culture. Other games flirt with the idea of sex work or embrace the “bimbo,” two things notably redefined by the internet’s obsession with sugar babies, OnlyFans, and previously maligned 2000’s hot girls like Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. Even the bestowed moniker “baddie game” encompasses these things with its implied hyperfemininity and sexual liberation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeEwBQ"&gt;In a February &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/gaming/high-heels-app-game-queer-joy"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Input&lt;/em&gt;, writer Matt Wille singled out &lt;em&gt;High Heels! &lt;/em&gt;as a game that rewards players for queerness, writing, “Whether or not its creators intended it, &lt;em&gt;High Heels!&lt;/em&gt; deserves credit for being a space around which the queer community can celebrate being femme.” I’m not entirely sure of that. The only things that are “queer” about these games are the aesthetics and vernacular co-opted from their most loyal players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4zxfh"&gt;With this in mind, I talked to queer comedian Mano Agapion about baddie games after seeing an old tweet of his about it. “Everyone play the iPhone game &lt;em&gt;High Heels!&lt;/em&gt;,” he wrote on February 6th. “It’s queer culture.” Wondering if he still played the game, I DMed him. “I burned through it in two weeks. I don’t play anymore, but I did try the big butt one,” he said over DM. “You clap as you’re split upon broom sticks connecting two skyscrapers. And that’s drag.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CMnWM9"&gt;I asked if anything about the game’s purported queerness bothers him. “It makes sense that it’s queer bait,” he said. “But sometimes you have to turn your brain off with a dumb thing. And I like queer things being celebrated in pop culture.” Ryan Davis, a Twitter user who tweeted that he was “willing to trade all of the live feed videos on my TikTok [For You Page] in exchange for more &lt;em&gt;High Heels!&lt;/em&gt; game ads,” DMed me something similar. “Honestly, I just thought the ad itself was pretty funny. I think the aesthetic and branding plus the Nicki song paired well and made the game seem intriguing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LpE9Pc"&gt;So maybe I am overthinking this whole “baddie game” thing. Maybe I should let games like Rollic’s &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bounce-big/id1552911964"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bounce Big&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which asks you in the description to “collect delish jigglers!” as you grow your character’s ass, jiggle in peace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jhw0hw"&gt;But Rollic has refused to acknowledge its explicit tie to the queer community, the one it created by using a queer person’s TikTok as free, viral advertisement. The studio, and other developers, strengthen the tie by flooding the app store with new baddie-baiting games that all seem to be in never-ending imitation of each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2h32IG"&gt;Searching any variation of “queen” or “heels’’ will yield you a healthy handful of hypercasual game results, most by Turkish developers like Rollic. Some notable titles that speak to just how strong the assembly line vibes on this whole “baddie game” thing is: &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/catwalk-queen/id1560181694"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catwalk Queen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Baris Yilmaz, which involves filling an ever-growing purse with mounds of money; &lt;a href="https://appadvice.com/app/roll-queen/1557507047"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roll Queen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;from Hakan Ozer, which uses the slogan “the simps go round and round” and has your character stepping on men to progress levels; and &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/baddies-up/id1559784459"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baddies Up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Wixot Studios, which requires you to both step on men and collect wads of cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbbHhi"&gt;Turkey is a bit of a powerhouse when it comes to mobile gaming and has been a part of a few high-profile sales, including San Francisco-based Zynga’s acquisition of Rollic for $180 million in cash in 2020. Homosexuality is legal in Turkey but institutionally &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55901951"&gt;suppressed&lt;/a&gt;. The “baddie games” tie to Turkey makes their queer bent a bit more exciting, flickering with the possibility that they’re giving Turkish queer developers and artists a space to create. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3S3GA4"&gt;But when pressed on the topic in the past, Rollic has been deliberately cagey. In an April &lt;a href="https://www.venn.tv/gaming/2021-04-12/tiktok-and-mobile-games-how-high-heels-went-viral/"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with video game news network VENN, when its games’ popularity with the LGBT community was mentioned, Rollic’s director of art and design Inci Alper said, “We didn’t make it specifically for one group of people, but wanted to be as inclusive as possible; we wanted to include everyone, kings and queens and everything in between. We make games that are played worldwide, and any age group can pick up.” In an interview with &lt;em&gt;Input&lt;/em&gt;, Rollic evaded revealing whether the studio employed any queer developers and did not respond to my request for comment. In other words, Rollic won’t publicly stand with, employ, or speak positively about the queer community, but it will certainly profit off of their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qC6oAX"&gt;TikTokkers have continued to &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@i.test.games.lol/video/6935750979551808774?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowe0rDxUyogiwS66UaiQITf%2FOFaxStXDkgmm6%2FfcCPT%2BBu5i%2BITqzlELc2eHJdEXuCGgA%3D&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAsnRtH4NmKnrIUH0lfirtlf8o9H0mLiBx-kT_mIufohUsVbqAVyuXSdBwG3lU09k1&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_item_id=6935750979551808774&amp;amp;share_link_id=E076F395-0A36-445B-B46A-2F09488A91F7&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;timestamp=1620065840&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=dd7g5ak540h11k&amp;amp;user_id=6844705173010957318&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;_r=1"&gt;highlight&lt;/a&gt; new “baddie games” because they tend to get a lot of likes. They’re also inundating the games with 5-star, facetious-yet-undeniably-glowing reviews. “This game is the reason I am still alive today,” one review from February 9th reads. “If you don’t download it you will go through a life of depression and misery and you will never learn to be a baddie.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NL3Ehc"&gt;When I asked Agapion what he thought of Gen Z’s understanding of being gay, he wrote, “It’s a weird moment for queerness.” He continued: “As someone who’s visibly POC and queer, my queerness affects my life, my health, my well being. The community (like trans queens at Stonewall) didn’t choose advocacy because it was cute. They &lt;em&gt;couldn’t live&lt;/em&gt; if they didn’t advocate. That is lost on young people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="dyYykg"&gt;For the makers of “baddie games,” leaning into a younger generation’s disconnect with history is the key to their success as imitating internet-speak, using memes, and catering to queer social media users become increasingly popular marketing strategies. But even if they want us to play, we don’t have to let them win.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halide’s iPad camera app is here to recklessly promote tablet photography</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hr8zNsDjKz3uoZwcqNgNXOWSvCE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69305591/iPad_Pro___Pro_View_and_Regular_View.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ylwtz0"&gt;One of the best third-party camera apps for iOS, Halide, is coming to the iPad, its &lt;a href="https://lux.camera/halide-pro-camera-for-ipad/"&gt;developer Lux announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The iPhone app has a reputation for the amount of control it gives you over your photographs, and this functionality has been carried over to the iPad along with a redesigned interface that’s optimized for larger displays. The app is free to existing Halide owners, while new users can either pay a one-off purchase fee ($40) or go with monthly ($1.99) or yearly ($11.99) subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgCtK4"&gt;Using iPads to take photographs has a bit of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/16/6990649/apples-ipad-air-2-shows-that-tablet-photography-is-here-to-stay"&gt;reputation problem&lt;/a&gt;. Not only do Apple’s tablets tend to have fewer and lower-specced rear cameras than its phones, but the act of taking a photograph using a large tablet often looks just plain goofy. At least Lux appears to be aware of one of the most egregious iPad photography sins: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/m88cm/you_thought_people_taking_pictures_on_their/"&gt;taking photos at a concert&lt;/a&gt;. The company is teasing a potential future “Concert Mode,” which could automatically disable the camera if it detects it’s being used at a show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93v5iz"&gt;“Concert Mode is disabled for now - as we trust our users to Do The Right Thing,” Lux tells me, “but we’re going to be ruthless about bringing this in a future update if people cannot behave.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IIhY1f0ow8iw79S6lm9S1BbxSYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522759/Concert_Mode__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Halide&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A proof of concept for a potential “Concert Mode.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V5PitlOn53aNmnulUOLxA_wDAjY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522761/Pro_View___Portrait_with_Manual_Focus.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Halide&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pro View shrinks the viewfinder to make it easier to see on larger displays.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zafEGU"&gt;The app’s controls have been reconfigured to work better with a larger display. It’s got a toggle to switch between modes for left- and right-handed users, and key features have their controls arranged around the edges of the screen where they’re within thumbs’ reach. Like the iPhone app, Halide on the iPad allows for manual control of ISO, shutter speed, focus, and supports its recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528652/halide-mark-ii-update-raw-processing-new-pricing-subscriptions-memberships"&gt;RAW photography modes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7o6QYR"&gt;One of the more interesting features of Halide’s iPad app is a “Pro View” mode, which is a toggle that shrinks the viewfinder into the center of the display. Lux’s argument is that this makes it easier to take in the entire viewfinder, and it has the side benefit of creating extra space around the edges of the display for a bigger histogram, waveform, manual focus, and other controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3v63F"&gt;Halide’s launch on the iPad isn’t going to convince anyone that tablets are the best devices for taking photographs. But if you insist on going against the grain, at least there’s a nicer way to do it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDV9JT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDpuVw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hurricane Sandy was much worse because of climate change, study finds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rockaways Recovery From Hurricane Sandy" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X8M4_TERd9KXSsGdyRz7u6V2BxM=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69305151/159697930.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S62loA"&gt;Just a few inches of human-driven sea level rise contributed to Hurricane Sandy’s devastation of the Northeastern US in 2012. Tens of thousands more people were affected, and more than $8 billion in damages incurred during the storm were a result of climate-induced sea level rise, according to a new study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNzqS8"&gt;That’s about 13 percent of the more than $62.5 billion total in damage that the superstorm created in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Because climate change pushed sea levels higher, floodwaters were able to creep further inland — bringing more destruction with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G4TZQs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Sea level rise raises the launchpad for every single coastal storm.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jL0rHg"&gt;This is the first study to put a dollar sign on how much human-caused sea level rise exacerbated damage during a storm, the researchers say. They hope their methods can reveal the vulnerabilities other coastal communities face as climate change pushes floodwaters closer to their doors.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vlj8GX"&gt;“Sea level rise raises the launchpad for every single coastal storm,” says lead author Benjamin Strauss, a chief scientist and CEO of the nonprofit research organization Climate Central. “Climate change is already hurting us more than we realize. And hopefully, this research can help to inspire more investigation into just how much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTdSwO"&gt;Waters surrounding the New York area rose by roughly four inches in the 100 years before Hurricane Sandy made landfall. As a result, floodwaters reached about 36,000 more homes and 71,000 more people, according to the study conducted jointly by Climate Central and other researchers from the Stevens Institute of Technology and Rutgers University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gaRWou"&gt;Hurricane Sandy was one of the costliest storms to strike the US. At least 147 people in the US lost their lives, according to the National Hurricane Center. Nearly a decade later, others are still recovering from the damage inflicted on their homes by the storm. Parts of the city were flooded with up to &lt;a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/AL182012_Sandy.pdf"&gt;nine feet of water&lt;/a&gt;. Waves in some places grew to &lt;a href="https://sos.noaa.gov/datasets/wave-heights-hurricane-sandy-2012/#:~:text=Hurricane%20Sandy%20was%20the%20largest,killed%20in%20the%20affected%20region."&gt;32 feet&lt;/a&gt; tall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="kpgqcg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Without climate change, thousands of people would have been spared&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D8OeUi"&gt;Without climate change, thousands of people would have been spared from the chaos, according to the study authors. “They would have been dry without the human caused portion of sea level rise,” says Philip Orton, another author of the study and a research associate professor at Stevens Institute of Technology. Others, he says, may have actually had their basement filled up with water because of human causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WD7ND3"&gt;A complex mix of factors can push sea levels higher, with more dramatic change in some areas compared to others. Waters around New York City, for example, rose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/2/17924052/new-york-sea-level-rise-city-flooding-climate-change-science"&gt;1.5 times faster&lt;/a&gt; than the global average during the 20th century. That’s in part because of the land readjusting ever since glaciers retreated some 20,000 years ago. Gravity and ocean currents play a role, too. And then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18511662/coastal-cities-sea-level-rise-cost-new-york-resiliency"&gt;there’s climate change&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18511662/coastal-cities-sea-level-rise-cost-new-york-resiliency"&gt;redrawing our coastlines&lt;/a&gt;. When greenhouse gas emissions trap heat and raise global average temperatures, ice sheets and glaciers melt, and water in the world’s oceans expands. In the new study, researchers were able to isolate each contributing factor so that they could pinpoint just how much sea level rise is the fault of humans pumping out greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvEiDh"&gt;Once the researchers figured out how much sea level rise was attributed just to climate change, they conducted more modeling. They simulated Hurricane Sandy twice: once with sea level rise attributed to climate change and again without it. Lastly, they estimated the costs from Hurricane Sandy attributable to climate-induced sea level rise. They landed on a range of losses from $4.7 billion to $14 billion, with $8 billion representing the midpoint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qzsGFZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Important implications for the future of coastal cities”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AJHgjh"&gt;“The new study has many important implications for the future of coastal cities facing the threat of sea level rise and severe coastal storm damage,” Vivien Gornitz, a retired geologist previously with Columbia University and NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email. The methods the researchers used to come to their findings could be used to figure out the damage climate change adds to other disasters, Gornitz says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgaySM"&gt;There could have been even more damage during Hurricane Sandy that might not have been captured by the study because the researchers focused on flood depths, according to Gornitz. Other factors like erosion and chemical corrosion weren’t accounted for in the study and might have caused even more problems.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;There might have been even more economic losses in the aftermath because of power outages and business closures, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKwwJk"&gt;“I’m actually surprised that the percentage of the damage, or the absolute value, was as low as they got it. I would have expected to be a little bit higher,” says Klaus Jacob, a geophysicist at Columbia University’s Earth Institute who was not involved in the study, adding that the authors of the paper “did a very thorough analysis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q82r33"&gt;“The key takeaway for me is, every coastal flood today and for the last half century has been more damaging because of sea level rise caused by human activity,” Strauss says. “And that effect is only increasing as seas continue to rise.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASZaGN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCq9ny"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrSHDHNRiQrX7uCuXdtZyYvmZKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this difficult time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt; (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that are preowned or refurbished — will likely continue to sell out quickly during the pandemic. But we’ll do our best to keep this article up to date with the latest in-stock offers, and we’ll tell you when each offer was posted. When something gets sold out, we’ll try to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qcOiY9"&gt;Over at Amazon, you can buy an updated Nintendo Switch model with gray Joy-Cons, plus a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMM3RHZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $317&lt;/a&gt;.

Keep in mind, however, that they’re occasionally only available for in-store pickup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="o2G175"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-with-gray-joy-con%2F206007.html%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAiAt9z-BRBCEiwA_bWv-HzeKt4-dsaWdi9G9SGmxFTUUEAxrCA4NxZS0xEWCkIacwTZ_cUKPRoCEYUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo’s online store where it sells refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, Nintendo is offering the &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch-gray-gray-joy-con-refurbished-2.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen Nintendo Switch with gray Joy-Cons&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch-neon-blue-neon-red-joy-con-refurbished-2.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red and blue Joy-Cons for $260&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to every color of the Switch Lite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jnXhNd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556339"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a MicroSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GXXKY6P/ref=asc_df_B08GXXKY6P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $70&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074RNRM2B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;400GB microSD card will cost you around $50&lt;/a&gt;, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Agp45r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some Super Mario Party titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAWKYZ0?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=29&amp;amp;imprToken=7cbcbe4d-23d3-64db-2f0&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21021684%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; also have the Switch Pro controller for $59, knockings $11 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $20 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728487093072266361" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grand Theft Auto V is coming to the PS5 and Xbox Series X in November</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s9lggj"&gt;One of the bestselling games of all time is coming to next-gen consoles at the end of the year. Today, &lt;a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/3981k373a7a9ok/details-on-new-updates-to-g-t-a-online-and-red-dead-online"&gt;Rockstar announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; and its online spinoff will both be launching on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X on November 11th; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21288378/grand-theft-auto-v-5-gta-ps5-2021-release"&gt;the new version was previously announced at the PS5’s reveal event last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgnvJA"&gt;We don’t yet know what exactly will be changed for the next-gen iterations, but Rockstar says they will be “expanded and enhanced.” It’s also not clear what the upgrade path will look like for current owners of the game. &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, will be available as a standalone title, and Sony previously said that it would be free for all PS5 owners during its first three months of availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEJ28b"&gt;Despite launching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/16/4736176/grand-theft-auto-v-review"&gt;in 2013&lt;/a&gt; — it debuted on the PS3 and Xbox 360 — &lt;em&gt;GTAV&lt;/em&gt; has proved to be an enduring hit, one that will soon span three generations of game consoles. Publisher Take Two says the game has sold more than 140 million copies to date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deepfake dubs could help translate film and TV without losing an actor’s original performance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1MqwYRLLmJ8lPyasIyKhzumyTE=/59x0:791x488/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69304782/flawless_deepfake_dub.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tz78tk"&gt;What exactly is lost in translation when TV shows and films are subbed or dubbed into a new language? It’s a hard question to answer, but for the team at AI startup Flawless, it may be one we don’t have to think about in the future. The company claims it has the solution to this particular language barrier; a technical innovation that could help TV shows and films effortlessly reach new markets around the world: deepfake dubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsUOmP"&gt;We often think of deepfakes as manipulating the entire image of a person or scene, but Flawless’ technology focuses on just a single element: the mouth. Customers feed the company’s software with video from a film or TV show along with dubbed dialogue recorded by humans. Flawless’ machine learning models then create new lip movements that match the translated speech and paste them automatically onto the actor’s head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SDUNBB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s all about retaining the performance.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OvNLAB"&gt;“When someone’s watching this dubbed footage, they’re not jolted out of the performance by a jarring word or a mistimed mouth movement,” Flawless’ co-founder Nick Lynes tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;“It’s all about retaining the performance and retaining the original style.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzmzJ9"&gt;The results — despite the company’s name — aren’t 100 percent flawless, but they are pretty good. You can see and hear how they look in the demo reel below, which features a French dub of the classic 1992 legal drama &lt;em&gt;A Few Good Men&lt;/em&gt;, starring Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise. We asked a native French speaker what they made of the footage, and they said it was off in a few places but still a lot smoother than traditional dubbing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Stm49G"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/544363296?byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kJn3KA"&gt;What makes Flawless’ technology particularly interesting is its potential to scale. Flawless’ pitch is that deepfake dubs offer tremendous value for money: they’re cheap and quick to create, especially when compared to the cost of full remakes. And, with the advent of global streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney Plus, and Amazon Prime Video, it’s easier than ever for such dubbed content to reach international markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iBkNuh"&gt;As a recent report in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-disney-and-amazons-streaming-wars-heat-up-overseas-11619083801"&gt;highlighted&lt;/a&gt;, demand for streaming services in the US is saturated and companies are now looking abroad for future growth. In the first quarter of 2021, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-faces-new-test-as-economies-reopen-11618911003?mod=article_inline"&gt;89 percent of new Netflix users&lt;/a&gt; came from outside the US and Canada, while the service’s most watched show, &lt;em&gt;Lupin&lt;/em&gt;, is a Parisian thriller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="hjAxkX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the vast majority of their consumers are going to be outside the US, over time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SqIrW4"&gt;“What you’re seeing is more and more streamers come online realizing the vast majority of their consumers are going to be outside the US, over time,” Erik Barmack, a former Netflix executive responsible for the company’s international productions, told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. “The question is how international does your content need to be to be successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4biJlH"&gt;As Barmack suggests, there are different ways to answer this demand. You can create shows with local flavor that still entertain domestic viewers. You can do remakes of local hits for new audiences. And you can roll out the subs and dubs. But Flawless is betting that its technology provides a new option that will be particularly enticing for filmmakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjFMTW"&gt;This is because the company’s deepfake dubs preserve, to some degree, the performance of the original actor, says Lynes. Flawless’ technology is based on research from the Max Planck Institute for Informatics &lt;a href="https://gvv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/NeuralStylePreservingVisualDubbing/"&gt;first published in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. As you can see in a showcase video below, the dubs it produces are somewhat sensitive to the facial expressions of the performers, retaining their emotion and line delivery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OHF51b"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p0muYUlQcJM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GqjjDQ"&gt;Flawless has developed these techniques over the past three years, says Lynes, speeding up production time and reducing the amount of input footage. The end results are still a balance of automated dubbing and manual retouching (about 85 percent to 15 percent) but speedy to edit. “If something comes out we don’t particularly like we’ll do a few iterations; resubmit the training data in different forms and get another result,” says Lynes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkDMRA"&gt;The company hopes that preserving the original performance will be appealing to filmmakers who want to retain the magic of their original casting. Lynes gives the example of the 2020 Oscar award-wining Danish film &lt;em&gt;Another Round&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which stars Mads Mikkelsen as one of a group of teachers who &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/f_FzLs92YFc"&gt;experiment with low-level alcoholism&lt;/a&gt; to see if it improves their lives. After its success at home and on the international award circuit, the film is set to be remade for English-language audiences with Leonardo DiCaprio in the main role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8BWWY7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When is a remake of a foreign film necessary?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6TgvdC"&gt;The news sparked discussion about the &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/why-english-language-film-remakes-like-another-round-are-a-tricky-proposition-1234948914/"&gt;value of such remakes&lt;/a&gt;. Is the Danish drinking culture that forms the film’s backbone really so alien to American audiences that a remake is required? Is Mikkelsen, an actor who’s appeared in such mainstream fare as &lt;em&gt;Hannibal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;, such an unknown that he can’t attract viewers in the US? And is the “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/movies/movies-subtitles-parasite.html"&gt;one-inch barrier&lt;/a&gt;” of subtitles (to quote &lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt; director Bong Joon Ho) simply too much for audiences to overcome?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ENvftX"&gt;From Lynes’ point of view, a deepfake dub would at least be a cheaper way to bring &lt;em&gt;Another Round&lt;/em&gt; to English-language audiences while retaining its original flavor. “If we’re offering something that’s two percent the cost of the remake, we only need to be half as appealing to offer 10 times better value,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3Yovr"&gt;Those in charge of the remake will have concerns other than money, of course. No matter how beloved Mikkelsen is, he’s not as bankable as DiCaprio. But Lynes hopes that as deepfake dubs become common it’ll change the calculations for such remakes in future. Much more than that, he says, it’ll could even reshape the international film landscape, allowing actors and directors to reach new audiences with minimal effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nufAfb"&gt;“I think the pulling power of actors will change globally as a consequence of this technology,” he says. “Different people’s performances and directors’ choices will be better recognized, because a wider audience will be able to see them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6lMHA"&gt;Perhaps so, but for the moment, Flawless needs to prove that audiences actually want its technology. The company, which launched earlier this month, says it’s already got a first contract with a client it can’t name, but there’s no timeline for when we might see its wares in a commercial TV show or film and that will be the real test. The proof is in the dubbing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify will auto-transcribe podcasts over the coming weeks</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify says it plans to generate transcripts for all podcasts on its app.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AhQUZ7"&gt;Spotify announced multiple updates to make its app more accessible across iOS and Android today, including a beta version of a podcast transcription feature. The company says it’ll start auto-transcribing certain exclusive and original shows over the coming weeks as part of a beta rollout. People will be able to read the transcript with or without audio and can tap on text to jump to that point in the audio. The company says the goal is to eventually “enable transcripts across all podcasts on Spotify.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bF71a"&gt;This is an especially helpful feature for people who want to scan and move around a podcast, possibly to hear a specific segment, and for people who would rather read than listen to a show. Spotify is one of the first major podcast apps to make this an automated feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2Kikp"&gt;Along with transcriptions, the app will undergo visual changes, too, starting today, in terms of button colors, text formatting, and size. The idea is to make it easier for people with low vision and visual impairments to navigate and use the app. This should also help with low lighting situations or high screen reflections, the company says. Additionally, iOS users can also make the text size much larger through their settings. To do so, they have to navigate to Settings &amp;gt; Accessibility and then tap “Display and Text Size.” From there, they can tap on “Larger Text” to make the text as large as they want.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford F-150 Lightning: what to expect from the automaker’s first electric pickup truck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pblSoU25aA7G0v03m0kNJujsI4A=/248x0:1193x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69304637/2021_f_150_reveal.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OFvMqP"&gt;Ford is set to unveil its next major electric vehicle, the F-150 Lightning, at 9:30PM ET on Wednesday, May 19th. But this isn’t just another EV event. An electric version of the automaker’s iconic F-series pickup truck is a very big deal for Ford, for the auto world, for car buyers, and even for the US economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yKrzT"&gt;Ford is very proud of its F-series trucks, and for good reason. It’s the bestselling truck in the US for 44 years. It’s also the bestselling vehicle in the country, period. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fmost-popular-cars%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F18%2F22441793%2Fford-f150-lightning-announcement-rumors-specs-details" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to Edmunds&lt;/a&gt;, F-series trucks are the most popular vehicle in 30 out of 50 states in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5cNKL"&gt;That means the F-Series trucks create a huge windfall for Ford. The Detroit automaker netted around $42 billion in revenue in 2019 from nearly 900,000 F-series truck sales in the US, according to a Boston Consulting Group study commissioned by Ford — more than most major companies and about four times as much as Tesla made in all of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sWLBOA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford netted around $42 billion in revenue in 2019 from nearly 900,000 F-series truck sales in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4p0grl"&gt;The F-150 Lightning has already drawn the interest of President Joe Biden, who is touring Ford’s Rouge Electric Vehicle Center outside Dearborn, MI, and likely will get an early look at the truck ahead of its debut Wednesday evening. Biden will probably use the company’s announcement to highlight his own $2 trillion infrastructure plan, which includes billions of dollars for companies and consumers of electric vehicles. The president in particular is interested in cultivating domestic EV production, and the F-150 Lightning would provide the perfect backdrop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5Qx5z"&gt;The F-150 Lightning has been in the works for over four years, with Ford first announcing its intention to manufacture an all-electric F-series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/3/14153852/ford-hybrid-f150-mustang-electric-car-2020"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. As such, some details have already started trickling out. Here’s what we know so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9ZiH17"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3iS5f716oYQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1Kg8cj"&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kK9lMr"&gt;Ford has said the F-150 Lightning will be more powerful than any other F-series truck in its lineup. That means, at minimum, it will be heftier than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303479/ford-2021-f-150-active-drive-assist-hybrid-specs-features-photos"&gt;the 430-horsepower F-150 PowerBoost&lt;/a&gt; or the 450-horsepower Ford F-150 Raptor. Given the fact that it’s an electric truck with near-instantaneous acceleration, it will also likely best the 570ft-lb of torque generated by the hybrid F-150 PowerBoost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XifTdX"&gt;We got a little bit of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20706515/ford-electric-f150-pickup-truck-pull-million-pound-train"&gt;demonstration in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, when a heavily camouflaged F-150 Lightning was shown pulling 10 double-decker rail cars over 1,000 feet. It did it twice, once when the rail cars were empty and a second time with them loaded with 42 regular, gas-burning F-150s. The latter stunt put the entire load at 1.25 million pounds. That’s a lot of towing capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlBu8w"&gt;Of course, Ford described the towing stunt as a “one-time short event demonstration” and claims it is “far beyond any production truck’s published capacity.” Right now, Tesla holds the record for pulling the heaviest load, when a Model X &lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/15/technology/tesla-tows-boeing-dreamliner-video/index.html"&gt;towed a 287,000-pound Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner&lt;/a&gt; nearly 1,000 feet on a taxiway at the Melbourne Airport in Australia last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="LDj0q8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Towing uses battery power, which in turn diminishes the vehicle’s range&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5DU1Ip"&gt;Towing uses battery power, which in turn diminishes the vehicle’s range, so how Ford presents this information in the context of the F-150 Lightning’s battery capacity will be very important to watch. Ford hasn’t revealed how far the truck will travel on a single charge, though the distance is expected to be ample. And if it doesn’t sound like it’s enough to satisfy the most range-anxious among us, Ford recently filed for a patent for a truck bed-mounted range extender, so it sounds like there will be options available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jtdk3i"&gt;As far as acceleration, expect a 0–60mph time somewhere in the three-second range. Rivian, GMC, and Tesla have all quoted sub-four-second 0–60 accelerations. Given the nature of electric powertrains and their near instant torque, there’s no reason to think the F-150 Lightning will be any slower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lLgjG"&gt;Whatever the exact specs, Jessica Caldwell, director of insights at Edmunds, says Ford will likely try to use the electric F-150 to prove “that you can still accomplish everything you would with an internal combustion engine [truck].” Ford has been quite good at convincing truck buyers to get behind new ideas, she says, like using aluminum bodies or switching to the smaller, turbo-charged EcoBoost engine. “The truck market has been fairly open to embrace some of these changes that we thought would shock them,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJJJSG"&gt;Ford hasn’t announced the sticker price yet. Expect a lot of attention paid to the “total cost of ownership” and the assertion that electric vehicles, on average, require less maintenance than their gas-powered counterparts. (This will also be a big deal for fleets and could appeal to proponents of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;Biden’s plan to swap all 645,000 vehicles owned by the federal government with EVs&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUFeYV"&gt;But even with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423479/semiconductor-shortage-new-car-truck-prices-sales"&gt;rising new car prices&lt;/a&gt;, Caldwell says the sticker price will still matter. Truck buyers, she says, really want to know “what am I going to get for my money?” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qUgdBj9SIjkOK3d7Msk4jzM1_iE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522525/Lightning.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QMlbci"&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6ydG8i"&gt;If you’re hoping for some crazy, outside-the-box design a la the Tesla Cybertruck, think again. This is Ford we’re talking about, the 117-year-old company that practically invented boring, easily repeatable, mass-market vehicles. Legacy automakers tend to be more conservative when it comes to design. We don’t expect the company to stray too far from the elements that make its current F-series lineup so popular. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WybDmw"&gt;That said, there will be some unique design cues that help differentiate the F-150 Lightning from its gas-powered siblings. Teaser images show an unbroken light bar that runs the full width of the grille, headlight to headlight, in what looks like an upside U-shape. The grille itself will also look different by either partially or fully closing off the ventilation, given that EVs have no combustion engine under the hood to cool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8EECt0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The inside of the F-150 Lightning is expected to be absolutely crammed with technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BXpYog"&gt;The inside of the F-150 Lightning is expected to be absolutely crammed with technology. Much like the 2021 F-150, the electric version will come with an optional hands-free driving mode called BlueCruise, be capable of receiving over-the-air software updates, and come with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSlp0x"&gt;It will be interesting to see how Ford balances the trend toward an all-digital user experience inside the vehicle with its customers’ desire for tactile controls. The 2021 F-150 comes with a 12-inch landscape touchscreen in the center of the dashboard, while the Mustang Mach-E has a massive 15.5-inch portrait touchscreen. Whether it’s horizontal or vertical, the F-150 Lightning’s infotainment system is likely to be cutting edge by Ford’s standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HokCOd"&gt;Will truck owners go for an electric F-150?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XfRR14"&gt;The US is a country of truck drivers. They are equally popular among hard-hat wearers and Costco shoppers alike. While EVs represent only 2 percent of the overall car market, trucks are a $90 billion-a-year industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FeIBp9"&gt;Ford will eventually go head to head against some potentially heavy hitters like Tesla and General Motors, as well as new players like Rivian, Lordstown, and Canoo. Though battery costs tend to drive up the prices of electric vehicles compared to their gas-powered equivalents, those costs are coming down and are expected to reach parity with gas cars in the near future. For automakers, the bigger the SUV or truck, the more profit they tend to pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSMIW9"&gt;Large vehicles already account for the majority of the domestic auto market. Half the vehicles sold in the US in 2020 are SUVs and crossovers, and pickup trucks captured an additional 20 percent of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYNfxG"&gt;Whether customers will go for an electric F-150 remains to be seen. Over a quarter of vehicle owners polled say they would consider an electric F-150 EV, while 45 percent say they would not consider one, and 27 percent are undecided, &lt;a href="https://go.cargurus.com/rs/611-AVR-738/images/CarGurus-2020-Pickup-Truck-Sentiment-Study.pdf"&gt;according to CarGurus&lt;/a&gt;. By comparison, 31 percent said they were interested in a Tesla Cybertruck and 16 percent would consider a Hummer EV. Among Ford truck owners in particular, 39 percent say they will probably or definitely own an electric truck in the next ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="HOkWK0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The pickup crowd is not, traditionally, the greenest consumer demographic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w6KxOk"&gt;The pickup crowd is not, traditionally, the greenest consumer demographic. But the F-150 Lightning has the potential to create a new class of “&lt;a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/20754.html"&gt;accidental environmentalists&lt;/a&gt;,” as described to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-a-wave-of-electric-trucks-could-create-millions-of-accidental-environmentalists-11619236828"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Christopher Mims&lt;/a&gt; by Matthew Kahn, a professor of economics at the University of Southern California. These are customers who are attracted to demonstrations of off-road capabilities, towing capacity, and gimmicky specs like “Crab walk” or adjustable suspension. They don’t care as much about climate change or carbon emissions but can be convinced to switch from polluting cars to zero emissions if the price tag and the specs are right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYKp10"&gt;The F-150 Lightning will have plenty of competition when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288000/ford-electric-f-150-2022-sale-launch-jim-farley"&gt;arrives at dealerships in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Edmunds expects at least six electric pickup trucks to make their debut this year, including the Cybertruck, Rivian R1T, GMC Hummer EV, and an electric Chevy Silverado. Ford will say a lot about the loyalty of its customers at the event on Wednesday, and to some degree they have the numbers to back that up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TsUPD"&gt;But truck buyers have grown increasingly fickle over the years, with less than half trading in their current truck for another rig from the same brand, according to Edmunds. CarGurus agrees, noting that the share of brand-loyal truck buyers has been cut in half versus just two years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nwZf1"&gt;Against this backdrop of increasing infidelity among truck owners and heightened pressure regulators and competitors, the Ford F-150 Lightning will make its debut. It’s certainly in for a wild ride. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia is nerfing new RTX 3080 and 3070 cards for Ethereum cryptocurrency mining </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yoWjRFWgi7VVIAVj2rF52GsE5I4=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69304541/twarren_rtx3080_3_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eIq7tp"&gt;Nvidia is extending its cryptocurrency mining limits to newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289154/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;nerfing the hash rates of the RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt; for its launch in February, Nvidia is now starting to label new cards with a “Lite Hash Rate” or “LHR” identifier to let potential customers know the cards will be restricted for mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xeYpom"&gt;“This reduced hash rate only applies to newly manufactured cards with the LHR identifier and not to cards already purchased,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/05/18/lhr/"&gt;says Matt Wuebbling&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia’s head GeForce marketing. “We believe this additional step will get more GeForce cards at better prices into the hands of gamers everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5G6za"&gt;These new RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 3070, and RTX 3080 cards will start shipping later this month, and the LHR identifier will be displayed in retail product listings and on the box. Nvidia originally started hash limiting with the RTX 3060, and the company has already committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/18/22290362/nvidia-will-not-reduce-3060-ti-3070-3080-3090-eth-mining"&gt;not limiting the performance of GPUs already sold&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h8UNL2SWMaPphvn_Juz9aP60yGE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22129713/twarren_rtx3060_ti_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 3060 already has a mining limit in place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vxMD4R"&gt;While Nvidia tried to nerf mining with the RTX 3060, the company also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331537/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-cryptocurrency-mining"&gt;accidentally released a beta driver&lt;/a&gt; that unlocked hash rates and increased performance. That’s been reinstated with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409838/nvidia-rtx-3060-etherium-cryptocurrency-mining-limit-back-driver-update"&gt;more recent drivers&lt;/a&gt;, but the beta drivers are out in the wild now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFJL1l"&gt;Nvidia’s new LHR cards are part of a broader effort to make its latest 30-series GPUs less desirable to cryptocurrency miners. PC gamers have been trying and failing to get their hands on new graphics cards for months due to the great GPU shortage, and miners have been blamed for part of the shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SKO0Q"&gt;Nvidia offers a separate &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/cmp/&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289154/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22053195__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cryptocurrency Mining Processor&lt;/a&gt; (CMP) for Ethereum miners instead. These cards include the best performance for mining and efficiency, but they won’t handle graphics at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MheWDl"&gt;Nvidia’s move to nerf new cards will undoubtedly drive up prices for existing 30-series GPUs that don’t have these restrictions in place. It will also likely mean the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419668/nvidia-rtx-3080-ti-leak-may-launch-rumors"&gt;rumored RTX 3080 Ti card&lt;/a&gt; will have similar cryptocurrency mining limits in place, as this card is expected to be announced later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
