    <title>How to use DuckDuckGo’s email protection app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="DuckDuckGo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QwsHRLDDP7oIs-Q3Cg504LEw-yo=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69687605/duckduckgo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yItPIR"&gt;It’s well-known that filling in a form with your email address — say, to get a discount on a product, receive a newsletter, or get the results of a quiz — means you are going to get email from that vendor, and possibly from a bunch of other vendors and / or advertisers, forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOtU2N"&gt;One of the ways to subvert this has traditionally been to create a free email account to use for sites that you want to register with but that you suspect will be the gateway for a large amount of spam. This is what I did. However, over time, that designated email account can become so well-used that it stops being a hidey-hole for spam and becomes another account that offers advertisers and others a source for information to aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBxxTa"&gt;This is where DuckDuckGo’s latest product comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyiB0I"&gt;DuckDuckGo is a browser that is known for its security and privacy safeguards. Recently, the company came up with a new feature to help its users keep their info to themselves: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22576352/duckduckgo-email-protection-privacy-trackers-apple-alternative"&gt;DuckDuckGo Email Protection&lt;/a&gt;. It provides you with a special email address that you can use as an intermediary for sites that you suspect will probably collect data on you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxBGoo"&gt;It works this way: you use your DuckDuckGo address for any site that is suspicious (or just commercial). All email that is sent to that email address will be filtered for hidden trackers and then forwarded to your “normal” email address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1t4nU"&gt;Intrigued? The feature is currently in beta, but you can sign up if you want to give it a try. According to a company rep, they are keeping a waitlist, and people will be picked up from that waitlist “on a week to week basis.” DuckDuckGo is planning to eventually offer invites that its users can distribute as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OP5MWQ"&gt;How to sign up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qOkS5m"&gt;So, with all that in mind, here’s how to sign up and use the new DuckDuckGo Email Protection feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jbshu"&gt;Sign up from the DuckDuckGo mobile app. (You can find links to Apple’s App Store and Google Play &lt;a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZqySk"&gt;Once you’ve installed the app, go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Email Protection.” Here, you can join the private waitlist (or enter an invite code, if you have one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFYn0g"&gt;Your invite will probably come in the form of a link. Go ahead and click the link. You’ll be taken through a series of screens that explain that DuckDuckGo does not save your emails, use your data for advertising, and that your data is encrypted, among other things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6noya"&gt;After you’ve read the usual service terms, you get to choose your unique DuckDuckGo email address (a combination of 3 to 30 letters or numbers which will be appended with @duck.com). You also need to specify an address where your email should be forwarded.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="DuckDuckGo Email Protection gives you an extra email address to use to avoid trackers." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z5N9a2NJthjtWLCdZSTtOxs7ce8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763547/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_11.59.41_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DuckDuckGo Email Protection gives you an extra email address to use to avoid trackers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fughzF"&gt;Now, whenever you use the DuckDuckGo email address to fill in a form, any email that is then sent to that DuckDuckGo address — an acknowledgment, an ad, a newsletter, whatever — will first go through DuckDuckGo’s servers and then will be delivered to your usual email address stripped, according to the company, of any trackers that were attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6aF6Yg"&gt;How the beta works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Xo3ouq"&gt;As I tested out the beta of DuckDuckGo’s email feature I found one or two glitches, but on the whole, it did seem to operate as promised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xny9nC"&gt;I signed up at two sites using the duck.com address. The emailed acknowledgment from the first, Allrecipes, took over an hour to appear in my regular Gmail listing. There was a statement at the top that “DuckDuckGo removed trackers from LiveIntent and more.” I clicked on the statement and was taken to a DuckDuckGo website that listed a tracker from LiveIntent (an ad distributor) and Allrecipes itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An email sent through DuckDuckGo will include an accounting of the trackers that were removed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gr8Ln99WU9pKGUl9OrHGmBq4wFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763550/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_4.34.24_PM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An email sent through DuckDuckGo will include an accounting of the trackers that were removed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on the tracking report on your email and you’ll be given more details." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sCyD7mUe-8JtgbtDSSwOhx4UJ9k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763553/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_4.34.41_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on the tracking report on your email, and you’ll be given more details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ugZfuw"&gt;After I signed up with the second retailer, a clothing company called Travelsmith, I got an email from the company in the “Promotions” section of my Gmail account within a few seconds. It told me that “DuckDuckGo removed 1 tracker.” I clicked on the statement; it was a single tracker from Travelsmith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3XfVev"&gt;Browser extension&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0Fijkw"&gt;Right after you register for the email account, DuckDuckGo offers to install an extension on your browser (according to a company rep, the extension is available for all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, and Safari). This extension lets you autofill forms with your DuckDuckGo email address or with a randomly generated address (which will also forward to your chosen email account). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The browser extension lets you autofill fields. (The email address here was edited for privacy.)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hU-QNnGcjvVdkZQklsx--Y462zg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763573/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_3.28.55_PM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The browser extension lets you autofill fields. (The email address here was edited for privacy.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2st5Ll"&gt;The browser extension comes with several other interesting features. It reports on the number of trackers on the current site and rates it for security. It also enables something called Site Privacy Protection which, &lt;a href="https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy/embedded-content-protection/"&gt;according to DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;, “blocks social media embedded content by default” in order to prevent tracking codes from being loaded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyrDxC"&gt;Be aware, though, that this particular feature can interfere with certain sites. For example, it prevented me from typing this article into &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s content management system. Once I realized what the problem was, it was easily fixed: the extension lets you disable the protection for specific sites by just toggling it off. After that, the feature was automatically toggled off every time I visited that site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The browser extension also rates the site you’re on." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/848DAzMXSvYb1D6OdjG_OWpfdOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763593/Screen_Shot_2021_08_05_at_11.23.53_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The browser extension also rates the site you’re on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nrvkMC"&gt;Mobile App&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ys1gGa"&gt;You can use the email protection feature in DuckDuckGo’s mobile app as well. If you’ve already registered as a beta user, then once you’ve installed the iOS or Android app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="N2R9iW"&gt;In the app, use the three dots in the upper corner to get to Settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1cHysa"&gt;Scroll down to find “Email Protection” (it will be marked as beta) and tap on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XSKfBg"&gt;You will be asked if you want to join the waitlist, if you have an invite code, or if you already have a Duck address. If you haven’t registered yet, tape on “I have an Invite Code” and you will be led through the registration process. If you’ve already registered, tap on “I already have a Duck Address” and you will be sent a passphrase through the “real” email address that you registered with. Once you’ve entered that passphrase, you’ll be able to use your @duck.com addresses on your mobile device as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Find “Email Protection” in the mobile app’s settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1IzuB_vMXS68DiuDEjy_cJiPjIA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22764611/Screenshot_20210805_163518.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find “Email Protection” in the mobile app’s settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can register for email protection or use your preregistered Duck address." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fn0iMIsYRoHx-9-Jc2EPaimTTnY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22764614/Screenshot_20210805_165931.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can register for email protection or use your pre-registered Duck address.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eseVzN"&gt;So should you try DuckDuckGo’s email protection if you can get in on the beta? Why not? At the very least, trackers are a pain in the neck; sign up for one service, and suddenly, you’re getting emails from a dozen or more. Having an alternate email address to prevent at least some of the nuisance spam — not to mention preventing other data about you from possibly getting distributed — can’t be a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkI0mr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s ‘Super Duper Secure Mode’ for Edge trades speed for better security</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zI5ZNbDoGchmCb8iUbsrknt2ZhU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69687559/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UH2OrV"&gt;Microsoft’s browser vulnerability research team is &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.github.io/edgevr/posts/Super-Duper-Secure-Mode/"&gt;working on a mode&lt;/a&gt; to make the Edge browser more secure, and it’s given it an incredible name: “Super Duper Secure Mode” (&lt;a href="https://therecord.media/microsoft-announces-new-super-duper-secure-mode-for-edge/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The mode is currently very experimental, but could help make it harder for attackers trying to exploit bugs in Microsoft’s browser by turning off certain optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1fve7"&gt;To make the browser “super duper secure,” the mode turns off a feature of Edge’s JavaScript engine that’s meant to make a website’s code run faster. The technology is called Just-In-Time compilation (or JIT), and while it can help improve performance, it’s also fiendishly complex. This makes it easy for bugs to slip in, which can lead to security exploits — Microsoft points to &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FslzTx4b7sKZK4BR-DpO45JZNB1QZF9wuijK3OxBwr0/edit#gid=865365202"&gt;analysis by Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; that showed that over half of the real-world Chrome exploits since 2018 were related to JIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vnDdBq"&gt;(If you’ve got some programming knowledge, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-iiEDtpy6I"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; provides an interesting overview of how Just-In-Time works for JavaScript.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhlEeM"&gt;Of course, there are concerns that turning off technology meant to make a huge part of modern websites run faster could hurt performance. &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.github.io/edgevr/posts/Super-Duper-Secure-Mode/"&gt;The blog post notes&lt;/a&gt; that disabling JIT can lead to significantly lower JavaScript benchmark scores, but the team says that, in the real world, people didn’t usually notice much of a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bC5JXg"&gt;I can at least somewhat back that up — I turned on Super Duper Secure Mode for myself (if you’re running &lt;a href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/"&gt;a test version of Edge&lt;/a&gt;, you can enable the mode using a flag), and haven’t noticed any sites feeling particularly sluggish. Of course, everyone’s web use is different, so it’s possible that you’d notice a difference if you spend your days in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/8/4/22610448/kid-pix-html-port-web-art-drawing-memories"&gt;complex webapps&lt;/a&gt;. The Microsoft team does note, though, that it’s looking into making the mode smart by having it turn protections on and off based on the risk a website may pose, or how resource intensive it may be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfUH9S"&gt;The experimental mode still seems to be in its very early stages — there are things the team wants to enable but hasn’t, it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spoofyroot/status/1423011020524589059?s=20"&gt;doesn’t work on all the platforms that Edge supports&lt;/a&gt;, and the team says there are “quite a few technical challenges to overcome” before the feature launches. It is, however, exciting work being done — since Edge is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321779/microsoft-edge-legacy-spartan-browser-support-ended"&gt;now based on Chromium&lt;/a&gt;, it uses &lt;a href="https://v8.dev/"&gt;the same JavaScript engine&lt;/a&gt; that Chrome does. This makes it conceivable that the feature could end up being adopted by other browsers if it’s successful on Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oi3yrh"&gt;As for the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snazzyq/status/1179425532875812866"&gt;Tesla-esque name&lt;/a&gt;, vulnerability research lead Johnathan Norman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spoofyroot/status/1423011022902759425?s=20"&gt;says that at some point it will have to change&lt;/a&gt;, in part because explaining how secure something described as “super duper secure” is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spoofyroot/status/1423056237281771520"&gt;to lawyers&lt;/a&gt; would be challenging. Still, if there’s any way that Microsoft can make it happen without incurring extra liability (people may understandably be upset if they fell victim to an exploit in Super Duper Secure Mode), it would bring some welcome whimsy to the browser alongside the additional protection.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This PS2 mod is a handheld dream come true</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/laJwzrp2EZJcLl61vC_GNhoxacE=/0x0:1818x1212/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69687387/20210626_184744.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: GingerOfOz&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PmGxs8"&gt;GingerOfOz, the console modder you might remember from his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/8/29/21406254/nintendo-modder-custom-wii-game-cube-game-boy"&gt;excellent Game Boy-sized portable Wii&lt;/a&gt;, is back with another home console-turned-handheld. This time &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ7x2b6BlHk&amp;amp;t=1s"&gt;it’s the turn of the PS2&lt;/a&gt;, objectively the best console ever made and the one that just so happens to be the first I ever owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWBisA"&gt;Dubbed the “PS2 Eclipse,” the mod involved trimming down an original PS2 motherboard and packing it into a 3D printed chassis with a set of PlayStation Vita buttons, Nintendo Switch joysticks, a 5-inch 480p display, batteries, and a couple of extra custom circuit boards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMrz7h"&gt;It’s a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; neat little handheld, and the fact that it’s using original PS2 hardware rather than emulation means it doesn’t have any major compatibility issues with the console’s library of almost 4,000 games. That said, the way the console loads games slowly off a USB drive means that some titles can stutter slightly, and load times are apparently a bit arduous. Battery life sits at around two and a half hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6XSzRr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's a peek into what the internals look like: &lt;a href="https://t.co/GZjGFv6jvb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/GZjGFv6jvb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— GingerOfOz (@GingerOfMods) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GingerOfMods/status/1423381531364524032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QCbFvK"&gt;Although GingerOfOz has done a great job with the handheld’s usability, including building in speakers, a headphone jack, and a battery life indicator, he admits that it can sometimes struggle to detect that there’s a controller attached. As such, some games will refuse to load, and are effectively unplayable. GingerOfOz says he hopes this can be fixed in software at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1DjEQ"&gt;Unfortunately, if you want to get your hands on the portable, GingerOfOz says he has no plans to sell them like he did with his previous portable Wii. After making fifty of the handheld consoles over the past two years, the modder says that building this many to order “is just miserable.” So if you’re interested in taking your PS2 library on the go, you &lt;a href="https://www.gingerofmods.com/building-your-own-portable"&gt;might need to get your soldering iron and 3D printer ready&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, I thoroughly recommend subscribing to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDfr25a1fzOgWZFwvIIRuHg"&gt;GingerOfOz’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, and reading his &lt;a href="https://www.gingerofmods.com/eclipse"&gt;full writeup&lt;/a&gt; of what went into the PS2 Eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s justification for banning third-party researchers ‘inaccurate,’ says FTC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i7HuCAN4Q5Wrumhkv9ZwobK6W8M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69687343/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / Th&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AuF2oA"&gt;When Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609020/facebook-bans-academic-researchers-ad-transparency-misinformation-nyu-ad-observatory-plug-in"&gt;banned the personal accounts&lt;/a&gt; of academics researching ad transparency and misinformation on its platform this week, it justified the decision in part by saying it was only following rules set out by the Federal Trade Commission. But the FTC itself says this is “inaccurate” and that its rules require no such action, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/05/facebook-nyu-ftc-dispute/"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUoUx9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/research-cannot-be-the-justification-for-compromising-peoples-privacy/"&gt;Facebook claims&lt;/a&gt; it banned the accounts “to stop unauthorized scraping and protect people’s privacy in line with our privacy program under the FTC Order.” The &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/c4365facebookmodifyingorder.pdf"&gt;order in question&lt;/a&gt; was put in place following the Cambridge Analytica scandal and says Facebook must obtain “affirmative express consent” from users before sharing their data with a third party (known as the “consent decree”) and maintain a “comprehensive privacy program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wobUTS"&gt;Facebook’s wording about which part of the order from the FTC mandated its actions is ambiguous, but the agency was nonetheless unhappy about its claims. The FTC’s acting director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection, Samuel Levine, complained to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a letter obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d9RFwL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FTC doesn’t want to be blamed for Facebook’s actions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1vnwm"&gt;“Had you honored your commitment to contact us in advance, we would have pointed out that the consent decree does not bar Facebook from creating exceptions for good-faith research in the public interest,” wrote Levine. “While I appreciate that Facebook has now corrected the record, I am disappointed by how your company has conducted itself in this matter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apdWGP"&gt;In a later &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-reason-banning-researchers-doesnt-hold-up/"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborne acknowledged that it was not the FTC’s consent decree that forced its hand, but rather the stipulation that Facebook maintain a “comprehensive privacy program,” which the company says the researchers violated. However, this makes the ban Facebook’s decision, not the FTC’s. If Facebook wanted to it could make allowances in its privacy program for such research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yEZ852"&gt;The research itself was based on a browser plug-in called Ad Observer, which Facebook users can install to collect information about which political ads they’re shown and why. This information is pooled by the researchers, and used to find out more about political advertising. As well as helping track who is funding political campaigns, this work helps track misinformation on Facebook, as political ads aren’t fact-checked. The Ad Observer plug-in is &lt;a href="https://adobserver.org/"&gt;still live and operational&lt;/a&gt;, but Facebook banned the pages advertising the project on the social network as well as the personal accounts of researchers involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dfQVuz"&gt;Facebook also says it banned the plug-in because it violated users’ privacy by collecting information about users who had not installed it. But an independent audit of the plug-in’s code by Mozilla says this claim is also false. As Mozilla’s Marshall Erwin &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/why-facebooks-claims-about-the-ad-observer-are-wrong/"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis his): “We decided to recommend Ad Observer because our reviews assured us that it respects user privacy and supports transparency. It collects ads, targeting parameters and metadata associated with the ads. &lt;strong&gt;It does not collect personal posts or information about your friends. And it does not compile a user profile on its servers&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uhIcXm"&gt;We’ve reached out to Facebook for comment and will update this story if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is integrating Spotify into a new Windows 11 focus feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ZHxHoq_I1M3DPeAvHMJB5Rdz8A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69687264/wjoel_200601_1777_windows10_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wjwibh"&gt;Microsoft is planning to integrate Spotify into a new Windows 11 feature. Panos Panay, Microsoft’s head of Windows and devices, teased the Focus Sessions Windows 11 feature on Twitter this week, and it appears to be a new way to focus on tasks and work. Focus Sessions includes Spotify integration, allowing you to create a focus timer to work through tasks while listening to playlist of music from Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knLpOq"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t started testing Focus Sessions in its public builds of Windows 11 yet, but from the video Panay teased it appears to be built into the operating system’s Clock app. It looks like it’s following the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique"&gt;Pomodoro Technique&lt;/a&gt;, a method of managing time by breaking down work into smaller chunks with short breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zf0c4n"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Another first look from the team...&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FocusSessions?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#FocusSessions&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Windows11?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Windows11&lt;/a&gt; coming soon. This has been a game-changer for me, especially with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Spotify?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Spotify&lt;/a&gt; integration  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Productivity?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Productivity&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Creativity?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Creativity&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WindowsInsiders?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WindowsInsiders&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/HfJh4niDiS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HfJh4niDiS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Panos Panay (@panos_panay) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/panos_panay/status/1423343837934546946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mnK2fx"&gt;There are already a variety of Pomodoro apps and websites that let you set aside time to focus on a list of tasks. Microsoft’s Spotify integration could be the company’s way of standing out from the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98KdgH"&gt;It’s also the first time we’ve seen some significant Spotify integration in Windows since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/2/16401898/microsoft-groove-music-pass-discontinued-spotify-partner"&gt;Microsoft retired its Groove Music service&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. At the time, Microsoft partnered with Spotify to move Groove Music subscribers and their playlists over to the rival music streaming service. Microsoft and Spotify have also previously worked together on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/20/15840992/spotify-windows-store-app-download"&gt;Windows 10 app&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/8/16105990/spotify-xbox-one-app-download-store"&gt;separate app for Xbox consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Overwatch League sponsors reevaluate support following Activision Blizzard lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activision Blizzard logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1gW59uvI-mTQ4-eNtUKsoA-8oGg=/78x0:3714x2424/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69687216/1233534678.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K0Hnrd"&gt;Overwatch League sponsors Coca-Cola and State Farm are re-evaluating their support of the competition after the game’s publisher Activision Blizzard was sued by regulators over a culture of ‘&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;constant sexual harassment,&lt;/a&gt;’ &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/08/05/activision-blizzard-sponsors-overwatch/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The companies’ statements come as another sponsor, T-Mobile, appeared to pull its branding from the Overwatch League as well as the Call of Duty League, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22607861/activision-blizzard-t-mobile-overwatch-league-call-of-duty-cod-league-esports"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFLi0v"&gt;In a statement, Coca-Cola told the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; that it is aware of the allegations surrounding Activision Blizzard, and said it is “[taking] a step back for a moment to revisit future plans and programs.” However, a spokesperson for the company would not confirm whether or not the company would cease its sponsorship of the league entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ee3CFt"&gt;Meanwhile, State Farm said it is “reevaluating” its “limited marketing relationship” with the Overwatch League, and that it’s asked that “no advertisements run during the matches this weekend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aSa1wg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;State Farm has asked that no ads run on this weekend’s matches&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RfLl2u"&gt;Partnerships like these are an important source of revenue for Activision Blizzard’s esports leagues alongside broadcasting rights and franchise fees. Logos and advertisements for the brands appear prominently during broadcasts, and branded Coca-Cola cups are sometimes seen next to commentators. State Farm and Coca-Cola are among seven brands listed on the partners page of the &lt;a href="https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/partners"&gt;Overwatch League’s website&lt;/a&gt;. The other companies listed did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQByM6"&gt;The statements come as earlier this week, viewers noted that &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22607861/activision-blizzard-t-mobile-overwatch-league-call-of-duty-cod-league-esports"&gt;T-Mobile’s branding appeared to have disappeared from&lt;/a&gt; Overwatch League and Call of Duty League broadcasts. The company’s branding has disappeared from both league’s list of sponsorship partners and has not been appearing in recent Overwatch League tweets. In a recent Call of Duty League match, the New York Subliners team were seen wearing duct tape over T-Mobile’s logo on their jerseys. T-Mobile did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4ekQb"&gt;Sponsors are reevaluating their support in the wake of a lawsuit from California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which alleged widespread harassment and discrimination at Activision Blizzard. Following the lawsuit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;employees staged a walkout in protest&lt;/a&gt;, and made several demands including an end to forced arbitration in employee contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiPqLE"&gt;Two high-ranking employees have left the company in the wake of the allegations — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;Blizzard president J. Allen Brack&lt;/a&gt; and the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608320/blizard-jesse-meschuk-leave-company-hr-svp"&gt;head of global human resources&lt;/a&gt; Jesse Meschuk — while Activision Blizzard CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;Bobby Kotick has pledged&lt;/a&gt; to take “swift action” and will investigate “each and every claim.” However, employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598128/activision-blizzard-employees-ceo-letter-response-key-concerns"&gt;criticized the CEO’s response&lt;/a&gt; for failing to address key concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmDg9a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaPR9u"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on 4K TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZkMUvv2TJUV9INCLobptUX5d9lI=/2x0:4499x2998/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151213/Samsung_Crystal_TU_7000_series_UHD_TV_Lifestyle_Image.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The 55-inch Samsung Crystal TU-7000 is on sale at Best Buy for $450. | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pYdAAO"&gt;There are a lot of 4K TVs available to choose from, complete with a wide variety of prices and performance. And, with many summer sales in full swing, now might be the best time of the year (or, at least until the fall) to get an amazing TV deal. Even if your budget is less than $500, you can get a good 4K TV in a bigger size than you might expect. Whether you want a secondary TV for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built for a cinema-like experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals across four common categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tf9rXR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eeM2RN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vzRoT0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mlO4U5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="d2lRkA"&gt;We will provide regular updates to this post so be sure to check back periodically for the most up-to-date info on the best deals available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MLgUIb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best TV to buy for the PS5 and Xbox Series X","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mszLRr"&gt;A 55-inch TV is a popular size for good reasons. It is not too big, nor is it too small, making it a safe size if you’re looking to upgrade the TV in a living room or bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3LwO3"&gt;Sony’s 55-inch X80J 4K TV has Google TV software built-in, so you won’t need to purchase any additional streaming boxes, like an Apple TV or Chromecast. The LED panel also supports HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Vision HDR, and has four HDMI ports (one of which is HDMI ARC). It’s a relatively low-frills affair, but it seems like a good deal that’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743620079563082108#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, where you can get it for $200 off with a free My Best Buy account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gEtknI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10610217"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JbaBai"&gt;The TCL 6-Series R635 model is a good option if you are looking to balance price and performance. The R635 model sports a QLED panel, but it goes a step above with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363318/tcl-2020-5-6-series-4k-tvs-qled-mini-led-backlighting-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mini-LED backlighting&lt;/a&gt;, which brings better brightness and contrast. The 55-inch model is currently on sale at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FTCL-55-6-Series-4K-UHD-Dolby-Vision-HDR-QLED-Roku-Smart-TV-55R635%2F796005169%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_yIDSdFQtCxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkB14GwkExnTVM0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_1460806%26clickid%3DyIDSdFQtCxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkB14GwkExnTVM0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart for $893&lt;/a&gt;, though, we’ve seen steeper discounts on the R635 in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Osz4r"&gt;If you prefer a larger model, both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0885N17CC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748187444641286142#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; sell the 65- and 75-inch variants, though, neither retailer is currently discounting either model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y8BpYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327662"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zWYgij"&gt;You don’t have to spend a fortune for a 4K TV; spending $500 or less can still net you a TV with good image quality and features. Insignia’s 55-inch 4K HDR Fire TV Edition model is the perfect case in point, one that supports HDR10, HDMI ARC, and HDMI eArc, among other notable features. Although its price isn’t as low as it was during Amazon Prime Day, you can still pick it up for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748188127423432886#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $460&lt;/a&gt;, slightly more than the typical sale price but still $90 off the initial MSRP. You’ll need a My Best Buy account to take advantage of the deal, however, Best Buy’s rewards program is free and the discount automatically applies at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jIOPJT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10605845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cW4VPC"&gt;Another Fire TV Edition TV deal happening now is on Toshiba’s 55-inch Smart Fire TV Edition 4K LED, which normally retails for $520. As the name might imply, it allows you to stream content from services such as Disney Plus and Netflix, and includes the option to watch live TV. The latest models also tout an Alexa-enabled remote, an easy-to-use interface, and support for Dolby Vision HDR and HDR10. Right now at Amazon, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-55-inch-4K-UHD-Smart-Fire-TV/dp/B0924XSHB2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch model for $370&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-55-inch-4K-UHD-Smart-Fire-TV/dp/B0924WG7JD/ref=asc_df_B0924WG7JD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model for $410&lt;/a&gt;, a 21 percent discount on both models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x443tm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="74eOSC"&gt;TCL also has competitively priced televisions, and its 4-series lineup is one of the more affordable options on the market. The S435 model features a built-in Roku interface, dual-band Wi-Fi, HDR10, and support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri voice assistants. You can currently get the 50-inch model for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08DHFX4FV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$450 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $50 less than the usual retail price. Amazon is also selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08GWBBH4R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model for $500&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08GW31GLZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;75-inch variant for $1,000&lt;/a&gt;, a sizeable discount on both devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside id="9H3H8m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 38,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vbJRlM"&gt;OLED televisions offer the best image quality in a mainstream TV. LG’s BX line supports HDMI 2.1, meaning this TV is perfect for people looking to take advantage of the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. You can get it in either the 55- or 65-inch configuration and save up to $300, depending on the size. The popular 55-inch model is currently &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1555063-REG%2Flg_oled55bxpua_bxpua_55_class_hdr.html%2F%3Fap%3Dy%26ap%3Dy%26smp%3Dy%26smp%3Dy%26lsft%3DBI%253A514%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjww-CGBhALEiwAQzWxOgU3ox9wsfBFjLRJVHH3TWdndzXKhfL4blfPMcuIgQPfk8De4iHqNxoCh80QAvD_BwE&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,297 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flg-55-39-39-class-4k-uhd-smart-oled-tv-oled55bxpua%2F-%2FA-52328755&amp;amp;subid1=BestTVDealsDeals04122021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,300 at Target&lt;/a&gt;, and basically the same price at other major retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OMVgrF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MB8PX4"&gt;Despite the high price tag, LG’s Gallery Series GX OLED is a good TV for those looking for a more cinematic experience. It includes support for Google Assistant and Alexa, and for those who want to use their TV for gaming, it features Nvidia G-Sync and HDMI 2.1 support, meaning it can take full advantage of the RTX 30-series cards or Sony’s and Microsoft’s next-gen gaming consoles. Right now, you can get the 55-inch for as low as &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLG-GX-55-inch-Class-with-Gallery-Design-4K-Smart-OLED-TV-w-AI-ThinQ-54-6-Diag-OLED55GXPUA%2F152371849%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_33DRwsUfoxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkESb%253AWnWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_1943169%26clickid%3D33DRwsUfoxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkESb%253AWnWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=BestTVDeals04142021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,797 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, or for a few dollars more at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744656950369633474#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1555068-REG%2Flg_oled65gxpua_gxpua_65_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model is also available at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Flg-oled-gx-65%2Fp%2F16C-000P-004G0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg for $2,097&lt;/a&gt;, a savings of more than $1,400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lpiA85"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10445785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nGYSCL"&gt;Vizio’s 65-inch OLED is a Best Buy exclusive, and&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748271630959872367#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; you can get it for $1,800&lt;/a&gt;. Although Best’s Buy’s current discount is nowhere near its steepest — last month, it was on sale for $1,500 — it remains one of the more affordable options if you’re looking for a 65-inch TV. Vizio doesn’t have the same kind of experience in the OLED playing field as LG, but it’s a great deal if you want a high-end viewing experience and HDMI 2.1 ports to display high frame rates from your PS5 or Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q8lGs4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xr7I2E"&gt;Sony’s PS5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X can play 4K games with HDR at up to 120 frames per second. So, naturally, if you don’t have a TV that takes full advantage of your console, it might be time to upgrade to one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. For the best experience, you’ll want a TV that supports HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Nkhmv"&gt;Deals on those picks are scarce right now, however, there’s one happening on LG’s CX series of TVs, which include support for Nvidia’s G-Sync and AMD’s FreeSync adaptive sync technologies, as well as a low 1ms response time. The big difference between the CX and the cheaper BX model mentioned above is the CX line can have slightly better brightness, which is better for HDR content. It comes in four sizes: 48, 55, 65, and 77 inches. Right now, you can purchase the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748273201373884122#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model for $1,300 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or the 65-inch configuration for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/lg-65%22-class---cx-series---4k-uhd-oled-tv---%24100-allstate-protection-plan-bundle-included.product.100657326.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,950 at Costco&lt;/a&gt;. The latter deal requires a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://costcomembershipoffer.com/Purchase/Purchase/cj?qid=e6583bbeb3f911eb830f05100a1c0e10" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco membership&lt;/a&gt;, but it also nets you an Allstate Protection Plan — a three-year warranty for your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F5GsVe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9534696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BfJNcm"&gt;If you’re looking for an even more impressive TV, we recommend turning your attention to LG’s C1 line. Like its predecessor, the CX, the 4K C1 touts support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD Freesync technologies, along with a 120Hz refresh rate and low input lag. The main difference between the two is that the C1 is available in an 83-inch variant and features a better processor. It also utilizes a newer interface that makes good use of a settings pane dubbed “Game Optimizer,” which conveniently brings together a host of game-centric settings — refresh rate, latency, etc. — for quicker access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkH38i"&gt;If you’re interested in all the bells and whistles that come with the C1, the 55-inch model is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747318067989758928#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for around $1,500, one of the lowest prices to date on the excellent OLED. You can also pick up the smaller, 48-inch model for $1,297 at the same retailers (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747323256242351544#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;), as well as the 65-, 77-, and 83-inch variants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IrDSVn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10618444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bn523S"&gt;For a viable OLED alternative — one that’s currently seeing a rare discount — there’s the Neo QLED QN90A. Unlike the LG models above, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309077/samsung-2021-8k-4k-tvs-now-available-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s most recent flagship&lt;/a&gt; uses Mini LED backlighting, a technology that allows for better contrast, less “blooming” around white objects on a dark background, and brightness levels that outperform even the best OLED TVs. Like the C1, the QN90A is also built with gamers in mind. The 2021 model features an HDMI 2.1 port and a “Game Bar” that gives you the ability to quickly adjust your screen’s aspect ratio, monitor input lag, and check to ensure settings such as HDR and VRR are active, all of which make for a better gaming experience overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x9RwhV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung starts shipping its most ambitious TV lineup in years","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309077/samsung-2021-8k-4k-tvs-now-available-price-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TYqOuE"&gt;In terms of discounts, we don’t often see them on the QN90A. Right now, however, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748274080574733405#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3W4YXJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are both offering the 55-inch model for about $1,600, the second-best price we’ve seen on the stunning QLED. There are also varying discounts available on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3W4YXJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3K77SC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; 65&lt;/a&gt;-, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V39W74P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;75-inch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3B227H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;85-inch configurations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4gR7Wz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462562"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>IMDb TV app finally arrives on iOS and Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YWBqDDedP4ZmG3dxwZYKciScfbY=/0x157:947x788/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69685791/iOS_Image.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: IMDb TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jKRoK9"&gt;Amazon’s free streaming service IMDb TV now has its own dedicated app for the iPhone, iPad, and Android after launching on other major platforms earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43jTsV"&gt;IMDb TV is a dedicated hub for free, ad-supported movies and series as well as its own dedicated originals produced by Amazon Studios. Previously, you could find IMDb TV’s content slate in the primary IMDb app, but a standalone streaming app for the service was not available for iOS and Android. A spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the content is still available to stream through IMDb, but the new IMDb TV app was “designed for the streaming experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4C2Opp"&gt;IMDb TV’s content slate is quite good, even if its originals have struggled to make as much of a splash as titles from larger premium services. But if you don’t mind ads, there’s a ton of great stuff to stream for free on the service, including documentaries, sci-fi titles, dramas, and plenty of TV to binge. &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;How to Train Your Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Schitt’s Creek&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt; are all currently streamable on the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxmqnT"&gt;Plus, through a recently announced deal with Universal, IMDb TV will also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570590/universal-films-prime-video-streaming-peacock"&gt;exclusively stream&lt;/a&gt; some live-action and animated titles from the studio following their release in theaters and a brief pay-one premiere on Peacock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEuOWw"&gt;The app was previously made available on the majority of major streaming devices and some smart TVs, including Fire TV, Roku, Xbox, Android TV, Android TV OS devices, newer LG Smart TVs, PlayStation 4, Chromecast with Google TV, and Nvidia Shield. It’s also available as a free channel within the Prime Video experience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bill Gates admits meetings with Jeffrey Epstein were a ‘huge mistake’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PUjpdVkDVvP5qKKqSF1zHsReAS4=/486x0:2880x1596/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69685441/Screen_Shot_2021_08_05_at_1.08.17_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jAXJno"&gt;Bill Gates said that spending time with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was “a huge mistake” in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhZa3J2cemM"&gt;an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper&lt;/a&gt;. The interview covered Gates’ relationship with Epstein, which he says was an attempt to get “billions for philanthropy,” as well as Gates’ &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/16/business/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-epstein.html"&gt;alleged workplace misbehavior&lt;/a&gt; at Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGVdca"&gt;Gates’ story regarding his relationship with Epstein hasn’t changed much since their meetings came to light. In 2019, he &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mind-of-bill-gates-revealed-on-netflix-11568107801"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he had met Epstein, but “didn’t have any business relationship or friendship with him.” A month later, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/business/jeffrey-epstein-bill-gates.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; quoted&lt;/a&gt; a spokesperson for Gates, who said that Gates “regrets ever meeting with Epstein and recognizes it was an error in judgment to do so.” The statement, and further comments from the spokesperson in the article, mention the same promises of charitable donations from Epstein that Gates talks about in his CNN interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vtuDOR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhZa3J2cemM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zAAS7U"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; story, however, reports that the two men met many times, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/12/20911488/bill-gates-foundation-jeffrey-epstein-meetings"&gt;details meetings that reportedly happened&lt;/a&gt; between Gates Foundation employees and Epstein that were centered on fundraising. In the CNN interview, Gates admits that the “several” meetings he had with Epstein (which took place after Epstein had &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2008/06/30/jeffrey-epstein-pleads-guilty-to-prostitution-charges/"&gt;pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor&lt;/a&gt;) gave Epstein credibility, which he again called a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOA5Yd"&gt;When asked if he had any regrets about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/16/22439640/bill-gates-microsoft-board-alleged-affair-investigation"&gt;an affair with a Microsoft employee&lt;/a&gt;, which was investigated by the Microsoft board, Gates said that everyone has regrets but that he needed to “go forward” with his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wF5A3v"&gt;Melinda French Gates, whose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607200/bill-gates-melinda-french-gates-divorce-finalized-financial-assets-foundation"&gt;divorce from Bill Gates was recently finalized&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly objected to him meeting Epstein. Melinda and Bill will continue to work together to run their charity, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22566889/bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation-divorce-governance-plan-two-years"&gt;foundation has announced&lt;/a&gt; that Melinda could leave after two years if she and Bill can no longer work together.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla reportedly paid $1 million to former employee who said supervisors called him a racist slur</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hlw8DUhO1fJHgS1ZhOIsYqBcMrI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69685384/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Giyg4Q"&gt;A former Tesla employee won a $1 million award from the automaker after an arbitrator found the company failed to prevent his supervisors from calling him a racial slur, &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/ex-tesla-employee-called-racial-slur-wins-rare-1-million-award"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Law&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Melvin Berry, who is Black, was hired at Tesla’s plant in Alameda, California in 2015. He said a supervisor called him the N-word, then retaliated by forcing him to work longer hours and do more physically demanding work when Berry confronted him. Tesla has denied the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QGgpN"&gt;Arbitrator Elaine Rushing said in a May 12th ruling that Tesla was liable for the harassment Berry described, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “Case law is clear that one instance of a supervisor directing the N-word at a subordinate is sufficient to constitute severe harassment,”  Rushing wrote. And, she wrote, a supervisor who wrote Berry a warning letter lacked credibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjKlHX"&gt;Tesla argued that there was no written evidence that Berry had complained about supervisors calling him the N-word, noting that he left the company voluntarily, the arbitrator’s ruling shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcDdOK"&gt;Arbitration proceedings between employers and employees are usually kept confidential, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomber&lt;/em&gt;g reported that Berry’s attorney filed a standard petition in court to enforce the arbitrator’s order, which revealed the decision. Attorney Lawrence Organ told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;that Berry would not be pursuing further legal action since Tesla has paid the award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ho3AAz"&gt;Berry is not the first worker to allege racism at Tesla’s Fremont plant. In 2017, former assembly worker &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-tesla-racism-lawsuit-20171115-story.html"&gt;Marcus Vaughn sued Tesla&lt;/a&gt; saying the company had not investigated his written complaint that co-workers and supervisors had called him the N-word. Vaughn called the Fremont plant a “hotbed for racist behavior.” &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/hotbed-misinformation"&gt;Tesla said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; at the time that Vaughn’s lawsuit was a “hotbed of misinformation.” In April, a judge in Alameda County rejected the company’s request to block Vaughn from seeking class action status for the suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TxKOri"&gt;An email to Tesla seeking comment was not immediately answered on Thursday; &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-media/tesla-disbands-u-s-media-relations-team-electrek-idUSKBN26R2CX"&gt;Tesla dissolved&lt;/a&gt; its press office last year and doesn’t usually respond to media inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;
