    <title>How to activate and use Google Chat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2RAjBG6BUaHLxhWcMClP6Ky3fw0=/259x0:2158x1266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69463132/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_9.27.20_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kznv7R"&gt;Real-time collaborative chat, as exemplified by apps such as Slack, has become a common way to communicate between colleagues and friends, especially since last year when so many of us transitioned to working from home. Google has apparently taken note of this and is pitting itself against Slack by taking two of the features from its corporate Workplace app suite — Chat and Rooms — and integrating them into its standard Gmail app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8I4aj7"&gt;Google Chat allows you to hold chat sessions with friends and groups of friends either on an informal or formal basis. The former can be done just between two people or between several in what Google calls a group conversation. The latter is done via a separate space that Google currently calls a Room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJR9xO"&gt;What’s the difference? &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chat/answer/7659784?hl=en"&gt;According to Google&lt;/a&gt;, Chat is simply a way for two or more people to chat together without any formalities — for example, if you wanted to quickly talk about where you were going to meet for lunch, you’d create a group conversation among your friends. Once the conversation is done, it’s done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gliRcM"&gt;A Room, on the other hand, is for more long-term conversations. Each Room has its own name, remains available for people to leave and rejoin, will send out notifications, and can share files. You can even have rooms within rooms. It’s for work projects, party planning, or any other activity where you want to keep the conversation going over the course of days, weeks, or longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkUrX7"&gt;If this sounds useful to you, then the first thing you need to do is activate Google Chat for your Gmail account. Currently, at least, you need to do it separately on your browser and on your mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gQ7jOG"&gt;Activate Chat on a mobile app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zVHWsU"&gt;Tap the three-line icon at the top-left corner. Scroll down and select “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="s2RMES"&gt;Select your account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Mmujm6"&gt;Select “General” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lAJF5L"&gt;If you’re using an Android phone, check off “Show the Chat and Rooms tabs.” If you’re using an iPhone or iPad, toggle “Show the chat and rooms tab” on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1AdW8N"&gt;Note: if you’re using an iPhone / iPad, you’ll have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22429322/ios-14-how-to-close-quite-app-iphone"&gt;close and re-open&lt;/a&gt; Gmail manually to activate the Chat feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="wJUlit"&gt;On the bottom of the screen, instead of just Mail and Meet icons, you’ll now also have Chat and Rooms icons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can activate Chat in the General section of Settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0UEUVD8qg_uOfUzI0LWs_pI1P1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662468/Screenshot_20210616_104823.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can activate Chat in the General section of Settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There will now be four icons at the bottom of your Gmail page." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iwNwwP6oVVY1WNPLHy3adpGb1Hs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662469/Screenshot_20210616_104725.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There will now be four icons at the bottom of your Gmail page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Azi11N"&gt;Activate Chat on a browser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oWenT2"&gt;Go to your Gmail account and go to settings (the gear icon in the upper-right corner)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qBQYol"&gt;Select “View all settings”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ade7aX"&gt;In the top menu, select “Chat and Meet”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rXItCy"&gt;You have the choice of selecting “Chat,” “Classic Hangouts,” and “Off.” Assuming you want to try Chat, click on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d0w0Fg"&gt;Usually, Chat will appear on the left side of your Gmail screen, but you can choose to have it appear on the right side instead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="D1ZOT9"&gt;By the way, “Chat and Meet” lets you hide the Meet section in Gmail if you want to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rNj6gp"&gt;Click on “Save Changes”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="On your browser, go into Settings and look for the “Chat and Meet” section." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G-Ybl84pt7-A42oxfhhmAv4nNBs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662472/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_9.26.49_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On your browser, go into Settings and look for the “Chat and Meet” section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kKO0Wf"&gt;Your Gmail screen will refresh, and you will probably get a pop-up welcoming you to the “new Gmail.” Instead of the Meet and Hangouts boxes that used to be on the left-hand side of your Gmail screen, you’ll now have a Chat box, a Rooms box, and a Meet box. Any contacts with whom you previously had chats with via Hangouts will appear in the new Chat box; click on their names, and a small pop-up window in the lower left will show you those previous chats. (Note that if you blocked anyone in Hangouts previously, that blocking isn’t going to carry over to Chat.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9qyI6"&gt;Before we go into the specifics of how to use Google Chat, you may notice some other small differences after the refresh. To begin, the icon that looked like a quote mark at the bottom of your left column — which referred to Google Hangouts — will now be replaced by a couple of quote bubbles. The previous large “Compose” button on the upper-left corner will be replaced (why, I’m not sure) by an inconveniently small pencil icon. And you now have a button on the right of the search box that lets you choose to be active, away, or undisturbed; you can also type in your own status.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A new button lets you tell people whether you’re active or not." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pd0nAwx_axN8kDHqcBrc6B1FBWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662896/Screen_Shot_2021_06_16_at_1.19.46_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new button lets you tell people whether you’re active or not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qhM2oJ"&gt;Begin a chat on the web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="NESiN8"&gt;To start a new Chat, you have a choice: you can click on the “Find a chat” link in the Chat box, or you can click on the plus sign in the corners of the Chat or Rooms boxes. Either way, you’ll get a drop-down menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f6dwYH"&gt;If you want to just chat with a single person, type their name into the top field, and you will be taken into a small chat box. (You can maximize it if you want.) If you want to chat with more than one person, then select “Group conversation.” You’ll then be able to list the people you want to chat with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qHKk4Z"&gt;The same menu also lets you start a room (more on that later), browse existing rooms, or search for message requests (in other words, search for previous requests for chats from other people).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll now find Chat and Rooms in the left column." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kbUu_TJp5tpAHz02txYiTwQMLeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662482/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_9.29.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll now find Chat and Rooms in the left column. Either can be used to start a chat, a group conversation, or a room.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Eh7Dld"&gt;Begin a chat on a mobile app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CPJqO8"&gt;Tap on the Chat icon and then on the small “New chat” popup in the lower-right corner &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="693sJQ"&gt;You can type in the name of a person here, or you can create a room or browse existing rooms &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CtshOl"&gt;If you want to create a group conversation (in other words, have a chat with several people), first type in the name of the first person you want to chat with (or choose their name from the drop-down list), then tap on the group icon that will appear in the same field you’re typing in, and add any other names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="After you click on “New chat” you can create a chat or a room with one or more people." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/44LpVXPjcmZJ-PS6Cw7BmoW0FbI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662491/Screenshot_20210615_153349.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After you click on “New chat” you can create a chat or a room with one or more people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you want to add more people to your chat, click on the group icon at top." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MhgC-0RWio0pW55Q3z-ppS4RkMw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662492/Screenshot_20210615_153409.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to add more people to your chat, click on the group icon at top.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U4jayJ"&gt;People who are invited to your chat will get an email with a link, and will have the option of joining the conversation or blocking it; if they are on Hangouts or Chat, they will get a notification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuXN46"&gt;Whether you’re using the web or a mobile app, to add a new message, type into the field at the bottom of the screen. A series of icons to the side or below the entry field lets you add emoji, upload a file, add a file from Google Drive, start a video meeting (essentially, starting Google Meet), and schedule an event.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A chat can include images and emojis." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VrPLA70exaBCnMd8aqb4BpSTuts=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662506/Screen_Shot_2021_06_16_at_11.07.07_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A chat can include images and emojis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pT3Cfi"&gt;Create a Room&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LfBO79"&gt;On the web, go to the Chat box or the Room box on the left of Gmail and click on the plus sign. In the mobile app, tap on the Rooms icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6KXG1E"&gt;Select “Create room”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you create a room, you name it and add participants." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I1yT3Un9sAmEz66MqQVt183aVs8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662519/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_11.16.33_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you create a room, you name it and add participants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="KnBLiM"&gt;Create a room name and add the people you want to include. (If they’re not on your contact list, you can just type in their email address.) Click “Create.” You’ll be taken into the new room. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0rvt04"&gt;The people who are invited will get an email with a link. When they click on the link, they will be shown the new room and given the opportunity to either join it or block it. (If they haven’t joined Chat yet, they will get notifications from Hangouts.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YhA8oH"&gt;To add a new message, type into the field at the bottom of the screen. Like Chat, a series of icons on the right of the field lets you add emoji, upload a file, add a file from Google Drive, start a video meeting (which is essentially starting Google Meet), and schedule an event. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A room can include images, emojis and tasks — but it’s not as temporary as a chat." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bKOtaTRDuujv2vMs9OanYECm-Wk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662530/Screen_Shot_2021_06_16_at_11.16.22_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A room can include images, emojis and tasks — but it’s not as temporary as a chat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oWymr0"&gt;A couple of notes about rooms: if you’ve created a room using a personal account (as opposed to a business account), anyone in the room can change its name. There are a few other rules as to the use of rooms that can be found on a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chat/answer/7659784?hl=en"&gt;Google support page&lt;/a&gt;; it’s a little confusing as to which apply just to business accounts and which to personal accounts, but hopefully Google will fix that in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uG0tpS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPofI9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9hFs5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam Next Fest lets you try hundreds of games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vII940qm4znI3Gbq4GTwkRU1ScE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69463124/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n2lX1u"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjjvO3i8JzxAhWBnp4KHaTjCToQFjAQegQIAhAE&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F12%2F22531138%2Fe3-2021-summer-game-fest-news-announcements&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0XBQ-xSNvTeepA3HrCilJY"&gt;E3 2021&lt;/a&gt; is technically over, and without a show floor to demo things, plenty of developers lost an opportunity to spread the word about their games. Xbox has one way around that, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528733/xbox-summer-game-fest-event-40-demos-sable-tunic"&gt;collecting indie game demos&lt;/a&gt; on home consoles, and now Valve is launching its version for PC games.  The latest Steam festival, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest"&gt;Next Fest&lt;/a&gt;, has launched today with hundreds of demos of upcoming games to try and livestreams of playthroughs and interviews with developers if you’d rather watch than play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJSeIH"&gt;Running from June 16th to June 22nd, Next Fest includes a wide swath of games in a variety of genres, some of which weren’t spotlighted during last weekend’s loose collection of E3 livestreams and keynotes. Some notable games included in the fest are &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/757310/Sable/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1319420/Chasing_Static/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chasing Static&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1118240/Lake/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1307580/TOEM/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1221250/NORCO/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Norco&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbDLJ9"&gt;Valve’s been running these online festivals periodically since the pandemic started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21184319/steam-game-festival-sale-gdc-2020-indie-developers"&gt;as a way to fill the void&lt;/a&gt; of in-person events like the Game Developers Conference. While it might be a bit more hit or miss than the big splashy showcases at E3, Next Fest seems filled to the brim with interesting ideas. Plus all the demos are free, so it doesn’t hurt to give any of them a spin. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Even the Xbox app has stories now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/chD8LcD8lXnShhlG5ZaDVP_x9eI=/3x0:1419x944/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69462995/xboxappstories.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stories inside the Xbox mobile app.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HzuVjn"&gt;Microsoft is now adding a row of stories to its Xbox app on iOS and Android. It’s the same interface that originated in Snapchat and has spread to every single social media app, including Instagram, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570368/twitter-fleets-disapeating-tweets-stories-launch-available-now"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook Messenger, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22249152/pinterest-story-pins-carousel-home-screen-update"&gt;Pinterest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21156247/linkedin-testing-instagram-stories-feature-social-network-resumes-why"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. Even Slack is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505519/slack-instagram-stories-push-to-talk-audio-calls-new-features"&gt;adding stories&lt;/a&gt; soon, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oa6u6"&gt;Now you’ll also see stories from Xbox games in the mobile app, just in case you haven’t had enough stories in your life. While most social media apps have stories content that’s created by your friends or whoever you follow, the Xbox stories will be from game brands instead. So if you play a lot of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll see stories from these games and any others you follow on the Xbox network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqh61A"&gt;Stories in the Xbox app are simply being used as another form of marketing for games to advertise promotions, updates, and more. Thankfully, it’s not all that intrusive in the Xbox app, and Microsoft has placed these stories halfway down the page rather than prominently at the top. They’re simply labeled “official posts from games.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUw4s7"&gt;It’s not clear whether Microsoft will ever allow Xbox network users to create their own stories in the Xbox app, but there’s certainly no way to do that right now. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1405223650148589568"&gt;Microsoft says&lt;/a&gt; it’s adding stories into the Xbox app “because everyone deserves to see that no scope,” but you’ll only see the no scopes from brands and not your talented friends.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a big screen, or a great camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="TNIRIb"&gt;If you’re shopping for a new phone on a budget, we’ve got good news: there are more great, affordable phones on the market than ever. Companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung are spreading the wealth of features enjoyed by their flagships down to less expensive options. Other brands like OnePlus are finding ways to challenge more established manufacturers with budget devices that make smart sacrifices to keep costs down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWFA5k"&gt;The bad news is this makes the job of picking the best budget phone that much harder. Bear in mind that it’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything at this price point; instead, prioritize the features that matter most to you. You’ll have an easier time deciding, and you’ll end up with a great phone that you should be able to use for years to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JHLP0"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it’s just over a year old, we think it’s still the best bet for most people.  While it does a competent job at everything, its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gY4Mp"&gt;If you’re looking for the best cheap Android phone, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt; is your best bet right now. It comes with an excellent 6.5-inch screen with 120Hz fast refresh rate, still a rarity at this price point. Even better, Samsung says it will offer four years of security updates, including three years of major OS upgrades. The A52 5G isn’t the cheapest — it’s priced right at $500 — but that healthy support policy means you’ll get many years out of your investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQUJ3j"&gt;What most people are looking for in a sub-$500 smartphone are the same things people want in a more expensive model: long battery life, good screen, good camera, and decent performance. It’s difficult to get high straight A’s in every single one of those categories, but if you’re able to decide where you’ll tolerate the occasional B grade, you’ll find a phone you’ll love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="xLIfAi"&gt;The best smartphone for under $500 in 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBU6PLPRcKtVVTdfTrprm4mAigQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19916232/vpavic_042019_3980_0024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best smartphone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bkDOPH"&gt;The phone that strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people is the Apple iPhone SE 2020. Even though it’s over a year old now, it should still give you an excellent return on your investment. We recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZnehD"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today and also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market. High refresh-rate screens with smoother animations and scrolling have been trickling down into the budget class recently, and you definitely won’t find one here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOgwn4"&gt;It’s a familiar design and not one that screams “modern.” But in exchange, you get a lot of value. The 2020 SE is part of the iPhone 11 generation, so its A13 Bionic processor is a year behind the latest and greatest. (That would be the A14 chipset in the iPhone 12 lineup.) However, it’s still one of the fastest processors you can get on any phone, but &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; one in this price bracket. Normally, speed isn’t something we prioritize on phones at this price point, but it’s nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9LjWN"&gt;Why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in opposition to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means, in a few years, the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and still be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5TvHua"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tETMb0"&gt;Battery life is good but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, which is still uncommon at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape as the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8, there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAfzxG"&gt;The iPhone SE has just one camera on the back and just one selfie camera on the front, 12 megapixels and 7 megapixels, respectively. Neither is great by 2021 standards, but both are significantly better than what Apple shipped in older iPhones. It’s also fairly good by the standards of sub-$500 phones, though the Google Pixel 4A continues to win this category by a knockout. You will get a lot of camera features on the iPhone SE, including portrait and HDR, but unfortunately, there is no night mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nB1ZXR"&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people. If you think of it on a cost-per-year metric, it ends up being significantly less expensive than the competition because it’s likely to last four or five years if you take care of it. Just as importantly, it’s a great phone on its own merits. You get access to the vast array of iOS apps, Apple’s strong support network, and a huge ecosystem of accessories.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7jGjKdcssyDUAL1Vc67gH-WoCNo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465667/ajohnson_20210419_4541_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G offers a 120Hz fast refresh-rate screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qyhaRs"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MeddEq"&gt;The best budget Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7CPw9a"&gt;On the Android side, the Galaxy A52 5G is a great option, albeit at the very top of the price range considered in this guide. It includes some features that aren’t too common in a budget phone, like its fast-refresh rate screen, an IP67 water resistance rating, and for now at least, monthly security updates for fast access to bug fixes and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s379P4"&gt;The A52 5G’s 6.5-inch screen is an OLED panel that’s bright with good contrast that’s generally nice to look at. But its best feature is a subtle one: a 120Hz refresh rate that gives a much smoother appearance to animations and content as you swipe and scroll through menus and social feeds. We’ll likely see this feature make its way into more budget phones soon, but for now the A52 5G is one of only a few to offer better than the standard 60Hz screen in its class, and it makes the experience of using the phone that much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grIaTf"&gt;The phone overall performs well for its class with a Snapdragon 750G processor and 6GB of RAM. You may notice the occasional hesitation or stutter with heavy tasks, but otherwise everyday scrolling, app switching, and navigating is handled easily. And even with a power-hungry display, the Galaxy A52 5G’s 4,500mAh battery should get you through at least a day of moderate to heavy use before needing another charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RSNCy0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;if you want to make an investment in a phone that you can keep using years from now, the A52 5G is your best bet right now on Android&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwHMHO"&gt;One of the A52 5G’s not-so-bright-spots is Samsung’s current take on Android, which puts a lot of pre-downloaded apps on your phone that you probably don’t want, and it even includes the occasional ad in places like the native weather app. For a cleaner or more grown-up Android skin, look to the Pixel or OnePlus. The Galaxy A52 5G’s camera is another consideration: it’s capable, but it tends toward an oversaturated look. If you prefer a more natural look to your photos, then the Pixel 4A is the winner here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFmNNo"&gt;There’s also 5G, which we still don’t think is a feature you should run out and buy a new phone for, but it is nice to have the support here — particularly if you plan to hold on to your phone for a few years. This device doesn’t support super-fast mmWave 5G, but it’s hard to come by so that’s not a huge loss. Importantly, it supports more widely available sub-6GHz bands and should be able to take advantage of improving 5G networks in the US over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOCh8W"&gt;You can buy a much less expensive device to get you through the next couple of years, and that’s just fine. But if you do want to make more of an investment in a phone that you can keep using three or four years from now, the A52 5G is your best bet right now on Android. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mjpWjB"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ndqid1"&gt;An affordable Android phone with the best camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nCclP5"&gt;If you want to spend a little less money, or just want the best camera, then the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt; Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice&lt;/a&gt;. Its screen is on the small side, and it doesn’t have the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android and is first in line for updates from Google. The 4A came out in August last year, but it’s still guaranteed to get software updates until at least August 2023. It comes in either black or baby blue with 128GB of storage for $349. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Huw9Ph"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera. It’s based on generation-old technology at this point, but it’s still the best in this class and it can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,000 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software. (The sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special.) That means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XiTOqY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g65TGg"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrF1h5"&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff you probably don’t want. More importantly, it means that Google can supply the software updates directly instead of waiting for another manufacturer or carrier to approve it, putting you first in line for Android updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XggNCE"&gt;Unfortunately, in a little over a year’s time, it’s quite likely that the Pixel 4A will be slowing down. Android phones generally don’t last quite as long as iPhones do because Android tends to bog down on older hardware more quickly. The Pixel 4A’s processor is fast enough today to not be a bother, but over time, it’s possible that it won’t age well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7VV1d"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for well under $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Nord has very good specs for its price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bFMC0d"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;OnePlus Nord&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PWBCf6"&gt;The best all-around Android phone outside the US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VceItk"&gt;Technically, saying the OnePlus Nord costs less than $500 doesn’t make much sense because it’s not available in the US, and the company doesn’t plan to sell it in the States. But if you live in a market where it’s available, the OnePlus Nord is the kind of phone that aims for a solid B grade in every category instead of trying to ace one or two. For £379 / €399, it’s a safe Android bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCe0u5"&gt;The OnePlus Nord has a couple of features that are normally reserved for much more expensive phones: support for sub-6 5G networks and a high refresh rate 90Hz display. If you live in an area where 5G is built out, you may notice faster download speeds. But it’s the display that’ll have a bigger impact on your day-to-day experience. It makes everything feel smoother and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdWibC"&gt;You will miss out on wireless charging and a headphone jack with the Nord, but they’re really the only big things that are lacking. Battery life is strong, the 6.44-inch screen is big and beautiful, and the software is less annoying than some competitors (though not as clean as Google’s). The £379 / €399 model comes with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, both plenty good for this price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5llXq"&gt;As for cameras, there are a bunch of them — maybe even too many. There’s a standard, an ultrawide, and a macro camera on the back as well as a couple of selfie cameras on the front. As is the norm with most smartphone cameras these days, they will get you decent photos in decent light but fall down a bit in the dark. You’ll mostly want to use the main camera, as the ultrawide has a noticeable drop in quality, and the macro is only good for, well, macro or close-up shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijydf9"&gt;All too often, phones at this price point have some critical compromise you’re forced to make in order to get the feature you really want. With the OnePlus Nord, there’s no big flaw you’ll have to work around. Again, though, it’s not available in the US. You can import it, but it’s not recommended as it won’t work correctly on US LTE networks.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N10 5G is priced well under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2pPPrl"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0wGhHB"&gt;If you want an inexpensive 5G phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zVN77Q"&gt;At $299, the N10 5G is well below the threshold for this category. Given its price, you might expect to see some significant sacrifices compared to a $400 or $500 phone, and OnePlus has made a few. But they’re smart sacrifices that add up to a device that’s really quite good for the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vb4uVX"&gt;You won’t find a fantastic screen here, although its large 6.46-inch LCD does come with a faster-than-average 90Hz refresh rate. Worth noting is the device’s somewhat “tall” 20:9 aspect ratio, which is a little unusual at first glance but makes the phone slightly narrower and easier to use with one hand. Its processor is capable enough, though it sometimes shows its limits. It also ships with Android 10, which OnePlus says it will update to 11, and is only offering two years of security updates in addition to that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXW2WO"&gt;On the camera side, the N10 offers a 64-megapixel main camera that’s surprisingly good in daylight and even moderately low light. There’s an 8-megapixel ultrawide, too, along with macro and monochrome cameras that aren’t really worth talking about. It’s not Pixel 4A-level good, but if you don’t push it too hard, the N10’s main camera takes good photos in the right light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y00B08"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; is also well worth considering in this price bracket for two very good reasons: it’s a bit less expensive and will be supported with security updates for the next four years. However, it lacks some of the N10’s nice features like a faster refresh rate screen, the camera isn’t as good, and its software feels more cluttered and bloated. The A32 5G is a better pick if you want to hang on to your phone for as many years as possible, but the N10 is a more likable device overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5Ppnc"&gt;If budget is a major consideration, the N10 5G is about as good as it gets at this price. It offers the future-proofiness of sub-6GHz 5G support, a thoroughly decent camera, good battery life, a capable processor, and a fairly clean implementation of Android. It’s not a standout in any one way, but as a total package, it’s very hard to argue with its capabilities at this price.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2021 Moto G Power offers days-long battery performance but makes a lot of sacrifices for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qq9tmB"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Motorola Moto G Power (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tXDuyi"&gt;The budget phone with maximum battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NSb4tw"&gt;The Moto G Power does exactly what it says it will: provide days and days of power on a single charge, thanks to its larger-than-average 5,000mAh battery. This is a slightly different version of last year’s phone with the same name, and it starts at a lower $200 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7tVXv"&gt;The lower price tag does come with trade-offs. It includes just 32GB of built-in storage, so adding a microSD card for some extra space is a must. There’s also a slightly slower processor on board, and while it’s capable enough for all of your daily needs, it’s a little laggy jumping between apps and opening the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8syWIE"&gt;As for the camera: it’s just okay. Motorola did away with the ultrawide in this year’s models, so you’ll just be working with the 48-megapixel standard wide and 2-megapixel macro cameras in addition to an 8-megapixel selfie cam. Photos in bright outdoor light look good with plenty of detail, though colors can be a little washed out. The camera struggles with high-contrast scenes and low light, but all things considered, it’s fine for a $200 phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bJEGA"&gt;If top-notch battery performance is an extremely important feature in your smartphone, then the Moto G Power should be on your shortlist. It’s capable, and you really will get multiple days of battery life on a charge. But if you’re fine getting by on a battery that’s just average, then we think you’ll be happier with a more well-rounded device.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zLkqZB"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22408041/motorola-moto-g-play-2021-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;Motorola Moto G Play (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0rkwQp"&gt;The best phone under $200&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y8w9H"&gt;There are plenty of options for those shopping on a tighter budget, but the Motorola Moto G Play is the one that stands out to us. It covers the basics well with a big 5,000mAh battery and a Snapdragon 460 processor that does a good enough job handling daily tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwHIya"&gt;The G Play has a generously sized 6.5-inch screen. It’s a lower-resolution panel at 720p and is difficult to see outside in direct light, but it’s more or less just fine. Camera specs are likewise basic: there’s just one rear-facing 13-megapixel camera that performs well in bright light but isn’t well suited for low-light photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTXRvU"&gt;You’ll also want to strongly consider a microSD card purchase with this phone. It only includes 32GB of built-in storage, a lot of which is already occupied by system files. Motorola has only promised security updates for two years, but realistically, the G Play isn’t built to last much longer than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhtEOa"&gt;It has its shortcomings — the G Play’s performance doesn’t keep up with many phones that are just $50-100 more expensive, for example — but it’s hard to argue with what it does offer for its price: good, basic performance without any major flaws. If there’s flexibility in your budget to spend a little more, you’ll get some meaningful upgrades, like a better camera or a longer-lasting device. But for its price, the G Play does just what it needs to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will start putting ads in Oculus Quest apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Advertisement within the Oculus Quest game Blaston." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QRSZ-LfCeZDfs8c4kzeUGb9L7Hc=/0x0:1350x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69462797/image001.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UHJH6q"&gt;Facebook will soon begin testing ads inside its Oculus Quest virtual reality system. In the coming weeks, ads will start appearing inside the Resolution Games title &lt;em&gt;Blaston&lt;/em&gt; as well as two other unnamed apps. Facebook will later expand the system based on user feedback, saying it aims to create a “self-sustaining platform” for VR development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCRvWQ"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/social-marketing/oculus-to-begin-testing-ads-on-its-mobile-app-for-content-on-its-platform/"&gt;introduced ads&lt;/a&gt; on the Oculus mobile app last month, and it’s used limited Oculus data to target Facebook advertising &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/facebook-ads-vr/"&gt;since 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but this is its first major foray into putting ads inside the Oculus VR platform itself. “Once we see how this test goes and incorporate feedback from developers and the community, we’ll provide more details on when ads may become more broadly available across the Oculus platform and in the Oculus mobile app,” the company said in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="m1bo9b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook has “no plans” to base ads on movement or voice command data&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BszKJB"&gt;As on Facebook’s non-VR apps, you can block specific posts or companies from appearing in ad slots. And Facebook says it’s not changing how it collects or analyzes user information. It says that some of the most sensitive data — like raw images from Oculus headset cameras and weight or height information from Oculus Move fitness tracking — remains solely on users’ devices. Also, Facebook says it has “no plans” to target ads based on movement data or recordings &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301697/oculus-portal-smart-display-hey-facebook-wake-word-quest-headsets"&gt;from its voice assistant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bNcxY"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson says the system &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;use information from your Facebook profile, as well as “whether you’ve viewed content, installed, activated, or subscribed to a Oculus app, added an app to your cart or wishlist, if you’ve initiated checkout or purchased an app on the Oculus platform, and lastly, whether you’ve viewed, hovered, saved, or clicked on an ad within a third-party app.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhO3T2"&gt;As shown above, users can click an ad and either open it or save the link for later. The former option will launch a landing page in the Oculus Quest’s web browser, and the latter will save the ad in the Quest in-VR experience and Oculus mobile app’s Explore sections. Developers will get a share of the revenue from ads in their apps, but Facebook isn’t publicly revealing the percentage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NHlwjb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Later ad formats could be tailored specifically to VR&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XTy4UF"&gt;Facebook is leaving its future roadmap open-ended. The spokesperson says Facebook hasn’t determined, for instance, whether ads could eventually appear inside your Oculus Home experience. Facebook also isn’t yet identifying the other apps using advertisements, although it will list additional names in the coming weeks. The first ads look like standard boxes inside game interfaces, but Facebook’s blog post says it’s exploring other options as well. “We’re currently investing in unobtrusive ads as a new way for developers to build businesses — and though we’re not quite ready to test them yet, we’re also exploring new ad formats that are unique to VR,” it says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgB5Ur"&gt;VR has arguably been an advertising medium for years, with countless film and TV promotional tie-ins as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/14/11214484/mcdonalds-vr-htc-vive-sxsw-2016-capitalist-dystopia"&gt;novelty experiences&lt;/a&gt; from companies like McDonald’s and Ikea. But ad-supported VR apps are using a different model that more closely resembles that of the mobile and web ecosystem. Letting developers integrate advertising could create a greater incentive to work within Facebook’s official ecosystem rather than distributing through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22395923/sidequest-android-app-sideload-oculus-quest-2-virtual-reality-apps-games-experiences"&gt;sideloading options like SideQuest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhdKNK"&gt;Facebook says ads are part of an attempt to figure out profitable business options in the growing but often difficult field of VR app development. “This is a key part of ensuring we’re creating a self-sustaining platform that can support a variety of business models that unlock new types of content and audiences. It also helps us continue to make innovative AR/VR hardware more accessible to more people,” says the blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZTAZpN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ads have always seemed in the cards for Facebook’s super-cheap Quest&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3M668B"&gt;Facebook currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"&gt;dominates consumer VR&lt;/a&gt; with its Oculus Quest 2 headset — which, at $299, is one of the cheapest options on the market. It’s also acquired the studios behind several major VR games, including rhythm game &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22530144/facebook-oculus-studios-acquires-bigbox-vr-population-one"&gt;the battle royale title &lt;em&gt;Population: One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While it may face renewed competition from a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536263/sony-playstation-vr-2-ps5-release-date-2022-samsung-oled"&gt;second-generation Sony PlayStation VR headset&lt;/a&gt; next year, at least one VR company has retreated from consumer hardware in part because of Facebook’s influence: Vive creator HTC, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22417120/htc-vive-focus-3-standalone-vr-headset-price-release-date"&gt;called Facebook’s low-cost consumer headsets&lt;/a&gt; “artificially subsidized” by the company’s advertising-focused business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBz893"&gt;Meanwhile, Facebook has slowly strengthened ties between its central business and Oculus, which it acquired in 2014. It began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375118/oculus-facebook-account-login-data-privacy-controversy-developers-competition"&gt;requiring Facebook logins&lt;/a&gt; for Quest headsets last year, although users can maintain separate profiles and use pseudonyms in VR. Adding advertising isn’t a surprising move for the company — and it’s another signal that Oculus hardware is becoming ever more closely integrated with Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Republicans and Democrats are gearing up to fight tech monopolies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-COMMERCE-SCIENCE-TRANSPORTATION-HEARING" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ieWGsuTufwE6nrxFM0gBzV6ZFFw=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69462650/1232440343.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C4Cp2D"&gt;In a surprise decision Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;President Joe Biden tapped Lina Khan&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most prominent critics of Big Tech, to lead the Federal Trade Commission. In that role, Khan will have the authority to guide the FTC’s agenda — and it’s fair to assume she’ll be taking a hawkish stance toward Big Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKWWMy"&gt;The move is already spooking industry groups, with the conservative Open Competition Center warning Khan would use “antitrust law as a Trojan horse to advance woke goals and policy priorities” — and the tech-backed ITIF saying her agenda would cause “lasting self-inflicted damage” to the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mL1bbA"&gt;But it isn’t just Khan who has the tech industry raising the alarm. Khan’s position at the FTC is just one part of a multipronged antitrust effort from the US government — an effort that’s proceeding along largely bipartisan lines. After years of posturing and confusion, a bipartisan consensus on tech antitrust is finally taking shape across Congress, the Department of Justice, and the FTC — with unpredictable consequences for targets like Facebook and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJrwtB"&gt;Last week, the House Judiciary Committee &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;released a slate of bipartisan bills&lt;/a&gt; to chip away at tech’s power, including measures that would empower the FTC and Justice Department to break up tech firms by forcing them to sell off parts of their businesses that could create conflicts of interest. On Wednesday, Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) went further, saying that the committee would take quick action to move forward on the bills, saying that the package could be marked up as early as next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wV99jn"&gt;Once approved by the committee, the bills would face a vote on the full House floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SRFiG"&gt;There’s also a bipartisan movement in the Senate to pass similar reforms. At a hearing on competition in the smart home market Tuesday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) praised the House’s efforts. Earlier that day, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2021/06/15/klobuchar-starts-work-on-companion-antitrust-bills-795951"&gt;Klobuchar told &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that she would begin work to introduce companion bills in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GH1oUw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We need to use all the tools of government”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5FjGs"&gt;In a Congress that loves to stall radical change, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22319564/filibuster-reform-manchin-democrats-nuclear-option"&gt;largely due to the filibuster&lt;/a&gt;, these sweeping competition reforms are picking up an unusual amount of momentum. At Wednesday’s House press conference on the package, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle — including the most progressive and conservative parts of the parties — called on their colleagues to support the measures. Khan’s nomination was approved bipartisanly in the Senate as well, suggesting there could be broad consensus on these reforms in the upper chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzXjgJ"&gt;That consensus is important for Khan, too, since the FTC can’t push forward on her aggressive agenda without help from Congress. The FTC is still relatively weak in comparison to the large tech firms it’s seeking to regulate, with &lt;a href="https://bigtechnology.substack.com/p/its-ridiculous-underfunded-us-regulators"&gt;less than $350 million a year&lt;/a&gt; compared to the billions that companies like Facebook can spend to protect their business. It will take a full-court press approach from every branch of the government to take on Big Tech, competition experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ummwj6"&gt;“We need to use all the tools of government, and actually add some new tools, to get at this problem,” Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy director for Public Knowledge, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Wednesday. “It’s going to require action at the FTC, Congress, and the DOJ.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9UxviN"&gt;Still, the Biden administration is dragging its feet when it comes to beefing up the Justice Department. Even though Attorney General Merrick Garland was praised by tech critics for his antitrust experience, Biden has yet to nominate anyone to lead the department’s antitrust division. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/01/18/biden-big-tech-antitrust-renata-hesse/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Intercept &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that two attorneys who previously advised tech companies could be tapped for the role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1HSxx"&gt;For now, the FTC has a majority of Democrats at the commission, but this could change in the coming days and weeks. Democratic Commissioner Rohit Chopra was nominated to lead the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, and once confirmed for the role, the agency would be deadlocked yet again. This creates a small window for Khan to take aggressive action before a third Democrat could be confirmed at the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSOmSC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best cheap wireless earbuds to buy in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4hTIXZNPpiQyNL8oPR8bII20auo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67828044/cwelch_20210528_4608_0005.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Spending a little on any of these picks will get you a lot&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="NS3KAj"&gt;As fantastic as products like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;Sony WF-1000XM4, Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, and AirPods Pro are&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn’t take spending over $200 to get a perfectly good set of wireless earbuds. You can even drop below the price level of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus or Jabra’s Elite 75ts and still find something that’ll do the job just fine. For this set of recommendations, I’m going to stick to an MRSP of around $100, give or take $30 in either direction. Odds are at least a few of these picks will go on sale for Amazon Prime Day 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1svWxl"&gt;You can find an endless list of true wireless earbuds under $100 on Amazon from random brands you’ve probably never heard of. But I’m sticking with some tried and true companies that can also be had in retail stores — and are more likely to have established customer support. Just because you’re being sensible about money doesn’t mean you should be left in the lurch if something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isVeDE"&gt;These picks won’t fully match the audio fidelity or deep bench of features of premium earbuds. You’ll give up things like active noise cancellation and wireless charging in severa lcases, but they’re still plenty enjoyable in their own right — and retain a lot of the convenience factor and freedom that make true wireless buds so appealing to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ld4FN1"&gt;The best cheap wireless earbuds for 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="XSyAdn"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Skullcandy Jib True Wireless, pictured on a table, are the best cheap wireless earbuds you can get for $30." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZU4D1FItK_aqVgzRYj8DirN8l9M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22053521/skullcandy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay, so maybe the blue / yellow / red combo looks like it came out of a Happy Meal, but at least there’s also a black option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RcfPyY"&gt;1. Skullcandy Jib True&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1Wt5c7"&gt;Best cheap wireless earbuds for $30&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SoeNT5"&gt;Skullcandy just recently put out its most affordable pair of true wireless earbuds yet. The $29.99 Jib True — available in black or this very attention-getting mix of blue, red, and yellow — manage to deliver a solid mix of specs and serviceable sound quality. Battery life lasts up to six hours, they’ve got the status quo IPX4 sweat resistance rating, and you can use either of the earbuds independently. That last part is something that many more expensive earbuds (hi, Jabra) still don’t offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71tVI6"&gt;The earbud controls aren’t customizable, but Skullcandy packs in &lt;a href="https://support.skullcandy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052905534-Jib-True"&gt;pretty much all of the functions you’d want&lt;/a&gt; (track skip / back, volume, voice assistant, and play / pause) into the large single button on each earbud. They’ve been easy to memorize in my time testing the Jib True buds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUJ1yM"&gt;If there’s one hangup with the Jib True, it’s that Skullcandy hasn’t really optimized them for use with multiple devices. Whereas pricier earbuds tend to remember a handful of pairing sources, the company recommends that you delete these from their current device’s Bluetooth list before repairing with another. It’s not the end of the world, but it’s also fairly inconvenient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X335IA"&gt;As for how they sound, I found that the Jib True made for a solid seal in my ear with the included large-sized tips. This always helps with bass response, and the Jib True definitely put most of their sonic weight behind the bass. It’s to the point where the low end is overemphasized and takes away from the mid- and high-range frequencies. I’m guessing that’s partly intentional since a more neutral sound signature would reveal the inherent weaknesses of $30 earbuds. Acoustic guitars lack warmth, and everything here feels like it’s happening in the middle of your head, so the soundstage is quite narrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frNXSS"&gt;But… 30 bucks, folks. The Jib True earbuds never made me want to rip them out of my ears from audio agony, and I consider that a win. Nor did I run into sync issues when watching videos, and their connectivity proved robust and dependable when walking around busy Brooklyn streets. Perhaps most surprising of all, Skullcandy backs these $30 earbuds with a two-year warranty. If I do have one gripe, it’s that they use a Micro USB connector. We’re supposed to be long past that now, but I can forgive it for the price point. If you’re willing to spend more, stepping up to Skullcandy’s pricier earbuds like the $50 Evo Sesh will get you improved audio and other features like integrated Tile tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3Aa4e7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="VAoORU"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus Buds Z deliver a full sound in a small, affordable package." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rPhEbpBGp3SbOTFb5E-5_HHjuaA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22053533/oneplus.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike the original OnePlus Buds, the OnePlus Buds Z have silicone tips for an in-ear seal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CDNazR"&gt;2. OnePlus Buds Z&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Q3b8I0"&gt;Great cheap wireless earbuds for $50&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zyhYIp"&gt;Jokes about their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435637/us-cbp-counterfeit-airpods-oneplus-buds-mixup"&gt;troubles with customs aside&lt;/a&gt;, I wasn’t enthralled with the original OnePlus Buds. Hard plastic one-size-fits-all earbuds never work out well for me, and these weren’t an exception. But the newer (and less expensive) OnePlus Buds Z, on the other hand, are a much better fit. These ones have traditional silicone tips and sit way more securely in my ears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVbYpz"&gt;Despite their $49.99 price, the OnePlus Buds Z include convenience features like auto-pause when an earbud is removed, and they also support Android’s NFC-based Fast Pair for quick setup. And they’re rated a surprisingly durable IP55 for dust and water resistance, making them a good pick for workouts — as long as you’re okay with no ambient sound mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9q58ky"&gt;Battery life is likely their biggest weakness. OnePlus estimates they can last up to five hours of continuous playback, but I’ve averaged a bit over four hours so far. But you at least get several full recharges from the case, which the company says has 20 hours worth of juice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rpG5H"&gt;The controls are also a bit rudimentary. Out of the box, all you can do is double tap to skip tracks. If you use an Android phone that &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; made by OnePlus, you can install the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.heytap.headset&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;HeyMelody app&lt;/a&gt; to configure the earbuds’ tap controls a bit more; OnePlus phones will let you do this once the earbuds are connected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hr7F7O"&gt;I’ve been quite pleased with how the OnePlus Buds Z sound. They’ve got smaller drivers than the regular OnePlus Buds but still output a nicely rounded audio profile. Again, the emphasis is on bass (and the treble is boosted), but it’s not quite so blatant as with the $30 Skullcandys. Watching videos across a few devices worked fine, and I didn’t have any connectivity problems. Also, unlike the Skullcandys, the OnePlus Buds Z work nicely with more than one device. You can long-press either earbud for three seconds to switch back and forth between the two most recently paired devices. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel Buds A-Series are so good, there’s little reason to get Google’s more expensive earbuds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4wsda2"&gt;Best cheap wireless earbuds for hands-free Google Assistant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yf4cAH"&gt;Google’s Pixel Buds A-Series offer the same sound quality and hands-free “Hey Google” voice commands as the 2020 Pixel Buds for a much lower price. The Google Assistant integration lets you receive audio alerts for incoming notifications and is a convenient way of controlling your music or smart home devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9WrdG"&gt;The Pixel Buds A-Series look very similar to the pricier Pixel Buds, but these earbuds are lighter in your ears and retain the same IPX4 rating for water and sweat resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dP9bMR"&gt;You do give up some conveniences in exchange for the lower price: there’s no wireless charging, nor direct volume controls, and the earbuds still exhibit occasional connection dropouts — though not nearly to the same extent as last year’s Google buds. But the Pixel Buds A-Series preserve the best aspects of the pricier pair, and there’s frankly little reason to upgrade when you can get these for $100.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro are the best cheap earbuds for noise cancellation and voice calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6JHmGR"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323748/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-wireless-headphone-price"&gt;Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="uhRGQ3"&gt;Best cheap noise-canceling earbuds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XrdXY1"&gt;Anker’s Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro improve on the standard model thanks to the inclusion of active noise cancellation. They’ve got a comfortable design, good sound quality, and the mics perform well for voice calls. Anker also includes wireless charging and an IPX4 rating for water and sweat resistance. And you get a ton of ear tips in the box to help find the ideal fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1QEtv"&gt;The Liberty Air 2 Pros can last for up to six hours on a charge with noise cancellation enabled — or seven in situations where you don’t need it. Anker’s robust smartphone app also provides many options for EQ customization, and you can adjust the balance of noise cancellation and ambient sound to your liking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="iLyYB2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gh1ia5"&gt;5. 1More ColorBuds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Nd8ldy"&gt;Best cheap wireless earbuds for style&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7NIyq4"&gt;1More is one of those companies that’s quietly been making great audio products for a long time. With the ColorBuds, the focus is on comfort — each bud weighs only 4.1 grams, barely more than an AirPod — and looks. Sound quality is also a clear step above the previous two picks, with greater clarity, a wider soundstage, and more nuance in general. (There’s still plenty of bass kick, though.) You’d hope for good sound at their $100 price, and these do come through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ox69lp"&gt;Battery life is up to six hours of continuous listening (22 with the case), and the ColorBuds are rated IPX5 for water and sweat resistance. While most of the picks on this list support the standard AAC and SBC Bluetooth codecs, 1More adds Apt-X to the mix on Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXhiYb"&gt;The ColorBuds are available in a handful of attractive colors which, combined with the price and excellent performance, might be enough to sway some people toward them instead of AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UjtTdU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591243"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="vEgPSK"&gt;6. Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Y8OziV"&gt;Best cheap wireless earbuds for voice calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7QRNj1"&gt;Though they press right up against our $100 price ceiling, Anker’s Soundcore Liberty Air 2 remain one of the best pairs of “budget” true wireless earbuds on the market. They’re somewhat AirPods-like in design, thanks to the long stems, but this results in the best microphone performance of anything in this price bracket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlIGzP"&gt;The Liberty Air 2s also have lengthy battery life, lasting for up to seven hours of straight playback. (With the case, you get 28 hours of battery life in total.) Sound quality is enjoyable but falls short of what you’d get with the 1More buds — and Anker’s tap controls can prove a bit finicky at times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OdxZx0"&gt;Best neckband-style cheap wireless earbuds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="89cSQz"&gt;Not everyone loves the concept of earbuds without a wire connecting them, and if that’s you, the recent Beats Flex are a great option — and that still applies for people with Android phones. These $50 “neckbuds” improve upon the older Beats X in several ways: they charge over USB-C instead of Apple’s Lightning connector, they have long-lasting battery life of up to 12 hours, and the built-in microphone is a reliable performer for voice and Zoom calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EOFB5"&gt;The Beats Flex sound better than AirPods and many earbuds at this price range and beyond. They’ve also got a convenient auto-pause feature when you attach the two earbuds together via their magnetic connection. Connectivity is free of any dropouts or other issues, and iPhone owners can expect the usual instant setup process just by bringing the Beats Flex close to their phone. But Beats also has an Android app that lets you customize settings and shows the remaining battery percentage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Y7758"&gt;One downside is that the Flex buds aren’t rated for water or sweat resistance, so I can’t recommend them for the gym. But outside of that, they’re a great pick. Sometimes it’s nice to just let earbuds hang around your neck when not in use instead of fussing with a charging case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aFOzEE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591203"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s WF-XB700 are the best budget wireless earbuds if you can find them on sale. They offer terrific performance, a steady fit, and lengthy battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7V93kL"&gt;8. Sony WF-XB700 earbuds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iNsCq6"&gt;Best cheap wireless earbuds if you love bass&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PpQzHU"&gt;I’m a big fan of Sony’s entry-level true wireless earbuds, the WF-XB700s. I’ve owned a pair for several months now, and I’ve never once had to put up with connection problems, battery frustrations, or other bugs. They also fit better and seal more tightly in my ears than pretty much anything on this list. Your results may vary, but there’s something about the design that works tremendously well with my ears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42EBDX"&gt;The XB700 buds last for up to nine hours of continuous listening and have all the oomph you could ever want. It can border on too much, but Sony does a nice job of not letting the bass take away from everything else. The mids and high frequencies aren’t drowned out. These earbuds stick out of your ears a bit more than most, and they lack any kind of ambient sound mode — which some might see as a negative considering how good the passive noise isolation is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4iNvvN"&gt;I quite like the matte finish on the XB700s and their charging case, and the buds lock into the case with a stronger magnetic pull than is typical; this has always ensured they juice up as expected. They use physical buttons on each earbud for controls, which I prefer over touch gestures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5KybL"&gt;Technically, the Sonys retail for over $100, but they’re on sale for so frequently that they’re still worth a mention. There’s a ton to like about them, even if there’s nothing flashy about them. They’re a great example of Sony keeping things simple and doing it right. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best phone to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12, Galaxy S21 Ultra, Galaxy S21 Plus, iPhone 12 Mini, Galaxy Z Fold 2, and Pixel 4A 5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xXWN-t57Q2UyqQv662Bj9KonMk=/158x0:1883x1150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490961/Best_Phone_Grid_2021_2.7.png" /&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OauOjO"&gt;In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason: even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800. It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLLWfM"&gt;Luckily, if you’re looking for a no-compromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400. For those recommendations, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJpqAH"&gt;A great smartphone will last you for several years (at least), have a great camera, a nice screen, long battery life, and be fast enough to do all the work, social networking, and gaming you want to pack into a day. Believe it or not, all of those things are easier than ever to find in a phone — so picking the best one is often a matter of degrees or preferences. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DK8L4P"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WnjecW"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wW82H0"&gt;Apple has released four different variations of the iPhone 12, more than it ever has at one time. Despite all of those choices, the traditional, regular model is still a good pick. The regular iPhone 12, which starts at around $830 for a 64GB model, is the best smartphone for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VycfOO"&gt;The 12 has the same overall design, the same processor, the same wireless charging, the same Face ID system, the same 5G support, the same front camera, and the same main and wide-angle rear cameras as the pricier 12 Pro but for hundreds of dollars less. On top of all that, it comes in five colors, one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wUSPTz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 12 balances a big screen with manageable size well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vgfddW"&gt;Compared to the iPhone 12 mini, the iPhone 12 has a noticeably roomier display and a bigger battery — two things that are important to many people. At 6.1 inches, it’s big enough to make watching video and reading text comfortable and engaging, but it isn’t so big that it’s terribly hard to use in one hand or fit in your pocket. Battery life is also very good; you can reliably expect this phone to last all day without needing to charge up before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CpBRz"&gt;The 12 gives up the telephoto camera that’s available on the 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, but that’s something not everyone will miss. The iPhone 12’s camera system is the best you can get in this price range and is excellent at most anything you’d use it for. It also has the ability to shoot Dolby Vision HDR for brighter and more dynamic video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaJMCS"&gt;Since the 12 has Apple’s latest smartphone processor, the A14 Bionic, it has extremely fast performance and fluid animations. It also has a sleeker, more modern design than the previous iPhone 11 or iPhone XR, which feel frumpy in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4Yr6F"&gt;The base iPhone 12 comes with 64GB of storage, but as usual with an iPhone, it’s not expandable, so we recommend buying the 128GB model for only $50 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qsBso"&gt;In all, the iPhone 12 is an easy choice for most people: it offers top-level performance, design, and camera features, while providing reliable battery life for less money than other options on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GxgXJO"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KXRoWF"&gt;If neither size nor price is a concern, the best Android phone you can buy right now is the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. With a big 6.8-inch screen and the best cameras you can get on an Android phone, it’s the no-compromise pick. In some cases, its cameras can even best the iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc0tSW"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra comes with the latest and best specs you can get on Android. It has the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is the fastest you can get on Android. It features support for S Pen styluses if you prefer to use a pen with your phone, although it’s sold separately. The screen has a high refresh rate, which makes scrolling much smoother. It also has a huge battery that will last two days without much effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNdn1U"&gt;Samsung updated the design of the S21 Ultra, with a metal rail that curves naturally into the camera bump on the back. It is the best-looking big phone you can get right now. However, we can’t say we like Samsung’s software as much, which at the moment is a bit cluttered and features ads in places like the weather app. For a sleeker experience the OnePlus 9 Pro would be a good choice; the Ultra beats it on screen and camera quality, but it’s a good device all-around and offers a more grown-up take on Android OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOuzp6"&gt;That camera bump houses four cameras: a regular wide-angle with a 108-megapixel sensor, an ultrawide, and two different telephoto lenses. This makes it an incredibly versatile camera system that also has a ton of advanced video features like Pro modes and 8K recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b68lAw"&gt;Starting at $1,199.99, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a very expensive phone. Thankfully, Samsung phones are discounted early and often. If you are in the market for one, it’s worth looking around for a deal before buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="bwT4eg"&gt;Although the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus don’t post the big numbers the S21 Ultra does, they are still our picks right now for best Android phones under a thousand bucks. The regular Galaxy S21 with a 6.2-inch screen starts at $800 while the Plus version with a 6.7-inch screen starts at $1,000. However, both are frequently discounted with either price drops or bundles, so these are great candidates for hunting down sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7grLVJ"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus are essentially identical phones with three differences: screen size, battery size, and materials. We’ve reviewed the regular Galaxy S21 and found it to be a very competent phone even though you could argue it’s a minor refresh over last year’s Galaxy S20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EbSGE"&gt;However, Samsung refreshed the important part: the processor is the same Snapdragon 888 as the Ultra. That means the Galaxy S21 is super fast and should last more than a couple of years without slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvvhF"&gt;There are likely more great Android phones coming soon but right now, the Android phone that strikes the best balance of features and price is the S21.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max is huge, but it has the best camera system on a smartphone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QzSdip"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FUQpEY"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G0d3Pt"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best camera system you can currently get on a smartphone. Its three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, even in poor lighting. If camera quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 12 Pro Max is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCe5L2"&gt;The big difference between the 12 Pro Max and the other iPhone 12 models is found in its main camera sensor. The 12 Pro Max has a physically larger camera sensor that allows it to gather more light and produce better-quality images when in dark or challenging lighting conditions. In addition, the 12 Pro Max has an improved image stabilization system that helps keep your images sharp as light levels drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IjBeK"&gt;But unless camera quality is all you care about, the 12 Pro Max isn’t the best iPhone for most people. It’s enormous, and the squared sides make it feel even bigger than its spec sheet implies. Most people will be happier with the smaller but still large-screened iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini is small enough to be used in one hand by almost anybody.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hvSkHC"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IZTX1K"&gt;Best small smartphone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="n8BP66"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 12 mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 12 mini is one of very few small phones on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNVbxg"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em0efZ"&gt;Otherwise, the mini is the same phone as the iPhone 12: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KsgWM"&gt;If you prefer Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;Asus Zenfone 8&lt;/a&gt; is a good alternative. It’s a little bigger than the 12 mini with a 5.9-inch screen, and it doesn’t work on Verizon, but it’s otherwise a very similar proposition: great build quality, top-notch processor, and high-end features like a 120Hz screen all tucked into a pocket-friendly device.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MPtDpR"&gt;If you want a stylus built into your phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="efDFTK"&gt;If you’re looking for the best phone to go from morning to night with heavy use and last through it all, Samsung’s top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the one to get. It has a massive 4,500mAh battery that keeps its enormous 6.9-inch screen going as long as you need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3wWez"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is also a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant screen supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions; its triple rear camera system is one of the most advanced you can get; and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM allow it to perform without a hiccup. In addition, it supports Samsung’s S Pen for stylus input, allowing you to write or doodle on the screen with a pen instead of your finger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6gOEi"&gt;Although you can now use a stylus with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, it isn’t built into the phone as it is here on the Note 20 Ultra. Depending on Samsung’s plans, this may be the last “Ultra” version of the Note, too — though rumors have been conflicting on that front. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 is a step down from the 9 Pro, but it only gives up a few features at a significantly lower price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ofDQRV"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZJWuDD"&gt;If you want an excellent ultrawide camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uUgURs"&gt;The OnePlus 9 is the step-down model from the OnePlus 9 Pro, which is itself an excellent phone. But you don’t give up too much by opting for the 9, and you save a ton of money. Like the 9 Pro, it offers great performance with a Snapdragon 888 processor, fast 65W wired charging, and something that will appeal especially to the landscape photographers out there: a great ultrawide camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qa2S7w"&gt;The sensor behind the OnePlus 9’s ultrawide camera is physically larger than most and offers a healthy 50-megapixel resolution. A unique lens design corrects distortion without introducing the funhouse mirror-type stretching you’ll often see in the corners of ultrawide images. And if super-wide photography isn’t your thing, know that the main camera turns in solid image quality, too. Images are well-exposed, and colors look pleasantly vibrant. OnePlus makes a big deal of the Hasselblad color science at work here, which does a fine job but isn’t as mind-blowingly good as the company suggests.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O804KE"&gt;Unfortunately, you do miss out on a couple of good camera features opting for the 9 rather than the 9 Pro. The main camera on the 9 Pro offers optical image stabilization, which isn’t included on the 9, and is useful for its ability to keep subjects looking sharp in lower light conditions. There’s also no telephoto lens — just digital zoom, which isn’t as good as the 9 Pro’s optical zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxzBBh"&gt;The OnePlus 9 also doesn’t work on AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network. (It works on both T-Mobile and Verizon’s 5G networks, however.) That’s no great loss right now (honestly, it might be for the better), but in a couple of years, this will probably become a downside. Bearing this in mind and a couple of camera feature omissions, the OnePlus 9 is an excellent device. It offers a flagship feel and performance for a bit less than the highest-end Android options and a seriously good ultrawide camera for wide-angle photo fans.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A52 5G offers a large 6.5-inch screen with 120Hz refresh rate, a feature that’s not too common yet in the midrange class.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="z3SklF"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7spKRS"&gt;Best cheap phone with high-end features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gfmz0Z"&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G is our current pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;best Android phone under $500&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s also worth highlighting here for its combination of features usually reserved for premium devices and a reasonable price. You won’t get all the bells and whistles of the S21 series phones, of course, but the A52 5G includes a 6.5-inch screen with fast 120Hz refresh rate, an IP67 water resistance rating, and (for now, at least) access to monthly bug fixes and security updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rl0lbP"&gt;The A52 5G delivers on the basics too. Its Snapdragon 750G processor isn’t the fastest in the game but it keeps up well with day-to-day tasks. Its 4,500mAh battery delivers well over a day of moderate to heavy use. And the phone supports sub-6GHz 5G, which will allow it to take advantage of improving 5G networks in the US over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5qamU"&gt;Then there’s the typically Samsung-y stuff, including a UI that’s currently trending toward over-cluttered with the occasional unwelcome ad. The phone’s camera hardware is good, though photos tend to look a little oversaturated, which may or may not suit your taste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcPo00"&gt;One of the phone’s best features is Samsung’s commitment to providing four years of security updates. Overall, it’s a relatively affordable device with a solid feature set that should keep up for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixel 4A is the best Android phone under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yteQuG"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WMeIkj"&gt;Best Android phone under $400&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cBeDqy"&gt;If you’re on a budget and prefer Android, then the Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice. It doesn’t have the largest screen or the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android that’s guaranteed to get software updates for at least three years. It only comes in one version: black with 128GB of storage for $349.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZEqw2"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special. It means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZsgOa"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ftzlw6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sUP4Y7"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $400. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 is expensive, extravagant, and the easiest way to fit a tablet-sized screen into your pocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mre8Bq"&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4x700N"&gt;Best folding phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JDL8H8"&gt;Folding phones have been around for less than two years and have already seen their share of controversies. But if you are interested in buying one and are willing to pay the hefty price required, there’s really only one model worth considering: Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Mbw2f"&gt;The Fold 2 is Samsung’s second-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a normal smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books to browsing the web to watching video to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 2 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, and its outside screen is much smaller than what you’re probably used to. It is also delicate; there’s no rated dust or water resistance, and its inner screen is more likely to get damaged if you poke it too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rta9KS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3cHb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: the Fold 2 is roughly twice as expensive as other high-end phones. Since it debuted for $2,000, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364162/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-5g-price-cut-announced-1800"&gt;permanently marked down by $200&lt;/a&gt;, but you’re still paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xA969T"&gt;If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else, though, the Fold 2 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iahfYJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKGbug"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Podcasts start coming to Facebook next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DRoyqGercObThBfX7AGR-INk8zw=/0x0:1590x1060/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69462339/facebookpodcasts.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BZ5xSl"&gt;Facebook is planning to start rolling out its podcast product next week, on June 22nd, and, eventually, add a feature that’ll allow listeners to create clips from their favorite shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUX02w"&gt;According to an email sent to podcast page owners and viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, hosts can link their show’s RSS feed up to Facebook, which will then automatically generate News Feed posts for all episodes published moving forward. These episodes will show up on a “podcasts” tab that doesn’t appear to be live yet, but that the company teased in a wider announcement about audio initiatives &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391551/facebook-audio-podcasts-clubhouse-competitor-spotify-live-rooms"&gt;in April&lt;/a&gt;. (You can see it below.) &lt;em&gt;Podnews&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://podnews.net/update/podcast-ads-vs-tv-ads"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; the date earlier this month, and at the time, Facebook confirmed with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that a limited number of page owners would have access. However, emails are still being sent to additional page owners, suggesting the rollout might be wider than initially anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="883Lfd"&gt;“Facebook will be the place where people can enjoy, discuss, and share the podcasts they love with each other,” the company says in this email.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nfP0MQvs8OGeevlTQKNWZK8ei74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455083/Podcasts_Listening.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pages will eventually have a tab for podcasts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ROIuHo"&gt;Podcasters who publish on the platform will also be opting into Facebook’s podcast terms of service, which you can &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/podcast_terms"&gt;view here&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a relatively standard agreement, although it doesn’t have clear limits around what exactly Facebook can do with the podcasts distributed on its platform. For example, it grants Facebook the rights to make derivative works, which may be necessary for distributing shows in certain formats, but also might alarm podcasters who are protective over their IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtQjQw"&gt;Along with the option to distribute their show through Facebook, podcasters can decide whether to enable clips, which the company says will be created by listeners and last up to one minute in length. These “may help increase visibility and engagement.” Presumably, these will be easily shareable outside of the podcaster’s page. Short-form clips have been a key way for Twitch streamers to share moments from their lengthy streams, and Facebook seems to hope the same idea can apply to podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the pop-up podcasters will see when they go to add their show’s RSS feed to Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HYKFbi"&gt;It’s unclear how Facebook is determining what pages belong to podcasters. My page, for example, received the option to publish &lt;em&gt;Why’d You Push That Button?&lt;/em&gt;, a show I co-host. I have only published links to webpages that have the show embedded, however, not the actual link to my podcast episode or RSS feed. I’ve reached out to Facebook for comment and will update if I hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MELnFX"&gt;Broadly, though, this update comes as the company begins a legitimate push into audio. Mark Zuckerberg hosted the first Live Audio Room in the US yesterday, and in April, the company also announced plans for a feature called Soundbites, which will live within the News Feed. The idea behind Soundbites is to give users a “sound studio in your pocket” and allow them to create short, shareable clips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wdq5y"&gt;With podcasts, Facebook is seemingly banking on the fact that podcasters already use the platform to foster conversation with their listeners and to promote their shows. Directly publishing to the platform might make it easier for them to accomplish those goals while also giving people a reason to never leave the Facebook app. It’s also possible Facebook sees potential in podcast advertising, which Spotify has focused its efforts on as it launches exclusive shows and its own ad network. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon confirms it removed RavPower, a popular phone battery and charger brand </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H7Aqxw"&gt;One month ago, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"&gt;Amazon-first gadget brands Aukey and Mpow suddenly and mysteriously disappeared&lt;/a&gt; from the giant online retailer’s storefront, with almost all their electronics vanishing from Amazon’s shelves. Today, popular battery and charger brand RavPower has completely disappeared as well — and Amazon now confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was the one that removed RavPower from its store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fpIGa"&gt;Amazon hasn’t yet said why it took the action, but it’s not hard to imagine what happened here. On Sunday, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fake-reviews-and-inflated-ratings-are-still-a-problem-for-amazon-11623587313"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s Nicole Nguyen ran a story&lt;/a&gt; about how her new RavPower charger included an offer for a $35 gift card in exchange for a review, something that Amazon confirmed was a violation of company policy. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/3/13155578/amazon-incentivized-reviews-ban-vine-program-product-bias"&gt;banned incentivized reviews&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. Nguyen tweeted about RavPower’s removal earlier today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lI7yDz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Following my fake review story, listings for Amazon-native electronics brand RAVPower are gone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company offered $35 gift cards for reviews on a product that was sold directly by Amazon itself. RAVPower acted as a wholesale vendor on that listing.&lt;a href="https://t.co/6nazZZ5Wtb"&gt;https://t.co/6nazZZ5Wtb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/znp9u48YHV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/znp9u48YHV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— nicole nguyen (@nicnguyen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nicnguyen/status/1405202548760334339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ymIKjk"&gt;As a result, all of RavPower’s product listings have disappeared, leaving blank white spaces in the company’s Amazon storefront. Searches for “RavPower” don’t bring up any listings for products made by the company. Existing links to RavPower products either point to Amazon’s “Sorry, we couldn’t find that page” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/16/17577654/amazon-prime-day-website-down-deals-service-disruption"&gt;cute 404 dogs&lt;/a&gt;, or listings that read “Currently unavailable.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jOz0exolfEqLyA0V0e5YMvXZKWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662870/ravpower_amaozn_3.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;RavPower’s seller page is still up, but it’s empty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zs6aQB"&gt;By and large, this is exactly what happened to Aukey, Mpow, and other lesser-known electronics retailers last month — except here, Amazon has been a bit more thorough. You can actually still find a couple of Aukey listings on Amazon, while RavPower seems to have none. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbVUe2"&gt;Another important difference may be that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravpower.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F16%2F22536976%2Famazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RavPower has its own separate online shop&lt;/a&gt; that ranks high in Google search, so it may not strictly need to depend on Amazon. RavPower didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PL6D6V"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"&gt;would not tell us last month&lt;/a&gt; if it actually removed Aukey and Mpow, merely giving us a generic statement that suggested it generally suspends sellers that violate “the integrity of our store.” At the time, Aukey and Mpow didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEEseZ"&gt;Fake, inflated, paid, and other forms of scammy reviews run rampant on Amazon (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;other online platforms&lt;/a&gt;, to be fair), and I see suspicious-looking cards in my random Amazon purchases all the time. It’s weird to think that RavPower would need to stoop to this behavior, though: we’ve regularly featured good products that the company makes, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;our favorite wireless charging pad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8ctEj"&gt;Amazon is actively trying to clamp down on this kind of fraud, though it’s not always successful. &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/how-amazon-works/creating-a-trustworthy-reviews-experience"&gt;In a Wednesday blog post&lt;/a&gt; that explains some of its enforcement efforts, the company says it “stopped more than 200 million suspected fake reviews before they were ever seen by a customer” in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
