    <title>The FCC’s still in a stalemate a year into Biden’s presidency</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tmkiI1"&gt;After nearly a year into Joe Biden’s presidency, new pressure is mounting on the Senate to expeditiously confirm nominations for positions at two of the federal government’s top agencies with control over broadband and data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDGCMl"&gt;In new statements issued on Monday, public interest groups Free Press Action and Fight for the Future called on the Senate Commerce Committee to fill the final seats at the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. Both Gigi Sohn and Alvaro Bedoya, for the FCC and FTC, respectively, have finished their confirmation hearing processes, but neither nomination has received a final committee vote to set them up for floor confirmation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6itOiX"&gt;“Americans are in desperate need of these consumer protection agencies as their dependence on affordable access to the open Internet has grown during the pandemic,” &lt;a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2022-01-10-senate-democrats-need-to-stop-dragging-their-feet-on-fcc-and-ftc-nominations/"&gt;Fight for the Future said in a statement on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. “Industry insiders have openly admitted that they are pushing for these delays because it benefits their bottom line, at the expense of the public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3tgbU"&gt;With open seats at these agencies, the FCC and FTC are unable to press forward on any partisan measures or Democratic policy priorities, like net neutrality. Late last year, Jessica Rosenworcel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787261/biden-fcc-net-neutrality-jessica-rosenworcel-gigi-sohn-broadband"&gt;was confirmed as FCC chair&lt;/a&gt;, but no votes have been lined up for Sohn, Biden’s pick as the last remaining Democratic commissioner. Democratic FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra stepped down from the agency after he was confirmed to lead the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau in October, leaving the FTC at a 2-2 deadlock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2BfPD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/04/nominations-sent-to-the-senate-54/"&gt;Biden renominated Sohn and Bedoya on January 4th&lt;/a&gt;, setting the nominations up for further consideration by the Senate Commerce Committee. &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2022/01/10/antitrust-enforcers-are-drowning-in-mergers-799773"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Politico &lt;/em&gt;on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, the committee plans to vote on nominees on January 24th, and the markup may include Sohn and Bedoya, but the final agenda has not been released as of publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TOoiRQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s no time to waste”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TBS5Bd"&gt;“There’s no time to waste and so much to get done at the FCC: ensuring the billions being invested in broadband actually reach those who need it most, restoring Net Neutrality and Title II, reckoning with media regulators’ history on race and repairing the damage of the Trump years,” Craig Aaron, Free Press Action co-CEO, said in a Monday statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PA2Ec3"&gt;As FCC and FTC nominations saw some movement in the Senate last year, Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-media-censor-for-the-fcc-gigi-sohn-joe-biden-nominee-11636408804"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;editorial board&lt;/a&gt; argued that Sohn was a telecom policy extremist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27p3VK"&gt;“Gigi Sohn is a complete political ideologue who has disdain for conservatives. She would be a complete nightmare for the country when it comes to regulating the public airwaves,” Graham said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1458222266395811849?s=20"&gt;in a tweet thread last November&lt;/a&gt;. “I will do everything in my power to convince colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject this extreme nominee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsGsnj"&gt;So long as every Senate Democrat, including Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), votes in favor of both Sohn and Bedoya, no Republican support would be necessary to confirm them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otTWl1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izA6yL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM finally bends the knee to California’s authority to set vehicle pollution rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Freeway Construction" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L4KCWe5jgghc2CqJrRK51pKUcNs=/101x0:5900x3866/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370221/1237448695.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o2kftz"&gt;General Motors isn’t done wiping the egg off its face from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21026865/general-motors-ev-day-trump-emissions-rollback-climate-crisis"&gt;misguided decision to back then-President Donald Trump’s failed effort&lt;/a&gt; to take away California’s ability to set fuel efficiency standards. In a letter sent to the state’s governor today, the automaker said it “recognizes California’s authority to set vehicle emissions standards” under the Clean Air Act and offers itself up an EV supplier for the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ox1i2W"&gt;This represents a reversal of GM’s position three years ago, when it joined Fiat Chrysler and Toyota in supporting the Trump administration’s escalating battle with the state over vehicle emission rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qetMHf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a reversal of GM’s position from three years ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RmiuxP"&gt;Under the Clean Air Act, California has historically been allowed to set its own emissions standards, which are tougher than federal guidelines and typically set the bar for the entire auto industry in the US. California is the largest auto market in the US and the 10th largest in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6blrht"&gt;

&lt;iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" title="Governor Gavin Newsom 1.09.22" src="https://www.scribd.com/embeds/552080508/content?start_page=1&amp;amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;amp;access_key=key-RPOOQCBwMYWNf7hgABsN" data-auto-height="false" data-aspect-ratio="0.7729220222793488" scrolling="no" id="doc_31037" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H5GwTZ"&gt;After Trump declared his intention to roll back the Obama-era fuel economy standards, California stated that it would go its own course and keep enforcing the earlier, stricter standards. Trump sued the state, prompting the auto industry to take sides in the legal battle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGyinm"&gt;Nearly two dozen states &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272179/attorneys-general-sue-trump-administration-fuel-efficiency-standard-rollback"&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; the Trump administration in response and other major car companies balked at the administration’s attempt to roll back the fuel efficiency mandate. While GM and a few others supported Trump, Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, and BMW all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20727261/trump-emissions-rollback-ford-volkswagon-honda-bmw-california-deal"&gt;sided with California&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ajVhFQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;But after Trump’s defeat, the effort was essentially moot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qomGnU"&gt;But after Trump’s defeat, the effort was essentially moot. President Joe Biden announced his own plan to hasten a transition to electric vehicles in an effort to combat climate change — and GM scrambled to get on board. Two weeks after Trump’s loss, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611607/gm-trump-california-car-emission-pollution-biden-fuel-efficiency-standards"&gt;GM renounced its support for the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; and called on other automakers to join it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhzIec"&gt;Now, the company is furthering its efforts to get on California’s good side, and it seems to be working. The state has agreed to add GM to its list of auto manufacturers to consider for fleet vehicle purchases. This is important especially as GM releases new electric work vehicles, such as the BrightDrop delivery vans and the Chevy Silverado EV pickup truck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxF0Tc"&gt;“GM is joining California in our fight for clean air and emission reduction as part of the company’s pursuit of a zero-emissions future,” Newsom said in a statement. “This agreement will help accelerate California’s nation-leading commitment to tackling the climate crisis. We welcome GM in our clean vehicle revolution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1IAJFD"&gt;GM has said it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;stop selling gas-powered vehicles by 2040&lt;/a&gt; and has committed to spend $35 billion on electric and autonomous vehicles by 2025. California has said it wants to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;ban the sale &lt;/a&gt;of new internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035. To date, 14 other states have &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/nevada-california-zero-emission-vehicle-standards/#:~:text=More%20EVs%20for%20Nevada.&amp;amp;text=This%20decade%2C%20Nevada%20will%20become,%2C%20climate%2Dfriendly%20future.%22"&gt;adopted its progressive zero-emission vehicle program&lt;/a&gt; for passenger vehicles, which was launched in the early 1990s and has spurred automakers into developing hybrid and fully electric cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7E5rHt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LinkedIn to launch audio events later this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="LinkedIn logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BnfqTUuzRKqHGU1wvuCamhHF5Vg=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70369916/1237155405.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;LinkedIn is planning audio events | Photo by Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8tpXLK"&gt;The live &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;audio feature LinkedIn confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it was working on last year will reportedly debut later this month in beta as part of the company’s new events platform. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11920938/microsoft-linkedin-acquisition-why-report"&gt;Microsoft-owned LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; said last March that it was doing “early tests to create a unique audio experience connected to your professional identity.” According to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/linkedin-is-launching-interactive-clubhouse-style-audio-events-this-month-in-beta-a-video-version-will-come-this-spring/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, LinkedIn’s all-virtual events platform will eventually include moderated panel-style discussions, roundtables, and fireside chats, with the formats left up to the event hosts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8crZqE"&gt;The virtual events will be built on LinkedIn’s in-house tools, and event participants will potentially be able to converse with each other during and after the live events. The video version is expected to be available later in the spring. &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;reports that unlike other companies with audio chat features, such as Twitter’s Spaces, LinkedIn doesn’t plan to include ticketed events, where organizers could charge for access. LinkedIn didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cluF4V"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380290/clubhouse-social-audio-twitter-facebook-platforms"&gt;Clubhouse drew in a big audience&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic with its invite-only audio events (it’s now open to all, even without an invitation to join), it’s been overshadowed in recent months by competitors from established social platforms. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187490/twitter-spaces-test-voice-chat-rooms"&gt;Twitter began testing its Spaces&lt;/a&gt; to a limited audience in December of 2020 (and made it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739249/twitter-finally-letting-everyone-create-spaces"&gt;more widely available&lt;/a&gt; last year); Spotify introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22535214/spotify-greenroom-locker-room-live-audio-app"&gt;its live audio app, Greenroom&lt;/a&gt;, and Facebook added its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22540508/facebook-live-audio-rooms-clubhouse-rival-spaces-greenhouse"&gt;Live Audio Rooms&lt;/a&gt; in June; and Discord &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;launched its Stage Channels&lt;/a&gt; last March.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snag a Sonos Beam 2 refurbished for almost $50 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_TK5EC_EnBu7NhQPOvN4pP9103M=/0x0:1903x1269/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70369479/cwelch_290921_4780_5699.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qNfMRW"&gt;Last year, Sonos raised its prices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667044/sonos-speaker-price-increases-announce-september-12"&gt;for some of its most popular products&lt;/a&gt; due to the pandemic’s negative effect on the supply chain. But one of its latest releases, the Sonos Beam 2 soundbar in white, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoeDa42cbI" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is almost $50 off&lt;/a&gt; when you buy refurbished at Best Buy right now. It comes with a 90-day warranty via Best Buy, and the Beam 2 includes all original accessories, including the soundbar itself, a power cable, an HDMI 2.0 cable, and a Sonos optical audio adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxkkN6"&gt;Sonos touts Dolby Atmos as being the Beam 2’s big spec upgrade over the first-generation model. But my colleague Chris Welch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701137/sonos-beam-gen-2-atmos-soundbar-review-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;stated in his review&lt;/a&gt; that Atmos shouldn’t be the sole reason why you buy it. It does feature wider, more expansive sound than the first iteration, but it’s the sleeker design (ditching fabric for cleaner-looking perforated plastic), and the addition of HDMI eARC, enabling Atmos and eliminating video and audio sync issues that plagued the first-gen Beam, that make this one worth checking out. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701137/sonos-beam-gen-2-atmos-soundbar-review-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z69mir"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10970437"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dvBeDf"&gt;Amazon’s tiny Echo Show 5 (2021 version) is back down to the best-ever price that we last saw during Black Friday. It originally sold for $84.99 (though it’s usually always cheaper than that), but you can pick it up at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoeZhdn3Ym" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-5-2nd-Gen-2021-release/dp/B08J8FFJ8H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $44.99. This is an affordable way to connect to friends and family with its built-in camera or to listen to music and hear the news read aloud to you by Alexa. What’s more, both sites are offering a Blink Mini smart camera (usually $34.99) for just $5 on top of the cost of the Echo Show 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fHKUHP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873822"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n0QXSQ"&gt;If you missed out on some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22825859/ps5-best-games-playstation-5-sony-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best PS5 games of 2021&lt;/a&gt; (as well as some that came out closer to the console’s November 2020 launch), you can save on several right now. Some retailers are offering discounts on disc copies of games like &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Returnal&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Tsushima-Directors-Cut-PlayStation-5/dp/B098G34GBT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and more. Additionally, Sony is matching most (but not all) of these deals with its sale on digital games, which is convenient if you have the PS5 digital version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q5fhdX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="RyvfUJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10687661"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Take-Two Interactive to acquire social game developer Zynga in $12.7 billion deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Zynga logo seen outside the top corner of the building on Tuesday, May 28, 2019 in San Francisco, Calif.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EEQY9y"&gt;Take-Two Interactive, the video game publisher that owns Rockstar and 2K Games, is &lt;a href="https://ir.take2games.com/news-releases/news-release-details/take-two-and-zynga-combine-bringing-together-best-class"&gt;set to acquire&lt;/a&gt; social game developer Zynga in a deal valued at $12.7 billion (via &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/videogame-maker-take-two-interactive-to-buy-zynga-in-12-7-billion-deal-11641818298"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The cash and stock transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023, pending regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvPgRW"&gt;Take-Two Interactive’s acquisition of Zynga marks the company’s foray into the mobile game market. Take-Two is behind some of the most well-known game series, including &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UPMKwY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Take-Two’s $12.7 billion acquisition is one of the biggest in video game history&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IuMoTW"&gt;Meanwhile, Zynga has a pretty impressive portfolio of its own, defining a genre by planting some of its earliest games, like &lt;em&gt;FarmVille&lt;/em&gt;, on Facebook. The mobile game developer also created the ultra-popular &lt;em&gt;Words With Friends, &lt;/em&gt;which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/2/15504996/zynga-words-with-friends-facebook-messenger"&gt;eventually made its way to Messenger&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also set to roll out an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679557/snapchat-games-revamp-zynga-among-us-clone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;-like game on Snapchat, called &lt;em&gt;Revamp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5qqSP"&gt;“Combining Zynga’s expertise in mobile and next-generation platforms with Take-Two’s best-in-class capabilities and intellectual property will enable us to further advance our mission to connect the world through games,” said Frank Gibeau, the CEO of Zynga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xwYr9"&gt;Take-Two’s $12.7 billion acquisition is one of the biggest in video game history, by a pretty big margin — ahead of even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;Microsoft’s $7.5 billion purchase of Bethesda&lt;/a&gt;, which was finalized last March, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/21/11986712/tencent-supercell-softbank-majority-stake-acquisition"&gt;Tencent’s $8.57 billion acquisition of a majority stake in Supercell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lbi2wH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor announces the Magic V, its first foldable smartphone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/skD0J9sSG0ptJskU5JJts_kogs0=/0x0:1358x905/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70369188/d81jWLiA_cropped.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honor’s new foldable, the Magic V.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Honor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vRv9FC"&gt;Former Huawei sub-brand Honor has just announced its first foldable smartphone, the Honor Magic V. It uses a similar folding form factor to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold devices, combining a large internal folding display with a smaller external display that can be used while the device is folded. Today is the foldable’s Chinese launch, where its price starts at ¥9,999 (around $1,569) for its 256GB storage model. It will go on open sale on January 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puGB6W"&gt;The Magic V’s flagship feature, its internal folding screen, measures 7.9 inches from corner to corner, has a resolution of 2272 x 1984 with a refresh rate of 90Hz, and an aspect ratio of 10:9. That’s slightly bigger than Samsung’s Z Fold 3, whose internal screen is 7.6 inches with a resolution of 2208 x 1768. Honor says the Magic V’s internal screen is like using two 21:9 screens side by side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWMekK"&gt;The Magic V’s external screen is also slightly larger than the Z Fold 3 at 6.45 inches (compared to 6.2 for Samsung), with a resolution of 2560 x 1080, a 120Hz refresh rate, and a 21:9 aspect ratio. Honor says this will help make the device more usable when you don’t want to unfold it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pqAqKnxfPipygOI4i1AW1A6XFeo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23158005/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_12.32.15_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Honor&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honor Magic V in orange.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M4iOVM251Pj5YM_WPRwb-g8SZHc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23158009/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_12.29.52_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Honor&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honor’s foldable, folded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jym1Eh"&gt;When folded, the Magic V measures 72.7mm wide, 14.3mm thick, and has a height of 160.4mm, and when unfolded it expands to 141.1mm wide and is 6.7mm thick. That’s slightly wider than Samsung’s latest Z Fold, while being slightly thinner overall when folded. Honor’s foldable is slightly heavier, however. It’s available in three colors: orange, silver, and black, and Honor CEO George Zhao says it should survive being folded and unfolded 200,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hr0esu"&gt;Internally, the Magic V is running Qualcomm’s latest chipset, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, which is paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB or 512GB of storage. It’s got a 4,750mAh battery that can be charged at up to 66W, which gives you a 50 percent charge in 15 minutes. It’s 5G compatible and is running Honor’s Magic UI 6.0 software on top of Android 12, which supports the display of multiple app windows at the same time, Honor says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNoWvQ"&gt;In terms of cameras, Honor has included a trio of 50-megapixel sensors on the rear of the foldable, which include a main sensor, an ultrawide camera, and something Honor is calling a “spectrum enhanced camera.” We’ve followed up with the company for details on what exactly this third camera does. The Magic V has a pair of 42-megapixel selfie cameras, one embedded in the outer display, and one embedded in the inner folding screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NjOIA"&gt;Honor joins an increasingly long list of companies that have either announced or have started to sell foldable smartphones. Most recently, we saw Oppo announce its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837149/oppo-find-n-hands-on-announcement-specs-price"&gt;Find N&lt;/a&gt; late last year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;Honor’s former parent company Huawei&lt;/a&gt; also have foldable devices of their own. We’ve followed up with Honor to find out if, or when, the Magic V might see a global release. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked images show new Surface Go 3 matte black option</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z2BjSvoPFGwidlP2k4pS6OK7dsM=/477x0:3000x1682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70369170/surfacego3black.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jjsCrw"&gt;Microsoft appears to be readying a matte black version of the Surface Go 3. Leaked images from Aggiornamenti Lumia &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ALumia_Italia"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; show the 10.5-inch Surface Go 3 with a new matte black finish. The device looks identical to the Surface Go 3 otherwise, and the marketing images could suggest a launch is imminent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTwhXs"&gt;Microsoft first launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684608/microsoft-surface-go-3-processor-specs-price-features"&gt;Surface Go 3 in September&lt;/a&gt;, with new Intel processor options. The Surface Go 3 can be configured with an Intel Pentium Gold 6500Y or Core i3-10100Y, upgrades over the Surface Go 2, which launched with a Pentium Gold 4425Y or a Core m3 chip. Little else changed with the Surface Go 3 over the previous model, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aJABD6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/q10SpNcK5o"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q10SpNcK5o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Aggiornamenti Lumia (@ALumia_Italia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ALumia_Italia/status/1480474084253343747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3Txnxm"&gt;LTE versions of the Surface Go 3 are expected to arrive very soon, as Microsoft originally promised in September that these models would appear “in the coming months.” A matte black version could complement the launch of LTE versions of the Surface Go 3, alongside what’s expected to be a bumper year for Surface. Microsoft is set to celebrate 10 years of Surface with multiple product refreshes throughout 2022, according to sources familiar with the company’s plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15RqyG"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Microsoft-Surface-Tablet-Windows-Platinum/dp/B093X5LJJM?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon listing in Germany&lt;/a&gt; also includes images of the matte black Surface Go 3, alongside a specification list that suggests it will ship with Intel’s Core i3 processor, 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and LTE connectivity. Amazon lists a release date of January 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxS2Ob"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, January 10th 8:50AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with Amazon listing information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says Apple ‘should not benefit from bullying’ created by iMessage lock-in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/56-uL5spppOk5I9TkLl66qtqb0Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70368827/akrales_181218_2952_0084.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s Messages app distinguishes between iOS users (in blue) and Android users (in green). &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yY1j6X"&gt;Google has accused Apple of benefiting from bullying as part of a deliberate strategy to make Android users into second-class citizens on the iPhone-maker’s iMessage service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvJ9pO"&gt;Apple’s messaging service includes a number of iOS-exclusive features, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17506010/apple-ios-12-imessage-how-to-make-memoji"&gt;Memoji&lt;/a&gt;, and famously turns texts from Android users green instead of the iOS-native blue. This has turned iMessage into a status symbol among US teens, creating peer pressure for young people to buy iPhones and sometimes leading to the ostracization of Android users. Showing up in a group chat as a green bubble has become, for some, a social faux pas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lL5hng"&gt;A recent report in &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apples-imessage-is-winning-teens-dread-the-green-text-bubble-11641618009"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; highlighted this dynamic and prompted a response from both the Android team and Google’s head of Android, Hiroshi Lockheimer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvidSI"&gt;“iMessage should not benefit from bullying. Texting should bring us together, and the solution exists. Let’s fix this as one industry,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Android/status/1479875457667448837"&gt;tweeted the official Android account&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgwqNp"&gt;Lockheimer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1479865157753147395"&gt;was more strident&lt;/a&gt;: “Apple’s iMessage lock-in is a documented strategy. Using peer pressure and bullying as a way to sell products is disingenuous for a company that has humanity and equity as a core part of its marketing. The standards exist today to fix this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aWzMmN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple says making iMessage available on Android would “hurt us more than help us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MtlNIi"&gt;Although Apple’s iMessage strategy has long been apparent, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;internal emails sent by company executives&lt;/a&gt; that were surfaced during the recent Epic Games trial confirmed the conscious importance of this strategy. Apple did consider making iMessage available on Android to attract more users, but concluded that doing so would “hurt us more than help us” (in the words of Apple exec Phil Schiller). As another executive, Craig Federighi, put it: “iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gWXGj"&gt;Google’s intervention here is not purely altruistic, of course: the company would benefit hugely from Apple making iMessage available on Android. Google has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715696/svp-android-invitation-apple-rcs-texting-iphone"&gt;recently been pushing&lt;/a&gt; for the iPhone-maker to support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/17/18681573/google-rcs-chat-android-texting-carriers-imessage-encryption"&gt;next-generation texting standard RCS&lt;/a&gt;, which is intended to replace SMS and has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584443/verizon-android-messages-rcs"&gt;gathered support&lt;/a&gt; from major US carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBsMkZ"&gt;Google is also not well-placed to criticize other companies messaging strategies. As &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; editor Ron Amadeo &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ronamadeo/status/1480025128763371523"&gt;noted on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, the search giant is notoriously dysfunctional when it comes to messaging, and has launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22538240/google-chat-allo-hangouts-talk-messaging-mess-timeline"&gt;13 separate messaging apps&lt;/a&gt; since iMessage came out in 2011 (most of which have failed).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Display’s new QD-OLED panel can hit 1,000 nits brightness for improved HDR  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hLJiwmoDm-sW6HjMgUMkdFWNVbY=/0x0:750x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70368754/3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Display’s new panels combine a self-emissive layer with quantum dots.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung Display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WSdRDT"&gt;Key specs for Samsung Display’s new QD-OLED TVs have been revealed by third-party certification company SGS, the &lt;a href="http://global.samsungdisplay.com/29275/"&gt;South Korean display manufacturer has announced&lt;/a&gt;. According to SGS the new panels are capable of hitting a brightness of 1,000 nits, and can display over 90 percent of the BT.2020 color space, which both represent substantial improvements over current OLED TVs on the market, otherwise known as WOLEDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rqH9E"&gt;The figures are in line with those that were put out by YouTube channel &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Piteu5gyKq0"&gt;LinusTechTips (LTT) last week&lt;/a&gt;, in a video that was sponsored by Samsung Display. So it’s notable that these relatively impressive specs have now been validated by an independent certification company, albeit only partially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="zo0wfU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10961963"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bTKGmQ"&gt;LinusTechTip’s video compares the QD-OLED’s specs with LG’s G1 OLED, which was its flagship from last year and has an OLED Evo panel. According to LTT, Samsung Display’s QD-OLED hit almost 200 nits in fullscreen brightness, rising to 1000 nits over a 10 percent patch, and 1500 nits over a 3 percent portion of the screen (in general, the less of an OLEDs screen it has to illuminate, the brighter it can get). In contrast, &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/lg/g1-oled"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rtings&lt;/em&gt; review of the LG G1&lt;/a&gt; has it hitting a maximum peak of 167 nits in fullscreen brightness, 827 nits on a 10 percent window, and 846 on a 2 percent window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4iBQ2"&gt;The new QD-OLED panels also reportedly have an impressively wide color gamut compared to the G1. While Samsung’s new panel can reportedly display over 90 percent of the BT.2020 color space, and 120 percent of the DCI-P3 color space according to SGS, &lt;em&gt;Rtings&lt;/em&gt; reports the G1 can only display around three quarters of the BT.2020 space, and around 100 percent of DCI-P3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZmSubN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Piteu5gyKq0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eBxG5S"&gt;Importantly, Samsung Display’s new panel appears to achieve this without sacrificing the existing benefits of OLED displays. These include pure blacks where no light is being emitted at all, not to mention excellent viewing angles compared to typical LCD TVs. In fact, SGS says the viewing angles of Samsung Display’s QD-OLEDs are even better than existing OLEDs, maintaining 80 percent of luminance when viewed from a 60-degree angle compared to 53 percent for a conventional OLED. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SU32Xy"&gt;An important caveat is that all of these comparisons were made with LG’s 2021 flagship, which is due to be superseded this year when it releases a new lineup of OLED TVs. LG Display also has a new generation of OLED panels of its own, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/29/22858131/lg-oled-ex-technology-improved-brightness-accuracy-ces-2022"&gt;dubbed OLED EX&lt;/a&gt;, which it says offer increased brightness levels of up to 30 percent. Whether that’s enough to remain competitive with Samsung’s new panels remains to be seen.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zO0V3M"&gt;We’ll still have to wait for consumer TVs to actually make it to market using both panels before we can be completely sure of these readings, but it’s looking like an impressive set of results for Samsung Display’s latest technology. And Samsung’s display arm produces panels for a variety of companies, so it won’t just be Samsung’s own TVs that benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0Nc5p"&gt;The question still remains when, exactly, Samsung Display’s new panels will actually go on sale. Interestingly the first QD-OLED TV to be announced wasn’t from Samsung Electronics, but was instead &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865220/sony-a95k-qd-oled-qdoled-4k-tv-announced-features-explainer"&gt;from Sony&lt;/a&gt; which said its Bravia XR A95K will use a QD-OLED panel from Samsung Display. Alienware also has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855531/alienware-curved-34-inch-qd-oled-samsung-gaming-monitor-specs"&gt;QD-OLED computer monitor&lt;/a&gt; in the works. When Samsung Electronics will eventually release a QD-OLED TV of its own is anyone’s guess.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s ‘Full Self-Driving’ beta has an ‘assertive’ driving mode that ‘may perform rolling stops’</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0oCQK5"&gt;Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta lets you choose from three driving “profiles” that dictate how the car will react to certain situations on the road. Each mode, “Chill,” “Average,” and “Assertive,” varies in terms of aggressiveness (and potentially safety). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqDOXI"&gt;The feature was included in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tesla_raj/status/1452152897798426625"&gt;October 2021 version 10.3 update&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/24/22743628/elon-musk-tesla-fsd-beta-10-3-rollback-issues-phantom-fcw"&gt;was pulled two days after&lt;/a&gt; it started rolling out due to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1451907229796417542?s=20"&gt;an issue with left turns at traffic lights&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1452576223620747266"&gt;issued version 10.3.1&lt;/a&gt; one day later, which still includes FSD profiles, as shown on the release notes posted on &lt;a href="https://www.notateslaapp.com/software-updates/version/2021.36.5.3/release-notes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not a Tesla App&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Based on these notes, FSD profiles are described as a way “to control behaviors like rolling stops, speed-based lane changes, following distance and yellow light headway.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uzWDR6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I guess "Road Rage Mode" didn't fit on the screen &lt;a href="https://t.co/6pJNFvrJXA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6pJNFvrJXA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— David Zipper (@DavidZipper) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DavidZipper/status/1480218411162550273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 9, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rPcUL9"&gt;A separate image posted to Twitter gives us a more detailed glimpse at what this actually means. In the description beneath the “Assertive” option, Tesla notes the vehicle will “have a smaller follow distance” and “perform more frequent speed lane changes.” The vehicle will also “not exit passing lanes” and “may perform rolling stops,” and it’s not entirely clear whether this means cars won’t come to a full stop at stop signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QPhnXk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1jL6YpmJvGg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="45Dv1M"&gt;A YouTube video shows all three modes in action, and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/1jL6YpmJvGg?t=713"&gt;towards the end&lt;/a&gt;, it shows how Tesla describes each FSD profile. In “Chill” mode, the vehicle will “have a larger follow distance and perform fewer speed lane changes,” while “Average” mode means the car “will have a medium follow distance and may perform rolling stops.” That said, it’s a bit hard to distinguish the difference between these modes from this video alone, as it doesn’t test out the vehicle’s behavior in heavy traffic or harsh weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReQITV"&gt;It’s hard to tell just how much these FSD profiles change the way the vehicle drives, and if they push the limits of safety, especially when traveling in the rain or snow. If the descriptions of these profiles are accurate, this means that a Tesla in “Assertive” mode may follow cars more closely, come to rolling stops, and swap lanes more frequently — behaviors that tend to be more dangerous no matter the car you’re in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I81FKG"&gt;It’s important to note that Tesla’s FSD feature doesn’t make the car completely autonomous — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20929529/tesla-full-self-driving-release-2019-beta"&gt;a “feature complete” version&lt;/a&gt; would ideally let users drive to and from work without intervention. Tesla’s controversial FSD beta was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;rolled out to more users last September&lt;/a&gt; based on a “Safety Score” system that prioritizes drivers with safer driving habits, something that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682272/ntsb-official-tesla-safety-elon-musk-full-self-driving"&gt;the National Transportation Safety Board cautioned against&lt;/a&gt;. In November, what appears to be the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778135/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-crash-fsd-california"&gt;first-ever crash involving Tesla’s FSD mode&lt;/a&gt; left a Tesla severely damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
