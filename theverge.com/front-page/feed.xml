    <title>Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For the early adopters of next-gen hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cyuvuR"&gt;Just over two months after their release, the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world. While it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on a new console, those lucky enough to own one can enjoy something unprecedented in modern gaming history. For the first time, next-gen console owners can take their existing library — whether it’s physical, digital, or a mix of the two — and bring it to a next-gen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNh3ro"&gt;That gives consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play and what performance benefits are worthwhile enough to upgrade. And technologies like cross-platform play and now even cross-generation support will allow people to still play with their friends, even if they don’t upgrade to the latest gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uXjX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CveWHl"&gt;Yes, both consoles arrived within seven years of the last generation of console hardware. And while it’s likely within the first year of both consoles’ lifespan that many of the hottest titles may launch on last- and current-gen simultaneously, there’s still a good chunk of games that will be exclusive titles playable only a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79IWA"&gt;Besides 4K, the solid-state drives, and other spec changes, Microsoft and Sony have pledged to support close to every title in the existing console platforms’ libraries. Every Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One game currently playable on existing Xbox One hardware (minus Kinect games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326805/xbox-series-x-xbox-one-game-support-backward-compatible-feature-kinect"&gt;will be playable on the Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, while Sony is supporting a “vast majority” of PS4 games, totaling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan"&gt;more than 4,000 titles&lt;/a&gt;. With both consoles early into their lifespan, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;easy for many to return to older games&lt;/a&gt; to help fill the gap in between long wait periods for more titles to be added to each console’s library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwgnjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new consoles let you take a majority of your existing libraries with you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlnZM"&gt;This changes the calculus a bit with regard to buying a new console. No longer do you have to abandon what you were playing on your old device and start anew. And thanks to some genuinely consumer-friendly initiatives like Xbox Smart Delivery and similar upgrade programs, plenty of the games we own now or are planning to buy in the next couple of months will not only work on the new platforms, but in most cases, they’ll also come with free upgrades from the standard PS4 and Xbox One versions. Sony also introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a library of PS4 games available for free with its online subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmWX6y"&gt;That leaves us with one big issue: how do you know what new games are coming out for which platforms and when? There’s also the painstaking process of parsing whether a game company is giving out a free next-gen upgrade of a cross-gen title, charging a little extra, or releasing a next-gen-only game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsrpjD"&gt;2021 is packed full of new releases and full optimizations of cross-gen games that should further pad out what’s available to play on your new system of choice. We’ve compiled the list below to help you understand every game coming out during the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM3UJT"&gt;This excludes games without release dates that may have been previously announced — like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Fable &lt;/em&gt;reboot, for example — and any games that were released for either console in 2020, including launch titles. We’ve also chosen only to list release dates for games where the publisher has chosen a concrete date with both day and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hTe555"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9552771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQEqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 2020, 12:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that &lt;/em&gt;ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;em&gt; recently released an Xbox Series X enhancement update that will be available to new console owners on launch day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC6OMy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated &lt;/em&gt;Haven &lt;em&gt;would be a PS5-only release and that &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder &lt;em&gt;would be Xbox Series-only at launch. Those are incorrect; Haven is also coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox One and as part of Game Pass at launch, and &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is slated for PS5 mid-November. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPYdhq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add additional titles releasing in 2021 and update any games that may have been delayed into this year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yywDTp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T spins out DirecTV as a $16B company, a quarter of what it paid in 2015</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qcUNkMMrtzKhjg0-UgELFsKl6xo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876637/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="keg3YK"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T today announced plans to spin out its various video businesses — DirecTV, AT&amp;amp;T TV, and U-Verse — into a new company that it will jointly control with TPG Capital. The deal sees AT&amp;amp;T holding on to a 70 percent stake in the company, with TPG getting the other 30. “The transaction to separate AT&amp;amp;T’s US video business into New DirecTV implies an enterprise value for the new company of $16.25 billion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1gjto"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T paid a total of $67 billion to buy DirecTV: it landed the satellite provider &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/18/5727276/att-acquires-directv"&gt;for $48.5 billion in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, and the rest was debt that AT&amp;amp;T took on. With this “premium new video entity” valued at less than a quarter of that, you can see how just how badly the original mega-acquisition has fared. “We certainly didn’t expect this outcome when we closed the DirecTV acquisition in 2015,” AT&amp;amp;T John Stankey said on a call with analysts and investors after the news was made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPdvuQ"&gt;The deal for this new company, which will be led by AT&amp;amp;T US video boss Bill Morrow, is expected to close in the second half of 2021. AT&amp;amp;T will net $7.8 billion as part of the pact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AHRlOq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AT&amp;amp;amp;T tried to buy out the streaming wars — and customers are paying for it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21115181/att-direct-tv-time-warner-acquisition-debt-streaming-wars"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GbwZay"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T says that all content deals — including NFL Sunday Ticket — will move along to the “new” DirecTV. The company is also insisting that its WarnerMedia channels like CNN, TBS, and TNT will remain a core part of the video properties. “Customers aren’t going to see a change” in bundles or programming in the near term, Stankey said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24mN8c"&gt;Activist investors have long urged AT&amp;amp;T to deal with its DirecTV problem; Elliott Management has said the transaction produced “damaging results.” DirecTV’s business has continued to suffer declining subscribers as consumers have shifted en masse to streaming entertainment. But AT&amp;amp;T’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/30/20747190/directv-now-rebrand-att-tv-streaming-app"&gt;deeply confusing branding choices&lt;/a&gt; for its video services hasn’t helped matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O3RBdH"&gt;“Today’s announcement lines up with the evolution of our business,” Stankey said on the call. “We’re coming off a year where we saw strong wireless subscriber growth,” Stankey said, and he also called HBO Max “an important part of our future.” Stankey added that AT&amp;amp;T examined “every possibility under the sun” for what to do with its video assets.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mj7LGifJ1euP-dbrplwPMhD36I4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67781485/dseifert_191123_3810_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJm2GwlbGF56gpDmNhJwIgppWKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989898/dseifert_201025_4263_0002.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Echo Dot with clock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. But, if you want an Echo Dot now, you can buy it for $50 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fpreselect%3D80770243%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which is its usual price. There is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; to show the time, weather, and other information available for $10 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHsulr"&gt;Amazon is also selling some bundles, including a $50 one, which includes &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one Sengled Bluetooth bulb&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Amazon-Smart-Charcoal/dp/B08GTWC9ZB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot and Amazon Smart Plug bundle&lt;/a&gt; for $10 more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;We have seen this product go down to $40, but no deals are available at this time. You can get an Echo Dot Kids Edition for its usual price of $60 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is also selling a bundle for $75 which includes an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition plus an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3GbSWO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;Right now, the Amazon Echo is down to $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733330369536034962" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770246%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, Amazon is selling a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KVFM2XM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Echo for two Philips Hue bulbs&lt;/a&gt; for the same sale price of $80.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiNGuc"&gt;If you are looking for a pair of Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $180&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $20 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=c8b1ed4e46d21c7660ba5ae3006737b8&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is the one to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90 and we have seen it go down as low as $45. At the moment, you can get the Echo Show 5 for its usual $90 price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZD7VZG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GGyBnu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the Show 8 go down as low as $65. While no active deals are available now, you can grab one unit for its usual $130 price tag at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation Echo Show 10. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It is also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;There are no active deals going on right now for the Echo Show 10, but if you just want the device itself, you can get it for its usual price of $250 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551%3Fpreselect%3D80770248%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kppkjv"&gt;There are, however, a few bundles going on that throw in an additional item alongside the Echo Show 10. At Amazon, can buy the Echo Show 10 and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FRR5V57?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $40 on a one-year subscription&lt;/a&gt; to Food Network Kitchen.

    <title>Nikola stops work on electric watercraft and ATV projects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xFBcmyxT3rRtFoUW6ivw7s0JwOM=/295x0:2455x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876537/nikola_nzt3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nikola Motors&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ip4nqH"&gt;Zero-emission trucking company Nikola has shuttered its so-called Powersports division and is pausing work on an electric personal watercraft and off-road vehicle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18411541/nikola-wave-electric-jet-ski-4k-display-cruise-control"&gt;first announced in April 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Nikola stopped work on the projects as part of &lt;a href="https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-corporation-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020-results-114"&gt;a larger push to focus on getting its first hydrogen-powered truck out the door&lt;/a&gt;, following a number of stumbles in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JcgBS"&gt;“We still own the NZT and WAV rights and have put the projects on pause. We may consider moving forward with them at a later time,” a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Right now we are focusing on commercial trucking and hydrogen infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mZadr41xywhsdvQQ5HdqH4IXJf8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16126861/nikola_wav_watercraft_3856.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photos by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LIawQy"&gt;Nikola started pursuing an electric watercraft back in 2017 after it bought up &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2017/11/08/nikola-motors-electric-watercraft-startup/"&gt;one of the more promising startups working on the idea&lt;/a&gt;. The off-road vehicle was a hybrid of sorts, mixing dune buggy styling with the kinds of comforts found in passenger cars, like air conditioning. Nikola was promising the so-called NZT vehicle would get 590 horsepower and 150 miles of range. It was supposed to come to market this year at a starting price of $80,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swe1IO"&gt;Both Powersports vehicles were a big focus of Nikola’s annual event in 2019, but the NZT in particular always seemed like a possible moneymaker for the startup considering the &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2018/03/26/marines-test-all-electric-nikola-utv/"&gt;interest it generated from the defense industry&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OAQh5"&gt;The Powersports division is not the first casualty of Nikola’s rocky 2020. The startup’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726594/gm-nikola-deal-equity-badger-truck-hydrogen"&gt;pickup truck project crumbled after a falling out with General Motors&lt;/a&gt;, which was backing Nikola before accusations of fraud started flying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2mtlw"&gt;Nikola announced the death of its Powersports division Thursday afternoon along with its &lt;a href="https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-corporation-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020-results-114"&gt;2020 financial results&lt;/a&gt;. The company reported a $384 million loss for the year, though it finished 2020 with $840 million in the bank, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21162886/nikola-public-nasdaq-merger-hydrogen-electric-trucks"&gt;thanks to the money it generated when it went public earlier in the year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok reaches $92 million settlement over nationwide privacy lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z4DQbGo44LSnrGApcYHPcmExbM4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876490/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GISdKv"&gt;TikTok has agreed to pay $92 million to settle a class action lawsuit over alleged privacy violations, which included claims that the app collected “highly sensitive personal data” to track users and target ads to them. TikTok rejected the allegations but said it didn’t want to spend time litigating the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkM44k"&gt;“While we disagree with the assertions, rather than go through lengthy litigation, we’d like to focus our efforts on building a safe and joyful experience for the TikTok community,” a TikTok spokesperson wrote in a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CM21z3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A settlement for 21 combined lawsuits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B0NDPu"&gt;The settlement combines 21 proposed class action lawsuits against TikTok over an assortment of alleged privacy violations. The lawsuit makes some substantial claims, from allegations that TikTok analyzed users’ faces to determine their ethnicity, gender, and age to supposed violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act over its transmission of private data. Nearly all US users would be included in the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Za0Tq"&gt;As part of the settlement, TikTok has agreed to avoid several behaviors that could compromise user privacy unless it specifically discloses those behaviors in its privacy policy. Those behaviors include storing biometric information, collecting GPS or clipboard data, and sending or storing US users’ data outside the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jScZnC"&gt;TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on whether it currently engages in any of these behaviors or would be changing its privacy policy as a result of this agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV9xDT"&gt;The settlement is just one of many that TikTok has made to set aside privacy concerns. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997199/tiktok-bytedance-musically-lawsuit-coppa-settlement-children-data"&gt;settled a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; over alleged children’s privacy allegations in 2019, and the same year, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/27/18243312/tiktok-ftc-fine-musically-children-coppa-age-gate"&gt;paid $5.7 million&lt;/a&gt; to the Federal Trade Commission over accusations that its predecessor, Musical.ly, failed to gain parental approval for young users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu’s animated MODOK series looks like Robot Chicken meets Marvel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bbD2g30xE1GShm8_fcPicggRgNc=/203x0:2279x1384/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876431/Screen_Shot_2021_02_25_at_4.25.37_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XcDRm1"&gt;Hulu has released the first trailer for &lt;em&gt;MODOK&lt;/em&gt;, its upcoming animated show that will see Patton Oswalt voice the titular Marvel villain in a more light-hearted,&lt;em&gt; Robot Chicken&lt;/em&gt;-style take on the franchise’s usual portentous superhero dramas. The show also got a release date: it’ll debut on May 21st on the streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62nyve"&gt;MODOK (Mental Organism Designed Only for Killing) has been a long-running bad guy in Marvel Comics as the leader of the evil scientific group AIM. (A more serious take on the character serves as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21422708/marvel-avengers-review-single-player-campaign-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;primary antagonist for Square Enix’s &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; video game, released last year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00FS3z"&gt;In the new Hulu animated series, MODOK has managed to bankrupt AIM, resulting in the supervillain being fired as the organization’s leader and leaving the massive floating head to sort out his professional and family problems on his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yoefih"&gt;&lt;q&gt;MODOK gets his day in the sun&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MNPeoh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MODOK &lt;/em&gt;was originally part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/11/18220473/hulu-marvel-animated-series-howard-the-duck-modok-hit-monkey-tigra-dazzler-offenders-kevin-smith"&gt;larger slate of animated Marvel shows&lt;/a&gt; planned for Hulu in 2019 by the now-defunct Marvel TV, alongside &lt;em&gt;Hit-Monkey&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tigra &amp;amp; Dazzler&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Howard the Duck &lt;/em&gt;series. The four shows were then slated to cross over in a special called &lt;em&gt;The Offenders &lt;/em&gt;(a take on existing crossover shows like the &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; films or Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Defenders&lt;/em&gt; for its Marvel heroes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcelPc"&gt;Those plans would be upended later in 2019 &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2019/12/marvel-tv-shut-down-layoffs-jeph-loeb-kevin-feige-1202805979/"&gt;when Marvel TV was shut down&lt;/a&gt;, studio head Jeph Loeb (who was overseeing the new animated shows) left the company, and future Marvel TV efforts were placed under Kevin Feige’s Marvel Studios division (which has a staggering number of Marvel shows planned for Disney Plus over the next several years). Shows that were already in development under Marvel TV — like the final seasons of &lt;em&gt;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525187/ghost-rider-helstrom-hulu-live-action-marvel-shows-2020"&gt;Hulu’s &lt;em&gt;Helstrom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;MODOK &lt;/em&gt;— were allowed to finish up their work, but the other shows were summarily canceled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbutco"&gt;In that light, &lt;em&gt;MODOK &lt;/em&gt;isn’t just a wacky spin on the Marvel universe; it’s a final glimpse at a different path that the company’s comics adaptations could have taken before the MCU fully took over the future of Marvel TV shows. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next Dragon Age will reportedly be single-player only amid other shifts at EA</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0pPVsCTE1IwehNU99toDe7Cddwc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876369/Screen_Shot_2021_02_25_at_12.54.43_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: EA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qy4law"&gt;The next &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt; game will no longer have multiplayer aspects, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-25/electronic-arts-pivots-on-dragon-age-game-removes-multiplayer"&gt;a new &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;. The game, made by EA-owned studio BioWare, had reportedly “been designed with a heavy multiplayer component,” but it has been turned into a single-player game “in recent months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USxXBZ"&gt;However, we still haven’t seen much of the game since it was first announced with a brief teaser trailer in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18126070/dragon-age-4-trailer-teaser-ea-announcement-release-date-game-awards-2018"&gt;December 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and we don’t know what the multiplayer component could have looked like. Even though the game has been in the works for some time — development started in 2015, reports &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; — there’s still no release date for it just yet, meaning it could be a ways off, and things could change. BioWare recently showed fleeting glimpses of the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21404442/dragon-age-4-behind-the-scenes-bts-bioware"&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18126070/dragon-age-4-trailer-teaser-ea-announcement-release-date-game-awards-2018"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sUIK4I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The change comes amid other developments at EA&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uF2dTh"&gt;The change comes amid other developments that have apparently led EA to be more willing to embrace a single-player-only &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt;. On Wednesday, EA announced that &lt;em&gt;Anthem Next&lt;/em&gt;, the planned reboot of BioWare’s live service open-world shooter &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22274771/ea-wont-continue-anthems-post-launch-development"&gt;has been canceled&lt;/a&gt; (though EA says the game “as it exists today” will continue). And EA’s single-player title &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/em&gt;, which launched in November 2019,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;exceeded sales expectations, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JoJ3k2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt; became one of BioWare’s marquee franchises based on its engrossing single-player campaigns, so the news that the next title won’t have multiplayer is likely welcome news for many fans. &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-is-putting-the-future-of-its-franchises-including-titanfall-into-its-studios-hands"&gt;In a recent interview with &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, EA’s studios chief Laura Miele said the company has been listening to what players want and is making decisions based on that feedback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="akReWd"&gt;“I asked [EA’s community leaders] to give me their best advice on how we can have a better connection to our players,” Miele said. “The biggest theme was — please listen to us about the content players are asking for, which resulted in us green lighting [the new] &lt;em&gt;Skate&lt;/em&gt;, College Football, &lt;em&gt;Command &amp;amp; Conquer&lt;/em&gt; and additional content for &lt;em&gt;Battlefront II&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qI2Ws"&gt;EA has also canceled a years-in-development game codenamed “Gaia,” &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-25/electronic-arts-cancels-gaia-game-after-years-in-development"&gt;according to another &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;. “&lt;em&gt;Gaia’s&lt;/em&gt; development was turbulent and the game went through at least one major reboot,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported. If you’re curious, you can get a brief look at some early footage of Gaia&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jMQ4n2922qI"&gt;in this video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oxford lab studying the coronavirus was victim of a cyberattack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/36-0Rjq94xDCa45VopqDE6ZDZPM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876361/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JyH849"&gt;Oxford University disclosed on Thursday that one of its research labs dedicated in part to studying COVID-19 suffered a cyberattack, following an &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/02/25/exclusive-hackers-break-into-biochemical-systems-at-oxford-uni-lab-studying-covid-19/?sh=3f7d621e2a39"&gt;investigation from &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;indicating external access to a number of the lab’s systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spnFK2"&gt;The lab is part of Oxford’s Division of Structural Biology, known as “Strubi.” There’s no indication the lab or its research had any direct connection to ongoing COVID-19 vaccine development conducted by the Oxford Vaccine Group and the Jenner Institute. But it’s unclear exactly what data may have been compromised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIrDd0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes &lt;/em&gt;says it was shown proof of the intrusion by Alex Holden, the chief technology officer of a cybersecurity firm called Hold Security, who provided screenshots showing access to lab equipment with active intruders as recent as February 14th. It’s not clear if the intent was to steal valuable lab data or to potentially sabotage ongoing research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tKVEVo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The lab was not involved in COVID-19 vaccine development&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pob30n"&gt;“We have identified and contained the problem and are now investigating further,” an Oxford University spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;. “There has been no impact on any clinical research, as this is not conducted in the affected area.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpA0r3"&gt;Oxford confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Forbes &lt;/em&gt;that some of the machines that were accessed included purification devices for handling biochemical samples, some of which included proteins used in ongoing coronavirus research. &lt;em&gt;Forbes &lt;/em&gt;reports that the attackers may not have been connected to any nation-state and instead may have been seeking out valuable research to sell on underground markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOj19W"&gt;Oxford contacted the UK’s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), which now says it’s conducting an investigation. “We are aware of an incident affecting Oxford University and are working to fully understand its impact,” an NCSC spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Forbes. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says it won’t loosen COVID-19 policies after Oversight Board request</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wtZ4gYrqoUKCRjZ-fjNScpRZy2s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876286/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="21GGFk"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/facebook-response-to-the-oversight-boards-first-set-of-recommendations/"&gt;has decided whether to adopt recommendations&lt;/a&gt; the Facebook Oversight Board made last month when the board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755133/facebook-oversight-board-supreme-court-first-cases-hate-speech-pandemic-misinformation"&gt;decided its first round of appeals from users&lt;/a&gt;. Among its responses, Facebook said it would not loosen standards on taking down COVID-19 misinformation, but it would test informing users whether a human or an automated filtering system deleted their post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r62gRv"&gt;The Oversight Board made 17 recommendations based on the six cases it examined. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254155/facebook-oversight-board-first-rulings-coronavirus-misinformation-hate-speech"&gt;Unlike the board’s decisions&lt;/a&gt; regarding the appeals cases, Facebook is not required to adopt the recommendations, but it agrees that it will at least consider them. However, several of the responses were noncommittal, with one promising to “continue to explore how best to provide transparency [...] within the limits of what is technologically feasible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5R7bLv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many of Facebook’s plans point toward increasing transparency and clarity around its rules&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="01rzrT"&gt;The one recommendation Facebook says it will not do anything about stems from a case where Facebook removed a user’s post for saying that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were effective COVID treatments. The company says it will not follow the recommendation to reduce its enforcement against posts that contain misinformation that could lead to “imminent harm,” as it disagrees with the board’s interpretation of the phrase based on its consultation with global health organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnRS7w"&gt;One of the more interesting responses is how Facebook plans to clarify its policies around its ban on “dangerous individuals and organizations,” including hate figures. The board suggested the clarification after Facebook removed a post attributing a quote to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, but the user said they had intended to compare Goebbels unfavorably to former President Donald Trump. Facebook plans to add language to indicate that it could remove posts containing hateful content if it’s not unambiguously condemned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0hmtw"&gt;Facebook also plans to test a feature where it lets users know if one of their posts was automatically removed. If the feature sticks around, it should provide some insight into whether it was a human who removed the post after reviewing it or an automated system.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bungie addresses major Destiny 2 player complaints with massive changes on the horizon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eH-NEu8RMLlYFIGUSvABBVKrCsU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876272/media_wallaper_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bungie&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Y5G0i"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, Bungie’s long-running online sci-fi shooter, has a year of substantial changes ahead of it, according to a new roadmap the studio &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/en-us/Explore/Detail/News/50124"&gt;detailed in an extensive blog post published on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. While the game’s next major expansion, &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;, has been delayed to early 2022, Bungie says it has major overhauls planned for nearly every aspect of the game — from the competitive multiplayer Crucible mode to how players progress and become more powerful across the game’s seasonal expansion model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="miQTtB"&gt;One of the biggest changes slated for &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; is a major crossplay implementation that will, for the first time, allow players on PC and players on consoles to join one another for activities. In its blog post, Bungie said crossplay is coming later this year in season 15, and most importantly, the studio confirms it will not mandate crossplay for competitive activities as many fans feared. “Don’t worry, we won’t be matching console and PC players together in the Crucible unless PC players specifically invite their console friends to play with them in the PC Crucible pools,” the blog post reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXUmbX"&gt;There are a ton of other major changes planned, many of which address long-standing player complaints. Here’s a rundown of some of the more significant ones: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oCDa4q"&gt;Bungie will no longer “sunset” weapons and armor by making older items obsolete. The studio says “any weapon or armor that can currently be infused to max power will continue to be able to reach max power permanently.” That’s a huge relief for players who’ve been frustrated at the sunsetting experiment over the last year leaving behind fan-favorite gear. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OCExZc"&gt;The Vault of Glass, &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt;’s very first raid, is coming back as part of the &lt;em&gt;Destiny Content Vault&lt;/em&gt; in season 14 this summer. Bungie now says it will eventually launch a “master” difficult version to align the raid with the game’s hardest player versus environment (PvE) activities. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Js0dns"&gt;Bungie is planning an “overhaul” of the ultra-competitive Trials of Osiris game mode to improve matchmaking, rebuild the incentivize structure to encourage less skilled players to compete, and to figure out ways to allow solo players to participate. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XHBcTO"&gt;Bungie has outlined major changes to how its Darkness-based Stasis subclass functions in both PvE and PvP activities to tone down its dominance against human opponents and bring the older subclasses up to par. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HP34vT"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2 &lt;/em&gt;will no longer force players to grind out 50 power level points every season and will instead introduce minor season expansions with just a 10 power level jump. That should make it easier for players to sink back into the game at the start of new seasons and not feel pressured to level up. (This is my personal favorite announcement of the day.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="s5RUgj"&gt;Many of these changes represent Bungie’s renewed effort to listen to its diehard fans, many of whom have been playing &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2 &lt;/em&gt;and its predecessor since 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrkxmc"&gt;Common complaints include exhausting grinds to reach max power level and enjoy the game’s most rewarding activities, a lack of attention and focus on the competitive Crucible game mode, and inconsistencies in the depth and richness of certain expansions versus others that can result in long content draughts and little incentive to keep playing. Bungie appears to be tackling all of this with its 2021 plans, all leading up to the eventual release of &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt; next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9GUTG7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Destiny universe looks more promising than ever &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gRpOCi"&gt;The studio has weathered countless storms before, including a near-constant ebb and flow between extreme player satisfaction and frenzied outrage. With last year’s &lt;em&gt;Beyond Light,&lt;/em&gt; Bungie signaled it was ready to push the &lt;em&gt;Destiny &lt;/em&gt;universe toward a longer-term scope with a more service-oriented model and a more cohesive vision for the game’s story and structure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uq80Lj"&gt;Effectively, this meant no &lt;em&gt;Destiny 3&lt;/em&gt;; the series would move forward in its current state and evolve over time, like a proper MMO or live service game. And last week, the company also &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50109"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a major shuffle of its executive leadership and a studio expansion that includes an expansion of the &lt;em&gt;Destiny &lt;/em&gt;universe into “additional media,” opening the door to film and TV and other formats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuwlaA"&gt;Bungie has proven that it’s more than capable of listening to feedback and focusing its attention and resources where they matter most, and this most recent roadmap is making &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; look more promising than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
