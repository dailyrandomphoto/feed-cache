    <title>Myspace Tom got it right</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p_gX6qtQ449EYyOWLQojePGkEJw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204724/acastro_210426_4559_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YjVSXh"&gt;Two days after the DC insurrection, as the country was still processing the aftermath, MySpace co-founder Tom Anderson posted his second tweet of the past three years. Anderson attached the thinking emoji to an amateurish Photoshop render of Donald Trump, sitting in one of his typically garish offices, with his browser opened to Myspace. “‘MYSPACE TOM’ ABOUT TO GET A NEW FRIEND,” reads the caption, saliently predicting that with the entire internet industry mobilizing to hastily deplatform the president, Trump’s only access to the public might come from a long-zombified social media company. Anderson must’ve found the meme funny enough to log back on, disrupting a truly unprecedented offline streak for the average tech mogul. He disappeared again shortly afterward, withdrawing into the ocean of enviable vacation photos that have been left to fossilize on his few remaining social feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AW9mPm"&gt;Anderson sold Myspace to News Corp in 2005 for $580 million. Six years later, Myspace sold again for a hugely depreciated $35 million, prompting Rupert Murdoch to refer to the initial purchase as &lt;a href="https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/10/news-corps-murdoch-calls-myspace-a-huge-mistake.html"&gt;“A huge mistake.”&lt;/a&gt; In retrospect, it’s clear that Anderson cashed out at the perfect time. Myspace was quickly outpaced by other social media ventures — Twitter and Facebook — and by the early 2010s, the website had lost much of its user base and tangible identity. Visiting the URL today is downright surreal for any pilgrimaging millennials. All of its familiar trappings, (the Top 8, the chintzy color layouts, the twinkling custom cursors) have been scrubbed away. Instead, all you’ll find on the modern Myspace is a meager trickle of music news, aggregated directly from other corners of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E8QekC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/HHUJylI3J2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HHUJylI3J2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Anderson (@myspacetom) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/myspacetom/status/1347723797361659906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3NX7PX"&gt;Industry analysts have long regarded the downfall of Myspace to be one of the greatest missed opportunities of the last decade, but frankly, I think it’s becoming increasingly clear that Anderson got off easy. It is true that Twitter and Facebook are more influential, and possess wealthier executives, than anything in Myspace Tom’s estate. If you are an entrepreneur in the psycho Silicon Valley tradition — that is to say, you are capable of perceiving a functional, quality-of-life difference between net worths of $100 million and $100 billion — then perhaps you too envy the lives of Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg. But just consider how those two weathered the events of January 6th: panicked, agitated, staring down at the chaos that they helped wrought, considering some truly arcane, dystopian-fiction solutions like perma-banning the president from their websites. What was Anderson doing while the great networks crashed and burned? Jumping back online for a quick dig, completely at peace that these questions are firmly Not His Problem Anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACpRc0"&gt;Go take a look at Anderson’s Instagram page. Like his Twitter, it is rarely updated and aggressively neutral. There are no bar charts, or product promos, or lengthy pontifications on how NFTs will “disrupt the investment economy.” Instead, Anderson uploads a steady stream of beautiful photos from all over the world. Here he is &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BalBM3ehtdL/"&gt;on the crystal waters of the Maldives&lt;/a&gt;, standing on a dockside bungalow with an anonymous woman. Here he is a few weeks later in Bhutan, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BbgNgJsBtbL/"&gt;soaking in an alabaster monastery&lt;/a&gt; on a gorgeous November day. A few weeks later, he’s &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BcBooWYhxqJ/"&gt;gazing at a sunbeam in Antelope Canyon&lt;/a&gt;, before &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BcEDXPeBfgt/"&gt;skipping off to Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;. For the longest time, Anderson’s Twitter bio read: “Enjoying being retired.” Today it simply says, “Enjoying the good life.” In fact, one of the &lt;em&gt;only &lt;/em&gt;tweets Anderson has made in recent years was a response to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JackDMurphy/status/1282699652954030082"&gt;a hugely viral post by user @JackDMurphy&lt;/a&gt;, who raved about Tom’s willingness to sink into the background without any fanfare. “What a man. Myspace was just too pure for this world,” wrote Murphy. (Anderson responded &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/myspacetom/status/1282948450372349952"&gt;with two heart-face emojis and a salutary hang loose&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpTQr8"&gt;If there was any professional jealousy toward his peers — any latent bitterness that Myspace did not grow as dominant and ubiquitous as Facebook — it seems that it’s long passed from his mind. Anderson is instead focused on the tranquilizing impact of luxury. There is no hustle instinct left. He has nothing more to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W3KTFE"&gt;Compare that to the architects of Twitter, or Facebook, or literally any other social media enterprise with clout in the 2020s. The rent has come due. It’s now brutally apparent that the necrotic, parasocial tics encouraged by those platforms have an immeasurably negative impact on society. Facebook is plagued by constant scandals and may have played a role in &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/04/11/601323233/6-facts-we-know-about-fake-news-in-the-2016-election"&gt;swinging the 2016 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter remains one of the worst places on the internet, to the point that it might be giving its most &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/07/how-twitter-fuels-anxiety/534021/"&gt;chronic users lifelong anxiety disorders&lt;/a&gt;. Even a benign arena like Pinterest — a website intended for moms who want to catalog different shades of wallpaper — is dealing with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755406/pinterest-shareholders-lawsuit-sue-toxic-work-culture-discrimination"&gt;an uproar over its own internal toxic culture&lt;/a&gt;. Nowhere is safe. If you are a social media executive in 2021, a significant portion of your job must now be spent proving that your website isn’t actively destroying people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vxoknJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Meanwhile, Dorsey and Zuckerberg are stuck in endless congressional hearings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T3fJPm"&gt;Myspace, on the other hand, peaked in 2005 — a time when the internet was both young enough and small enough to not cause any lasting damage to humanity. Sure, the platform ruined a handful of high school friendships and elevated “Hey There Delilah” to the top of the Billboard Hot 100, but then it immediately flamed out. That ought to be a lesson to every other major player in social media: institutional failure is the only escape. It’s impossible to save the world by editing a code of conduct over and over again. You can’t reform Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38RGEK"&gt;I think this image from Dorsey and Zuckerberg’s &lt;a href="https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/11-17-2020/t_6b001a6d61a34a9d8b06acccfac07ba6_name_t_2cb3fb29076b415995b2a1cf03aefb2e_name_1___1920x1080___30p_00_00_01_23_Still014.jpg"&gt;most recent testimony to Congress&lt;/a&gt; sums up the divide. Dorsey is almost a year into cultivating his Rasputin beard, Zuckerberg dressed like G-Man from &lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt;, and each of them are locked in an interminable Zoom call where they’re frequently lectured by pedants like Ted Cruz &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3ZzLYFWRCc"&gt;about the tyranny of Section 230&lt;/a&gt;. This is what happens when you’ve let social media grow beyond your grasp. These men are no longer tech ministers. Instead, they’re the vanguard of a brand-new class in America — these quasi-public bureaucrats, forever advocating on behalf of apps that, by all accounts, are slowly facilitating the annihilation of our political norms. Dorsey and Zuckerberg exist in a prison of their own making, and the Silicon Valley mandate of corporate overreach, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/facebook-spent-more-on-lobbying-than-any-other-big-tech-company-in-2020.html"&gt;Capitol Hill dealmaking&lt;/a&gt;, and endless, monolithic growth guarantees that neither of them will ever be able to take the Myspace way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWoDfs"&gt;Where do you think Anderson was during that hearing? Probably knocking back his third mai tai, on an island so exclusive that neither you nor I have ever heard of it. Never for a moment does he need to worry about the ways his former company might be fraying the civil order. Those days are over. Anderson is simply enjoying being rich and adamantly offline, knowing that — by luck or foresight — he abandoned the social media monopoly right as it was getting very, very dark. Let’s hope some other tech CEOs start taking a page out of his book. Please, for the love of god, just enjoy being retired.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hOdz5W"&gt;Ford has sold more than 7,000 Mustang Mach-E SUVs so far, and it says 70 percent of those buyers have never owned one of the company’s cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7ZI39"&gt;For comparison, Ford told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that 39 percent of people who bought the more affordable 2020 Escape were new to the brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twf6zX"&gt;So what does that 70 percent figure actually mean? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4YKpU"&gt;Well, if Ford keeps up the pace and meets its goal of selling 30,000 Mustang Mach-Es in the US in 2021, then it’s a promising sign the company is doing important work in attracting new customers. It’s also evidence that a really capable electric car can help Ford carve out new market share, and that some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373903/mustang-mach-e-deep-sleep-12v-battery-jump-start"&gt;early production issues&lt;/a&gt; haven’t scared away unfamiliar buyers. That could be good news for the all-electric version of the bestselling passenger vehicle in America, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288000/ford-electric-f-150-2022-sale-launch-jim-farley"&gt;the F-150 pickup truck&lt;/a&gt;, which Ford will formally reveal later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bFqH0"&gt;But there is a way this number could break bad for Ford. New customers are great, but if Ford sells fewer Mustang Mach-Es than it planned, a 70 percent mix could be evidence that current&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;customers really don’t like the electric SUV. That could throw more fuel on the fire of everyone’s favorite conversation about the Mustang Mach-E since it was announced, which is whether it “deserves” be called a Mustang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOMdbz"&gt;Ford certainly thinks it’s good news, as it was featured prominently in the company’s first quarter results, which &lt;a href="https://shareholder.ford.com/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Ford-1Q2021-Earnings-Press-Release.pdf"&gt;were published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. “The strong customer response to Mach-E affirms our choice to shift more capital to [battery-electric vehicles],” Ford’s chief financial officer John Lawler said on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5DHOxf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re going to be chasing demand for quite some time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uxc5G0"&gt;CEO Jim Farley took that a step further when talking about Ford’s new products, like the Mustang Mach-E and the Bronco. “Our fresh new lineup is not only fresh, but it seems to be hitting the mark of the zeitgeist of the customer right now,” he said. “I don’t know where that’s going to take us, but I do know it feels like we’re going to be chasing demand for quite some time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AneB7"&gt;But even the most optimistic take on the Mustang Mach-E’s performance is overshadowed by something else Ford shared Wednesday, which is that its overall output is taking a big hit thanks to the global chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2MuA5"&gt;Ford said that its production will drop 50 percent in the second quarter of 2021 because of the shortage, a far worse dip than the 17 percent drop it already experienced in Q1, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;which even affected the F-150&lt;/a&gt;. The company said it expects things to recover in the second half of the year, but it will ultimately make 1.1 million fewer vehicles than it originally forecast. As a result, Ford said it now believes it will make about $2.5 billion less than expected this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pc5nTu"&gt;Now, Ford’s not the only automaker taking a hit because of the shortage, and its output is &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Renesas-expects-bigger-damage-from-fire-at-its-chip-factory"&gt;also being affected by a fire at chip supplier Renesas&lt;/a&gt;. But some companies have adapted better than others as the problem persists. Tesla, for instance, shared strong first quarter sales results earlier this week and said it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404198/tesla-q1-results-earnings-profit-model-s-x-y-3-bitcoin-delay"&gt;has largely been able to navigate the shortage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peacock signs up 9 million after adding WWE and The Office</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o8tAWfuoEzWGyZ2nsdYGxTYeYBA=/0x0:1875x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204588/117798103_10158141375989748_7899803978219609921_n.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Steve Carell in The Office. | Photo: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yfgeKj"&gt;Comcast said that &lt;em&gt;The Office &lt;/em&gt;and WWE were to thank for its new-ish streaming service, Peacock, &lt;a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/news-releases/news-release-details/comcast-reports-1st-quarter-2021-results"&gt;adding 9 million signups&lt;/a&gt; during the first three months of 2021. Peacock now has 42 million members total in the United States. That looks strong compared to HBO’s 44.2 million US customers, but it comes with a huge caveat: Peacock has a free tier, and Comcast doesn’t say how many customers are paying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXbrGg"&gt;Still, Peacock got a sizable boost during a quarter when other streaming services notched smaller growth. HBO added 2.7 million subscribers in the US, and Netflix added 4 million subscribers globally. (Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s parent company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXts7I"&gt;Two big names contributed to this quarter’s growth. &lt;em&gt;The Office &lt;/em&gt;became a Peacock exclusive on January 1st, after leaving Netflix where it had become a staple of comfort viewing. And on March 18th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248330/wwe-network-peacock-move-announced-date-price"&gt;the WWE Network launched on Peacock&lt;/a&gt;, bringing over around a decade of pay-per-views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylMSpN"&gt;The problem will be whether Peacock can keep this up going forward. Those were two big names, and the service didn’t even have a particularly remarkable quarter — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253988/peacock-nbcuniversal-comcast-streaming-broadband"&gt;added 11 million signups&lt;/a&gt; last quarter, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345031/comcast-peacock-cable-second-quarter-earnings-customers"&gt;added 10 million signups&lt;/a&gt; before the service even fully launched. So 9 million, in comparison, during a quarter when it rolled out some huge names, starts to look a little concerning.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lime is bringing its electric mopeds to New York City</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rGpjZzfBwTiuUGy9PIZpl7XodpI=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204498/Moped_DC__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sja2Mg"&gt;Lime’s bright green electric mopeds are coming to New York City. The company that’s better known for its electric kick scooters will initially roll out 100 mopeds in Queens, Brooklyn, and Lower Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJ5KB6"&gt;It’s the second US market for Lime’s mopeds, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22248805/lime-electric-moped-scooter-niu-washington-paris"&gt;first launching them in Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt;.  (The company is also operating a fleet in Paris.) Lime was also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383976/nyc-scooter-permit-selection-lime-bird-veoride"&gt;recently approved to deploy 1,000 electric scooters in the Bronx&lt;/a&gt; as part of New York City’s inaugural shared scooter pilot.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0GNR8D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s the second US market for Lime’s mopeds&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X3RiEN"&gt;The mopeds are manufactured by NIU, a Chinese company that also supplies mopeds to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/16/18677586/revel-mopeds-scooter-nyc-review"&gt;New York City-based mobility company Revel&lt;/a&gt;. NIU’s mopeds typically get between 25–100 miles of range. Lime’s mopeds will be speed limited to 28 mph and can be controlled and monitored via wireless connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVa7EZ"&gt;The mopeds are intended to lend credibility to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538190/lime-scooter-ceo-interview-covid-future-200-million-rides"&gt;Lime’s claims of being more than just another scooter company&lt;/a&gt;. The company sees itself as a “platform” for different types of low-speed, electric-powered mobility. Last year, Lime added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506805/lime-wheels-app-integrate-scooter-bike-mobility"&gt;pedal-less e-bikes from Wheels&lt;/a&gt; to its app in several cities as part of a new effort to integrate third-party micromobility providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tikmd"&gt;Mopeds are arguably a faster way to get around, but they can also be more dangerous, especially for novice riders. Lime says that riders will be required to take a multi-chapter rider safety course that is provided through the app, developed in partnership with the Motorcycle Safety Foundation. Customers will be required to have a driver’s license in order to ride. And they’ll also have to take a selfie of themselves wearing one of the provided helmets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChO5Wf"&gt;The news comes a day after Revel, New York’s other moped operator, announced that it would begin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22405539/revel-ride-share-nyc-tesla-model-y-moped-uber"&gt;offering a Tesla-only ride-hailing service in Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch Series 6 is $249 now at Best Buy and Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The blood oxygen animation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dqFRVtWs7Wj7FD9DSYpZHaRqxcU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204449/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UXw07U"&gt;Best Buy and Amazon are offering the 40mm Apple Watch Series 6 (GPS) for $249, smashing yesterday’s discounted price of $299. This model normally sold for $399, and today’s price drop makes it more affordable than — and superior to — the Apple Watch SE that costs $279. The one downside to this promo is that it only loops in the Product Red model that’s all red, which might not go with your look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7RDawh"&gt;At this price, it’s currently about $80 more than 38mm-sized Apple Watch Series 3, yet it provides a sizable boost in power and capabilities. For one, the Series 6 has more internal storage. A few other perks of this discounted watch include its always-on display that’s surprisingly efficient, and its ability to take blood oxygen readings. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438413/apple-watch-series-6-se-5-3-comparison-smartwatch-models-versus"&gt;You can see all of the differences here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNKVDl"&gt;This deal is lasting until later today, April 29th. Best Buy in particular usually has a lot of stock when it puts something on sale, but place your order quickly at either retailer if you’re interested in case there’s a swell of demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rm1PYD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MVmcSY"&gt;Other deals you should know about today include Woot’s one-day sale on the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds. These keep dropping in price, and this deal is the best yet. If you use the Woot mobile app (&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/woot/id571457538?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;amp;itscg=30200&amp;amp;at=1001l7uV&amp;amp;ct=TheVerge&amp;amp;ls=1"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.woot.android.main&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;) to buy them and have Amazon Prime, you’ll get 10 percent off the order. So, instead of paying $170 (which matches the lowest price we’d seen up to this point), you’ll pay just $153 before tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sV9OOv"&gt;If you don’t want to jump through those hoops, here’s the link to its site where you can get them for $170.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J4tBBc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Meg0Kz"&gt;Daily Steals is offering an extra discount on standalone Google Wifi routers that can be &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9548099?hl=en"&gt;added onto either Google Wifi or Nest Wifi mesh Wi-Fi systems&lt;/a&gt;. With the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEWIFI&lt;/strong&gt;, you can get a new one for $68. The price over at Amazon fluctuates between $70 and $80. This purchase seems ideal if you want to add more coverage to eliminate Wi-Fi dropouts in your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m9n1vW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10472238"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P9Hiaw"&gt;Lastly, Daily Steals has yet another good deal if you want a new wireless gaming headset and don’t mind buying one that released a few years ago. Logitech’s G533 with DTS 7.1 virtual surround sound is just $55 by using the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGELGTCH&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/4/14116582/logitech-g533-wireless-gaming-headset-pc-price-ces-2017"&gt;Former &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor Vlad Savov spoke highly of its sound quality in 2017&lt;/a&gt; when they used to cost $150. These are rated to last up to 15 hours per charge and the battery is replaceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OR4BBH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10472257"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="QQxhRK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s library redesign makes it easier to find your downloaded content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nYoONOZW_IqtNL3Xy0BjTMCHLqs=/0x0:8000x5333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204385/spotify.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify’s redesigned Your Library features dynamic tabs and an easier way to sort your downloaded content. | Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ri8Wis"&gt;Spotify is trying again to make its Your Library tab easier to navigate. It’s &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-29/listeners-can-explore-their-spotify-collections-faster-and-easier-with-a-new-your-library"&gt;introducing&lt;/a&gt; dynamic filters, a new grid view, the ability to pin content, and different sorting options. The changes are coming to all users across iOS and Android over the coming week. The filters will likely be the most useful change, with users being able to filter between album, artist, playlist, or podcast. Premium users can also choose to view only downloaded content, which, up until now, has been hard to find within Spotify without scrolling through every artist and album they’ve saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K14lZA"&gt;Users can also choose to pin four playlists, albums, or podcast shows that’ll show up at the top of their content. To pin, swipe right on what you want to keep at the top. Finally, users can view content in a grid view or in a list by the content’s alphabetical order, recently played, or the creators’ names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrXRE1"&gt;The changes aren’t exactly monumental, but that downloaded content filter will likely be especially useful. I know I’ve spent way too long trying to find something I’ve saved whenever I fly, so hopefully this solves that issue. Spotify last updated Your Library &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-06-13/spotifys-your-library-refresh-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but only for Premium users. This forthcoming update will make the experience easier for everyone, which is much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft shakes up PC gaming by reducing Windows store cut to just 12 percent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TJHMC2LiwaIdhtYqrumVnd9STdE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204323/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uhzx1p"&gt;Microsoft is shaking up the world of PC gaming today with a big cut to the amount of revenue it takes from games on Windows. The software giant is reducing its cut from 30 percent to just 12 percent from August 1st, in a clear bid to compete with Steam and entice developers and studios to bring more PC games to its Microsoft Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ntGFw"&gt;“Game developers are at the heart of bringing great games to our players, and we want them to find success on our platforms,” says Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios at Microsoft. “A clear, no-strings-attached revenue share means developers can bring more games to more players and find greater commercial success from doing so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkPAYp"&gt;These changes will only affect PC games and not Xbox console games in Microsoft’s store. While Microsoft hasn’t explained why it’s not reducing the 30 percent it takes on Xbox game sales, it’s likely because the console business model is entirely different to PC. Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo subsidize hardware to make consoles more affordable, and offer marketing deals in return for a 30 percent cut on software sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gY3UFk"&gt;Microsoft’s new reduction on the PC side is significant, and it matches the same revenue split that Epic Games offers PC game developers while also putting more pressure on Valve to reduce its Steam store cut. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18120577/valve-steam-game-marketplace-revenue-split-new-rules-competition"&gt;Valve still takes a 30 percent cut on sales&lt;/a&gt; in its Steam store, which is reduced to 25 percent when sales hit $10 million, and then 20 percent for every sale after $50 million.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wfON0iQZ2qBHzL-0kALhqJkq4-U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22477692/social_og.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steam is still the dominate games store on Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="551rFJ"&gt;Despite this larger revenue cut, Steam continues to dominate mind and market share among developers, but many don’t think the 30 percent fee is fair. A &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210428005374/en/Game-Developers-Conference%E2%80%99s-2021-State-of-the-Industry-Survey-Shows-Pandemic-Brought-Delays---But-Also-Growth-Reflects-Rising-Interest-in-the-PlayStation-5-and-Strong-Disapproval-of-30-Digital-Storefront-Revenue-Shares"&gt;recent survey&lt;/a&gt; of 3,000 game industry professionals found that most game devs don’t think Steam earns its 30 percent revenue cut. Microsoft’s move will only increase the pressure on Valve further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2MIp2U"&gt;Competing with Steam is still a big challenge. Microsoft and Epic Games have both struggled to convince game developers to list titles in their stores to compete with Steam. Epic Games has tried exclusives to lure developers in, but a big part of Microsoft’s struggles have been related to forcing game developers to use UWP in the past, and the terrible Windows store app that exists today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BzFsTw"&gt;Microsoft finally started supporting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645250/microsoft-xbox-game-studios-publishing-valve-steam-32-bit-windows"&gt;traditional win32 games in its store a couple of years ago&lt;/a&gt;, but this change alone hasn’t helped the Windows store compete with Steam. The 12 percent cut might tempt more developers into listing their games in Microsoft’s store, particularly if the company can improve the poor experience for end users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rxMVLEeNGXQBtO2FuEh9C3xAt0c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22477694/096WaLI.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft is promising Windows store improvements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HIcA5y"&gt;Booty is promising just that, with “improved install reliability and faster download speeds over the next few months.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393655/microsoft-windows-app-store-overhaul-apps-games-rumor"&gt;Microsoft is also reportedly working on an overhaul to its Windows store&lt;/a&gt; that could pave the way for developers to be able to submit any Windows application to the store — including browsers like Chrome or Firefox. These store improvements may even allow third-party commerce platforms in apps, which would be a big shift alongside this 12 percent cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpCc9L"&gt;Beyond the store, Microsoft still needs to significantly improve PC gaming. The Xbox Game Bar has been a welcome improvement, but services like Steam and Discord are far more popular than Microsoft’s alternatives. The world’s biggest PC games are also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"&gt;fighting a huge surge in cheaters and hackers&lt;/a&gt;, and Windows doesn’t do enough to help game studios protect their games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbKys4"&gt;“We know that we still have a lot of work to do, but based on the response from both PC gamers and PC game developers, we think that we’re headed in the right direction for this community with the investments we’re making,” says Booty. Microsoft still has more to share on its PC plans and general Windows improvements in the coming months. Booty teases a promising second half of 2021 “when our work across the entire PC ecosystem has the potential to come together in a way that propels the industry forward and brings great games to more gamers around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite will support crossplay and cross-progression on Xbox and PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cj2QdmolOxTy2Y4u8-4Kj4JABHs=/9x0:1805x1197/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204336/haloinfinite.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U5NFrt"&gt;Microsoft is announcing today that &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinit&lt;/em&gt;e will support crossplay and cross-progression when it launches later this year. This will allow PC and Xbox players to match together and play the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; campaign, and the support also extends to multiplayer. Any multiplayer customization and progress will sync across both PC and Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVJvT1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s multiplayer mode &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349236/halo-infinite-multiplayer-free-to-play-120fps-rumors"&gt;will also be free to play&lt;/a&gt; when it launches later this year, with support for up to 120fps in the arena mode on Xbox Series X. Microsoft is also ensuring all of the customizations PC players expect are available inside &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite. &lt;/em&gt;This includes support for ultrawide monitors, triple keybinds, advanced graphics options, and other customizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="A21SnY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Halo Infinite: watch 8 minutes of gameplay on Xbox Series X","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21335520/halo-infinite-gameplay-xbox-series-x-trailer-demo"},{"title":"Microsoft confirms Halo Infinite multiplayer will be free-to-play and up to 120fps ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349236/halo-infinite-multiplayer-free-to-play-120fps-rumors"},{"title":"Halo Infinite is looking a lot better in these 4K screenshots ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22302094/halo-infinite-4k-screenshots-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="S5hkAV"&gt;We’re now waiting to hear more about &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; and when the beta will be available across PC and Xbox ahead of the game’s debut this fall. Developer 343 Industries is still working on improving the visuals in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x"&gt;game was delayed&lt;/a&gt; following criticisms over a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335520/halo-infinite-gameplay-xbox-series-x-trailer-demo"&gt;gameplay demo last summer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; certainly looks a lot better in recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22302094/halo-infinite-4k-screenshots-pc"&gt;4K PC screenshots released by Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, but we haven’t seen any updated gameplay in almost a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nZVPJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinit&lt;/em&gt;e is a “spiritual reboot” of the original &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;making it easy for new players to immediately jump into the story. It includes an open-world environment that’s very similar to &lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with the original Warthog vehicle and the Banished enemies. 343 Industries has also added new mechanics like Master Chief’s new grappling hook and a “Drop Wall” cover.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku does customizable buttons right on the Voice Remote Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LZ-EGmE6YSNq_MtkdoB5kTavNR0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204223/cwelch_20210428_4565_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pLVDcf"&gt;Roku has a strange relationship with remotes: it’s one of the worst offenders when it comes to branded buttons, with a seemingly ever-rotating list of streaming services — Netflix, Sling, even Rdio at one point — that have come and gone over time. One of its remotes even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21436977/roku-touch-remote-button-useless-design-purpose-feature-software-update"&gt;bears a mysterious glyph&lt;/a&gt; that’s never been used for anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pt4Fcb"&gt;And yet, Roku also leads the pack when it comes to customizability. For the last couple years, some of its remotes have offered programmable buttons, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22391174/roku-voice-remote-pro-review-features-price"&gt;its recently released Voice Remote Pro&lt;/a&gt; elevates them to new heights.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fnjLrEIQgdcpFMo2hq6msgItqto=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476645/cwelch_20210428_4565_0001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QxUk3b"&gt;The programmable shortcut keys, labeled with just a 1 and a 2, are almost infinitely customizable. And Roku actually has the software support to back them up in an easy and approachable way, one that the updated Voice Remote Pro’s mic makes even easier with its hands-free commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hBQyB"&gt;Speak any voice command — be it as basic as opening a streaming app that Roku doesn’t have a sponsored button for, or as complex as “lower the volume to 10 percent” — and then press and hold the button afterward, and you instantly create a shortcut to do that action on command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wACWOQ"&gt;As my colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22391174/roku-voice-remote-pro-review-features-price"&gt;Chris Welch explains&lt;/a&gt; in his review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ksWUKp"&gt;The buttons labeled “1” and “2” can save any voice command that Roku supports; just long-press either button after the voice command, and it’ll be set as that button’s function. This can be as simple as using them as two shortcuts for apps that don’t have their own button, like “open HBO Max” or “open Peacock.” But you can also use the shortcut buttons for searches (“show me free movies”), input selection (“switch to antenna TV”), or TV controls (“turn the volume up,” “turn on closed captioning”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cVLRz4"&gt;It’s a clever system, one that leverages Roku’s voice controls to allow for complex commands, without requiring that users muck around with complicated software menus to program in exactly what they want. You just say what you want your Roku to do, and then save it for as long (or as little) as you need. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jHcZdyF6mIoEJGsHE9xc-m-nk4c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476647/cwelch_20210428_4565_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O86dgq"&gt;Roku’s customization system is also easily reprogrammable on the fly: want a dedicated button that just plays &lt;em&gt;Iron Man 2&lt;/em&gt;? You can have it. Trying to learn French by watching Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Lupin&lt;/em&gt;? You can quickly make a button to toggle captions. The only real limit is your imagination (and Roku’s &lt;a href="https://support.roku.com/article/360009552694"&gt;surprisingly deep bench of voice command options&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Z6Hkm"&gt;Roku’s system also helps to alleviate one of the biggest issues with voice assistants — sometimes, you don’t want to bother your housemates with the noise of you constantly asking your TV to change channels. Once programmed, the shortcut buttons make it possible to use complex or long voice commands silently, making them the perfect complement to Roku remotes’ similarly roommate-pacifying headphone feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRZKRV"&gt;It’s a system that’s so useful, it’s a wonder that companies like Apple, Amazon, and Google — all of which feature set-top boxes with their own robust voice assistant setups — aren’t looking to offer a similar feature in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4CmqY"&gt;Voice remotes are all well and good, but at the end of the day, no one wants to hear you shouting over the sound of the latest episode of your favorite show.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Returnal is dark, challenging, and the perfect PS5 showcase</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_QzNXMKVimGJeLegukbrN1aIdnM=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204052/50700424253_e8d902ea3e_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PRQG8S"&gt;We’re nearly six months into the life of the current generation of game consoles, but there are still vanishingly few high-profile exclusives that show off what the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X can do. After getting through the initial wave of launch titles, I’ve spent most of 2021 using my PS5 to play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. But this week sees the launch of &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;, a PS5 exclusive that comes with some caveats. It’s challenging and complex, making it the kind of game you’ll die in repeatedly. But it also might be the best showcase for Sony’s new console yet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvRiUG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; puts you in the spaceboots of an astronaut experiencing the worst case of deja vu imaginable. After crash landing on a mysterious alien planet, she soon realizes she’s stuck in a loop; every time she dies, she heads back to the crash site to start all over again. Each time you explore, you learn just a little bit more about the planet and the astronaut, as well as the rules of the game. With more information and practice, you’ll (hopefully) be able to progress slightly farther each loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPQ9M6"&gt;The game plays out as a third person shooter, but it’s also a mish-mash of many different inspirations and genres. Despite the perspective, &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; often feels like a bullet hell shooter, with alien creatures spitting countless energy orbs for you to avoid. You even get bonuses for avoiding getting hit. (This aspect of the game shouldn’t be too surprising, as &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; was developed by Housemarque, a studio best-known for games like &lt;em&gt;Super Stardust&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Resogun&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oz9cGY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lL2Qa0MQyuE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gmqxuV"&gt;The loop structure also means that the game plays out like a roguelike (think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496904/hades-supergiant-games-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;games like &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Each “run” is different; the planet remixes itself each time you play, and you’ll pick up different weapons and fight different enemies along the way. There are also elements of &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt;, where you’ll come across roadblocks that you can’t get around until you unlock the right item or ability. Early on, for instance, there are electrified webs that block your way, and you can’t cut them down until you get a massive laser sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VoE8kY"&gt;It should also be noted that &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; is extremely hard, combining two notoriously challenging genres — roguelikes and bullet hell shooters — into a game that does little to make itself accessible. In fact, there aren’t even any difficulty options, aside from the ability to turn up the aim assist. The result is an experience where you’ll have to get used to death and failure, and learn from your mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JFS8I6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What stands out is its use of sound and the DualSense controller&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JvvdGG"&gt;It can be frustrating, but it’s worth pushing through for a few reasons. For one, the action feels incredible; zipping around while shooting octopus birds and slicing at evil tree-creatures with a huge sword is a blast. But &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; is also a game that’s just dripping with atmosphere — and it’s only enhanced by some of the PS5’s unique features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1z1JVm"&gt;The dark world you’ll explore feels ripped out of an &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; movie, complete with towering, crumbling ancient ruins, and lots of disturbing bio-engineered technology. This is all rendered in incredible detail, and &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; particularly shines when it comes to special effects; there are all kinds of hypnotically beautiful explosions of light and color, and I especially love the fast travel effect, which sees your character melt away into nothingness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N0ANd9yFrnUghuOUiVjpzZK2Inw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476658/50826660412_71c9837773_k.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="USTWoR"&gt;But there are lots of great-looking PS5 games already. Even last-gen titles look good on the new hardware. What makes &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; stand out in particular is its use of sound and the DualSense controller. I’ve spent most of my time with the game so far wearing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;Sony’s Pulse 3D headphones&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s the first game where I’ve really noticed the 3D audio that the company has touted so much. I could pinpoint monsters by the sounds of their screams and growls, which was extremely helpful, as there’s often so much happening on screen that it can be hard to follow. The sound design also makes the game that much creepier; the alien monsters make unsettling noises as they approach, and it always made me wary when stepping into a new, unknown space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNBuNd"&gt;Meanwhile, I’d go so far as to say it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller"&gt;the best DualSense game since &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which comes bundled with the console in order to show off the gamepad’s unique capabilities. The subtle vibrations mean you can feel the patter of raindrops in your palms, and the burst of each weapon has its own distinct sensation. There are also some really creepy noises that come out of the speaker (though you may miss them with headphones on). My favorite feature, though, is the way &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; utilizes the controller’s adaptive triggers. The left trigger has two phases: push halfway and you can zoom in to aim your main weapon, but click it all the way down and you’ll unleash a special attack. It basically gives the controller an extra button in a way that feels very natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yf86u7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; is definitely an acquired taste. Its looping structure and unforgiving nature means many players will end up frustrated as they struggle through nearly identical scenarios repeatedly. Death isn’t always fun. But it also blends together so many cool things, from the vibe of &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; to the thrill of a great arcade shooter, in a way that’s seamless and deliberate. And if you’re someone who actually managed to pick up a PS5, it’s the kind of game you’ll want to take out to show off what the console can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9L7Wg4"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Returnal &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches on April 30th on the PS5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
