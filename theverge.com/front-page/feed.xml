    <title>Get in on this week’s best tech deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/89o_6EWiilz0oaXZGSzC_IXfAmY=/0x56:2529x1742/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69035366/VizioOLED.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vizio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wqJkb2"&gt;Would you believe that it’s Friday already? That means it’s time for this week’s roundup of tech deals that are better than the rest. We comb through hundreds of deals from a variety of retailers each week, picking only the best sales to tell you about. By the time Friday comes around, some of them have usually expired, but we’ve included the good ones that are still happening below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IQdYO"&gt;Enjoy the weather this weekend if it’s starting to get nice outside where you live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oAKYTw"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gF9219"&gt;Save $10 on &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&lt;/em&gt; before it’s discontinued on March 31st&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dzqyqt"&gt;For reasons only Nintendo can explain, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&lt;/em&gt; will no longer be produced after March 31st. Even the digital version of the game will be delisted on the eShop. So if you want the game while it’s still relatively easy to find (and affordable to buy), head over to Walmart where you can get the compilation that contains &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; for $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ATwu7M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10355141"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LJCK37"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gFqFmT"&gt;Save $150 on Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones by buying refurbished at eBay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E3i83I"&gt;Normally, we recommend buying products new when possible (especially headphones), but this deal’s too good to pass up. At eBay, a well-rated seller is offering a like-new set of Sony’s high-end noise-canceling headphones for $208 before tax (originally $349 new). And with offer code &lt;strong&gt;PICKCR5 &lt;/strong&gt;added at checkout, you can knock the price down to $198.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgD3xt"&gt;We feature deals on this model a lot. And there’s a reason for that: they sound fantastic, and they’re comfortable. If you want to see what they’re all about — and save a bunch of money — check out this deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0Y0tjZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10411678" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="unDnzE"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NB7xHF"&gt;Vizio’s 55-inch OLED TV is back down to $1,000 at Best Buy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aLRrlQ"&gt;It’s been about a month and change since Vizio knocked the price of its debut OLED TV down to $1,000, but that time has returned. This model’s OLED panel has unparalleled picture quality and color accuracy compared to LCD, and its HDMI 2.1 ports allow the Xbox Series X, PS5, and PCs with certain graphics cards to display up to 4K at 120 frames per second in games that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5U9oWS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733767"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="pXftAc"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c6v6PQ"&gt;Save $10 on &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; for Nintendo Switch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gBk7yo"&gt;At eBay, you can get the new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F284205856974%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F3%2F27%2F22352334%2Fvizio-oled-4k-hdr-tv-sony-wh1000xm4-headphones-deal-sale-amazon-ebay-best-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; for $50&lt;/a&gt; instead of $60. It’s a small discount for the game, which just released Friday, March 26th. But if you wanted to jump in (and can wait a few days for this physical edition to deliver), you’ll save a bit with this deal. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352085/monster-hunter-rise-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;Check out our review&lt;/a&gt; for this game.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose Frames Tempo review: the specs to beat</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Bose’s sporty shades offer good sound, a steady fit, and total awareness&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="FNpYyb"&gt;It’s still fair to call audio sunglasses a niche category, but with Bose offering several models, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;Amazon in the game&lt;/a&gt;, and counting recent announcements from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314474/razer-anzu-smart-glasses-announced-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;Razer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22219425/jlab-audio-jbuds-frames-open-ear-headphones-price-release-date"&gt;JLab&lt;/a&gt;, it’s certainly a growing one. There are people out there who just aren’t particularly fond of earbuds — often because they dislike the feeling of silicone tips plugging up their ears. Open-style products like the standard AirPods and Galaxy Buds Live are one alternative, but then you still face the possibility of losing them. If you’re running on a trail or out for an intense bike ride, it’s not an insignificant risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7ENkh"&gt;For those people, I can absolutely see the appeal of the Bose Frames Tempo, which have speakers built right into their frame and will stay planted on their face no matter how strenuous outdoor activity gets. The Tempo glasses are the sportiest model of Bose’s Frames family, clearly geared at hikers, runners, cyclists, and anyone else who spends a good chunk of their time outside. Bose says they’ve also got the best sound performance of the bunch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sFRdRG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10414314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ejbqly"&gt;From the front, they look like your typical pair of Oakley, Nike, or Under Armour sunglasses. Bose is clearly going after that same market with the $250 Tempos. If you’re more fashion-forward or looking for a pair of audio sunglasses that don’t give the impression you’re in the middle of a triathlon, you’ll want to stick with the Tenor or Soprano styles of Frames. These come with black mirrored lenses in the box, but Bose also sells a couple of other pairs of $40 lenses that you can swap in to let different amounts of light pass through. The oversized temples are where it becomes more obvious that these are audio sunglasses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OnX4us"&gt;But there’s a benefit to that chunky design: unlike the Tenor and Soprano Frames, which use a proprietary charger, the Tempo model has a regular USB-C connector on the left temple. Bose says the frame is made from “TR-90 nylon.” There’s not much give, but they feel rugged to me, and they’ve got an IPX4 water and sweat resistance rating, so if you get caught running or biking in the rain, they’ll survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/31eYWBrkY8nTLxTrG9Wu6O0Vs7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297692/cwelch_200927_4359_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The large temples are the obvious tell that these are audio sunglasses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C5-w4FzhCl2WmB3MC2SAh-YuzDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297697/cwelch_200927_4359_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Frames Tempo have simple controls that let you stay focused on your activity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q8gtu0rHkK8xmhoe_hgSeyaNoEk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297700/cwelch_200927_4359_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three sizes of nose pads come included.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0Y8ORN"&gt;For the first couple of days wearing the Tempos, I felt a slight squeeze at the sides of my head that got uncomfortable. Now, I’ve got an extremely large dome — they used to have to bring out a special-sized helmet in Little League, friends — but thankfully, the fit loosened up a bit because this pressure went away by the end of the first week. The sunglasses didn’t get loose enough to where they started bobbing on my head or anything; they still felt nice and secure. (My friend Theresa, who has a normal-sized head, never mentioned any headache-inducing tightness.) Bose includes three sizes of nose tips in the box, and I found the large to be the right match. Even if my face was covered in sweat from a long run, the nose tips helped ensure the sunglasses didn’t slide around. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z1g2o-AkX8tJRZDQdhItRqKiaEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297695/cwelch_200927_4359_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The frames have an IPX4 rating for water and sweat resistance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uyqKV7"&gt;The controls that Bose came up with are wonderfully foolproof, which is crucial when you’re trying to stay focused on other things. You swipe across the right temple to raise or lower the volume, and on the underside of that temple is a small circular button that you can press to play / pause, double-tap to skip tracks, or triple-tap to go back. In no time at all, these controls felt so natural and &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;. Powering off the Frames Tempo just takes holding down the button for a few seconds. Or you can flip them over and lay them down with the top of the frame on a surface. After two seconds in that orientation, they shut off. (You can disable this in settings, but I found it really convenient and, again, natural.) Battery life is listed as eight hours, and that’s lined up with my experience so far. The sunglasses take roughly an hour to charge back to 100 percent. Bose’s mobile app lets you update the sunglasses’ firmware, but there aren’t any EQ controls or other options that adjust their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N0H3LshrVobE92af08xzWK5myl4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297702/cwelch_200927_4359_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sunglasses stay firmly in place through all sorts of outdoor activities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DWoQIu"&gt;Describing the sound quality of audio sunglasses can be tricky. They’re nothing like headphones or earbuds since these are essentially down-firing speakers pointed at your ears. But Bose stepped up its game compared to the first-generation Frames, which I’ve tried on occasion. These have more life to them across the whole EQ range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="NGrMoF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10414391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kop70c"&gt;There’s a surprising amount of separation between vocals and instrumentation, and the Frames Tempo have a nice clarity and even-handed balance. There’s more bass than before, but this is where I think it’s most important to set reasonable expectations: the low end you get from any decent pair of in-ear buds will blow these out of the water. No contest. That said, Bose has at least reached a place where the bass no longer sounds anemic or flat, which is a legitimate improvement over the first-gen Frames. It’s there and perceptible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsBupf"&gt;Sound bleed is easily canceled out by everyday street noise, but if you’re inside with the volume turned up, people nearby will be able to tell that you’re listening to music. These are sunglasses, after all, so I imagine those situations will be few and far between. The Bluetooth connection has held stable throughout the vast majority of my time with the Frames Tempo so far. No complaints there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZPrsZ"&gt;Voice calls while wearing the Tempos have also been a joy. Callers say I sound nearly as good as when speaking directly into my phone, and something about taking calls with your ears totally open just feels very cool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jnzrc3nz17qM7RC_2LLjDsfjCxk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399542/cwelch_200927_4359_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose sells additional $40 pairs of lenses that let in different amounts of light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3mlr5M"&gt;Even after a relatively short time using the Frames Tempo, I get this audio glasses thing. I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; get it. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22330833/open-ear-headphones-review-best-bike-riding"&gt;It’s like Dieter recently wrote&lt;/a&gt;: “Not having to put in or take out headphones changes your relationship to audio — it’s just always available, always there when you want it.” Do I wish I could pop clear lenses into them and wear them everywhere? In theory, you bet. But this style wouldn’t really work for that, nor is it what the Tempos are meant to be at the end of the day. So I can’t knock Bose for the disappointment I feel when switching back to my normal glasses, which now seem so very primitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="FnaDAD"&gt;The Bose Frames Tempo let you hear the world around you with no obstructions — with a soundtrack playing over everything, while at the same time giving your ears a bit of a break compared to normal earbuds. At $250, they will be a tough sell for some. But I’ve come to realize that audio sunglasses are the exact sort of thing you won’t ever realize you needed. Until you put ‘em on — and all of a sudden, you do. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I do not Feel Good Inc about the Gorillaz NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CLVrlvLoQcKKS2ENEyhSQwFfbuM=/0x0:2004x1336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69034271/Screen_Shot_2021_03_26_at_3.21.40_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me, after the ice caps melt.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04mfKJWDSzI" target="_blank"&gt;Gorrilaz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dCdjY2"&gt;Virtual band Gorillaz’s debut album is turning 20 years old today (a fact I’m going to try to immediately forget), and in celebration the group will be carrying out the usual anniversary celebrations: re-releasing albums, selling new merch and, &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/gorillaz-celebrate-20-years-of-their-self-titled-debut-album-2908720"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;NME&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, selling NFTs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAM2Z6"&gt;This news has &lt;em&gt;Broken&lt;/em&gt; me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="endB6v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kMMtXa"&gt;At this point, it’s pretty clear that NFTs are a thorny environmental issue — while it can be hard to calculate exactly how bad they are in terms of carbon emissions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;the picture is not looking good&lt;/a&gt;. In general, upon seeing the torrent of NFT news, it’s been easy to needle people about participating in a marketplace that is doing actual damage to the world: “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/3/17/22336115/charmin-nft-toilet-paper-cryptoart-marketing"&gt;Okay, Brand&lt;/a&gt;, hope this marketing stunt was worth setting the Earth on fire?” Turns out it’s not as fun when someone you actually like is doing it, especially if that artist has previously &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSffezqR_XA&amp;amp;list=PLxzSZG7g8c8xYzHnxKrYxJ2FobX8rd2_C"&gt;made&lt;em&gt; an entire album about ecological destruction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qPORhn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;O green world, don’t desert me now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qhRfBk"&gt;I don’t want to come off like I’m trying to cancel Gorillaz, or say it’s bad for artists to make money. Artists should absolutely be paid more for their work, and I’m all for them trying to come up with new things to sell to fans willing to pay. But NFTs come with a cost that’s hard to justify, and seeing a band I like seemingly ignore that has left me sitting on a &lt;em&gt;Melancholy Hill.&lt;/em&gt; And I’m not &lt;em&gt;All Alone&lt;/em&gt; — there have been &lt;a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/gorillaz/gorillaz-self-titled-nfts/"&gt;plenty of other fans voicing their disappointment&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. It probably doesn’t help that their ecological album was called &lt;em&gt;Plastic Beach&lt;/em&gt;, and they’re reportedly working with a company called Superplastic to sell the NFTs&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Life comes at you fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRIpyb"&gt;If you’re an artist, here’s a &lt;em&gt;Song 2 &lt;/em&gt;repeat: &lt;/p&gt;

Martin, the author of the &lt;em&gt;A Song of Ice and Fire&lt;/em&gt; book series that was turned into HBO’s smash hit &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, has signed a huge new deal with HBO to make content for the network and HBO Max, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/george-r-r-martin-signs-massive-five-year-overall-deal-with-hbo-exclusive"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a five-year deal worth “mid-eight figures,” sources told &lt;em&gt;THR.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnEdEi"&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;ended in 2019, HBO owner WarnerMedia has already announced a prequel series, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21067850/house-of-the-dragon-hbo-game-of-thrones-prequel-premiere-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;House of the Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;based on Martin’s 2019 book &lt;em&gt;Fire and Blood. &lt;/em&gt;And there are five projects in development based on the &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; universe, &lt;em&gt;THR &lt;/em&gt;reports. Martin is also developing series for HBO based on the novels &lt;em&gt;Who Fears Death &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Roadmarks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVoTVk"&gt;My worst fear, though, is that this huge new deal keeps Martin from working on the sixth book in the &lt;em&gt;A Song of Ice and Fire&lt;/em&gt; book series, &lt;em&gt;The Winds of Winter&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2021/02/02/reflections-on-a-bad-year/"&gt;The author said in February&lt;/a&gt; that he wrote “hundreds and hundreds of pages” of &lt;em&gt;The Winds of Winter &lt;/em&gt;in 2020, which was the “best year” he’s had on the book. Fingers crossed he’s been keeping that momentum going. The previous title in the seven-book series, &lt;em&gt;A Dance with Dragons&lt;/em&gt;, was released in July 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wait, GameStop sells GPUs now?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jg8EBPMRBEAuirHUQ-FYoWlZw4o=/0x0:2200x1467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69034003/20170822_Sean_Hollister_Verge_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ps4rDY"&gt;GameStop has sold PC gaming hardware for a while now, including entire gaming laptops, monitors, headphones, mice and speakers, but in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323839/gamestop-stock-price-dramatic-rise-fall-stonks-return"&gt;the post-stonks era&lt;/a&gt; it apparently wants a piece of Best Buy and Newegg’s desktop components business as well. Most prominently, the company has started selling Nvidia RTX 3000 series graphics cards — where by “selling,” I mean engaging in the same sort of barely-there, blink-and-they’re-gone listings as every other purveyor of GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYaR9T"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gamestop-starts-selling-gpus-obviously-doesnt-have-any-gpus-to-sell/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, GameStop made its entire weekly circular ad revolve around PC gaming this week, including several GPUs, motherboards, a power supply, and a case:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WeJRF96V6DEU-ekTmI6HCz1PSzw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22401083/gamestop_weekly_ad.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameStop’s weekly circular for March 21st-27th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DebatL"&gt;Back in reality, though, GameStop sold out of these GPUs days ago, roughly the instant they  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GameStop/status/1374420993607831561"&gt;first went on sale&lt;/a&gt;. Judging by the replies to GameStop’s tweets, this was the typical reaction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JMTvIQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;wanted a 3080 but javascript happened &lt;a href="https://t.co/ILZor3DWvd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ILZor3DWvd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 『ᴇɴ ᴠᴛᴜʙᴇʀ』Freya @ TFF SUN 3/28 3AM EDT (@FreyaFloof) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FreyaFloof/status/1374424835833483264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FafEE2"&gt;And as best as I can tell, the entirety of GameStop’s PC component selection consists of two motherboards right now. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oSiK5m_FlRxaiT7Mcgw5Pvb-Zoo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22401091/gamestop_selection_hardware.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The selection of GameStop PC hardware that is “available now.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="etV0CP"&gt;It’s hard to blame GameStop for selling out of components, though, hilarious Javascript or no — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;the street prices of Nvidia and AMD GPUs are utterly out of control&lt;/a&gt;, selling for 2x-3x their worth. I just don’t understand why GameStop would even bother to try during the shortage. Maybe it could refurbish old graphics cards at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/10/3230609/gamestop-tour-interview-spawn-labs-paul-raines-tony-bartel"&gt;its refurbishment plant&lt;/a&gt;? Even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278562/nvidia-rtx-2060-gtx-1050-ti-gpu-shortage-global-chip"&gt;older cards are in high demand&lt;/a&gt; right now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon gets FDA authorization for an at-home COVID-19 test kit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OCwR2AlUfZ93EApaYK_4BGaO8TY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69033532/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nWj5B7"&gt;Amazon received Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/147050/download"&gt;authorization&lt;/a&gt; for a COVID-19 test made by its&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;subsidiary STS Lab Holdco, and it plans to use it for its onsite coronavirus testing programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PznzYo"&gt;The test is done using a nasal self swab that can be done either under the supervision of a health care provider or as part of an at-home kit where a patient takes their own sample and mails it to a centralized lab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuwEFz"&gt;“Amazon plans to use the Amazon Real-Time RT-PCR Test for Detecting SARS-CoV-2 (Amazon Test) as part of the company’s overall Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) preparedness and response program,” the FDA’s &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/147053/download"&gt;authorization reads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEi4an"&gt;The authorization also describes Amazon’s employee-screening program. Some Amazon employees will be automatically given testing appointments around every 14 days. The tests are voluntary. “Amazon has partnered with a third-party healthcare provider who will issue the necessary prescriptions and individual test orders,” the authorization said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQJAZa"&gt;The authorization letter is addressed to Cem Sibay, the vice president of Amazon Labs. Last summer, Amazon tapped Sibay to build its in-house COVID-19 testing lab, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-cem-sibay-now-leading-covid-19-test-lab-2020-7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. In October, &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/how-we-ramped-up-onsite-covid-19-testing-for-amazon-employees"&gt;the company said&lt;/a&gt; it had the infrastructure to run tens of thousands of tests for employees each day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQs5jT"&gt;The new test is a modification of another COVID-19 test made by&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;BGI Genomics, which &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/147053/download"&gt;the authorization&lt;/a&gt; said Amazon used at the end of August. The company began using the modified version that would become the Amazon test on August 28th, 2020. Between late September and early December 2020, it ran over 560,000 samples, according to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/147053/download"&gt;the authorization&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DnXDCu"&gt;Amazon started selling at-home COVID-19 testing kits made by genomics company DxTerity &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2021/01/06/amazon-sells-home-covid-19-testing-kits-cases-continue-rise/6561595002/"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;. That test sells for $110. The company continues to expand into health care: last week, it announced that it would start offering its in-house telehealth and at-home health care program to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336010/amazon-care-expand-employees-virtual"&gt;other companies&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon has also expressed interest in medical testing before. In 2018, the company &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/amazon-explored-medical-diagnostics-was-in-talks-to-buy-confer-health.html"&gt;was in talks&lt;/a&gt; to buy diagnostics company Confer Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PY0lIs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Fast charging and elegant software offset a so-so camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KqtAyf"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro is a legitimate flagship phone that is genuinely competitive with the best Android phones on the market — at least from a features and quality perspective. Yet in terms of market and mind share, it’s still destined to be a niche device for a small group of enthusiasts looking for a specific kind of elegance in their Android device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAjS4O"&gt;And that’s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0Ns9M"&gt;If you live in the US and you’re buying an Android phone, chances are very high that you’ll end up with a Samsung Galaxy phone. Samsung has the carrier relationships, quality, and marketing that have led directly to market share. LG, Motorola, and even &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america"&gt;sell more phones here than OnePlus does&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4shcPS"&gt;But after nearly seven years and dozens of phones, OnePlus has established itself as a brand that can make great phones that are serious alternatives to the mainstream. The $969 OnePlus 9 Pro achieves that goal with only a handful of notable compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2jYBg"&gt;OnePlus’ flagship phones always come with a laundry list of top-of-the-line specs, but what makes the OnePlus 9 Pro good isn’t the numbers; it’s how well those specs translate into one of the best experiences you can get using Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AHu1Vy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi-pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"},{"title":"This $159 OnePlus Watch is OnePlus’ first smartwatch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22334322/oneplus-watch-smartwatch-features-price-specs-battery"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro announced with Hasselblad-branded cameras ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22340406/oneplus-9-phone-price-release-date-availability"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hpoEZD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10406462"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 Pro has an elegant design, but won’t support 5G on all networks" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NjdZe-bk4k4KgMTns8qChqCoZ-o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388892/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0068.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro has an elegant design but won’t support 5G on all networks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bQiCrq"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro hardware design and 5G support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rZIXVc"&gt;The hardware design on the OnePlus 9 Pro is the most seamless, elegant phone that the company has designed to date. It is, of course, big. It has a 6.7-inch screen that goes from edge to edge in a body that’s narrow enough to make it just barely usable for me in one hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MZ4NI"&gt;What I can’t help but notice is how far OnePlus has come in build quality. The glass on the front and back curves into the aluminum rail on the edges with no seams at all. It’s well-balanced, beautiful, and solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Top: OnePlus 9 Pro; bottom: Galaxy S20 Plus. Both phones have similarly curved glass and molded aluminum rails." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sTvlAj6Darv2g-R9N0QJ9O44UZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389264/oneplus9progalaxys20plus.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Top: OnePlus 9 Pro. Bottom: Galaxy S20 Plus. Both phones have similarly curved glass and molded aluminum rails.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It has a three-stage ringer switch" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hAp70uBpGGWtFpcHUizuZRTE4QI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388880/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0054_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It has a three-stage ringer switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYWqZR"&gt;It’s also the spitting image of a Galaxy S20 Plus. Shift a couple of buttons around, move the selfie camera to the middle, and swap out the logo, and it’s the same design. I get that there are only so many ways to sandwich curved glass and aluminum together, but it’s uncanny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSjJvc"&gt;To be fair, OnePlus does keep some of its identity in the three-stage ringer switch, which easily lets you toggle between a ringer, vibration, and fully silent. It may still be my favorite feature on OnePlus phones, and I remain baffled as to why more Android phone makers don’t adopt a physical ringer switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVSttu"&gt;Speaking of vibration, the haptics on the OnePlus 9 Pro aren’t sloppy at all, unlike many Android phones. Unfortunately, the trade-off is that they aren’t very strong; I often can’t feel it vibrate in my pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6vr0E"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro has the top-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is paired with eight gigs of RAM on the 128GB model. You can’t get it in a smaller screen size, but you can spend $100 more to get 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM. There’s no microSD card slot for storage expansion in either model. What you get is what you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMXoXr"&gt;It supports both Sub-6 and millimeter-wave (mmWave) styles of 5G, but there’s a significant caveat: the phone supports it, but OnePlus has only managed to land 5G certification from its carrier partner, T-Mobile. If you buy it unlocked, as of now, it will only work with T-Mobile’s 5G network. Everything else will be LTE. AT&amp;amp;T 5G support doesn’t appear to be in the cards at all, and as for Verizon, OnePlus says that it “continues to work with Verizon to certify both the 9 and 9 Pro on its 5G network.” Later, on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353052/oneplus-9-pro-verizon-5g-network-certified"&gt;March 26th, Verizon announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would support 5G on the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OnePlus’ wireless warp charger can fully charge the phone in under 45 minutes" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gyFkyRjI2k4qCPN085Bz4kQTDBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388875/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus’ wireless warp charger can fully charge the phone in under 45 minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="w5puLi"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro battery and charging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zfl3AK"&gt;For OnePlus, the standout spec is its proprietary charging technology. There’s a 65W charger included in the box, and it can charge up the phone ridiculously fast. The phone’s 4,500mAh battery is actually split in two, which helps further speed charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 65W charger comes in the box (pictured with the regular OnePlus 9)." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bYtldbablBg79ONjjiRExDVLu8E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388874/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0044.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 65W charger comes in the box (pictured with the regular OnePlus 9).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJcrVY"&gt;If you like, you can spend an additional $69 on OnePlus’ new Warp Charge 50 wireless charger. It charges at 25W, but since the battery is split, it’s essentially the same as charging at 50W, wirelessly. It also works if you set the phone on the charger in landscape mode. With the phone fully dead, it charged completely in 45 minutes. With ambient mode in Google Assistant on, it took a bit longer — but it was still wicked fast compared to other wireless chargers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1P12A6"&gt;That 4,500mAh battery was enough to get me through a full day and a half of moderately heavy usage. However, OnePlus phones do tend to be a little more variable in their battery life depending on use. Spending a day shooting 4K video and pushing the processor with games meant I could kill it with less than four hours of screen-on time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fG6qV"&gt;So while the battery life might not be best in class, the way OnePlus has built its ecosystem for charging means I’m able to top off faster than I can with other phones — provided I use OnePlus’ proprietary chargers, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 Pro has an LTPO OLED screen, which can help with battery life" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B5cHhLu_Wn4xSxFlJ9pZp5KWWUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388890/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0066.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro has an LTPO OLED screen, which can help with battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X8qQlG"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="OAFOOG"&gt;After wireless charging, the next standout spec on the OnePlus 9 Pro is that 6.7-inch screen. Like Samsung, OnePlus has switched over to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;an LTPO style of OLED&lt;/a&gt;, which can be more power efficient and allows the company to have more control over the refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQ9Qor"&gt;The screen can go all the way from 120Hz on down to 1Hz, depending on what’s happening on the display. OnePlus has branded the touch response rate on the screen as “Hyper Touch,” clocked at 360Hz for certain games, and though I am dubious it makes that big a difference for gamers, OnePlus says it could. More consequential is the screen resolution: 1440 x 3216 at 525ppi. You can leave it at that high resolution and have the high refresh rate screen going at the same time. Doing so probably hits battery life, but to me, the point of this max-spec phone is to max the specs, so I didn’t turn down the resolution or the refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yI05D4"&gt;Those are the specs on the screen, but it’s the experience that matters. And again, I think OnePlus has done a remarkable job here. Something about the tuning of the animations in OxygenOS makes this phone feel just a little bit smoother than even Samsung phones. I also appreciate the color tuning — although it’s not as subdued as an iPhone or even a Pixel, it’s more restrained than Samsung’s default settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid, but has room to improve" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBNXzq7K6YNBtQHo8bKFRoCNvZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388879/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0053_Edit_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid but has room to improve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0avD9X"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bt7aQC"&gt;Without delving into a lot of history, I will just point out that until very recently, camera quality has been the main downfall for OnePlus phones. It’s a particularly bad way to fall down, too, because often, the clearest and simplest way to compare phones that otherwise look and perform nearly equivalently is to look at the photos they take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95RI9o"&gt;OnePlus knows all of this and wants to position the OnePlus 9 Pro as a heads-up competitor — or at least a viable alternative — to the very best Samsung and even Apple have to offer. So it did a thing a lot of challenger brands do: called in a ringer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="G9j19S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Hasselblad partnership is only about color tuning and interface design this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Xt3br"&gt;That ringer is Hasselblad, which OnePlus is partnering with to improve its camera results. It will be a multiyear effort, and it’s far from guaranteed it’ll be a fruitful partnership. In fact, most of these sorts of deals don’t really do anything notable when it comes to the camera’s quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhWaA4"&gt;This year, Hasselblad’s participation with OnePlus’ development process amounted to helping the company tune the colors from the camera and lending a bit of its interface to the camera’s Pro mode. Oh, and most importantly for OnePlus, Hasselblad allowed its logo to be stamped next to the lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOkITZ"&gt;I do think there’s some credit due to this color-tuning influence. In the same way that other smartphone brands have a “look” to their photos, I think OnePlus is developing its own. iPhone photos are generally flat and neutral, tending to the warm side of color; Pixel photos contrasty and blue; and Samsung photos have the vibrancy slider set to max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus tends to ramp up blue colors, which is usually fine but can sometimes get the camera into trouble.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OnePlus does a good job not adding too much vibrancy when it’s not there in the first place" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XaIF0PK3g-pGh0OMJy-SxrBH9XU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389336/15_LE2125_IMG_20210313_110553.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus does a good job of not adding too much vibrancy when it’s not there in the first place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vFHBSJ"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro’s image output lands mostly in the middle. It tends toward blue, and it definitely lifts up shadows to create more even lighting. Its photos are more striking but less accurate than what you’ll get out of an iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yYysn"&gt;The camera system is good, but it can’t quite match the quality you get from an iPhone 12 Pro Max or Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra — both of which cost more than the OnePlus 9 Pro. It handles a variety of conditions quite well, but sometimes I just had to take an extra beat to compose my shot. It let me better judge what the viewfinder was showing and, honestly, gave me time to try the shot again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ps0XCc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10406526"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GnGiG3"&gt;As usual with smartphone cameras, I think the difference comes down to software. I like the colors the 9 Pro produces, but sometimes it just tries too hard and whiffs. Similarly, OnePlus seems to want to bring a little of that Pixel contrast magic to bear but instead just oversharpens. And lightening shadows is sometimes laudable, but not when it adds completely unnecessary and distracting image noise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The camera can try too hard to brighten shadows, introducing noise" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CF7YOM7t6e5tB0A06yC8faoLao4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389355/18_LE2125_IMG_20210313_112304.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera can try too hard to brighten shadows, introducing noise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The camera oversharpens sometimes, too. Take a look at the fringing around the runners on the lake in this ultrawide shot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gDooOLmKNWq0aQR0K3UtcKZlt6Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389354/06_LE2125_IMG_20210311_160459.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera oversharpens sometimes, too. Take a look at the fringing around the runners on the lake in this ultrawide shot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jmns55"&gt;The main camera uses a new 48-megapixel Sony sensor with OIS, though when I pressed OnePlus to tell me what exactly that sensor brings to the table, I didn’t really get a clear answer. You can shoot 12-bit RAW images in the Pro mode (which is two bits more than last year, if you’re keeping count). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noaYb1"&gt;That’s all nice, but the interface on Pro mode is what gets me. You can clearly see what’s set to manual and what’s in auto mode. It’s simple and easy to use, too. Best of all is focus peaking, which draws little lines over the part of the image that’s in focus. It is a lot clearer and more fun to use than the tap-to-focus you need to use on other phones. (You can do that here, too, of course.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qMoum"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro’s other cameras include a big, 50-megapixel ultrawide with a sensor that’s quite a lot nicer than the usual step-down sensors ultrawides get stuck with. I loved using it right up until it went haywire with sharpening. OnePlus put in a custom lens to help with distortion at the edges, and it works as well or better than pure software fixes at keeping straight lines from bowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGBpJb"&gt;The telephoto camera is 3.3x, and it’s not anything special at that zoom level. Beyond it, digital zoom is kind of a mess. It gets pantsed by the S21 Ultra with its periscope-style lens. There’s also a monochrome camera that serves only as a helper for the rest of the system, but I suspect it’s not doing anything especially important. OnePlus did drop the gimmicky and pointless “color filter” camera from last year’s 8 Pro this time around. It will probably drop the monochrome camera next year, if I had to guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="exkR3H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10406545"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TReqrH"&gt;OnePlus’ software-focused Nightscape mode works really well for capturing nighttime shots, although to my tastes, it over-brightens the image. Portrait mode is a mixed bag; heads often look artificially cut out from the blurry background. Again, I can get good shots, but portrait mode was often one of those situations where I needed to try the shot a second time. The selfie camera is passable in good light but falls down fast in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkqOPE"&gt;Unfortunately, video is equally messy. The OnePlus 9 Pro will let you shoot up to 8K 30 or 4K 120, but neither looked good. In fact, regular old 4K 30 has that overprocessed and oversharpened look you see so often from smartphones. The big new feature is improved HDR for backlit subjects, but the effect is minimal at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uC8chD"&gt;That’s a whole pile of critical takes compared to phones that cost more than this phone. But despite the price difference, I think the OnePlus 9 Pro’s camera should be held to as high a standard as possible — it’s a flagship phone. It can sometimes hang with the best of the best, and that’s a win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pLQs9q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10406554"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can put all your widgets in a drop-down menu instead of on your home screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZN4UWi"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro performance and OxygenOS 11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iYZu5Q"&gt;Even though the camera is often the main differentiator for an Android phone, it’s not necessarily everybody’s highest priority. When I’m not pixel-peeping photos, the OnePlus 9 Pro is the best Android phone I’ve used so far this year. The performance is great. I’m especially impressed with the optical in-screen fingerprint sensor, which is super fast and doesn’t seem to be thrown by weird lighting conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHyiSQ"&gt;OnePlus’ version of Android is called OxygenOS, and it’s now at version 11. The company has borrowed Samsung’s idea of shifting content down to meet your thumb and added in support for an always-on ambient display. The animations feel smooth, and OnePlus has learned its lesson about how annoying it can be to have apps close in the background too often. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bWqNDM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;OnePlus has a more elegant version of Android than Samsung&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eOb2Eg"&gt;OnePlus has committed to two major OS updates and three years of bimonthly security updates, which puts it ahead of brands like LG but behind Samsung and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpxgUZ"&gt;You can customize a few things like the font and icons, too. My favorite customization is an ambient display mode that displays a colorful bar that shows how often you’ve been using your phone throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXAAvg"&gt;One feature borrowed from Apple and / or Microsoft is the ability to put your widgets into a separate panel so they’re not littering your main home screen, accessible via a quick swipe down. I love it, but I wish it wasn’t mapped to the same thing other Android phones use to quickly bring down notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIRq8d"&gt;Mostly, though, OxygenOS just feels &lt;em&gt;chill&lt;/em&gt;, especially compared to Samsung. OnePlus isn’t pushing its own ecosystem of apps and services (though with a new OnePlus Watch coming, perhaps that may change). It’s also not festooning its own apps with advertisements, unlike Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="waqTIv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10406439"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="p8uB5Z"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro is not a “flagship killer.” It’s a flagship. Although it still costs a little less than its top-tier competitors, it nevertheless is a pricey phone that makes a lot of promises. Mostly, it delivers on them. Even though a tiny fraction of customers buy OnePlus phones compared to Apple and Samsung, the company has built a track record long enough to deserve its status as an established brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GhSKH3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The regular OnePlus 9 is a fine choice for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NA5uRY"&gt;If you’re considering one of the new OnePlus phones, I am actually hard-pressed to make the case for the OnePlus 9 Pro over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;regular OnePlus 9, which Allison Johnson reviewed.&lt;/a&gt; The regular OnePlus 9 is $240 less, and the things you lose are mostly the nice-to-haves that justify the Pro’s existence: fast wireless charging, OIS, a telephoto lens, mmWave 5G, and the slightly larger screen. The cheaper OnePlus 9 lacks telephoto, but its other cameras take photos that are nearly equivalent to the pro. It has a high refresh rate screen, fast wired charging, wireless charging (though it’s not as fast), and most importantly, a nice OnePlus software experience with great performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="mMX9ur"&gt;The reason to opt for the 9 Pro over the regular 9 is in some ways the same reason you’d opt for a OnePlus phone over a Samsung phone in the first place: it’s just a little nicer and a little different than what everybody else has in their pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iuxd2s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 26th, 2021 5pm ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353052/oneplus-9-pro-verizon-5g-network-certified"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon announced&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; it would support 5G on the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro and OnePlus confirmed they will not work on AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network. The review has been updated to note the new information. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The OnePlus 9 gives up a few of the 9 Pro’s features but costs $240 less&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="IFjJBH"&gt;The OnePlus 9 is a very good phone that holds its own against other (often more expensive) flagships. It has all the things that truly matter: a great screen, excellent performance, good battery life, and a capable camera. But for better or worse, it still doesn’t feel quite like a device that’s well-suited for the mainstream. It misses a couple of features present on the competition like a stabilized main camera and broad 5G support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9PITs"&gt;Instead, it offers some neat but arguably not as useful extras, like really fast charging and an excellent ultrawide camera. It leaves this device in somewhat unusual territory: it’s good and well-priced, but it’s not the Android flagship I’d recommend to just anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6QDFvf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10406322"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WeBHsj"&gt;What’s here is good; it’s what’s missing that gives me pause. For example, it’s a 5G phone that, at launch, won’t work on two of the three major US carriers’ 5G networks: Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T. OnePlus says it’s working with Verizon on 5G certification, and on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353052/oneplus-9-pro-verizon-5g-network-certified"&gt;March 26th Verizon announced&lt;/a&gt; it would support 5G. However, OnePlus says that the OnePlus 9 will not support 5G on AT&amp;amp;T. (T-Mobile is selling the OnePlus 9 directly, and as a result, it has no problems with the carrier’s low and mid-band 5G service.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ge5BFF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="HDWb3J"&gt;Likewise with the main camera’s lack of optical image stabilization, you may end up with photos that look a bit soft due to camera shake in moderate to dim light. Taking a few extra shots will usually ensure that there’s a tack-sharp one in the bunch, but that workaround doesn’t suit everybody or every situation. OIS would also be a big help with keeping video steady; the 9 offers decent electronic stabilization for this, but results aren’t as smooth as when both technologies are used together. You might know already if you can live with these quirks, but they’re too significant to make this a top all-around pick for the average smartphone buyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qLAqX"&gt;If you’re curious how the 9 stacks up against the higher specs of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;9 Pro sibling&lt;/a&gt;, I have better news: if you opt for this less expensive model, you give up very little. The 9 offers the same Snapdragon 888 processor, top 120Hz refresh rate, 50-megapixel ultrawide camera, and Gorilla Glass back panel as the 9 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0XHjwE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It adds up to a phone that feels like a small step forward, rather than a confident stride into mainstream flagship territory&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HIz4ke"&gt;Here’s what you don’t get versus the more expensive model: a newer 48-megapixel Sony IMX789 main camera sensor, a telephoto camera, main camera stabilization, fast wireless charging, a higher-res screen, millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G, and in some cases, an official IP water and dust resistance rating. Sure, some of those features would be nice to have, but for an additional $240? Personally, I’d save the extra cash and go with the 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oS8IAs"&gt;Compared to last year’s OnePlus 8, the 9 is a little more expensive but also a little better equipped. While you do gain some useful features including 15W Qi wireless charging, a refresh rate boost from 90Hz to 120Hz, Qualcomm’s latest processor, and a bit bigger battery, these feel like necessary evolutions. It adds up to a phone that feels like a small step forward, rather than a confident stride into mainstream flagship territory. That’s a shame because OnePlus had an opportunity to own this premium midrange category that it helped create with a clear standout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 has a slightly smaller screen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7cetFjAfrRKtYErNsip_4ScK7t4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388898/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0077_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 (right) features a slightly smaller 6.55-inch screen compared to the 6.7-inch 9 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c4SfW0"&gt;OnePlus 9 screen and build quality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="H9XEPs"&gt;OnePlus likes to make a big phone, and the 9 is no exception. It has a 6.55-inch screen with a 20.1:9 aspect ratio, giving it somewhat tall proportions that make it a little more comfortable to use one-handed. The 1080p OLED display is slightly lower-res than the 1440 screen on the 9 Pro, but it offers the same excellent 120Hz refresh rate. This makes animations and scrolling appear very smooth. If you’re coming from a phone with a standard 60Hz display, using the OnePlus 9 will feel a little more slick and polished. Fancy, even. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vEhMG3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a grownup-looking device with fit and finish well-suited to its $730-plus price&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2FmbMm"&gt;You’ll find Gorilla Glass on the front and back panels of the phone, meaning there’s no step down in build quality from the Pro in that sense — the frame is plastic rather than aluminum, but it’s not something I noticed or minded in my time using the device. The 9 does use a flat display rather than the slightly curved screen on the Pro, but that feels like a matter of aesthetics to me and I don’t find it to be a great loss. The flat design is also less prone to accidental touches at the edges of the screen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219861/oneplus-8-pro-review-specs-features-price-camera-battery-photos-video"&gt;like we saw on the OnePlus 8 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. As on the 9 Pro, there’s an optical in-screen fingerprint reader that’s generally quick and reliable. I noticed some failures but not at a high enough rate to bother me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWi63x"&gt;Overall, it’s not a bold or groundbreaking design, but it’s a grownup-looking device with fit and finish well-suited to its $730-plus price. Glass on both the front and back make it feel suitably premium, and the branding on the black unit I tested is tasteful and understated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USYqcV"&gt;The OnePlus 9 sold through T-Mobile — the only US carrier that will offer it directly — will include an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, which is the standard in this flagship class right now. The unlocked version will not have that official rating, but OnePlus tells us that the hardware is all the same. I used the 9 in some of Seattle’s ever-present drizzle and nothing bad happened. So depending on how you buy it, the 9 may not have that stamp of approval, but you can rest assured it’s just as robust as its peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iRMyA05Rd4BDDSKSx5GMGL4lo0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388897/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0073_Edit.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mAOYOJ"&gt;OnePlus 9 performance and UI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="49bvOd"&gt;The OnePlus 9 uses a top-of-the-line Snapdragon 888 processor and either 8GB or 12GB of RAM. It’s as good as you’ll find in an Android phone at any price right now, so its presence in a $730 phone is a major pro for the 9. I tested the version with 12GB RAM, which is $830, so bear that in mind. But let me tell you — this thing is slick as all heck. Apps load quickly, and jumping from app to home screen and back is seamless. I couldn’t really throw anything at it to slow it down. This is a spot where the OnePlus 9 shines, and it’s an important one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSSAxH"&gt;The 9 turns in good battery performance, too. The 120Hz screen draws more power than last year’s 90Hz display, but this year’s battery is a tad bigger, too: 4,500mAh compared to 4,300mAh. I don’t have any battery complaints, though my typical use is on the moderate side. It’ll get most users through a day and then some, and for those whose use is heavier, OnePlus has another feature to help out: fast wired charging. The included fast charger will take the battery from 1 to 100 percent in a scant 29 minutes. That’s fast enough for you to leave it unplugged overnight and just charge it up during a typical morning routine. Wireless charging is supported, too, which is a nice addition over last year’s model. The 9 is compatible with standard Qi chargers for up to 15W speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="JlRkCs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Being confined to 4G on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon right now isn’t a big deal, but it would be a significant drawback when the carriers start deploying their C-band frequencies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KQENoy"&gt;The OnePlus 9 is a 5G phone, as all 2021 flagships must be, but it has a complicated relationship with the technology. The phone supports the more widely used Sub-6GHz frequencies and is certified for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;C-band when it starts arriving in late 2021&lt;/a&gt; but not ultra-fast, super-scarce mmWave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I58Eem"&gt;Not having mmWave is no great loss, but there’s the aforementioned incompatibility with Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G networks. If you buy the phone unlocked, it’ll be LTE only on either of those networks, at least for now. OnePlus says it’s actively working with Verizon on 5G certification, but it couldn’t say if AT&amp;amp;T 5G compatibility would be added with a future software update. Being confined to 4G on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon right now isn’t a big deal — honestly, it’s probably for the best since their 5G networks aren’t very good yet — but it would be a significant drawback when the carriers start deploying their newly acquired C-band frequencies and 5G performance improves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="On5Mzo"&gt;The OnePlus 9 ships with the company’s OxygenOS UI built on Android 11. It feels modern and clean, with a few pre-downloaded apps but otherwise not much bloatware. It’s a grownup UI that doesn’t make you look at an ad to check the weather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajrcLl"&gt;OnePlus will supply the 9 and 9 Pro with two major Android upgrades and three years of security patches — a healthy life span, but not exactly best in class. Samsung’s flagships get a minimum of four years of security updates, though they slow down toward the end of the device’s life span, while Google provides three years of updates and security patches for Pixel phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vJcm5i8ToUvTwCsSFLeezfrkhok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388885/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0060.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 9 features main and ultrawide rear cameras, plus a monochrome sensor for additional black-and-white information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7P6B0H"&gt;OnePlus 9 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZTcSsk"&gt;The OnePlus’ rear camera array, relocated to the upper left of the back panel this year, includes a 48-megapixel main camera, 50-megapixel ultrawide, and 2-megapixel monochrome sensor. On the front is a 16-megapixel selfie camera. It’s a lot of cameras, but not outside the norm for phones in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXxeIG"&gt;The main camera sensor is the Sony IMX689 used by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219861/oneplus-8-pro-review-specs-features-price-camera-battery-photos-video"&gt;OnePlus 8 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. We liked its image quality in that device, and that’s still generally the case here. Combined with the new Hasselblad color tuning, the OnePlus 9 takes very nice images in good light, and I think does a particularly good job with landscapes. This much-touted “natural” color is fine but didn’t blow me away; it seems prone to occasional oversaturation and white balance misses just as much as any other smartphone’s image processing. It’s certainly not a reason on its own to run out and buy the 9 or 9 Pro, but it hasn’t hurt the output either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FHb2BJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not a reason on its own to buy the 9 or 9 Pro, but it hasn’t hurt the output either&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3fvxDK"&gt;For those who want to get hands-on with image processing rather than leaving it up to the camera, RAW shooting is available. The 9 and 9 Pro shoot 12-bit DNG files via the Pro mode in the camera app. These files contain more color information than the typical 10-bit RAW file you’ll get from most other phone cameras, which is helpful for post-processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYr2sw"&gt;But unlike with a traditional camera, shooting RAW on a phone misses out on the multi-frame image processing that it applies in its standard JPEG mode, which is often better for the final image than editing a single RAW file — even a 12-bit one. It’s a feature that sounds good on paper, and some dedicated mobile photographers might appreciate it, but not one that I can get excited about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VtOCBm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10406484"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="opIP1R"&gt;The 50-megapixel ultrawide chip puts out very nice 12-megapixel images. This camera uses  a new freeform lens featuring a nontraditional design to provide a wide view with minimal distortion. It also uses a 1/1.56-inch sensor that is substantially bigger than what you’ll find on the iPhone 12 and Galaxy S21’s ultrawide cameras. Ultrawide cameras can sort of feel like an afterthought, and this one doesn’t, which I really appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNKmz0"&gt;Back to the main camera, though: it’s good in bright light, but darker conditions like dusk or dim interiors are a challenge. These are the kinds of conditions where optical image stabilization can be a big help keeping things sharp, but unlike the 9 Pro and virtually all of its competitors, the 9 only offers less robust electronic image stabilization. I saw this crop up in a set of portrait mode shots taken outside in dim light that came out a little soft. I got one sharp photo out of the bunch, but I suspect OIS would have helped improve my hit rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y5mU3i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What’s missing from that stack of cameras and sensors is a telephoto camera&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j6ifaR"&gt;On the video side, the 9 supports 8K recording at 30p for up to five minutes per clip. Recording at 4K and 1080 is also offered at 60p or 30p. At 30p in either 4K or 1080 mode, you can enable HDR, though I didn’t see a meaningful difference in dynamic range with it on or off. The OnePlus 9 Pro includes a newer DOL-HDR mode that combines frames of different exposures, which should give better performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNgY3g"&gt;What’s missing from that stack of cameras and sensors is a telephoto camera, which puts the OnePlus 9 on par with the iPhone 12, but behind what Samsung’s S21 and a lot of other phones offer now. There’s still a 2x digital zoom shortcut in the camera app interface. Photos taken this way work okay in a pinch, but there’s an obvious softness if you look closely at them — it really isn’t a great substitute for an actual telephoto camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtPUw9"&gt;Oh, and that 2-megapixel monochrome camera isn’t one you can shoot with directly. As in previous OnePlus phones, its job is to supply additional information when using the monochrome filter mode with the main camera. If it makes a difference, we can’t tell and would much rather just have a telephoto camera next year instead, please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yBzo6LDD11ablHx1NwbHiWKMKXc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388873/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0041_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9’s included fast charger is one of its unique features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="JtZil6"&gt;The OnePlus 9 checks all the boxes required of a 2021 flagship phone: Snapdragon 888 processor, great high-refresh screen, good battery performance, and cameras aplenty. You’ll get top-of-the-line performance for about $100 less than the other base model flagships. That in itself is a great reason to consider the OnePlus 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNkZBX"&gt;But it’s not the phone I would recommend to absolutely everyone. Its unique propositions feel a little niche to me. Fast charging is neat, with lots of appeal to heavy phone users and travelers, but I think a lot of people are just fine with their overnight charging routine. I love that there’s an above-average ultrawide camera, but I’m probably in the minority here. And the Hasselblad color tuning is fine but nothing remarkable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="F9UdGS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’ll get top-of-the-line performance for about $100 less than the other base model flagships&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9of1pT"&gt;What should be easy to recommend — a well-priced phone with great performance — instead carries some significant ifs. &lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; extremely fast charging or the bigger screen are especially appealing, then the 9 is a great option. But &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you’re on AT&amp;amp;T and you’d like to keep your phone for a few years, proceed with caution. &lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; you want top-notch camera capabilities, or &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; fast charging feels more like a nice-to-have than a must, then you might want to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hzZKs1"&gt;I think with a little tuning, the OnePlus 9 could have been an absolutely killer premium midrange device. And I still think it’s a great device for a subset of the smartphone-buying population. There are just one too many ifs for it to earn the title of class-leader. The OnePlus 9 is very good, but it isn’t a runaway winner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="E25vZ9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10406439"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J3SgkP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 23rd, 11:15AM PT: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added detail about the OnePlus 9’s use of plastic rather than metal in the device’s frame.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSVkUk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 26th, 2021 5pm ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353052/oneplus-9-pro-verizon-5g-network-certified"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon announced&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; it would support 5G on the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro and OnePlus confirmed they will not work on AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network. The review has been updated to note the new information. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro can now use Verizon’s 5G network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 Pro (top) and OnePlus 9" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NM8uWJUzO-J9BPAuyUAExy7NZEE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69033502/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0061_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bbBnZy"&gt;The OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro are now certified for use on Verizon’s network, which means Verizon customers will be able to use the phones with the carrier’s 5G network; without certification, the phones would be limited to LTE. The news was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GLKCreative/status/1375542717577576452"&gt;announced today by a Verizon representative&lt;/a&gt;, but the timeline is a little unclear. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus had said it was working with Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, but there were no promises that it would be done by the phone’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQxKrD"&gt;The 5G story has been a bit confusing for the OnePlus 9 series phones from the start. Only the Pro model has the ultra-fast mmWave, and at announcement, the phones were only listed as 5G-compatible on T-Mobile’s network. Even with today’s news, that still leaves AT&amp;amp;T customers who buy a OnePlus 9 paying for 5G they can’t currently use. OnePlus’ carrier compatibility chart (which can be found via the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Foneplus-9-pro%3Firclickid%3D1HcXqjU5exyLWUhwUx0Mo36bUkEXhnQHNS69xk0%26irgwc%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F26%2F22353052%2Foneplus-9-pro-verizon-5g-network-certified" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus 9 or 9 Pro’s preorder page&lt;/a&gt;) currently lists the phones as having no bands compatible with AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8pPgu"&gt;Despite the initial confusion, it’s good that the phone can now be fully used on two out of the three major US carriers. The phones still aren’t listed in the Verizon store, but if you buy an unlocked OnePlus 9 or 9 Pro, you can use them with an existing or new Verizon account.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook, Uber, and Microsoft plan to start bringing employees back to offices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Daily Life in New York City Around The One-year Anniversary of The COVID-19 Shut Down" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WRqs3XTTBpnfKWWoN0dZWy8tMA4=/0x4:4324x2887/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69033494/1308703564.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FFVaJc"&gt;Facebook is planning to start its return to in-person work in May, after over a year of working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/facebook-to-start-reopening-silicon-valley-offices-in-may"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced remote work plans near the start of the pandemic that promised around half of his employees could work remotely &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2020/5/21/21265699/facebook-remote-work-shift-workforce-permanent-covid-19-mark-zuckerberg-interview"&gt;in the next five to 10 years&lt;/a&gt;, but until then, in-person work, at least in a limited capacity, is in the company’s immediate future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yln1QF"&gt;Facebook is reopening its offices in the Bay Area — including its Menlo Park headquarters — but limiting capacity at 10 percent to start. The company expects its largest offices to not reach 50 percent capacity until September, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; writes. In addition to limiting how many people are working in close proximity, Facebook also plans to require masks, social distancing, and weekly COVID-19 tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNVU7M"&gt;Uber is hoping to get back to in-person work even sooner. The ride-sharing company announced that it’ll reopen its Mission Bay, San Francisco headquarters on March 29th, with a limited 20 percent capacity, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uber-reopening/uber-to-reopen-san-francisco-offices-with-limited-capacity-next-week-idUSFWN2LN0XP"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Uber plans to follow similar COVID-19 restrictions as Facebook, requiring face coverings, regular cleanings, and asking employees with sick family members to stay home. Prior to this reopening plan, Uber was letting its office employees work from home &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/uber-extends-work-from-home-policy-through-mid-september/"&gt;until mid-September 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmoYm5"&gt;Other tech companies inside and outside of California are taking more of a mixed approach (or simply haven’t announced plans yet). Twitter took a big step and made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256060/twitter-employees-work-from-home-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;working from home indefinitely&lt;/a&gt; an option for all employees at the start of the pandemic. The company doesn’t have a set date for when it will reopen its offices, however, but “it will be gradual, office-by-office, and at a 20 percent capacity to start,” a Twitter spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UXbIuC"&gt;Google and Microsoft are looking into hybrid work models going forward, with Microsoft starting by reopening its Redmond, Washington, headquarters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344273/microsoft-redmond-headquarters-open-hybrid-workplace"&gt;on March 29th&lt;/a&gt;. The company also expects working from home part-time to be a standard for all office employees. Google’s plans are less certain, and the company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;but in 2020, it said employees would be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175150/google-return-office-september-flexible-work-week-coronavirus-pandemic-sundar-pichai"&gt;work from home until September 2021&lt;/a&gt; and that it would explore requiring employees only to work three days a week in-person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UFXv1c"&gt;Apple did not respond to a request to expand on its plans for returning to in-person work, but the company was reported to have ordered some staff &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256640/apple-employees-return-offices-covid-19-coronavirus"&gt;to return to its offices&lt;/a&gt; as early as May 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITCMQc"&gt;There are still risks involved with working indoors in close quarters with others, and being vaccinated doesn’t guarantee the virus can’t be transmitted. But as companies ease back into whatever “normal” working conditions will look like post-pandemic, it seems guaranteed that remote work isn’t going away entirely anytime soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f10le1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
