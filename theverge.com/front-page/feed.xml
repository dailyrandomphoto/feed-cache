    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TradUA"&gt;Like in previous years, Samsung used its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22617405/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-biggest-announcements-z-flip-z-fold-3-watch-buds-note"&gt;latest Galaxy Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt; to announce a slew of new devices, including the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3. The two smartphones are already available for preorder starting at $1,799.99 and $999.99, respectively, and will launch alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; and a handful of other devices on Friday, August 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wROhpD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Samsung beefed up its folding phones: metal, tape, and a dab of goo","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="3pJzAG"&gt;How to preorder the Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Hs307"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is Samsung’s latest foldable, yet it seems to take a cue directly from the Note, adopting S Pen support as well as an optional flip case designed to hold the stylus when not in use. The forthcoming device appears to be more rugged, too, with IPX8 water resistance, tougher aluminum in the hinge, and a protective film that is supposedly 80 percent stronger than that of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pmbYg4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 announced with S Pen support and water resistance","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rE4vJe"&gt;Specs-wise, the foldable features Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 processor and comes in both 256GB and 512GB storage configurations, each of which features a brighter front display that runs at an adaptive 120Hz refresh rate. The Z Fold 3 also sports three 12-megapixel rear cameras — specifically a wide, ultrawide, and telephoto lens — along with a 10-megapixel camera on the cover screen and a 4-megapixel sensor beneath the pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aejTfu"&gt;Both the 256GB and 512GB configurations of the Galaxy Z Fold 3 are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748811910154262197#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for preorder at Samsung&lt;/a&gt; starting today in one of three colors (silver, green, or black). Whereas the 256GB model will set you back $1,799.99, the 512GB model comes in slightly higher at $1,899.99. If you preorder either configuration between now and August 26th, however, Samsung will issue you a $200 credit that can be used toward another purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ECfqC"&gt;Financing options are available, too, and you can save up to $800 on your Galaxy Z Fold 3 when you trade in an eligible smartphone, smartwatch, or tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XEKb1B"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697006"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vrv8Kx"&gt;If you decide you’d rather preorder through your carrier, T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T offer similar pricing to Samsung, regardless of the color. You can buy the 256GB model outright for $1,799.99 (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-fold3-5g%3Fsku%3D610214670342&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617611%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-14527459?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-fold3-5g-256gb-phantom-black.html%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;) or the 512GB configuration for $1,899 (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-fold3-5g%3Fsku%3D610214670359&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617611%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-14527459?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-fold3-5g-512gb-phantom-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;), and both carriers offer financing options starting at $50 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ywZSMg"&gt;The two carriers differ when it comes to promotions, though. Both are currently offering up to $1,000 off the Galaxy Z Fold 3 if you trade in an eligible device, however, AT&amp;amp;T also requires you to sign up for an unlimited plan while T-Mobile requires customers to have at least one existing line with a Magenta Max, Magenta Plus, or T-Mobile One Plus plan. Like Samsung, AT&amp;amp;T is also offering a $200 credit toward select Samsung devices and accessories when you preorder either storage configuration by August 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V27ozw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697052"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="IKCucs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697054"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Si3AmL"&gt;Verizon customers can also save in a variety of ways or preorder the Galaxy Z Fold 3 for the full retail price ahead of launch. Both the 256GB and 512GB models &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-fold3-5g%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are available&lt;/a&gt; for $1,799.99 and $1,899.99, respectively, or with financing plans starting at $59.99. You can also save up to $1,000 on either configuration when you trade in an eligible phone and opt for an unlimited plan, as well as an extra $500 if you’re a new customer switching to Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Mn9Tsr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697089"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EFUkk1"&gt;How to preorder the Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="C3plMR"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 is nowhere near as expensive as the Galaxy Z Fold 3, however, it still comes at a premium. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594727/samsung-z-flip-3-fold-water-resistant-ipx8-pen-case" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;previous leaks have indicated&lt;/a&gt;, the successor to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip&lt;/a&gt; showcases the same IPX8 water resistance and Snapdragon 888 processor found on the Z Fold 3 and other Samsung flagships, along with a 10-megapixel selfie camera and a pair of 12-megapixel shooters on the back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="S13DT7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 announced with much bigger, useful cover display","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22617226/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-features-price-foldable-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8upDK7"&gt;Upon its release, it will be available in seven colors — gold, purple, green, black, white, pink, and gray — and features a cover display that’s four times bigger than the cover screen on its predecessor, allowing for more notifications and making it easier to capture selfies with the main camera. The 6.7-inch interior display also now sports an adaptive 120Hz refresh rate, as opposed to the 60Hz refresh rate of the original Z Flip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcbTDl"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 will be available in two configurations at launch: a 128GB model and a 256GB variant. Preorders are available starting today at Samsung ahead of the phone’s August 27th release, and pricing for the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748816475529586235#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model&lt;/a&gt; starts at $999.99. You can also preorder the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748816552261866427#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model&lt;/a&gt; for $1,049.99, however, unlike its smaller counterpart, it’s only available in black, gray, white, or pink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIlqWO"&gt;If you preorder either device at Samsung, you’ll also receive a $200 credit toward other Samsung devices, and if you go the trade-in route, you can save up to $650.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bbaUYi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697134"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rIKeFI"&gt;Both T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T offer similar pricing for the Galaxy Z Flip 3 as Samsung. The 128GB variant is available for &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-14527459?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip3-5g-128gb-cream.html%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder at AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; for $999.99, or in monthly installments of $27.78. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip3-5g%3Fsku%3D610214670298&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617611%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; offers both the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip3-5g%3Fsku%3D610214670298&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617611%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip3-5g%3Fsku%3D610214670304&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617611%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB configurations&lt;/a&gt; for $999.99 and $1,049.99, respectively, with installment plans starting at $41.67. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0qMEm"&gt;For those looking to save some money on their preorder, both carriers are currently running multiple promotions on the Galaxy Z Flip 3. AT&amp;amp;T is offering a discount of up to $1,000 to those who trade in an eligible phone and sign up for an unlimited plan, as is T-Mobile, though, you’ll need to opt for a Magenta Max, Magenta Plus, or T-Mobile One Plus plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EqMwB6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697215"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="6Jo25C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697211"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="im4J7U"&gt;Prices aren’t that different at Verizon, either. You can preorder the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip3-5g%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB version&lt;/a&gt; of the Galaxy Z Flip 3 in one of four colors for $999.99, or as part of a monthly installment plan for $33.33. In terms of promotions, Verizon is offering $1,000 off the foldable when you trade in your old device and sign up for an unlimited plan; new customers can also save an additional $500 to cover the cost of switching carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tZaKn0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697219"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KZOTTi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8E8cB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPysvZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Forget the Note — Samsung’s foldables are coming for the Galaxy S as well</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsgNylYjeSgwY6EWREDuce7U710=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69712308/cwelch_210809_4701_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fIwhvQ"&gt;It’s been easy to dismiss folding phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18088620/samsung-foldable-phone-science-fiction-movies-television-westworld-star-trek"&gt;as the stuff of science fiction&lt;/a&gt;, even after they became a reality two years ago. They were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355018/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-foldable-phones-normal-mainstream"&gt;too expensive&lt;/a&gt;, too large, too compromised to make sense for most. Some flips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;instantly flopped&lt;/a&gt;. But in 2021, a folding phone appears to have just killed off Samsung’s long-running Galaxy Note — and I’m starting to wonder if they’ll destroy the flagship Galaxy S as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4AI8Z"&gt;That’s because last month, Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22599306/samsung-q2-2021-earnings-component-shortage-foldables"&gt;promised to make foldables mainstream&lt;/a&gt;. And at $999, with fewer compromises than ever, Samsung’s new Z Flip 3 sounds dangerously close to a complete replacement for Samsung’s $999 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Galaxy S21 Plus&lt;/a&gt;. For the same price, they’ve both got 6.7-inch 120Hz AMOLED screens, the latest Snapdragon 888 processors, the same memory and storage options, the same water resistance, and roughly the same dimensions, just with a slightly lighter frame and smaller battery, and one fewer camera around back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Zraer9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Has the Flip reached parity with flat flagships?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2JBVF"&gt;Except &lt;em&gt;one &lt;/em&gt;of these phones awesomely folds down to half its size, and the other one doesn’t. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;Assuming Samsung’s new durability improvements&lt;/a&gt; aren’t just talk and the plastic-covered screen doesn’t feel weird, I know which one I’d pick! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKtNe5"&gt;Would Samsung really axe its flatscreen Galaxy S in favor of foldables, though? It’s not as far-fetched as you might think — because after two years selling a ridiculous number of “flagship” phones, the Galaxy S handsets are getting hemmed in on all sides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTeblN"&gt;In 2019, the company tried to sell as many as 10 different flagship phones around the world, including four different Galaxy S10s and four different Galaxy Notes with largely identical core specs. 2020 brought &lt;em&gt;11 &lt;/em&gt;different flagships, if you count the Galaxy S10 Lite and Note 10 Lite. Five flagship phones may still be too many in 2021, if three of them aren’t selling particularly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fsQ3B8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10697029"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YjXyaS"&gt;It’s not like Samsung would be killing off its bestselling handsets by ditching the Galaxy S, by the way. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;The company’s midrange A-series phones&lt;/a&gt; are actually its sales champs, after Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/3/17815746/samsung-flagship-features-midrange-phones-strategy-shift"&gt;declared it would prioritize those handsets&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. Meanwhile, sales of Samsung’s Galaxy S phones &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/report_sales_of_samsung_galaxy_s21_series_are_lower_than_s20_s10_sales-news-50385.php"&gt;have reportedly plummeted 47 percent over the past two generations&lt;/a&gt;, with the Galaxy S21 on track to be even more of a disappointment than the Galaxy S20 was the year before.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="keg1W6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fold replaces Note, Flip replaces S?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8enFPZ"&gt;Does Samsung need the Galaxy S any more than it needs the Galaxy Note? For smartphone enthusiasts who want the best of everything — now including the ability to fold out into a tablet — the Z Fold is already taking the place of the Note. Next year, with some camera upgrades, it could theoretically dethrone Samsung’s “Ultra” phones, too. That could leave room for the Flip to become Samsung’s new default flagship, with folding as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/1/5571738/samsung-our-next-big-thing-ads-drove-apples-marketing-chief-crazy"&gt;the “Next Big Thing” that Apple doesn’t offer its customers&lt;/a&gt; (at least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307677/folding-iphone-rumors-screen-size-kuo"&gt;not yet&lt;/a&gt;). For everyone else, there’s Samsung’s increasingly powerful Galaxy A series, which will likely get even more aggressive  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607248/xiaomi-overtakes-samsung-europe-smartphone-sales-apple"&gt;now that Xiaomi has overtaken Samsung in Europe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbXk4i"&gt;If it happens, I’d expect a transition period: the flagship phone category still starts around $700, not the $1,000 that Samsung is asking for the Flip 3, so the company would probably keep around a Galaxy S22 FE at a minimum. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532816/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-production-reportedly-halted"&gt;The Galaxy S21 FE is still pending&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esAWSL"&gt;And even if Samsung does decide to deemphasize flatscreen flagships, that doesn’t mean the Galaxy S name will necessarily go away. It might just become what Samsung calls its folding phones someday. Galaxy S is the brand that brought Samsung into the spotlight over the past decade, so there’s value and precedent to transfer the name to a new design: when Samsung first began experimenting with curved glass screens, it started as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/20/9181917/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-plus-review"&gt;the Galaxy Edge&lt;/a&gt;, but those curves became the norm with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus"&gt;Galaxy S8&lt;/a&gt;. If Samsung makes foldables the new normal, we might see the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ipVvD"&gt;All I know for sure: Samsung’s bloated lineup of flagships was getting pretty ridiculous — remember &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20852040/samsung-peak-flagship-blockchain-branded-galaxy-note-10-cryptocurrency-kakao-klay-klaytnphone"&gt;the Note 10 specifically for blockchain&lt;/a&gt;? — and it doesn’t need to be that way. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber’s latest delivery service partnership has drawn the FTC’s attention</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Uber Japan Couriers As Olympic Games Boost Foot-delivery Operators" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/os5wTLxS-nUFlehS0qI8KFfgLEI=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69711943/1234341481.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z828O3"&gt;The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is looking into a recent partnership between Uber and grocery delivery service Gopuff, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ftc-investigating-ubers-gopuff-partnership-alongside-drizly-deal"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Gopuff agreed to list its collection of grocery and liquor store items &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419461/uber-gopuff-grocery-delivery-expansion"&gt;on Uber Eats in May&lt;/a&gt;, expanding Uber’s delivery abilities to an even greater degree as it competes with other companies like DoorDash and Instacart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eh2MMS"&gt;The FTC is concerned that the deal “could hamper competition in online sale and delivery of alcohol and convenience-store items,” according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. Gopuff’s been growing on its own recently,&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/gopuff-acquires-bevmo/"&gt; acquiring the BevMo liquor store chain&lt;/a&gt; to use as stores and delivery centers, almost like Amazon warehouses for alcohol. The FTC is reportedly also looking in to &lt;a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2021/Uber-to-Acquire-Drizly/default.aspx"&gt;Uber’s recent acquisition of Drizly&lt;/a&gt;, an alcohol delivery service that Uber intends to fold into its Uber Eats app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jq24dk"&gt;Uber has been attempting to pivot into delivery for several years now with acquisitions of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21312447/uber-postmates-acquisition-announced-food-delivery"&gt;Postmates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20909643/uber-grocery-delivery-startup-acquisition-cornershop"&gt;Cornershop&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 and 2019, respectively. As the company’s original ride-hailing business &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22277043/uber-lyft-earnings-q4-2020-profit-loss-covid"&gt;has struggled during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, finding an alternative has been key, but the FTC might get in the way of that now. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISQ0Vx"&gt;There’s nothing inherently usual about the FTC reviewing an acquisition or partnership, but Uber has a history with the organization, paying fines for mishandling its employees’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16150902/uber-ftc-complaint-mishandle-privacy-data"&gt;access to private user and driver data&lt;/a&gt;, and for being misleading about how much drivers could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/19/14330708/uber-ftc-settlement-20-million-driver-mislead-earnings"&gt;actually earn with the company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hB66lx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;New FTC Commissioner Lina Khan’s&lt;/a&gt; more active stance toward curbing monopolies might also mean that Uber’s rapid expansion to secure its business for whatever happens after ride-hailing might be deemed to be too anti-competitive to fly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Chromebook for 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Chromebooks 2020: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HDV4yWEUjQt1tPQn1vixjNoG1V4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976144/mchin_181029_4126_0011.0.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best Chromebook laptop or two-in-one for every Chrome OS fan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="oqi8dk"&gt;The best Chromebooks aren’t just laptops that run a few Google apps anymore. Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chrome OS laptop or two-in-one can be more useful than a mediocre &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21231636/windows-10-pc-user-guide-how-to-microsoft"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281530/macos-mac-imac-user-guide-how-to-os-tips"&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt; laptop. That’s why our pick for the best Chromebook of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, which does just about everything right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnwyna"&gt;The best Chromebooks are known to deliver good value. The message that many people actually want &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers. Many are around $500 or $600, though there are good options in the higher and lower ranges as well. The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you’ll be happy with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUTNYw"&gt;For the first time, the quality of the best Chromebooks in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they’re all sourcing their components from the same factory. That’s great news if you’re comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. They can even rival some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21528540/budget-windows-10-chromebook-systems-acer-lenovo-cheap"&gt;best budget laptops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMCGia"&gt;Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we’ve selected the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; for shoppers on a budget. Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, the HP Chromebook x360, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4TuU"&gt;What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="YECpuA"&gt;Best Chromebook 2021&lt;/h1&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the best Chromebook of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KQRVus"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfZy92"&gt;Best Chromebook of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LpXHDz"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy. With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you’ll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarhIJ"&gt;The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting. There’s even an HDMI port, which you don’t see on a thin Chromebook every day. And (most importantly) the 11th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem. The Spin’s speakers aren’t great, and there’s no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX2USx"&gt;In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that’s excellent in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For students or anyone looking for a small secondary device, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great affordable pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RGZEpN"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P8MGAD"&gt;Best Chromebook on a budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xJq778"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price. It’s an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfnBmb"&gt;The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you’re just browsing and don’t plan on using a super heavy load. It also uses a version of Chrome OS that’s made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that’s optimized for tablet use. When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze. But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93jX9I"&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks. The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there’s no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim. But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price. It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a larger device with more power, one of the best Chromebooks you can buy is the HP Chromebook x360 14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C2SoIE"&gt;3. HP Chromebook x360 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rtrWbQ"&gt;Powerful Chromebook with a sleek design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rGvI"&gt;If you’re looking to get more power and you don’t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with the i3 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUDxQ"&gt;While we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn’t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="epP0CZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508136"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;If the Chomebook Duet isn’t enough, the Chromebook Detachable CM3 brings some new perks to the detachable form factor, for an extra cost.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FxguZ6"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CrrPVI"&gt;Best detachable Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="canZPK"&gt;The Chromebook Detachable CM3 is Asus’s attempt to compete with Lenovo’s highly praised Chromebook Duet. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch, 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, a kickstand, and a keyboard that pops on and off. It’s a bit more expensive than the Duet, but also has a few extra features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNgQvV"&gt;One unique perk is that the kickstand folds multiple ways: You can fold it the long way to stand the tablet up like a laptop, or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. We’re not sure how practical this functionality actually is, but it’s there if you have a use case in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlTu0z"&gt;The CM3 also comes with a built-in USI stylus, and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. But the thing we found most impressive was the battery life: We averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work on the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11a1Pz"&gt;The CM3 won’t be the best Chromebook for everyone: It only has two ports (one USB-C and one audio jack) and its MediaTek processor was a bit sluggish compared to more expensive offerings. But if you’re looking for a convertible Chrome OS device and find that the Duet doesn’t quite suit your needs, you’re likely the CM3’s target audience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="AZSrVU"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yloceu"&gt;Best midrange Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="IqMUru"&gt;Samsung’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; shot for the moon, with a $1,000 price tag, an OLED display, a packaged stylus, and a premium build. The Galaxy Chromebook 2 isn’t so much a sequel to that device as it is a pared-down, more affordable alternative. There’s no fingerprint sensor, no stylus, and no OLED — but it’s quite functional, and with a sub-$600 starting price it’s a much more reasonable purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMshkm"&gt;The Chromebook 2’s highlight feature is its finish: It comes in a bright “fiesta red” that will certainly stand out wherever you’re using it. (There’s a gray option as well, if you’d prefer something subtle.) It’s also the first Chromebook ever to feature one of Samsung’s QLED panels. QLED isn’t OLED — it’s just a fancier LED — but it still makes for one of the most gorgeous displays I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91mDFz"&gt;Nice screens sometimes wreck battery life, but that’s not the case here. I averaged about seven hours and 21 minutes of continuous work on the Chromebook 2, which means you shouldn’t need to plug it in &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;too often. And while the Core i3 processor isn’t the most powerful chip you can get in a Chromebook, it’s just fine for everyday work use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s4tmgA"&gt;Best Google Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WMItcT"&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds. It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M72CDq"&gt;Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports. Battery life is also impressive. The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem. But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCvQ3C"&gt;The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn’t top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price. But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="U2ykf7"&gt;Best premium Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nT7MLq"&gt;Many modern Chromebooks are oriented towards kids and students, but not this one. The C13 Yoga Chromebook is a sturdy, pricey, convertible Chromebook for grown-ups. It’s part of Lenovo’s renowned ThinkPad business line, and has all kinds of ThinkPad perks including a red Trackpoint, discrete touchpad clickers, a fingerprint sensor, a webcam shutter, and an aluminum design. Put this Chromebook next to any number of Windows ThinkPads, and we might not be able to pick it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLVSSi"&gt;The C13 is also unique in that it’s the first Chromebook to include AMD’s Ryzen 3000 Mobile C-series processors, which are marketed specifically for Chromebooks. The chips run all kinds of programs — even mobile games — quite smoothly. We do wish the battery life was a bit better — we only averaged just over six hours on one charge. We averaged seven and a half hours from our top pick, the Chromebook Spin 713, and plenty of the devices here break eight hours with no problem&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook is the best Chromebook for midrange shoppers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wNILY1"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598860/lenovo-flex-5-chromebook-review"&gt;Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sajnTX"&gt;Best Chromebook for midrange shopepers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pvusIr"&gt;The Lenovo Flex 5 looks a lot nicer than its sub-$400 price might indicate. It’s built to withstand all kinds of jolts and jostles in a backpack or briefcase, but also has a smooth soft-touch texture that’s pleasant to hold. Add a sleek backlit keyboard, a physical webcam shutter, and front-facing speakers, and you’ve got a chassis with hallmarks of a much more expensive device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y79cZK"&gt;You get some other perks as well. The Flex 5 has one of the better keyboards I’ve ever used on a Chromebook, let alone a Chromebook at a midrange price point. It also has a useful port selection including a microSD reader and a USB-C port on each side, as well as a crisp 1920 x 1080 touch display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zD2vyD"&gt;The one caveat is that the Flex 5 has somewhat disappointing battery life, averaging just over five and a half hours in our testing. If you’ll be using the device while you’re out and about, you’ll want to make sure you bring the 45W charger with you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="ujgaJf"&gt;Premium 2-in-1 with a built-in stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="fBDiBQ"&gt;It’s a bit heavy as Chromebooks go, but the 3.99-pound Inspiron 14 is still a sturdy convertible device with brushed aluminum chassis that gives it a premium look. It has a spacious backlit keyboard and a nice 1920 x 1080 display with accurate colors. With an 8th Gen Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, it delivers snappy performance for streaming, browsing, multitasking, and even more demanding artistic tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX7aDx"&gt;Speaking of artists, the Inspiron 14 comes with a stylus, which lives in a dedicated socket inside the chassis so you don’t have to worry about losing it. Thanks to electromagnetic resonance technology (EMR), it doesn’t need batteries or any kind of charge. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Criterion Collection’s first run of 4K Blu-rays includes Citizen Kane </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Citizen Kane" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s42Kkw8Ipt3-wsYrnmkEKxi2O7w=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69711855/1311663652.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DvBdvs"&gt;The Criterion Collection &lt;a href="https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/7494-citizen-kane-to-lead-criterion-s-first-4k-slate"&gt;has announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to release a six-film slate of classics on 4K Blu-rays for the first time, including a rerelease of Orson Welles’ American epic &lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cH1kNy"&gt;Besides the perennial film buff favorite, Criterion is also releasing the following films as part of its initial collection of ultra high-definition Blu-rays:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Nc7UqD"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Menace II Society&lt;/em&gt; directed by Allen and Albert Hughes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rlPrzZ"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Piano &lt;/em&gt;directed by Jane Campion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6YdeSL"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Mulholland Dr.&lt;/em&gt; directed by David Lynch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lje2WM"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Red Shoes &lt;/em&gt;directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oniPlH"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A Hard Day’s Night&lt;/em&gt; directed by Richard Lester&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="NcTjun"&gt;Criterion writes that each release will include the film in 4K UHD along with a traditional 1080p Blu-ray print. Special features, arguably one of the Criterion Collection’s greatest strengths, will also be included on the Blu-ray. Some select films will even support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="of1CYU"&gt;The company didn’t share when to expect the new Blu-rays but did say it would announce more details next week alongside its November release schedule. In the meantime, if you don’t want to wait for physical media, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/16/18099126/criterion-collection-streaming-service-filmstruck-warner-media"&gt;you can stream a whole host of films&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/"&gt;Criterion Channel streaming service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yes, Twitter changed its font</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/armgFPWJCUIr2t3e9zHz9UVAZj4=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69711696/E8hpSmxXoAMW80g.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter has changed the way the platform looks, including changing the font to its Chirp font.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SpZJF0"&gt;Twitter is rolling out its Chirp font to the Twitter app and feed, meaning that your daily scrolling might look a little different than you’re used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fvlhwa"&gt;Twitter’s main account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1425505690634780673"&gt;posted about the change&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday. I’m personally seeing the new font on the web and on the iOS app, but one colleague isn’t seeing it anywhere, so it may not have rolled out to everyone yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e3rKG9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;okay confirmed it did&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter (@Twitter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1425505690634780673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XcAkyT"&gt;Twitter detailed the Chirp font as one part of a broader brand refresh unveiled in January. “Chirp strikes the balance between messy and sharp to amplify the fun and irreverence of a Tweet, but can also carry the weight of seriousness when needed,” &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/imperfect-by-design"&gt;Twitter said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16Zbem"&gt;At the time, Twitter used it in things like promotional materials and graphics, but it wasn’t the font you’d see in the feed or when navigating the app. Twitter’s Derrit DeRouen, the creative director for the company’s global brand, said in January that it was his &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DerritDeRouen/status/1354548692888416257"&gt;“personal desire”&lt;/a&gt; to make Chirp the typeface for the Twitter product in a thread &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DerritDeRouen/status/1354548649561186306"&gt;about the new font&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, he didn’t commit to when that might happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l6UZSR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Do we eventually see Chirp as the typeface for the product? It's my personal desire, and the work on legibility, density and weight has already begun. There is more refining to do, more languages to build, but the hard work will be worth the benefit of having a holistic brand. &lt;a href="https://t.co/fDJQpkNnVT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fDJQpkNnVT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Derrit DeRouen (@DerritDeRouen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DerritDeRouen/status/1354548692888416257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HH2QfB"&gt;The new font also has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1354654194574135299"&gt;a fun Easter egg&lt;/a&gt;: you can tweet the Twitter logo if you type [CHIRPBIRDICON] in the tweet compose box. That’s “chirp,” “bird,” and “icon” all mashed into one word, and it has to be all caps for the icon to show up, in my testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isJw5r"&gt;On the iOS app, the icon appeared in the compose box for me after typing [CHIRPBIRDICON], but on the web, it didn’t appear until I actually sent a tweet including the phrase and brackets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8or191"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter’s new “Chirp” font contains a ligature that turns [CHIRPBIRDICON] into the Twitter logo &lt;a href="https://t.co/TgCRi804iK"&gt;https://t.co/TgCRi804iK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/SYDczXCBM5"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SYDczXCBM5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 黃文津 Jane (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1354654194574135299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2djWzZ"&gt;The font isn’t the only visual change introduced on Wednesday. “We’ve updated our colors to be high contrast and a lot less blue — a change made to draw attention to the photos and videos you create and share,” Twitter said in a thread &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterDesign/status/1425505308563099650"&gt;posted by its design account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuRKvu"&gt;The company is promising to roll out new colors sometime soon, though it’s unclear exactly what that means. People who subscribe to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22464291/twitter-blue-subscription-service-canada-australia-undo-reader-mode"&gt;paid Twitter Blue subscription service&lt;/a&gt; can already tweak the colors of the app and change the color of the app’s icon, though the service is only available for iOS in Canada and Australia right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ULvN8T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today we release updates for colors &amp;amp; typography! See &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterDesign?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TwitterDesign&lt;/a&gt; post for full details. The A11Y updates are:&lt;br&gt;- Higher color contrast of buttons, links, focus&lt;br&gt;- Easier reading with left-aligned text &amp;amp; more space between text&lt;br&gt;- Fewer distracting gray things&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you think? &lt;a href="https://t.co/Umu3F1iJjb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Umu3F1iJjb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Accessibility (@TwitterA11y) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1425507503593467904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JoEAQK"&gt;There’s also a change to the way the follow button looks that could prove frustrating. Now, when you already follow someone, the follow button’s background isn’t filled in, and when you aren’t following someone, it’s filled in with color. As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bcmerchant/status/1425520662995558400"&gt;writer Brian Merchant pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, this is the opposite of the way the follow button worked before, so be careful that you don’t accidentally unfollow people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0UcPx5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;know what makes me want to spend more time on this website? accidentally unfollowing people I was sure I had already followed and then following them again, making them think I had only just now followed them&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;love it&lt;/p&gt;— Brian Merchant (@bcmerchant) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bcmerchant/status/1425520662995558400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>A national alert test buzzed US TVs, radios,  and any phones that opted-in at 2:20PM ET</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Yk4FXbgUUFLoSQtjOtQg22plKU=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69711293/E8H1PYXWYAEjY84.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Test Wireless Emergency Alert message | Image: FEMA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qs7pJM"&gt;At approximately 2:20PM ET, FEMA &lt;a href="https://www.fema.gov/fact-sheet/frequently-asked-questions-2021-ipaws-national-test"&gt;conducted a test of both the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA)&lt;/a&gt; covering radio, TV broadcasts, and mobile devices in the US, but you might not see it on your phone. That’s because this time around, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17931750/fema-presidential-alert-test-reminder-trump-public-alert-warning-system"&gt;Presidential Alert test in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, it only reached phones with a setting to receive test messages and by default, most phones are set to opt-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMSwdj"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/weatest_opt-in_instructions.pdf"&gt;this document&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) from the FCC, on Android phones, there should be a Wireless Emergency Alerts section in your settings menu with an option for “State/Local Test alerts” that you can turn on or off. The process described for iOS is more complicated, but &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202743"&gt;Apple’s support page&lt;/a&gt; explains how you can opt-in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="t9IOZS"&gt;Open the Phone app and tap Keypad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Pw6aU"&gt;To turn it on: Enter *5005*25371# and tap the green phone icon. You’ll get an alert that says “Test alerts enabled.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tc6luY"&gt;To turn it off: Enter *5005*25370# and tap the green phone icon. You’ll get an alert that says “Test alerts disabled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="yxKvUJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This year's Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) test messages will only be displayed on wireless handsets where subscribers have “opted-in” to receive them. This will allow for a nationwide test without disturbing the public.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read more about opting in here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/kvGqLyBCqy"&gt;https://t.co/kvGqLyBCqy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/LW3UptMxK7"&gt;https://t.co/LW3UptMxK7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— National Weather Service (@NWS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWS/status/1424758994816667650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LHMQ1J"&gt;If you missed it, or if you weren’t thirsty enough to opt-in, this is the message for mobile devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjFwlC"&gt;“THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lBkpA6hiBrfBBTVAjg3dIpV4EEI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22776608/this_is_a_test.jpg"&gt;

&lt;p id="cYw84j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (2:30PM ET):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that the test occurred.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="URwxbR"&gt;A few weeks after 1Password started rolling out the &lt;a href="https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-for-windows-is-now-in-early-access/"&gt;Windows version of the redesigned 1Password 8&lt;/a&gt;, the company is now &lt;a href="https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-for-mac-is-now-in-early-access/"&gt;showing off the Mac version&lt;/a&gt; of the update, which is also available today to try in early access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3X65Io"&gt;Like the Windows version, 1Password 8 on the Mac features an overhauled design, which aims to make it clearer when items are being shared, who they’re shared with, and better labeling of groups in the sidebar.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u-MUEbWlGs5qVyTPSyopWZhNDsA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22776517/WatchtowerDashboard.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PQjfm6"&gt;There’s also a new search bar, which shows suggestions as you search (similar to Apple’s Spotlight or Alfred), and an updated version of Watchtower, which shows a comprehensive overview of your overall password security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5jp1U"&gt;Lastly, the new app overhauls the editing window, which the company says includes a “new password generator, smart suggestions, and simpler file attachments.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/agKgppnnD6WRmE7ghTm4WTwjpfo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22776518/opm8ea_unlocked.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0Uehl"&gt;1Password 8 looks like a fairly sizable update, and users will have to opt in to the early access build to try it out today. &lt;a href="https://1password.community/discussion/122136/"&gt;Instructions are here&lt;/a&gt;, but doing so requires deleting the old 1Password 7 app and then installing the new version. Additionally, while the flashy new features and design look fun, the company cautions that 1Password 8 is “for testing and validation purposes only and is not suitable for business critical environments.” So you might not necessarily want to use it for anything super important just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIDt42"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senators target Apple’s App Store exclusivity in new bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/InVLqrBh-kXo9CAONa4Uq094tG4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69711309/Google_Apple_App_Dominance2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zPgcBF"&gt;There’s a new bill introduced in the Senate Wednesday targeting the power dominant tech firms like Apple and Google have over the app store market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXF6EJ"&gt;The bipartisan “&lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/8.11.21%20-%20Open%20App%20Markets%20Act%20-%20Bill%20Text.pdf"&gt;Open App Markets Act&lt;/a&gt;,” introduced by Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) would ban app stores from forcing developers to use the store’s payment systems. It would also bar companies from punishing developers that offer lower prices on a separate app store or through their own payment systems, along the lines of Apple’s public dispute with Epic Games. Notably, the bill would also make it unlawful for companies like Apple to use non-public data from their stores to build competing products against companies using their service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mXlLqb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple and Google have squashed competitors and kept consumers in the dark”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NNBQst"&gt;“For years, Apple and Google have squashed competitors and kept consumers in the dark—pocketing hefty windfalls while acting as supposedly benevolent gatekeepers of this multi-billion dollar market,” Blumenthal said in a statement Wednesday. “This bipartisan bill will help break these tech giants’ ironclad grip, open the app economy to new competitors, and give mobile users more control over their own devices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOnZMb"&gt;An Apple spokesperson responded to the bill in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;Wednesday, writing, “Since our founding, we’ve always put our users at the center of everything we do, and the App Store is the cornerstone of our work to connect developers and customers in a way that is safe and trustworthy.” The spokesperson continued, “At Apple, our focus is on maintaining an App Store where people can have confidence that every app must meet our rigorous guidelines and their privacy and security is protected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0PBEX"&gt;Earlier this year, the Senate Judiciary Committee &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396544/apple-app-store-google-play-monopoly-antitrust-bill-hearings"&gt;hauled in representatives&lt;/a&gt; from companies like Spotify, Tile, and Match Group, a dating app company, to explain how Apple and Google’s app store policies and fees harm their businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4O8gs"&gt;Specifically, Tile’s General Counsel Kirsten Daru said that once Apple decided to make its own competing item-tracking device, the company made it more difficult for Tile products to work on the devices. Match’s Chief Legal Officer Jared Sine also said that app store fees are the company’s single largest expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbX1Ud"&gt;“We have worked toward creating a fairer and more competitive app marketplace for both developers and consumers,” said The Coalition for App Fairness, which counts Epic Games as a member, in a statement Wednesday. “The bipartisan Open App Markets Act is a step towards holding big tech companies accountable for practices that stifle competition for developers in the U.S. and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXe3CQ"&gt;Still, tech-backed think tanks like Chamber for Progress argue that the bill could pose a safety risk for consumers. “This bill is a finger in the eye of anyone who bought an iPhone or Android because the phones and their app stores are safe, reliable, and easy to use,” Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich said Wednesday. “I don’t see any consumers marching in Washington demanding that Congress make their smartphones dumber.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDz23s"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;creator Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; challenged the app store model with lawsuits Apple and Google, asking for a court-ordered injunction that would have similar effects to the proposed bill. A federal judge is currently reviewing the Apple case to determine whether the company violated antitrust law by implementing these policies. Nearly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;40 state attorneys general&lt;/a&gt; have also sued Google over its app store model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjbIYg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 8/11/21 at 3:38PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a statement from Apple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/heZCBOS2J4XTzRsyliaisTFBdxU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69711209/BFARSACE_210810_4707_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kgO9ag"&gt;As expected, Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22618532/galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-fitness-tracker-price-specs-features"&gt;took the wraps off the Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt; and the aptly titled Galaxy Watch 4 Classic during its Galaxy Unpacked event this morning, confirming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;recent leaks&lt;/a&gt; and introducing the first two devices built on Google and Samsung’s co-developed smartwatch platform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;. Both watches also sport Samsung’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617873/samsung-exynos-w920-chip-announced-galaxy-watch-4"&gt;Exynos W920 processor&lt;/a&gt;, 1.5GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, and come with a host of health-related features thanks to the inclusion of Samsung’s 3-in-1 BioActive sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hjg00g"&gt;Although neither model is set to arrive until August 27th, both are available for preorder starting today at varying price points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5191Hw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Galaxy Watch 4 inject Samsung’s capable hardware with Google software","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22618532/galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-fitness-tracker-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="qL41u7"&gt;How to preorder the Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TBKYyG"&gt;The Galaxy Watch 4 is essentially the next iteration of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20903452/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-review-fitness-tizen-apps-features-android-price"&gt;Galaxy Watch Active 2&lt;/a&gt;. The aluminum smartwatch will be available in either a 40mm or 44mm configuration and will showcase two side buttons in addition to a digital bezel. It will also launch in a handful of colors — specifically black, green, silver, and pink — with additional personalization coming in the form of watch bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRp0FY"&gt;If you’re looking to secure Samsung’s forthcoming wearable ahead of launch, both sizes are currently available for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748797745164269423#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder at Samsung&lt;/a&gt;. Pricing starts at $249 (or $299 with LTE) for the 40mm model, and if you preorder the Galaxy Watch 4 between now and August 26th, Samsung will throw in a $50 credit to be used toward Samsung select devices, add-ons, and accessories. The larger, 44mm variant costs $279.99 with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, while the LTE version is $329.99. If you trade in an eligible device like the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3, you can also save up to $185 on the total cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2czFV3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10696448"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="crVYG9"&gt;If you prefer to go through your carrier, &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-14460649?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fconnected-smartwatches%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon is offering&lt;/a&gt; the Galaxy Watch 4 as low as $12.49 a month. You can also save up to $100 off if you trade in an eligible device, or $150 if you purchase the forthcoming smartwatch alongside an Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b48CH2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10696557"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VzPZ0h"&gt;The Galaxy Watch 4 is also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-40mm%3Fsku%3D887276550282&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617607%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; for the same price as Verizon. You can preorder the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-40mm%3Fsku%3D887276550282&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617607%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;40mm model&lt;/a&gt; outright starting at $299.99, or finance it for $12.50 a month. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-44mm%3Fsku%3D887276550213&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617607%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;44mm configuration&lt;/a&gt; will cost you $329, or $13.75 a month, if you prefer to pay in installments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f5VVA5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10696601"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cezWss"&gt;Lastly, AT&amp;amp;T is offering preorders on both the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-14527459?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fwearables%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-40mm-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;40mm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-14527459?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fwearables%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-44mm-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;44mm models&lt;/a&gt;. You can preorder the 40mm configuration for $299.99, or the 44mm model for $329.99, and AT&amp;amp;T will knock up to $200 off if you trade in an eligible device. Financing is also available for $8.34 and $9.17 a month, respectively, and you can get a second Galaxy Watch 4 when you purchase both on a qualifying installment plan and add a new data line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="d9yX5Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10696646"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nk3xZL"&gt;How to preorder the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Dh5xXl"&gt;Unlike the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4, the Classic represents a more traditional take on a smartwatch, albeit with Wear OS 3 inside. The compact watch will launch with a stainless steel build and the same AMOLED display as the Galaxy Watch 4, however, it also features a bezel you have to physically rotate. It will be available in 42mm and 46mm versions and in one of two colors (black or silver).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjCSp9"&gt;On the preorder front, both sizes of the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic are now &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748797745164269423#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available from Samsung&lt;/a&gt;. Pricing starts at $349.99 (or $399.99 with LTE), and Samsung will throw in a $50 credit if you preorder the watch prior to its launch on August 27th, which you can use on select Samsung devices and accessories. The bigger, 46mm model with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi retails for $379.99, while the LTE-equipped variant runs $429.99. Like with the Galaxy Watch 4, Samsung will also take up to $185 off the total cost with an eligible trade-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fNzG3P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10696691"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uSVNnX"&gt;If you’d like to preorder the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic via your carrier, you have a few different options. The 42mm Galaxy Watch 4 is currently &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fconnected-smartwatches%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-classic%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Verizon&lt;/a&gt; outright for $399, or for $16.66 a month. The 46mm model, on the other hand, will cost you $429 outright or $17.91 a month on an installment plan. AT&amp;amp;T will also give you a $100 credit if you trade in an eligible device, or it’ll take $150 off if you purchase the smartwatch with an Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gDo3yN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10696718"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jIhfhc"&gt;T-Mobile offers the same pricing as Verizon, though you can also get a second Galaxy Watch 4 Classic of equal or lesser value for free if you opt for an additional line and purchase both devices on an installment plan. As for pricing, you can preorder the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-classic-42mm%3Fsku%3D887276550787&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617607%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;42mm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-classic-46mm%3Fsku%3D887276550909&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617607%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;46mm models&lt;/a&gt; for $399.99 and $429.99, respectively, or opt for an installment plan starting at $17.92 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JW5vCK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10696762"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DvT3I3"&gt;If you’re on AT&amp;amp;T, you can preorder both the &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-14527459?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fwearables%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-classic-42mm-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;42mm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-14527459?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fwearables%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-classic-46mm-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;46mm models&lt;/a&gt; for $399.99 and $429.99, respectively. You can also finance the 42mm model for $11.11 a month or the 46mm model for $11.95 a month; you can even get a second Galaxy Watch 4 Classic for free when you opt for an additional data plan and purchase both on a qualifying installment plan. Like Samsung, the carrier will also take up to $200 off with an eligible trade-in.&lt;/p&gt;
