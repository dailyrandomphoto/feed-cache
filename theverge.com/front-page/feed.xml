    <title>Tinder will soon let you gift a Lyft ride to your date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WxzsNXZl4qw3hrOdQ87El9bWae0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69008916/acastro_180822_1777_tinder_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cED3A4"&gt;Tinder is partnering with Lyft to offer the ability &lt;a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/news?item=122493#assets_all"&gt;to gift rides to dates without having to leave the Tinder app&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a small convenience if you already have the Lyft app downloaded, but like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248548/tinder-video-chat-launch-update"&gt;adding video chat in the app&lt;/a&gt;, it’s one less reason to switch your focus away from your match and to another app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRuyy2"&gt;There’s no firm release date for the Lyft integration other than it’s “slated to roll out in the coming months” and Tinder has no visuals to share yet for how it will work in the app. Tinder does say that Lyft’s usual safety features like location sharing with family and friends will be available from the Lyft app for gifted rides. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DfHAFWMe3g9A9X8MpIkm7OB2S1s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389905/TinderxLyft_NDC_iphone.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tinder&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rL44lT"&gt;Adding Lyft rides could be convenient, but there are some potential scenarios to be concerned about. It’s not clear at what point you’re able to order a ride, or whether both you and the person you matched with have to agree. It would be annoying (not to mention a little unsettling) for both the person you matched with in Tinder and the Lyft driver if you called a ride and they didn’t actually want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKYh2M"&gt;When asked for more details, Tinder declined and said more information would be available in the coming months. Until then, Zoom dates or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250995/tinder-trivia-live-test-launch-interactive-video-feature"&gt;Tinder’s built-in trivia feature&lt;/a&gt; might be the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRrOZf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s new Mars rover is about to spawn a tiny helicopter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_rdEDi7Xt7Te3E_SyhMbX-hH_eU=/0x130:1200x930/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69008806/middle_color_CROPPED.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Ingenuity’s debris shield lies beneath Perseverance | NASA/JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R9tli5"&gt;NASA’s Perseverance rover is getting ready to deploy a mini-helicopter named Ingenuity on Mars. The four-pound, four-blade rotorcraft will attempt the first flight of its kind on another planet, and in the process, it will test a new mode of mobility that could transform the way we Earthlings remotely explore other worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49iGBX"&gt;The craft is currently attached to the belly of Perseverance, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;landed&lt;/a&gt; at Mars’ Jezero crater in February. One of the first steps toward setting the baby helicopter off on its debut flight came this weekend when Perseverance dropped a protective shell and exposed Ingenuity to the bright Martian sunlight for the first time. “Away goes the debris shield, and here’s our first look at the helicopter,” the rover’s Twitter account said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3sQxvf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Away goes the debris shield, and here’s our first look at the helicopter. It’s stowed sideways, folded up and locked in place, so there’s some reverse origami to do before I can set it down. First though, I’ll be off to the designated “helipad,” a couple days’ drive from here. &lt;a href="https://t.co/E9zZGQk5jQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/E9zZGQk5jQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA's Perseverance Mars Rover (@NASAPersevere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere/status/1373708912281542665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e4I2nG"&gt;After dropping the debris shield, Perseverance will spend a couple of days driving itself to Ingenuity’s flight zone, which NASA officials plan to unveil in a press conference on Tuesday. The helicopter will be lowered to the ground, and Perseverance will scoot away to a safe distance of about 330 feet, leaving Ingenuity to unlock its rotor blades and carry out a few spin tests. NASA expects the first test flights to come “no earlier than the first week of April,” a statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="301QvM"&gt;The artificial boundaries of the flight zone, wherever it is, will be a 50-foot-long oval patch of land that Ingenuity will need to stay within during its flight tests. Perseverance will drop the helicopter off near one end of this flight zone, in a space engineers call the helipad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7wuKz"&gt;Deploying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21339544/nasa-mars-helicopter-ingenuity-perseverance-rover-flight-date"&gt;the first&lt;/a&gt; helicopter on Mars is no easy task. Ingenuity’s team of engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory had to account for a Martian atmosphere 100 times thinner than Earth’s, which means the craft needs to work much harder than Earth-bound helicopters to lift itself off the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Njtg1v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Every step is something to celebrate because nothing is a given”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OfEPed"&gt;And it’s not just a more powerful toy drone: Ingenuity is an $85 million spacecraft built to withstand an extremely turbulent ride to Mars — from the violent rumbling during liftoff from Earth last summer to Perseverance’s seven-minute landing sequence through Mars’ atmosphere in February. Its design also has to comply with the international 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which requires signatories to ensure their spacecraft don’t contaminate environments on other planets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqUgOf"&gt;“This was a design challenge that straddled both the aircraft and spacecraft boundaries,” says Bob Balaram, Ingenuity’s chief engineer. The team’s biggest challenge, he said, was creating a craft that can spin its blades fast enough to generate thrust, while keeping the overall design simple and lightweight — “otherwise whatever lift you generate doesn’t do any good if you’ve gotten too heavy in the process in the design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7f6eRM"&gt;Packing all that power in the craft’s four-pound body is made possible by a rectangular solar panel installed above the craft’s four carbon fiber blades. That panel also holds a tiny telecommunications device that can communicate with a node on Perseverance’s body called the Mars Helicopter Base Station, even from as far as nine football fields away.  The Base Station will help relay signals back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C2Oa0B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ingenuity will lie on the Martian surface for eternity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F4QETJ"&gt;Beneath the blades is a tissue box-sized fuselage that houses flight sensors, two cameras, batteries, and mini “survival heaters” that protect Ingenuity from freezing during nighttime on Mars, where temperatures drop as low as negative 130 degrees Fahrenheit. One of the two cameras has a 13-megapixel color camera facing the horizon that will snap and send images to Perseverance mid-flight (the other camera has a 0.5-megapixel black-and-white sensor used for navigation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0n5p5e"&gt;In all, Ingenuity will attempt to carry out five flight tests within a short, 30-day window. If the tests work, similar helicopter tech could be used in other missions, to trek places where wheeled rovers can’t reach, like caves, tunnels, or mountaintops. Ingenuity won’t fly again after its 30-day window, even if the tests are wildly successful. That’s because “we are being accommodated by a major flagship mission that’s got a huge, new astrobiology exploration ahead of it,” Balaram says. Perseverance’s primary mission is to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316093/nasas-perseverance-rover-first-drive-mars"&gt;explore&lt;/a&gt; Mars’ Jezero crater and pack soil samples into tiny, cigar-sized sample tubes that the rover will scatter around the surface for a future “fetch” rover to send back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbETgz"&gt;After that 30-day window, Ingenuity will lie on the Martian surface for eternity. If the craft’s first flight attempt doesn’t work out, Balaram said his team can still celebrate a number of achievements they’ve already made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40OWLq"&gt;“I think the main thing is, we’ve already achieved a lot of milestones just by having a design that could do all of these things, and we have had a successful test program so far,” he said. “Every step is something to celebrate because nothing is a given. It’s a fairly high-risk, high-reward type of activity. And tech demos are inherently a quite risky venture, they’re not a slam dunk.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Richard Stallman returns to the Free Software Foundation after resigning in 2019</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6xQcI_yhsEYSyIUUNtZaiEwwYKo=/0x86:2164x1529/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69008630/Screen_Shot_2021_03_22_at_11.05.09_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LibrePlanet&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pU27sb"&gt;Open-source software advocate Richard Stallman is rejoining the board of the Free Software Foundation. Stallman founded the FSF in 1985 and acted as its president &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20870050/richard-stallman-resigns-mit-free-software-foundation-epstein"&gt;until 2019&lt;/a&gt;, when he resigned after making widely criticized statements about convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqNsw2"&gt;Stallman announced the news &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nixcraft/status/1373905399707955202"&gt;during a live stream&lt;/a&gt; for the FSF project LibrePlanet. “Some of you will be happy at this, and some might be disappointed, but who knows?” he said. “In any case, that’s how it is, and I’m not planning to resign a second time.” He also mentioned that the announcement was meant to be made with a more formal video, but that “it didn’t get finished.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPXNCm"&gt;Stallman resigned from the FSF, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20870050/richard-stallman-resigns-mit-free-software-foundation-epstein"&gt;a position at MIT&lt;/a&gt;, after participating in an email conversation about &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9ke3ke/famed-computer-scientist-richard-stallman-described-epstein-victims-as-entirely-willing"&gt;MIT’s leadership and its ties with Jeffrey Epstein&lt;/a&gt;. Stallman defended MIT professor Marvin Minsky, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798900/marvin-minsky-jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-island-court-records-unsealed"&gt;allegedly had sex&lt;/a&gt; with one of Epstein’s trafficking victims — saying “the most plausible scenario” was that Minsky had been unaware the woman was being coerced and she would have “presented herself to him as entirely willing.” The exchange was posted online, sparking calls for him to step down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZmeLA"&gt;Stallman &lt;a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2019-jul-oct.html#14_September_2019_(Statements_about_Epstein)"&gt;denied defending Epstein&lt;/a&gt;, saying he wished he “could’ve prevented the misunderstanding.” But for some critics the problems &lt;a href="https://selamjie.medium.com/remove-richard-stallman-fec6ec210794"&gt;went beyond that exchange&lt;/a&gt;, covering other statements and actions he’d made over his years in the open-source software community, where critics said he’d created &lt;a href="https://selamjie.medium.com/remove-richard-stallman-appendix-a-a7e41e784f88"&gt;a hostile environment for women&lt;/a&gt;. MIT graduate Selam Jie Gano, who posted the original emails on Medium, called the Epstein statements “almost irrelevant” to the larger issue. “This was about real life actions, not only online words,” wrote Gano &lt;a href="https://selamjie.medium.com/remove-richard-stallman-fec6ec210794"&gt;in an update&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nN8Raf"&gt;Even after his resignations, Stallman remained in charge of the GNU Project, which develops and advocates for free and open-source software and operating systems. As referenced in the famous &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/linux"&gt;“I’d just like to interject” copypasta&lt;/a&gt; (which is based on &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html"&gt;a blog post by Stallman&lt;/a&gt;), the GNU utilities have been instrumental in the history of Linux, and the FSF has a similar function, acting as a nonprofit to advocate for free and open software. It publishes the GNU General Public License, under which many open-source projects are published. After being away from its leadership team for over a year, Stallman has returned to help run the FSF. The FSF wasn’t immediately available to provide comment on Stallman’s return or what role he will play on the board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft rebrands Xbox Live to Xbox network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ddmRo2OP7DilKgcwwrj4q8XRHc=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69008528/xbox_live_1280.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KHEpwd"&gt;Microsoft is rebranding Xbox Live to Xbox network. Instances of the new branding started appearing in the Xbox dashboard recently for beta testers, with clips being uploaded to “Xbox network” instead of Xbox Live. Microsoft has now confirmed the name change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVbi3S"&gt;“’Xbox network’ refers to the underlying Xbox online service, which was updated in the &lt;a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fservicesagreement&amp;amp;data=04%7C01%7Calexis.crofts%40assemblyinc.com%7C094de9662ca64e088b0208d8ed5e29c2%7Cb824bfb3918e43c2bb1cdcc1ba40a82b%7C0%7C0%7C637520336003048746%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;amp;sdata=Bp37ZUQU5G%2BIyqTGXisJA%2BfmuchnPzK%2F31zNfvmSTmE%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0"&gt;Microsoft Services Agreement&lt;/a&gt;,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The update from ‘Xbox Live’ to ‘Xbox network’ is intended to distinguish the underlying service from Xbox Live Gold memberships.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DYK03"&gt;Microsoft has used Xbox Live to refer to its underlying Xbox service since its original launch 18 years ago. Larry Hryb, better known as Major Nelson, has been known as “Xbox Live’s Major Nelson” for years, but Hryb now refers to himself as “Xbox’s Major Nelson.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2ertIQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Xbox network   &lt;a href="https://t.co/E49QQzQFad"&gt;https://t.co/E49QQzQFad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/OQS1cRsrZ2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OQS1cRsrZ2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1373458474898706433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sh39u4"&gt;Hints at a name change originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355756/microsoft-xbox-live-rename-gold-free-rumors"&gt;appeared back in August&lt;/a&gt;, after Microsoft updated its Services Agreement. At the time, Microsoft said it wasn’t rebranding the service and had no plans to discontinue Xbox Live Gold. Instead, Microsoft went on to announce a price hike for Xbox Live Gold that the company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/23/22245630/microsoft-xbox-live-gold-price-increase-reversed-f2p"&gt;forced to quickly reverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGfsFe"&gt;Microsoft is now planning to drop the subscription requirement for free-to-play games on its Xbox network in the coming months. Games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;will no longer require Xbox Live Gold as a result, but Microsoft hasn’t yet confirmed exactly when the paywall will be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon threatened warehouse workers organizing amid COVID-19 pandemic, says US labor board complaint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ggV_SB8VTw06IuLRYUbxpQdV3rw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69008497/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nv0dDf"&gt;The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) found merit to the claim that Amazon threatened and retaliated against workers protesting the company’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an NLRB complaint &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy8ngk/amazon-interrogated-worker-who-led-first-covid-19-strikes-nlrb-says"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The case, which centers on a warehouse in Queens, New York, was settled before it went to trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyJ0x4"&gt;The NLRB investigation found that warehouse managers may have violated US labor law on four accounts, &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reports. During the pandemic, they allegedly instructed employees not to organize without first notifying them, interrogated workers about the walkout, and threatened to discipline those who spoke to colleagues about the protests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1HT77"&gt;The complaint reportedly said that Amazon illegally interrogated and disciplined Jonathan Bailey, one of the lead walkout organizers. He coordinated a protest after a colleague tested positive for COVID-19 — the first time this had happened at an Amazon facility in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqbGUp"&gt;The day after the walkout, a regional manager interrogated Bailey for an hour and a half, telling him his behavior might constitute harassment, &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reports. He also demanded Bailey alert him in advance of any future protests. A week later, Bailey was written up for harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulzBui"&gt;“Amazon did its best to keep everybody working while simultaneously crushing our effort to fight back,” Bailey told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlvBxY"&gt;He’s not alone in this assessment. In February, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/technology/amazon-new-york-lawsuit-covid.html"&gt;New York Attorney General Letitia James sued the company&lt;/a&gt; for failing to provide adequate safety measures and retaliating against workers who raised concerns. The case is focused on the Queens warehouse as well as a facility on Staten Island. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t99dUR"&gt;The NLRB has separately found merit to allegations of retaliation from warehouse workers in Chicago, &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/17/amazon-covid-chicago-nlrb-strike/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Employees say they were retaliated against in the wake of protests regarding how the company handled the COVID-19 crisis. The US labor board is reportedly in the process of negotiating a settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKNf57"&gt;The news comes amid a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;historic union vote&lt;/a&gt; at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama. Workers began voting by mail on February 8th. Votes will be counted on March 30th. If the effort is successful, it’ll be the first Amazon union in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcrEAH"&gt;Amazon is disputing the results of the NLRB investigation. “While we disagree with allegations made in the case, we are pleased to put this matter behind us,” said spokesperson Leah Seay, in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The health and safety of our employees is our top priority and we are proud to provide inclusive environments, where employees can excel without fear of retaliation, intimidation or harassment.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This USB-C gadget from hell brings back the worst part of USB-A</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gp_C2T5JLl28DIh5pVJILBmhwcI=/0x86:2048x1451/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69008479/Ew_iOliWQAEs1eJ.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/mifune/status/1373565157759156226/photo/2" target="_blank"&gt;Pim de Groot (@mifune) / Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r8U7yG"&gt;USB-C ports, I am occasionally forced to admit, are somewhat confusing. Different standards, different charging speeds, different data and video capabilities, proprietary labels like Thunderbolt, all on top of identical-looking plugs — it can be a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uj9Xu9"&gt;But one thing that USB-C ports had going for them was a solution for one of the biggest annoyances of USB-A — it’s no longer possible to insert a USB cable the “wrong” way, thanks to the symmetrical design of the plugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qu8Vph"&gt;Or, at least, it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;, until mechanical engineer Pim de Groot came along with a USB-C gadget from hell, which &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; behave differently depending on which way your USB-C plug is facing. And I hate it so, so much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BZrSEj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’ve made a Cursed USB-C 2.0 device. It behaves differently based on the orientation of the plug. &lt;a href="https://t.co/8Ko66wPuV2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8Ko66wPuV2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Pim de Groot (@mifune) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mifune/status/1373564866443759617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JX8MB8"&gt;The device itself is rather simple: when the USB-C cable is plugged in one way, a green LED lights up on the top of the device. Plug it in reversed, and the bottom LED lights up green, a malevolent horror balefully blazing out in a sea of black silicon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5VEy88"&gt;What unearthly science has birthed this horror? Well, as de Groot explains, USB-C plugs aren’t &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; symmetrical — there’s a set of contacts that are only used when connecting plugs as a USB 2.0 device that’s only found on one side of the plug. And when you connect a plug to use in a USB 2.0 setting, you apparently can take advantage of that to create de Groot’s cursed device above, which uses a pair of microcontrollers that each only light up when they detect those contacts. (USB-C 3.0 connections apparently are immune to the trick, thankfully.)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gaze into the abyss.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GzviUN"&gt;Unfortunately, instead of viewing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mifune/status/1373565157759156226"&gt;de Groot’s eldritch sigil-etched monstrosity&lt;/a&gt; as a cautionary tale, some developers are looking to take things even further &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_MG_/status/1368736720133398530"&gt;by trying to intentionally build a USB-C cable&lt;/a&gt; that requires a “superposition” maneuver of constantly unplugging and replugging it in different orientations before it successfully works. For the sake of all that is good in this word, we can only hope that these efforts fail to come to fruition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V0cHWh"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Laughing_Man?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Laughing_Man&lt;/a&gt;, is there a way for a Type C cable to detect rotation? &lt;br&gt;I want to to make a Type C cable that implements “Type A mode” so it never works until you have unplugged &amp;amp; rotated it at least twice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m don’t see any orientation indicator possibilities from host :( &lt;a href="https://t.co/Z8v8E8KQzy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Z8v8E8KQzy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— _MG_ (@_MG_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_MG_/status/1368736720133398530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Lego announces its biggest and most detailed Space Shuttle set yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ARjpq4LuruhqjElgw4_2MAD8h5k=/34x0:394x240/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69008413/LEGO_NASA_Space_Shuttle_Discovery___LEGO_Designer_Video_10283_ci3ZwLhGNTw_Animated_Image__Large_.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://youtu.be/ci3ZwLhGNTw" target="_blank"&gt;Lego&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UEs4pR"&gt;In celebration of the 40th anniversary of the first Space Shuttle launch, Lego is releasing a new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fnasa-space-shuttle-discovery-10283&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F22%2F22345026%2Flego-space-shuttle-nasa-discovery-columbia-hubble-telescope" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Space Shuttle Discovery set&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with NASA. Discovery was not the first shuttle to take flight — that would be Columbia, which likely stirs up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/1/14458170/nasa-columbia-space-shuttle-accident-anniversary-engineer-interview"&gt;too many sad feelings &lt;/a&gt;for a Lego set — but it was the shuttle that launched the Hubble Space Telescope, which is also included in the set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tGHmOC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ci3ZwLhGNTw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="47926R"&gt;Available April 1st for $200, the set has 2,354 pieces, including three newly designed pieces for the windscreen and payload bay. It also includes 108 drum lacquered silver pieces, the most of any Lego set yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IMC4a"&gt;At 1:70 scale, the assembled shuttle comes in at around 8.5 inches high, 21 inches long, and 13.5 inches wide. The set comes with two stands so you can display the shuttle and telescope separately or together, as though the telescope is emerging from the payload bay. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lego space shuttle Discovery sitting on a table, with the Hubble telescope sitting just above its open payload doors." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EAdhLPyze9LDVJ8GW2gTScpMLrI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389680/10283_Lifestyle_03.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Faboutus%2Fnews%2F2021%2Fmarch%2Flego-nasa-discovery-space-shuttle&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F22%2F22345026%2Flego-space-shuttle-nasa-discovery-columbia-hubble-telescope" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;Lego&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space friends!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2VKNgK"&gt;This Discovery set is a big step up from previous Lego Space Shuttle sets like the Lego &lt;a href="https://brickset.com/sets/10231-1/Shuttle-Expedition"&gt;10231&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://brickset.com/sets/7470-1/Space-Shuttle-Discovery-STS-31"&gt;7470&lt;/a&gt;, not just in the number of pieces but in its overall sleekness and level of detail. The elevons on the wings can be tilted up and down by turning the middle engine, the leading edges of the wings have gray pieces representing the reinforced carbon-carbon of a real shuttle, and pulling up the flight deck reveals a mid-deck for tiny astronauts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bird’s eye view of the Lego space shuttle on a table, with it’s payload bay open to show the shiny interior of its doors.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look at those shiny doors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="33z9zz"&gt;Considering I derived great joy as a child from my (in retrospect) very dinky &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/RANXrB1LtxI"&gt;“Space Shuttle with Satellite”&lt;/a&gt; Hess truck, I am fully convinced this set will cure my ever-present existential dread. Please join me in appreciating these detail shots while I set a calendar reminder for April 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A hand lifting the flight deck from the space shuttle, revealing another deck underneath.

    <title>Samsung is reportedly working on a double-folding phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F2-rHBwDs0WYxMxmC5nGGhJcxcM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69008123/acastro_190503_1777_samsung_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gBFX4j"&gt;Samsung is reportedly working on a double-folding phone to add to its lineup, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Samsung-bets-big-on-foldable-smartphones-amid-chip-crunch"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/22/samsung-double-folding-smartphone-report/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to the article, the phone would fold into three segments using two hinges and could be announced “as early as the end of this year.” The phone would be a third option in Samsung’s foldable lineup, joining the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260357/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-price-drop-1200"&gt;Z Flip&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are also expected to appear in new versions this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6Tzqm"&gt;According to the report, the design is still being finalized, but &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;’s sources say its screen could have a more standard 16:9 or 18:9 aspect ratio, making it easier for app makers to design for than the 25:9 screen found on the Z Fold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBZaI5"&gt;We’ve seen phones with multiple folds before: Xiaomi’s folding phone prototype &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/23/18194065/xiaomi-foldable-phone-tablet-device-teaser"&gt;folded at two points&lt;/a&gt;, but the company has &lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/03/19/xiaomi-foldable-mi-mix-smartphone-leaks-real-skin/"&gt;reportedly adopted a more Galaxy Fold-like design&lt;/a&gt; for its upcoming foldable. Huawei’s Mate X2 foldable also uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;a similar design to Samsung’s&lt;/a&gt;. It would be a bit ironic, then, if Samsung’s working on a double-folding design after others adopted its single-fold style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bh1ED8"&gt;It’s possible that Samsung is introducing the new type of foldable to ease its power users into a transition to the form factor. Samsung says it might be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335502/galaxy-note-2021-delay-canceled-samsung"&gt;skipping a new Galaxy Note this year&lt;/a&gt; but wasn’t exactly clear on why. There was talk of streamlining its phone offerings and of the global chip shortage, but this could be a test to see if Note users are ready for the fold. By giving customers three foldable options to choose from, Samsung could be trying to make it as likely as possible that people will find one that works for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jl3OaD"&gt;It’s likely the multifold phone’s release will depend on whether Samsung can figure out how to navigate the chip shortages &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order"&gt;that have been affecting the entire industry&lt;/a&gt;. Folding phones are already more difficult to make than standard smartphones, and if Samsung’s not able to get the chips it needs, it could push the company’s plans back. Still, it’s exciting to hear that Samsung is working on a third type of foldable, as it indicates that Samsung still sees the form factor as the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vU7xI9"&gt;Did you know that you could mute all system audio by simply holding the mute button on the DualSense for about one second? I’ve had a PS5 for months, yet I only now realized this hidden feature exists after &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzw4DQT0qzs"&gt;watching a YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; that the algorithm served me. You’ll know it’s working when the orange mute light strobes softly, then you won’t hear any system sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQnHg4"&gt;Apparently, this trick works to disable all audio, no matter the audio source, be it your speakers, headphones wired into the controller’s 3.5mm jack, a wireless gaming headset, or one plugged in via one of the console’s USB ports. Even though the DualSense has some limited PC support, this feature is exclusive to PS5, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PYvPR"&gt;This video isn’t the exclusive source for this information, and it doesn’t appear to have been the first to crack that the function exists. A Google search for this feature shows a steady stream of gamers are accidentally stumbling upon it on a rolling basis, perhaps as more PS5 consoles become available to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HREzHL"&gt;Given that the console is still difficult to buy, let alone find in stock, I figured it’d be useful for anyone reading this who’s trying their luck at getting one. I’m not sure I would have ever figured it out myself if I hadn’t been served that one video, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFESYQ"&gt;It’s a handy feature, though it might take a little practice for me to take advantage of this feature versus my usual muting method, which is just to yank my headphones off. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is turning Keanu Reeves’ BRZRKR comic into a live-action movie and anime</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SoGFgQILi3tbOeKnFXwzYlxJcUI=/7x0:603x397/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69007989/brzkr.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yvWwsR"&gt;Netflix has its next major action franchise: an adaptation of Keanu Reeves’ new &lt;em&gt;BRZRKR&lt;/em&gt; comic book series, which the streaming service is turning into both a live-action film (produced and starring Reeves) and a sequel anime series (with Reeves voicing his character), the company announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmjT0T"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2021/3/4/22313805/keanu-reeves-brzrkr-comic-boom-studios-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BRZRKR&lt;/em&gt; is a new 12-issue series&lt;/a&gt; from Boom Studios (the first issue of which was released earlier in March) co-written by Reeves himself (in his comics debut) and Matt Kindt (&lt;em&gt;Folklords, Justice League of America&lt;/em&gt;) with art by Ron Garney. Fittingly, Reeves will play the title character in both the upcoming live-action series and the anime, although there’s no release date announced yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IA2wab"&gt;The ultra-violent comic follows an immortal berserker — who coincidentally looks almost exactly like Keanu — over his 80,000 year life, culminating in the present day, where he works for the US government in exchange for help discovering the secrets of his life and how he can finally die. (It’s a similar concept to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21323386/the-old-guard-netflix-palm-springs-hulu-streaming-summer-blockbuster"&gt;Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;The Old Guard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is also based on a popular run of comics and is viewed as another potential franchise for the streaming service.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3WJ6Ez"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Exciting news! Netflix is developing a live action film AND follow-up anime series based on Keanu Reeves’ BRZRKR, a brutally epic saga about an immortal warrior’s 80,000 year fight through the ages. Reeves will produce and star in the film, and voice the anime. &lt;a href="https://t.co/RVWEuBCXTJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RVWEuBCXTJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NX (@NXOnNetflix) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1374073397450276868?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FRJm0B"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BRZRKR&lt;/em&gt; was a massive crowdfunding success (helped in part by Reeves’ involvement), raising nearly $2 million between &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/boom-studios/brzrkr-by-keanu-reeves-matt-kindt-and-ron-garney"&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; and additional funding &lt;a href="https://app.crowdox.com/projects/boom-studios/brzrkr-by-keanu-reeves-matt-kindt-and-ron-garney"&gt;before the first issue even hit shelves&lt;/a&gt;. The series has so far sold has over 615,000 copies, making it the &lt;a href="https://www.cbr.com/brzrkr-comic-600000-copies-keanu-reeves/"&gt;second-most sold comic book in the last decade&lt;/a&gt; (following &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/7/26/8893276/best-selling-comic-book-of-all-time-x-men-1-marvel-dc"&gt;Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; #1 relaunch in 2015&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3OCOO"&gt;The upcoming adaption fits Netflix’s current strategy perfectly: the streaming service is always hunting for more must-watch content, and particularly for the kinds of shows and movies that can build franchises to rival those of Disney’s Marvel or &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; or HBO Max’s &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; universes. The multimedia method for the project is also part of Netflix’s  modern approach, mirroring animated expansions of projects like &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; or Zack Snyder’s upcoming &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; that are planned to help keep viewers invested even after the marquee show or movie has debuted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="soEaMv"&gt;It’s also the highest-profile project to come from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/13/21219574/netflix-boom-studios-first-look-deal-comic-book-tv-show-adapations"&gt;Netflix’s recent first-look deal with Boom Studios&lt;/a&gt;, which gives the streaming service the first shot at adapting comics from the indie publisher. &lt;/p&gt;
