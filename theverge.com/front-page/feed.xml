    <title>Nightmare of the Wolf captures the soul of The Witcher, even without Geralt</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="witcher nightmare of the wolf" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M2ArfLGC0CcDAeaKQpup-Yo5nPI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764956/The_Witcher__Nightmare_of_the_Wolf_00_47_25_01.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TfqYjS"&gt;If there’s one thing that ties the many iterations of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; together — whether it’s the original books, the hit games, or more recently the live-action show — it’s Geralt of Rivia. The lovably miserable monster hunter is the core of the series in a way that’s rare for fantasy, which often follows stories bigger than just one person. But that’s also what makes &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;, an anime spinoff on Netflix, so interesting. It’s a prequel that shifts back in time to focus on Geralt’s mentor Vesemir, who can feel like the polar opposite of his protege: charming, playful, and with a voracious appetite for the finer things in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UOUnn"&gt;It’s a refreshing twist that also does a good job of exploring some of the mysteries at the heart of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; universe, without getting away from the hallmarks of the series. &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; might not be the most welcoming starting point for the franchise, but it’s a whole lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JoDnv"&gt;The anime movie jumps back and forth in time, focusing on Vesemir’s life during two key points. Initially, it’s mostly about his upbringing and what led him to life as a witcher (which, for the uninitiated, are mutated monster hunters who train from a young age to kill deadly creatures for cash). Essentially, he fled a life of servitude in hopes of some respect (and money) hunting monsters, unaware of the harsh realities at Kaer Morhen, the bleak castle that serves as a training ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JO4HXs"&gt;These scenes show just how brutal the witcher training is and use that as way to explore the different ways people react to trauma. Witcher stories often talk about how few candidates actually survive this process, and in &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; you can see why: young boys are forced to fight seemingly impossible odds in a nightmare swamp and, if they manage to survive that, subjected to a painful alchemy meant to enhance their strength and senses. Those who make it through can be grim like Geralt, or hide their pain under a lust for life like Vesemir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sErr2Y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Witcher’s anime spinoff keeps the bathtub, but adds a fun-loving lead","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22602293/witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-anime-spinoff-netflix-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="63n6Ov"&gt;The other half of the story follows Vesemir at the height of his abilities. (Witchers age slowly, so even though he’s a handsome-looking young man with a square jaw and mischievous smirk, he’s actually 70 years old.) At this point he’s renowned for his ability to slay tough monsters and is able to charge a hefty price because of it; one of the earliest scenes shows Vesemir in the bath, haggling with an elf over his fee, before deciding he’s too expensive. At the same time, though, monsters seem to be few and far between, creating a conundrum for Vesemir and his compatriots. As one witcher puts it, “we’re putting ourselves out of business with every monster we kill.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="witcher nightmare of the wolf" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BqxXv5jpHxRnWlRybOfk_X_KAo0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800825/The_Witcher__Nightmare_of_the_Wolf_00_35_02_04.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HIpLJ5"&gt;As these two periods intersect, they shine light on a very pertinent relationship: namely between the witchers and the monsters they’ve sworn to kill. I won’t spoil anything, but &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; answers some questions that have been floating around on message boards for years about the origins of both hunter and hunted. And those new answers will likely change how you think about them both. Unfortunately, these revelations might be lost on newcomers, those who aren’t already immersed in the intrigue of the Continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBnznP"&gt;The good news is that, revelations aside, &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; is still a blast to watch even if you’re coming in cold. The shift to animation means that the action is more fluid than ever, particularly when it comes to Vesemir slicing his way through beasts with an inhuman grace, all while making smart-ass quips. (The slick action shouldn’t be too surprising, as &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf &lt;/em&gt;was created by Studio Mir, the same team behind shows like &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Korra&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts&lt;/em&gt;.) Whereas combat in the live-action show and games can feel heavy and laborious, in the anime things are much faster and more dynamic, befitting Vesemir as the new lead. For Geralt, fighting seems like a chore. Vesemir has fun. That doesn’t mean the battles don’t pack a punch: &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf &lt;/em&gt;is incredibly violent. It’ll only be a few minutes in before you see dismembered limbs and gushing blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1LagV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; manages to capture much of what has made &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; such a hit — a dark fantasy world, political intrigue, brutal action, buff men in the bath — but it does so without spending much time setting up the world. It assumes you already care. (This is especially true when it comes to the Big Twist, which won’t mean much if you aren’t invested in the universe.) So as fun as its gory action and plentiful one-liners can be, the movie can still feel like supplementary material — something to hold you over until season 2 finally drops in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gX4lyi"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is streaming now on Netflix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is retiring the swipe up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N0ZsIzlUP4EyC0XM1af1uO3U3yg=/0x0:1125x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764905/swipeup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ap5gV0"&gt;The swipe-up will be no more. Instagram is seemingly planning to retire the feature, which allows people to visit external webpages by swiping up, starting August 30th, according to a notification viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Instead of the swipe-up link, Instagram says people will be able to use link stickers, which are exactly as they sound: tappable stickers in stories that take people to external websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JR35W3"&gt;It’s unclear why Instagram is retiring the swipe up — a feature that’s spawned its own category of GIFs and a phrase that’s now part of the lexicon. However, a test from earlier this summer might provide a clue. In June, Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555434/instagram-link-sticker-post-test-swipe-up"&gt;began testing&lt;/a&gt; these stickers for various users, not just people who already had swipe up privileges. (Users have to be verified or have at least 10,000 followers to gain access to swipe up.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHBqsC"&gt;At the time of the test, Vishal Shah, Instagram’s former head of product, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the stickers fit more with the way people currently use the platform. He also said the goal was to more widely roll out the stickers. The only difference between the two features, apart from the obvious gesture difference, is viewers can respond to stories that have a link sticker, but cannot respond to swipe up stories.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrmplI"&gt;We’ve reached out to Instagram for comment and for clarification on whether the sticker links will be available to everyone or only people who have swipe up currently. We’ll update when we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Android 12’s clever new auto-rotate system  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ANwkcSj_r9As8hf02dEtaiIL_d0=/0x0:620x413/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764903/VRG_1777_Android_12_001.5.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oH2k7i"&gt;Google’s upcoming Android 12 update has plenty of eye-catching features, but don’t let yourself be fooled: sometimes, it’s the smaller, less obvious elements that are most deserving of your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MncrqD"&gt;That’s certainly the case with the software’s new auto-rotate system. With Android 12, Google has introduced a smarter way to control when your screen switches between its vertical and horizontal orientations. And while the improvement isn’t getting all that much time in the spotlight, you’d better believe it has the potential to make your life a whole lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFc34j"&gt;In short, instead of relying solely on your phone’s accelerometer to figure out which way you’re holding the device and then rotate your screen accordingly, Android 12 allows your device to use its front-facing camera as a guide. That way, the software can sense how that striking face of yours is positioned at any given moment and make sure the screen is always positioned to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21VymK"&gt;The advantage is that you then avoid those awkward situations where you’re lying down — and thus holding your phone at an angle — and the screen then flips into its landscape orientation when you’re actually &lt;em&gt;looking &lt;/em&gt;at it in its portrait mode. Since the system pays attention to the position of your face, it makes the screen match the way you’re actually &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; the device, no matter how you might be holding it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBeWZM"&gt;Activating the new option couldn’t be easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fFiin7"&gt;Four steps to a smarter auto-rotate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="phGYzW"&gt;(Note that these steps are specific to Google’s Android 12 interface and the way the new auto-rotate system is presented on Pixel phones. It’s not entirely clear at this point how other device-makers will alter the software’s interface or what specific features they’ll offer on their devices.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hAjnCl"&gt;Swipe down twice from the top of your screen and then tap the gear-shaped settings icon in the lower-right corner of the Quick Settings panel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="N4bcC7"&gt;Tap “Display.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t0vEVk"&gt;Scroll down until you see the line that says “Auto-rotate screen.” Tap it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Vh5zL1"&gt;Make sure the toggle next to “Use Auto-rotate” is in the on position, then activate the toggle next to “Enable Face Detection.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="That tucked-away toggle is the secret to enabling Android 12’s effective new auto-rotate technology." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/00LsbktXHvkM0rtH3wvtKLDL4Ro=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800854/android_12_auto_rotate_off.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This tucked-away toggle will enable Android 12’s effective new auto-rotate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once you turn on the auto-rotate, you can then enable face detection." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2_7gzJuEmIdadnUwBsNoHUWSmsc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800199/android_12_auto_rotate.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once you turn on the auto-rotate, you can then enable face detection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ClDJP7"&gt;And that’s it: all that’s left is to use your phone normally and watch as Android 12’s auto-rotate enhancement works its magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgyUME"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gqvYKU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In Greece, heatwaves are so bad officials are considering giving them names</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GREECE-WEATHER-HEAT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rmfOSGlKzhpJeJjxR_fCUTVh308=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764899/1234294387.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qNU8bu"&gt;During a summer of punishing heat, Greek officials and researchers are thinking about naming individual heatwaves to help keep people safe when temperatures soar. It’s part of a bigger push internationally to create a system for naming and ranking heatwaves, similar to the process for major storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R6jqNA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re a silent killer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BlvbBh"&gt;“Heatwaves cause a lot of deaths; they don’t make noise and they may not be visible but they’re a silent killer,” Kostas Lagouvardos, research director at the National Observatory of Athens, recently told &lt;em&gt;The Observer&lt;/em&gt;, a Sunday paper published by Guardian Media Group. “We believe people will be more prepared to face an upcoming weather event when the event has a name.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QC4aZR"&gt;Extreme heat kills 5 million people a year around the world, one recent &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(21)00081-4/fulltext"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found. Many of those deaths could be prevented by encouraging people to prepare for and find shelter from the heat, and by building more heat-resilient neighborhoods. The hope is that official names will prevent extreme heat events from sneaking up on people and make disaster preparedness for extreme heat a more urgent priority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ry5RJx"&gt;Greece has been wracked with repeated heatwaves this summer, which have also stoked devastating wildfires. The worst heatwave to hit the country in several decades landed in August, when temperatures soared to a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/world/europe/greece-turkey-heat-fires.html"&gt;record-breaking 115.3 degrees&lt;/a&gt; Fahrenheit (46.3 degrees Celsius). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OcFhE"&gt;Even under normal circumstances, Athens is the hottest capital city in mainland Europe. In July, Athens named former deputy Mayor Eleni Myrivili its new “chief heat officer,” the first such role in Europe. In a recent interview with &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/21/world/europe/athens-is-only-getting-hotter-its-new-chief-heat-officer-hopes-to-cool-it-down.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Myrivilli said talks are underway over whether to name heatwaves after people or cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfTBz7"&gt;The World Meteorological Organization already comes up with names for tropical storms. The practice of giving storms a human name started in the 1950s because it was easier than referring to them using latitude and longitude. Now, storm names like Sandy, Maria, and Katrina are thought to make it easier to issue warnings to the public and drum up news coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JOO7K"&gt;Creating a similar naming convention globally for heatwaves is the top priority of a new Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance forged last year. Its members include the City of Athens, as well as dozens of partners from other cities and charities including the Rockefeller Foundation and the Red Cross Global Disaster Preparedness Center​. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="2aspIn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The first step to being able to mitigate the risk to vulnerable communities” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WUpbqj"&gt;If the alliance succeeds in its goals, new names for heatwaves would also come with a ranking. That’s also similar to tropical storms, which are given a category from one to five based on their wind speeds. Ranking heatwaves could be “trickier” Lagouvardos told &lt;em&gt;The Observer, &lt;/em&gt;because risk can depend on population density and differences in temperatures from place to place. But temperatures over 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) could be the benchmark for naming a heatwave, according to Lagouvardos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJpB2O"&gt;“Naming heat waves as a global threat is the first step to being able to mitigate the risk to vulnerable communities,” California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a &lt;a href="https://www.onebillionresilient.org/post/extreme-heat-resilience-alliance-reducing-extreme-heat-risk-for-vulnerable-people"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; when the Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance formed. Older people, children, and city neighborhoods with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452777/hot-summer-weather-race-urban-heat-island-us-cities"&gt;more residents of color&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22575481/nyc-urban-heat-island-effect-thermal-camera-surface-temperature"&gt;fewer green spaces&lt;/a&gt; are often more vulnerable to heat-related illness and death. Regions with typically cooler weather can also be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580120/emergency-department-visits-spiked-june-heat-wave-us-northwest"&gt;uniquely vulnerable&lt;/a&gt; because cities and homes weren’t built to stand the heat, and residents haven’t had to prepare for such extremes in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUeQOK"&gt;Whatever plans ultimately materialize in Greece or elsewhere, heatwaves are becoming even more formidable threats because of global warming. Extreme heat events have already become &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;more common&lt;/a&gt; across much of the world, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594471/heatwaves-prediction-more-study-climate-change"&gt;more record-shattering heatwaves&lt;/a&gt; are forecast for the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tz0xG4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmSm0L"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hbn9U9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pfizer vaccine will be officially called Comirnaty, for some reason</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Athlone Stadium Mass Vaccination Site" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CCxCKPTiWxB8TbXqVhUxWuq1SW4=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764647/1234776741.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ByzQvk"&gt;With official Food and Drug Administration approval, the Pfizer / BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22616546/pfizer-covid-vaccine-fda-approval-licensing"&gt;can now be marketed as Comirnaty in the US&lt;/a&gt;, great news for general vaccine acceptance, sure, but also anyone who loves to fixate on bizarre drug names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pHcACr"&gt;Comirnaty is apparently supposed to be a portmanteau of several words — community, immunity, COVID-19, and mRNA — &lt;a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/pfizer-biontech-select-comirnaty-as-brand-name-for-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fierce Pharma&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. The branding was produced for Pfizer-BioNTech by the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Brand Institute — “&lt;a href="https://www.brandinstitute.com/"&gt;The World’s #1 Naming Company&lt;/a&gt;” — and while it doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue, it is at least shorter than most drug names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGKa9H"&gt;On the other hand, it’s not nearly as metal as &lt;a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/moderna-secures-spikevax-name-europe-joins-pfizer-s-comirnaty-awaiting-official-name-and"&gt;Spikevax&lt;/a&gt;, the European brand name of the Moderna vaccine and another Brand Institute project. Spikevax&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;directly references the spiky structure of COVID-19 and the word vaccines (having “vax” in the name is big, I’ve read). It could mark quite a badass second wind for US Moderna fans &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/04/pfizer-gang-and-sadness-vaccine-culture/618755/"&gt;who’ve lived in the shadow of the “hot-person vaccine”&lt;/a&gt; once it's approved by the FDA. Vaxzevria, the brand name for the AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe, is a bit more inexplicable. I really have nothing to say about it other than good on them for getting vax in there, and for immediately &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latveria"&gt;bringing Dr. Doom to mind&lt;/a&gt; anytime I read the name quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nPJsRC"&gt;The names are goofy, but the absurdity is highlighted because, other than during our dark pandemic era, when would anyone notice the brand name of a vaccine? We’re at a perfect intersection of having enough time to care, enough fear to obsess, and enough nihilism to laugh. Remember this next year &lt;a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza_virus_vaccine-vial_intramuscular/article.htm"&gt;when new flu shot brand names drop&lt;/a&gt;. Afluria 2 will need your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5zzzQb"&gt;Netflix has released a lot of information about its movie lineup through the end of the year, including details of its holiday slate of films. If you love cheesy holiday movies, it seems like Netflix will have you covered this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSdJca"&gt;Fans of the ridiculous &lt;em&gt;The Princess Switch&lt;/em&gt; movies starring Vanessa Hudgens will be pleased to know that there’s a third one set to release in November. There’s also &lt;em&gt;A Castle for Christmas&lt;/em&gt;, a romcom about a woman who wants to buy a castle in Scotland, which is also scheduled for November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULSic7"&gt;There are a number of non-holiday movies on the way this fall and winter, too, and we’ve listed out the full schedule below. Note that movies will hit theaters shortly before they come to Netflix, and we’ve noted when that’s the case.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best gaming laptops in 2021: seven laptops to get your game on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Gaming Laptops 2021: Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 gaming laptop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dFgjUrUVReawUz4BcRUID8XTWDI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856650/akrales_210226_4440_0019.9.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best gaming laptop is the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales/ The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best gaming laptop at every size and price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="SKtFh9"&gt;The best gaming laptops are changing every year. The early days of mobile gaming were largely desktop replacements — clunky chassis, multiple power bricks, and RGB lighting galore. But the top contenders now are different. Manufacturers are finally putting powerful specs in sleeker, more portable, and more professional builds. They have excellent, fast refreshing screens that are necessary for a great gaming experience. These laptops aren’t just great for gaming, but for everyday work as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiHviH"&gt;The best gaming laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;. It can handle the most demanding games on the market today and also makes a great daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRi2QJ"&gt;We’ll be updating this page regularly as the best gaming laptops hit shelves throughout this year. Some exciting updates are on the way. AMD and Nvidia have announced their next-gen series of mobile processors and mobile graphics cards — the Ryzen 5000 series and the GeForce RTX 3000 series, respectively — and we’re already seeing them in premium gaming laptops across manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGRnFN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;QHD screen&lt;/a&gt; is another feature to watch for in the best gaming laptops. A growing number of manufacturers are releasing configurations with 1440p displays, even in gaming laptops under $2,000. These options can hit a sweet spot for many gamers: a better experience than 1080p without the price premium or raw horsepower required for a 4K display. You can expect decently high refresh rates from these panels as well, depending on the model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5KtNO"&gt;One more thing to keep in mind with the best gaming laptops is the power you can expect. Not all chips with the same name are created equal — the RTX 3070 in one laptop may not deliver the same frame rates as the RTX 3070 in another laptop due to its wattage (as well as other factors like the processor and cooling). Nvidia now requires companies to disclose clock speeds and graphics power on each model’s product page, but plenty of manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;haven’t done that yet&lt;/a&gt;. Your best bet, if you can’t find those numbers on a company’s website, is to read some reviews and make sure the model you’re considering will deliver the frame rates you’re looking for. We will note the wattage used in any laptops we review with the new RTX graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dqOSgQ"&gt;Asus’s ROG Zephyrus G14 was our top gaming laptop pick for quite a while. It did just about everything right, and we weren’t sure whether Asus could ever replicate its resounding success. But somehow, the company managed to make the G14 just a bit bigger, and a heck of a lot better. In doing so, it’s created the ROG Zephyrus G15, the best 15-inch rig you can buy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsXGzm"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not making any compromises on performance for that portability: it’s powered by the top mobile chips that AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and includes a fast 165Hz QHD (1440p) display. Together, those components can handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. The panel has excellent color reproduction as well, so your games will look great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMlhzT"&gt;But it’s not just the gaming; almost everything else about the G15 is great, too. The audio (pumped from a six-speaker array) has strong percussion and bass, the keyboard and touchpad have a satisfying click, the port selection leaves little to be desired, and the battery can last for a whopping eight and a half hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MktsFD"&gt;The G15 won’t be the laptop for everyone. There’s no webcam, which is a significant oversight, and some may prefer something more affordable, or with a flashier aesthetic. But as a package, the G15 is the one to beat. Not only is it the best gaming laptop you can buy, but it’s also one of the best laptops you can buy, period. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gXl1tL"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ibDYbq"&gt;The best gaming laptop in a 14-inch chassis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PjVXGI"&gt;The ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best 14-inch gaming laptop you can buy. We most recently reviewed last year’s model, which includes AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series up to the eight-core Ryzen 9 4900HS and an Nvidia RTX 2060 GPU. There’s a brand-new model out featuring the Ryzen 5000 series and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series graphics, which we’re looking forward to getting our hands on ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvmPMM"&gt;For well under $2,000, the Zephyrus crams one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market into a super portable 14-inch chassis. With capable cooling to boot, the laptop delivers frame rates we’ve never seen in a laptop of this size before. It handled every game we threw at it without breaking a sweat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRoiIm"&gt;But aside from its excellent gaming performance, the G14 makes a great daily driver. The keyboard, touchpad, display, and port selection are all excellent. Even the battery life is good — something we almost never get to say about gaming laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yypId"&gt;There are a few downsides to the G14, but they’re fairly small and user-dependent. The most significant note is that it lacks a webcam; you’ll need an external one if you plan on taking video calls. There’s also some bleed in the backlighting, there’s no Thunderbolt connectivity (since it’s an AMD system, and that’s an Intel standard), and the fans can get louder than most under load. But these are very much nitpicks that won’t have a large impact on plenty of people’s gaming experience. Overall, we have very few complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eM7Jm"&gt;Asus recently collaborated with DJ Alan Walker on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629096/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-alan-walker-edition-dj-deck-gaming-laptop"&gt;Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition&lt;/a&gt;, with a box that becomes  DJ deck. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Best gaming laptop 2021: Razer Blade Pro 17 gaming laptop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Hw1GXC0JJNr36nQ6K4vzlWTH-k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21820230/mchin_181119_4158_0015.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a monster of a gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yzdsDK"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jT5h16"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E8Fdz3"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 delivers some of the best gaming performance you can find in a laptop — but that’s not even its superpower. What makes Razer’s 17-inch flagship so impressive is it packs that unbelievable power into a thin and attractive chassis. It’s just 0.8 inches thick and only requires one charging brick — so you can carry it around in a backpack or briefcase without compromising on power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaBYbX"&gt;Gaming enthusiasts can opt for a model with a 300Hz screen — the highest refresh rate you can get on a laptop — while folks who want to combine gaming with some creative work can opt for a 120Hz touchscreen configuration. Both models come with a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, which adds a touch of color to the Pro’s design without being too obnoxious for the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsGaDN"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 certainly isn’t cheap, but it’s the laptop to buy if you want the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 Advantage Edition is powered by an impressive AMD processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2kvoth"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SAASF8"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HhOl4t"&gt;The ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition is one of the few gaming laptops you’ll find that includes both an AMD processor and an AMD GPU. Not to worry — it delivers gaming performance on par with what you’ll see from laptops with Nvidia’s top GPUs. It also delivers one of the best gaming battery experiences we’ve ever seen — it was able to maintain playable frame rates on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;for over an hour with no charger attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHVLju"&gt;Speaking of battery, we averaged nine hours and 16 minutes of work use between charges, which makes the Strix G15 far and away one of the longest-lasting gaming laptops on the market. That’s doubly impressive because it’s powering a ton of flashy LEDs, including a per-key RGB keyboard and a colorful light strip around the front edge of the deck. If you’re looking for a jazzy, bold design and you’re all-in on AMD, the Strix G15 Advantage edition is the best gaming laptop for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DMtcRV"&gt;The best budget gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hCCjrZ"&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE offers a great gaming experience at a price range far below that of many competitors. You can buy it for around $1,000, and it doesn’t ask too many compromises for that price. While it only comes with a 60Hz screen, the hardware inside (especially AMD’s Ryzen 7 processor) is capable of maxing that out on all kinds of demanding games at native 1080p resolution, so you can reliably expect a playable experience from your favorite titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6ozmE"&gt;We’re also impressed by the G5’s connectivity. It includes a Mini DisplayPort, an HDMI, and an Ethernet jack — all ports you don’t see every day on laptops at this price point. Overall, if you’re looking for great value for your money, the G5 is your best bet. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade 15 is the 15-inch gaming laptop to beat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wzRw2D"&gt;A great thin and light gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="EcPuJg"&gt;The Blade 15 isn’t as powerful as its 17-inch sibling, but it may be a more pragmatic purchase for many people. If you’re looking for a balanced combination of performance and portability, the Blade 15 may hit that sweet spot. It still packs the top chips on the market and can come with a 300Hz display, but at just 4.7 pounds and 0.7 inches thick, it’s comparable in size to a number of 15-inch productivity machines like the Dell XPS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8vpQe"&gt;In addition to its reliable gaming performance, the Blade 15 works well as a productivity machine. We’re big fans of its keyboard, which is quite comfortable to use and has per-key RGB lighting, and the touchpad, which is roomy with a satisfying click. Our primary complaint is that this Blade got quite hot during our game testing — not only did the processor reach 99 degrees, but the hinge and palm rests were uncomfortable to touch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7lPrCK"&gt;The best laptop with flashy RGB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SK7elL"&gt;If you’re looking for a “traditional” premium gaming laptop with colorful, flashy panache, the ROG Strix Scar 15 is for you. The Strix’s keyboard isn’t just one of the most comfortable that we’ve ever tested on a gaming laptop; it also has some of the coolest per-key RGB lighting we’ve ever seen with all kinds of effects. There’s also a colorful light strip wrapped around the front of the deck (customizable as well) and a colorful glowing logo on the lid. In short: if you use this in public, people will notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZuwqX"&gt;Of course, the Strix is great on the inside as well, delivering some of the best frame rates you’ll find from a 15-inch laptop with Intel’s and Nvidia’s top chips. You’ll get the full benefit of their power with a 300Hz screen option as well. And the Strix comes preloaded with various programs to help customize your gaming experience. You can personalize color profiles, bandwidth allocation, and more based on the type of game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="SH9RLt"&gt;If money and desk space are no objects for you, you might be interested in the Alienware Area-51m. This hefty rig is essentially a desktop in laptop form. It pairs a desktop-class processor and a full-power mobile GPU with a 17-inch display and a full-size keyboard, delivering true desktop performance in a chassis that’s still (technically) portable. PC enthusiasts will also appreciate that you can update many of the components yourself, including the processor, RAM, and storage. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ample raises $160 million on the promise of battery swapping</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uJY_Jxu7mi0rLhYU1N7O2FVvr0w=/0x1:2400x1601/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764272/Ample_Car_lifted_and_battery_being_swapped.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ample&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ivyaMO"&gt;Battery swapping has long been a dream solution for the infrastructure problem standing in the way of wide electric vehicle adoption. Tesla famously tried but then abandoned the idea &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/9/8754667/tesla-elon-musk-battery-swap-fail"&gt;half a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;. But now a startup called Ample has raised $160 million to try to make it work — first for commercial vehicles, then maybe passenger cars and SUVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KngrIN"&gt;Given the approach Ample founders John de Souza and Khaled Hassounah are taking, they’ll need every one of those dollars, and then some. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MevwRN"&gt;The goal with Ample is to convince automakers to make versions of their electric vehicles that have a sort of adapter plate instead of a full battery pack, while everything else stays the same. Then Ample plugs a bunch of battery modules into that adapter. The modules can then be easily swapped at automated battery swap stations, allowing for a much faster “fill-up” that saves time and money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWWQKV"&gt;Ample then turns around and provides these vehicles (and the battery swap infrastructure) to fleets that want to go electric. The reduced charging time, plus less burdensome on-site infrastructure — one swap station versus a number of high-capacity chargers — are among the selling points. Uber is already &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/ample-opens-5-ev-battery-swapping-stations-for-bay-area-uber-drivers.html"&gt;using a few Ample stations in the Bay Area&lt;/a&gt; and supports a handful of vehicles like the Nissan Leaf and Kia Niro EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ITsrsp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery swapping has been tried in the US before, but no one has nailed the execution&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RtR8eV"&gt;What’s more, Ample is also going out and sourcing the cells that go in the modular packs, meaning it has to elbow its way into an extremely competitive market for batteries at a time when the world’s biggest automakers are literally throwing billions of dollars at trying to bring more battery capacity online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EPehHI"&gt;de Souza and Hassounah aren’t coming at this cold, though. They’ve been building up Ample for years now, and some of its original investors — including Moore Strategic Ventures, which is run by &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/12/peter-nygard-louis-bacon-legal-battle-bahamas#:~:text=January%202016-,The%20Billionaire%20Battle%20in%20the%20Bahamas,each%20man's%20paradise%20into%20hell"&gt;hedge fund king&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21319273/fisker-inc-karma-automotive-fundraising-public-evs-tesla-nikola"&gt;Fisker Inc. backer&lt;/a&gt; Louis Bacon, as well as Shell Ventures — are contributing to this series C funding round. Ample has brought on some new outside investors, too, like the venture arm of Singapore’s public transportation operator, as well as PTT, the major state-owned gas and oil company in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsu2Nm"&gt;And while battery swapping may still seem unfamiliar and possibly unfeasible in the US, it’s taking off in China, where startups like Nio have inspired the government there to &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/china-ev-swappable-battery-standards-approved/"&gt;basically start demanding a national standard&lt;/a&gt;. With billions of dollars headed toward charging infrastructure as part of the Biden administration’s push to clean up transportation emissions, as well as a flurry of investments and mergers happening in the electric vehicle space, there may be no better time for Ample to take its shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KSZO7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xa8THZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s start with the funding because that’s the news. It seems like you’re bringing along some people who had already invested in the company, which I would imagine made a private round something that you would want to pursue and maybe perhaps a little easier than going another route. But obviously there is a large menu of options for funding these days for companies in the electric vehicle space, the automotive space in general, etc. What made you decide to go down this route that you’re about to announce? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcFCy4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John de Souza:&lt;/strong&gt; I think the highest level of the question is do [we] want to stay private or do [we want to be] going public. I think for us at this point ... there’s a lot to get done in terms of what we want to do in terms of bringing electric vehicles to to market, and we didn’t want any distraction from that. It’s a time where we’re focused on scaling and growing, and we are fortunate in that there are a lot of investors that see that and are willing to go through and work with us on it. So we decided for now staying a private company made a lot of sense, it allows us to keep the focus on exactly what we’re going to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNQ9DQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see that there are some familiar names involved in this round. Did you find any resistance to raising this much money in the private market? Or was the conversation easy enough? Do you feel like investors are sort of more up to speed now than they have been in the last couple of years as far as some of this technology goes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntAZPx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John de Souza:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s an opportunity to raise significantly more money. I think we chose an amount together with our investors that made sense. I think, if we wanted to go and raise more there’s an opportunity to raise more in the market. So I think investors definitely see the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fo7bM1"&gt;If you look back a few years, initially it was sort of, “Will electric cars ever happen?” or, “Is it electric, is it hydrogen?” I think that game has played out where now [people] see it’s electric. The question then became: “Is electric going to happen in the next 10 years?” That has gone. And so I think right now, it’s real. People see the tremendous momentum towards it. And they look at the different problems ... there’s a bunch of people trying to solve the vehicle problem, you know, all OEMs are, but there aren’t many people that have a really good solution for the infrastructure, so I think that helped us. We have a solution that solves a problem and can be profitable. And so it was easy to go back in to find investors that saw it, understand it, and want to invest in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Aau8Bv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“this is not [investors] coming and getting the dog and pony show”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QLPo5W"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;This round is kind of led by existing investors who’ve already been supporting Ample for a while, plus external investors. So external validation [shows] more and more people can understand and see the value of what you’re creating. But for us it was a very positive thing that our existing investors really saw the business grow and get what it is, to double down, and kind of say, “Okay, we want it scaled.” For us, this was the ultimate signal that this is not [investors] coming and getting the dog and pony show, going “Oh, this is great” — they actually understand it very, very deeply, and have been there for years, and just working with us to go to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8JWsA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/from-the-ashes-of-nearly-a-billion-dollars-ample-resurrects-better-places-battery-swapping-business-model/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;somewhat long history to this idea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and I’m interested in what it feels like to try to build up this company now, when there is a much different set of circumstances like more money in the space and wider adoption of EVs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z84k82"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;I think when you’re talking about technologies fundamentally changing the way we do things, they more often than not are second and third attempts, right? So Google was not the first search engine, Tesla was not the first electric car. So to a great degree, very often it’s less about kind of coming up with an idea that is completely new and no one has ever thought through, because most likely, if no one ever thought about it, it probably has no merit, right? John has a slide which shows a car from 1944 that’s being battery swapped, so the idea of moving energy, physically, has a lot of merit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bB7J1a"&gt;I think where the innovation comes in understanding not how do you create an idea from scratch, but just the hard work of figuring out, well, how do you adjust the way you think about that idea so that it becomes viable, so that it becomes inexpensive, easy to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2LMIW"&gt;I think innovation comes more in that form. I mean we had to kind of fundamentally change one core aspect to it which is this idea of making it modular, because if you shift your mentality and say “Okay, it’s not one big bulk battery I’m going to move, I’m going to break it into smaller pieces,” a lot of things become a lot easier. But it requires a lot of innovation on the technology side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="9ppWVd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Google was not the first search engine, Tesla was not the first electric car”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="708obv"&gt;Other than that, generally it’s just a lot of thinking on how do you make this practical economically viable, easy to deploy. And that’s where a lot of the innovation came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYplf3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John de Souza: &lt;/strong&gt;There are lots people that said “let’s make the OEM standardize,” which sounds great and you’re just pushing all the work on to the OEMs. We said, well, let’s not ask them to standardize, let’s do all the work ourselves. And as Khaled mentioned, modularity helped us solve it. But we said we’ll do the heavy lifting. The solution isn’t to say well the OEM should just all standardize their solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IiO2Vv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One thing I want to ask you before we get into how things work, is that as you were raising this money, China has pushed really hard on this idea as well, and they are in some ways pursuing a sort of sweeping battery swap standard that may come to bear over there. Did that make it easier for you guys to raise money, and did that change your thinking technologically about how you might want to approach it, seeing what those companies were doing? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tf23CL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John de Souza: &lt;/strong&gt;I think in the US, we don’t look enough as to what’s happening around the world. So, I think a lot of people are surprised that there is a lot of battery swapping going on in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wei4z0"&gt;I think what is even more telling is that China has 16 times the number of fast chargers as the US — why are they doing battery swapping? And that I think is when people realize, “Hm, there must be something that’s not working with these fast chargers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQjnFp"&gt;So I think that really helped in terms of, they did invest a lot in charging, and now they’re doing this ... It’s an opportunity for us to learn from what they’ve gone through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEuvDh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;But one thing we have to be careful with is also making the assumption that we’re just taking technology from China and applying it to the West, because we have been working on this long before we even knew China was doing battery swapping. We’ve been at this for eight years. I think what China’s kind of pushing hard for it does [help], at least from a conceptual standpoint, it gets people familiar with the idea of, “even though China has built 16 times as many fast chargers as the US, they still kind of shifted, and there’s a good reason why that’s the case.” So it just makes kind of the overall argument a lot easier to sell. I think people pay a bit more attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8h1KJ"&gt;But in a way, battery swapping China-style — where the government forces every large automaker to go ahead and introduce a battery-swapping solution — doesn’t work in our environment, our market, and the way we do business and the way we do policy. So we need a different approach that can create an infrastructure that can be used by multiple automakers without them having to go and become a fully vertically integrated provider. And [in China] there’s less considerations for labor costs, and you can just staff factories with people all day long and assume that you’re going to make it economically viable because the government will subsidize you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kG0jVT"&gt;We had to kind of home grow our own way of doing things that’s different that works within our environment. But I think the fundamental idea of moving energy physically is a lot cheaper, faster, easier to scale, [and] is the core idea here and I think it’s just maybe the commonality between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIuHfr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re talking as the government here is still trying to put the final touches on a somewhat relatively big infrastructure deal, and that’s obviously a big focus of this administration. The awareness China brings to the idea of battery swapping is maybe advantageous to you. Establishing those differences between how they’re doing it and how you want to do it is important. Is there a political component to this, too? Does it help that China is working on this idea in the sense that you can say, “Hey, we need this too?” knowing how the reflection of what they’re doing versus what we’re doing is important to the policymakers in this country?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ykGIX7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have to do things because they make sense, not because China’s doing them”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Iu01fu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;It does, I just don’t want to overemphasize that. We have to do things because they make sense, not because China’s doing them, because otherwise you end up with the wrong policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MIW2N"&gt;So, in a way we just have to think practically on how we get there, and we’d much rather kind of focus on that and say, “Listen, China China China” ... and then that’s how you split people because you’re not making a solid, reasonable argument that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2GWKVP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the technological side, you’ve both talked a little bit about this idea of keeping things modular trying to make it work for the OEMs. Can you walk me through a little bit more detail about what goes into that approach and why an OEM would want to embrace this idea?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ff1WqD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John de Souza: &lt;/strong&gt;Our approach with the OEMs is to give them an easy way to embrace this technology, and we said, we don’t want them to change the car, we don’t want them to have to change what they do. So the way we work with them is they continue to offer their fixed-battery [vehicles]. But for the solutions where swapping makes sense, they can offer this as an alternative without requiring them to go through and change the vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaHHNy"&gt;So it allows them from a business perspective to say, for the people that can use charging, the people who charge overnight at home, or whatever the situation is, we’ll continue to offer a solution. But for all these other [customers] where infrastructure is the limiting factor, here’s a partnership we have that allows us very easily to go through and solve both — allow them to move to electric and solve the infrastructure at the same time. We don’t view OEMs as our customers. Fleets are our customers and we partner with the OEMs to deliver a complete solution of infrastructure and vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eioqJr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building one battery pack that’s tightly integrated into the car can allow automakers to get the best optimization; they run the software that controls the pack, integrate it physically in the layout, knowing every centimeter matters when we’re talking about energy density. But say they embrace this idea and they want to serve some fleet customers with this modular battery pack idea. What are some of the tradeoffs they have to make in this sort of end product of this car that is powered by your modular pack, knowing that it’s got to be more difficult to reach the same kinds of vertical integration optimizations they can get from doing it themselves?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Rznok"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;So that’s not what we’re going to do. We’re not going to the OEMs and giving them a battery and saying “even though you optimized this other battery to have the right shape, to have the right software interface etc, you should do something else.” We’re actually doing the opposite, which is we build our technology in a way where we adapt to how they decide to build the car — and that’s true for all ten car models we integrate with. We’re actually already working on two, hopefully soon three, more car models as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="L1Fyr1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“they still build the car the same way.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SdmAt9"&gt;At the end of the day when you build an electric car you build a vehicle, and you build a battery. The battery has a certain envelope it can work within, and certain attachment points at which you attach to the chassis to provide the structural rigidity needed. And then you have a simple electrical and software interface. It’s really very basic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o02lzW"&gt;So we build what we call an adapter plate — it’s a bit more than that, this is a disservice — but we build kind of a structure that is identical to [the automaker’s] battery. It has the same software interface, has an electrical interface, attaches at exactly the same point, and provides the same level of security that you expect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N44BdM"&gt;Once that’s installed in the car, we can swap the modules out of it... we can always get to within 10 percent — sometimes 10 percent lower, sometimes 10 percent higher — in capacity, but our interface with the vehicle is exactly the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JognF3"&gt;If you look at traditional battery swapping, typically you went to the OEM and say we need you to build a different car, or modify the chassis of an existing car so that the battery can be taken in and out. In this case, no. We’re saying there’s a fixed device that stays in the car, it works exactly the same way, but it gives us an interface on the other end to take batteries in and out. We’ve standardized the batteries without forcing the OEMs to standardize the [pack], because they still build the car the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7NvEG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But there is a capacity tradeoff at some level, you said 10 percent?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOXfyW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;I mean sometimes we’re actually 10 percent higher. It depends. We’re not smarter engineers, we don’t want to claim we’re better than OEMs that are doing this. We’re better than some of them, but we’re not going to tell you whom. [&lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMppEN"&gt;We can figure out how to fit the maximum chemistry in the volume available, how to make sure it lives long, and how to monitor it. A lot of the innovation now is the chemistry. Really the LGs, Panasonics, CATLs of the world are the ones that are doing most of the innovations to get more energy into the form factor. The pack war was won five years ago when everybody became the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UW622p"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5hcCbg1Nf-c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MZIAQL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You talk about putting in all that work of designing the modular version of their battery pack — are you also turning around and sourcing the same kinds of materials, the same cells, or is the OEM going out and sourcing them, then providing them to you so you can fit them into these battery packs you have ready to swap? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KerKtl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John de Souza: &lt;/strong&gt;We are providing them with the complete battery pack. Think of everything that goes into building the battery pack, so we source the cells, we source everything to build it, and we deliver a fully made battery pack to the OEM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jU1NT5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;One thing we typically don’t talk about because people are not interested in it, but it’s really very impactful, is that part of our innovation is this idea of abstracting the car from the chemistry. We use power electronics inside our modules that are inexpensive enough — that’s a lot of the innovation, how to make it inexpensive enough that it doesn’t impact the overall cost of the battery, but it allows us to abstract the car from the chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXE4n4"&gt;What that means... the first need was, how do you make one chemistry work with different cars. But then the flip advantage of that is how do you make one car work with multiple chemistries. So we’re able to kind of put different chemistries, even different state of health and state of charge and internal resistance, etc., in the same car, at the same time. In effect what that means is that over time, as you buy your car, we can keep introducing better chemistries that work with the existing vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FooiQX"&gt;So, in a way, we’re solving the problem for the OEM because right now they have to design the car around a specific chemistry and get stuck with it. And even if everybody thinks they have the best chemistry — that’s impossible. Even if someone else invents a better chemistry, the transition takes five to seven years and that’s what we’re seeing. So in a way, we’re making it more into like a three- to five-month process where if there’s a chemistry that is cheaper and safer, we just put it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdHVQx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does that in turn create any more work for the OEMs on maybe the software side of having to account for what chemistries go into the battery?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udL6YF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;That’s the beauty, it’s fully abstracted from them. So we do that on our end. We’re able to introduce to, to present the newer chemistry, even if it’s a voltage range, [it will be delivered] at the same voltage connecting into the vehicle. And that kind of simplification is what they should be easy for them because even for different chemistry we just adjust it and plug it in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2I1BP"&gt;We haven’t had to make a single line of software modification to any of the cars we integrated with even though we put varying chemistry in it in and a varying number of modules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o08s0J"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you handle crash testing and safety implications of all of this, is that something that you guys are actually going and proving out, to make sure cars that use these modular battery packs are at the same standard of the sort of typical version?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVHzGe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John de Souza: &lt;/strong&gt;The good news is that you have standards that you have to go through and certifications that you have to do to demonstrate that [these batteries] are safe enough to go into the cars. So we have to do the same tests as anybody else putting batteries in cars. You go through, perform the tests, make sure you pass all those tests. In addition, as you work with every OEM, they may have additional tests that they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="iciZ4Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“there’s what we convince ourselves is true, and what reality is”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1NU8LV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The last thing I want to ask you about is the fleet side of this, the people who you’re saying are going to be your sort of initial customers. One of the things we hear all the time is that fleets (and the commercial space in general) makes the most sense for early adoption of electric vehicles because the way that they operate is very standardized and very easy to predict, and that sort of lessens the burden of charging. What’s your pitch to fleet customers to win them over to your approach versus installing five Level 2 chargers or a couple DC fast chargers and going that way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zv2u3n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m just gonna say one thing and then John you should comment on this. I’ll just say there’s what we convince ourselves is true, and what reality is. So let’s just start with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lJfdR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John de Souza: &lt;/strong&gt;I would say our best customers right now are people who’ve tried [battery swapping], because there’s a theoretical concept that people have, and they can convince themselves that charging will work, you will get everything lined up, people will show up to the depots and sync and you’ll get 95 percent utilization. And then they deploy the first 50 chargers and that’s usually when they’re about ready to cancel their EV program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUV5Y8"&gt;[There’s also] the shock of installing chargers. You expect it’s going to be $3-$5,000. But then, one [customer] was saying, in the end you have landscaping, all this stuff that you’re digging up. And if people are going to be [charging] a while they may need to be ADA compliant. You could be spending $3,000 plus per charger. So the cost is much higher than you think it’s going to be. So you get these installed, then you have to upgrade power, because the problem with chargers is that when everybody comes in and turns it on, you have this huge peak, so you need to upgrade and it costs a lot of money. And people are coming up with smart software, which is how do you drip [electricity] to different people.. which basically doesn’t work that well. And then the operational complexity is tremendous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iG6wq0"&gt;So for us, our pitch is very simple. Do what you do right now. Switch over to electric, it will operationally stay the same, and we’ll charge you less than gas per mile, and we’ll take care of all the infrastructure. And that they understand. It’s very simple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOmNE0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of some of those considerations, what is your approach for the end of life of these batteries? Do you have a certain threshold that they have to hit before you pull them out of the system. What’s the process after that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVx3lQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s very straightforward. The batteries have a certain life cycle, it’s more or less predictable if you optimally charge them, they hit X number of cycles, and their capacity goes below [Y]. Being able to take them out is very straightforward because they’re literally being taken out every time you get energy into the into the vehicle so as they go out we take them out, they’re built in a way where we can immediately use them in second life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oK6f9w"&gt;Now one of the huge advantages is because we actively control how they’re charged, we really can get the maximum cycles out of them. If you have a battery that lasts 1000 cycles, versus one that you fast charge and can only do 700 cycles, the 1,000 cycle battery is 50 percent less expensive than the 700 cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTnmha"&gt;But one other thing is that when batteries are not being used, they do lose capacity so when you put a battery in a Tesla and you just park it for eight years, it is going to lose capacity. So there is kind of a time component. What we’re doing by moving batteries across vehicles is that we do get the maximum utilization out of every battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tqGbkQ"&gt;So over time that will lower the costs for everyone, but also increase the utilization of it before we have to go and completely recycle the batteries. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple debuts new trailer for The Morning Show’s second season ahead of September premiere</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5xxWYmCCT1UF6H19z7PA32qUMX8=/54x0:639x390/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764132/082321_Apple_The_Morning_Show_Trailer_Big_Image_01_big_image_post.jpg.medium.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ghQgHq"&gt;Apple has shared &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qZWPTsR-Wc"&gt;a new trailer for the second season of &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of its premier series for Apple TV Plus. The new 10-episode season debuts on September 17th, with new episodes hitting every Friday after. The show once again has an all-star cast, headed up by Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXTNtN"&gt;Here’s Apple’s summary for the new season:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="FWagLm"&gt;Picking up after the explosive events of season one, season two finds “The Morning Show” team emerging from the wreckage of Alex (Aniston) and Bradley’s (Witherspoon) actions, to a new UBA and a world in flux, where identity is everything and the chasm between who we present as and who we really are comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X20sDO"&gt;Steve Carell also returns, and there are a number of new actors in the second season. One is Hasan Minhaj, who plays a new member of the eponymous “The Morning Show.” (&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reported on Minhaj joining the cast &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564529/hasan-minhaj-the-morning-show-apple-tv-plus"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt; following the cancellation of his &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/patriot-act-with-hasan-minhaj-canceled-at-netflix-4047572/"&gt;Netflix comedy / news talk show&lt;/a&gt;.) Will Arnett also makes a surprise appearance in the trailer — his casting wasn’t previously known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NdzczH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Morning Show explores abuses of power, but not really","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942618/the-morning-show-apple-tv-plus-review-jennifer-anniston-reese-witherspoon"},{"title":"Hasan Minhaj joins The Morning Show following Netflix’s cancellation of Patriot Act","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564529/hasan-minhaj-the-morning-show-apple-tv-plus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FEwwlK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says it has pay equity, but an informal employee survey suggests otherwise</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FSFK27wYEtHQCq6saovGyjrJ9qI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764124/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KXgRUx"&gt;An early analysis of the informal Apple pay equity survey shows a six percent wage gap between the salaries of men and women, according to software engineer Cher Scarlett. It’s similar to the gender wage gap in San Francisco, &lt;a href="https://hired.com/h/wage-inequality-report/2021/"&gt;which hovers around five percent&lt;/a&gt;, but disappointing for a company that claims people of all genders “earn the same when engaging in similar work with comparable experience and performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgWsrH"&gt;The results are not scientific — employees opted into the survey and only 2,000 people responded (out of the &lt;a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/_10-K-2020-(As-Filed).pdf"&gt;147,000 employees&lt;/a&gt; Apple estimated in 2020)  — but they point to why some employees are suspicious of the company’s claim that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12371204/apple-diversity-report-pay-gap-hiring-equal-pay"&gt;it fixed its pay equity problem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOHxCk"&gt;“We know pay equity was a problem in the past and Apple did something to fix it, but we’re having this conversation again because we’re seeing gaps in certain areas of the company and we want to know what Apple will do to prevent it from happening year-over-year,” Scarlett says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWuHQm"&gt;A small group of Apple employees, including Scarlett and members of the data analysis organization, will present the results to Apple’s people team this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVXR64"&gt;Scarlett also says she found that there were far fewer women, non-binary, and non-white people in senior positions at the company — or in technical roles, which are typically among the highest paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bdfPUh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Honestly, without seeing the data team analyze the salaries, the most disturbing thing I noticed about this data is  the disparity between the gender demographics between white and non-white respondents. Out of nearly 2,000 people... it's alarming. &lt;a href="https://t.co/idvfVhQDD3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/idvfVhQDD3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cher Scarlett (@cherthedev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1426434491069861895?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nfoiAx"&gt;“These charts suggest that white men have much more opportunities to advance within the company, and are more likely to be working in technical roles than less represented demographics,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1426664223053008896"&gt;she wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwQIhH"&gt;Scarlett knows the survey isn’t conclusive. “We’re not trying to draw definitive conclusions, we’re trying to get some insight because we’ve had none,” she explains. “What we actually want is for Apple to do a third-party investigation into salary data, or an audit that we have insight into.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fq1Uf1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was granted access to the survey data, which offers evidence of a salary gap among the respondents. We analyzed the survey data by isolating the approximately 1,400 technical roles, then grouping them by job level, gender, and race&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;We then found the median salaries for the job level as a whole, as well as the race and gender breakdowns within that job level. We went with the median value to smooth out any skewing that could come from outliers (which can easily crop up in user-provided data). The approach did not take into account things like college degrees or years of experience. We chose not to look at the non-technical respondents, as there were only around 520. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BNxksb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re trying to get some insight because we’ve had none”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NBIA0M"&gt;Scarlett pushed back on the idea that there weren’t enough non-technical responses to merit analysis, noting that it might be harder for those employees to find out about the survey in the first place. “It’s easy to fall into the idea that the sample size is small so it should be set aside,” she says. “But the fact is I don’t work in retail and the places where I post mostly go to people in the software organization. So retail and support responses come in organically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hwz51J"&gt;Among the survey respondents in the data given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the median pay for men in mid-level technical roles was 6.25 percent higher than the median pay of women, while the median pay for white employees in mid-level technical roles was 5.06 percent higher than that of non-white employees. This sample was 944 white men out of 1,408 total respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHg50D"&gt;The median number of stock grants (restricted stock units) for non-white workers in entry-level and mid-level technical roles was roughly 11 percent lower than the median number of RSUs for white workers among survey respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRmIgu"&gt;Higher levels of the engineering organization show a partial reversal in this trend. The median pay for women in principal engineering roles is 1.2 percent higher than the median pay of men among survey respondents — but Scarlett is wary of the results. “Men in those high roles are less likely to respond to the survey because they’re the highest paid in the company, outside of leadership,” she says. There were far fewer respondents in this category than for mid-level technical roles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LbZifW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The median pay for men in mid-level technical roles was 6.25 percent higher than the median pay of women&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="37Qfl8"&gt;Scarlett started the survey after Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;shut down previous attempts for employees to gather pay data&lt;/a&gt;. “I don’t think anyone is going into this saying there for sure is a wage gap, whether that’s gender or race or disability,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a previous interview. “But it is concerning to everyone that every single time someone tries to create more transparency, Apple shuts it down.” The company reportedly told employees that the previous surveys contained personally identifiable information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LoZjGr"&gt;One Apple employee who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; said an Apple director discouraged employees from taking the survey during an all-hands meeting last week. “A lot of us had the same thought that what he was saying was not great, it felt antiquated,” the source said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iY72dN"&gt;In 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/27/technology/apple-shareholders-show-their-support-for-tim-cook.html"&gt;Tim Cook told shareholders&lt;/a&gt; that women at Apple made 99.6 cents on the dollar compared to men, and underrepresented minorities made 99.7 cents on the dollar compared to white employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpzfV5"&gt;The company later said it fixed the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWPMl0"&gt;In response to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Apple spokesperson Rachel Tulley sent the company’s already public statement on pay equity: “Apple has a firm and long‑standing commitment to pay equity. Globally, employees of all genders earn the same when engaging in similar work with comparable experience and performance. In the United States, the same is true for employees of all races and ethnicities. We don’t ask for salary history during the recruiting process. Our recruiters base offers on Apple employees in similar roles. And every year, we examine the compensation employees receive and ensure that we maintain pay equity.”&lt;/p&gt;
