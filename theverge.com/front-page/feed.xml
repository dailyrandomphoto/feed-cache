    <title>Tesla’s co-founder is teaming up with Specialized to solve the problem of e-bike batteries</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ydsas2"&gt;The growing popularity of electric bikes has raised a lot of exciting possibilities about the future of transportation, but it also presents a number of unique challenges. Chief among them is what to do with all those e-bike batteries when they eventually run out of juice. Rather than send them to a landfill, one major bike manufacturer is teaming up with a co-founder of Tesla to ensure those batteries have a second life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNWVvZ"&gt;Specialized, the third largest bike maker in the US based on market share, is partnering with a firm called Redwood Materials, which is run by Jeffrey “JB” Straubel, a co-founder and former chief technology officer of Tesla, to figure out a process for recycling the company’s e-bike batteries. Those batteries, which are typically attached to or integrated within the downtube of the bike, activate the motor when the cyclist is pedaling or uses a throttle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgIMzF"&gt;The bikes are built to last a lifetime, but the batteries typically run out of power after four and six years, said Chris Yu, chief product officer at Specialized. “Generally, the bikes will long outlast the packs for the typical user,” Yu told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And so it’s always been in the back of our minds: what do we do about them?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XF8svm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The bikes will long outlast the packs for the typical user”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ONSYl"&gt;Enter Redwood Materials. The Carson City, Nevada-based company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/2/15516632/tesla-startup-redwood-materials-recycling"&gt;founded by Straubel in 2017&lt;/a&gt; primarily as a recycler of electric car batteries. In addition to breaking down scrap from Tesla’s battery-making process with Panasonic, Redwood also recycles batteries from Nissan, Amazon, and others. Many of the batteries from those first-wave electric vehicles, like the Nissan Leaf, are just now reaching their end of life and are in need of recycling. Redwood promises that all of its recycling is done domestically — much of the e-waste in the US is shipped to developing countries for smelting — and with an eye toward reuse and recovery. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-race-to-crack-battery-recycling-before-its-too-late/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;referred&lt;/a&gt; to the company as the “anti-gigafactory.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qo_t4Hm1xGqioGxt-duzYlOQFpQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22379764/Specialized_Creo_1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A battery being removed from a Specialized electric bike.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ALcIRd"&gt;This is how the partnership will work: Specialized will recover depleted e-bike batteries through its network of retail partners and then ship those batteries to Redwood’s facility in Northern Nevada. The first step will be to figure out how much of the battery is reusable, such as various connectors, wires, plastics, and other components. After that, Redwood will begin a chemical recycling process, in which it strips out and refines the relevant elements like nickel, cobalt, and copper. A certain percentage of that refined material can then be reintegrated into the battery-making process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AxXanY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We strive to really minimize any separate waste streams”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oMwR9u"&gt;“Usually, there’s not very much else in there that’s very recyclable,” Straubel told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “But we strive to really minimize any separate waste streams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2Iaaa"&gt;Specialized says that by the end of 2021, every one of its e-bike batteries will “have a pathway” to Redwood’s recycling facility. Yu explained that means making customers aware through their local Specialized retailer or via diagnostic notifications through the company’s smartphone app about the expected end-of-life date of their e-bike’s battery and what recycling opportunities are available to them. The company has been piloting this process, and so far, 100 percent of the battery packs it collects are going to Redwood. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xekAg5"&gt;With e-bike sales booming, there is expected to be a tsunami of dead batteries needing to be recycled in the decades to come — perhaps more so than from electric cars. More &lt;a href="https://www.oicompass.com/market-statistics/ziv-publishes-data-on-german-bicycle-market-2020/87815.article"&gt;electric bikes were sold&lt;/a&gt; in Germany in 2020 than all of the electric cars sold in Europe. Over 547,000 e-bikes were sold in the Netherlands last year, or 54 percent more than the total number of cars, both gas and electric. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21016306/electric-bike-ebike-sales-us-numbers-deloitte-cars"&gt;According to Deloitte&lt;/a&gt;, 130 million e-bikes are expected to be sold globally between 2020 and 2023, making them the most popular battery-powered vehicle on the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjiL5v"&gt;These data points — a faster product life and higher volume of sales — helped convince Straubel to team up with Specialized on this project. He also was friends with Specialized’s founder and CEO, Mike Sinyard, and helped set him up with a Tesla many years ago. But e-bikes, in addition to other lightweight electric vehicles like scooters and mopeds, are a sign of where things are headed for transportation. Straubel said he was surprised by how much of the e-waste that is processed for recycling is comprised of materials from e-bikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qq3gSZ"&gt;“It’s kind of a bellwether, I think, for passenger EVs,” he said&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; “and that’s been a really fascinating thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fzFKc-WRWQfp9pDLa6bc4kg1RbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22379969/RedwoodMaterials_6877.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;A bin of e-waste at Redwood Materials’ recycling facility. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T0yCCG"&gt;E-waste recycling is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20992240/e-waste-recycling-electronic-basel-convention-crime-total-reclaim-fraud"&gt;notoriously shady business&lt;/a&gt;, with companies sending raw materials overseas to developing nations that lack the infrastructure for safe processing. This has caused &lt;a href="https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2018/08/27/growing-e-waste-problem/"&gt;a growing ecological disaster&lt;/a&gt;. Straubel insists Redwood is different because it does all of its recycling domestically, not just the separation and aggregation processes. And he aims for maximum transparency, inviting all of his clients to come to the facility and inspect every inch of the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8ZLfd"&gt;The gears are shifting in Washington in a way that could have a broad effect on what Specialized and Redwood are hoping to accomplish. A bill was just introduced in the House of Representatives that would &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/03/19/new-us-bill-grants-recycle-batteries/"&gt;incentivize the recycling of lithium-ion batteries&lt;/a&gt;, which are widely used by both electric cars and e-bikes. Another bill would offer a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22295115/ebike-tax-credit-congress-bill-blumenauer"&gt;tax credit for anyone who purchases an e-bike&lt;/a&gt;. Public tax dollars are flowing into the industry in a way that could underscore the importance of Specialized and Redwood’s partnership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7IvEa"&gt;“We’ve been working on this for a while. So it was a way to really get in front of it,” Specialized CEO Mike Sinyard told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “People who buy an electric car, but even more, people who buy an electric bike really care about that. And we care deeply about that too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lt2I5Q"&gt;Straubel agrees, saying it’s a question that’s on the minds of the people who buy these products: what will happen to it when it eventually runs out of power? “They want to make sure that the solution isn’t worse than the problem,” he said. “But to me, this is a story of optimism because these batteries are very highly recyclable, with the right process and method for doing it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Fire TV is adding local news in many more cities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QA5U5p09Vv1QUaG0OiJvn8cnzUk=/0x15:831x569/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68987359/FireTV.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0RC2Xu"&gt;Back in December, Amazon launched an ad-sponsored news app on its Fire TV platform.  At that time, the app offered local news coverage in 12 cities, including New York, San Francisco, Dallas, Miami, and more. But today, Amazon says it’s expanding local news to “88 major cities” across the US, “including popular local stations from news distributors such as ABC Owned Television Stations, CBSN, TEGNA, Cox, The E.W. Scripps Company, and Altice USA.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGh3FV"&gt;The news app now comes built into the Fire TV software, and local news gets its own tab in the app. “Amazon’s thoughtful expansion of local news content on its Fire TV devices is a strong testament to the power of local news to keep communities safe and informed through everything 2020 has brought us, and everything ahead in 2021,” Brian Lawlor, Scripps’ president of local media, said in today’s press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjJ5oM"&gt;Local news is certainly crucial, but the news app also serves as an easy way to bring in extra advertising dollars. Amazon lets you customize the app to some extent to show your preferred news sources: “When you open the app for the first time, you can select the news that matters most to you from national and local sources. A custom playlist will be generated based on your selections.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAKDZ4"&gt;At its launch in December, the Fire TV news app already had ABC News Live, CBS News, Reuters, Cheddar, Entertainment Weekly, Black News Channel, and others on board for national news — but expanding local coverage to so many new locations should make the app feel a little fuller and more useful. You can also quickly access local news with an “Alexa, play local news” voice command on the Fire TV remote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYw0wX"&gt;Roku has also &lt;a href="https://blog.roku.com/free-news-channels-roku"&gt;made live news part of&lt;/a&gt; The Roku Channel, so both leading streaming hardware companies seem to think it’s an important add. The full list of cities where Amazon Fire TV now offers local news includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Ogt1Og"&gt;Atlanta, GA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0N16La"&gt;Austin, TX&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7CRfvv"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724867471427496922#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VegeDailyDeals03182021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $75 right now. While this is not its lowest price ever (the previous best price was only $5 less), it is still an incredible deal on the normally $130 smart display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;The Echo Show 8 includes a slightly larger display than the Echo Show 5 and also includes support for videoconferencing apps, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="nDC3T7"&gt;If you’re looking for a good virtual reality headset but are intimidated by the $300 price tag for the relatively affordable Oculus Quest 2, you’re in luck. Over on Oculus’ official website, the company is selling &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a refurbished first-generation Quest for $199&lt;/a&gt;. This “As Good as New” VR headset includes a full one-year warranty. Like its successor, the Quest is a standalone head-mounted display, which allows you to play VR games without additional hardware. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You will watch the Snyder Cut in 4:3 aspect ratio because HBO Max respects cinema</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nnbEPeTGQFT9_zzccR8pcA6E0_s=/228x0:2943x1810/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986833/snyderwarning.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7MYsyZ"&gt;Lest anyone worry that &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=SnyderCut031821"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; would tarnish Zack Snyder’s auteur work &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;, for which the company &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/02/the-true-story-of-justice-league-snyder-cut"&gt;spent $70 million&lt;/a&gt; on reshoots and new digital effects in order to meet the director’s requirements and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22334362/zack-snyder-justice-league-fandom-release-cut-star-wars-twitter"&gt;satisfy years of fan demand&lt;/a&gt; for a better cut of the widely panned movie, the service is prefacing all streams of the film with a short disclosure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="815KjL"&gt;“This film is presented in a 4:3 format to preserve the integrity of Zack Snyder’s creative vision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9DaXXJ"&gt;That’s right. HBO will not artificially crop the image just to satisfy your natural demand for widescreen viewing. Nor would it tell Snyder that, hey, &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/03/zack-snyder-explains-justice-leagues-first-cow-connection.html"&gt;maybe &lt;em&gt;Justice League &lt;/em&gt;isn’t &lt;em&gt;First Cow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and doesn’t need to be presented in a tight boxy format in which it’s unclear if the entire film was even originally intended to be presented. After three years of demands, this is &lt;em&gt;his &lt;/em&gt;vision, and no one’s going to touch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9764pm"&gt;Now look, I’m not going to make fun of directors choosing less common aspect ratios (I contend that &lt;em&gt;First Cow&lt;/em&gt;, a quiet movie about a cow, which was also shot in 4:3,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was robbed of its place on the Best Picture nominees list). But this does mean that HBO Max’s highest-profile film — one that was announced before the streaming service was even available, is exclusive to the service, and is very much meant to bring in new subscribers — is presented in the aspect ratio of a ’90s TV series and leaves about half the screen empty on most modern devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b389vv"&gt;It was known before the movie’s debut this morning that the Snyder cut would be presented in 4:3. So it’s really only HBO’s warning — likely meant as a heads-up to less obsessive fans who may be confused by the crop — that’s a surprise here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxlMuu"&gt;The film was &lt;a href="https://decider.com/2021/03/18/snyder-cut-justice-league-black-boxes-aspect-ratio/"&gt;supposedly shot for&lt;/a&gt; this boxy format, and if that’s the case, then you’re actually seeing &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;on the screen than you did in the 2017 version (which was released in a more traditional widescreen format... and was also two hours shorter). The intention was for the taller footage to be shown on giant IMAX screens, which are close to a 4:3 ratio, though typically only portions of a movie are presented in the larger format. For now, your best bet at watching the film on a device intended for that screen size is to go with something a bit smaller:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to file and pay your 2020 taxes online </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="irs (ray tsang flickr)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TP0xxiL-v-HhVA274y3XwS_qa2o=/0x3:1100x736/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68687934/irs.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QSUmXj"&gt;In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic took everyone, including the IRS, by surprise. Because of the issues people were dealing with last spring, the filing deadline for federal tax payments was moved from the usual mid-April date to July 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NH5z8m"&gt;This year, it looked look like we weren’t going to get the same tax vacation — until &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-day-for-individuals-extended-to-may-17-treasury-irs-extend-filing-and-payment-deadline"&gt;the IRS announced on March 17th&lt;/a&gt; that tax day has been pushed back a month. As a result, the new due date for your 2020 taxes is May 17th, 2021.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1IHJ6"&gt;Meanwhile, the IRS has also made it known that the &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-operations-during-covid-19-mission-critical-functions-continue"&gt;pandemic is slowing down some operations&lt;/a&gt;, such as processing returns filed on paper. As a result, it might not be a bad idea to start working on those taxes as soon as possible — and to submit them online. In fact, whether you’re a full-time worker dealing with a single 1040 or a freelancer / gig worker getting a series of 1099s, the fastest way to pay the piper these days is to do it online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="7RmRXX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10286635"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DtewJZ"&gt;The IRS offers a series of directions &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt; to help US citizens figure out their taxes, report those taxes, and send in payments (or ask for refunds) using its e-file online method. Here’s a rundown of what’s available and where you can find it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your first stop: IRS.gov" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tZP6jZ2r6bfb_vXfNAlliRrrC5o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22238649/Screen_Shot_2021_01_15_at_2.52.29_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your first stop: IRS.gov.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MrTZxI"&gt;How do I file online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Wfouu8"&gt;There are several ways to file online, depending on your income and your comfort level in dealing with the whole income tax process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAGjYo"&gt;If your &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/definition-of-adjusted-gross-income"&gt;adjusted gross income&lt;/a&gt; was $72,000 or under, you can use the &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free"&gt;IRS Free File option&lt;/a&gt;. The site offers a number of third-party services that can help you put together and file your taxes free of charge. Of course, that is assuming the third party doesn’t try to scam you into paying more than you have to; back in April of 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-deliberately-hides-its-free-file-page-from-search-engines"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; revealed&lt;/a&gt; that TurboTax and other suppliers were deliberately hiding the pages for their free services in order to convince taxpayers to purchase additional features. As a result, in early 2020, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/1/21045779/irs-turbotax-free-file-h-r-block-tax-preparation-new-rules"&gt;IRS published rules&lt;/a&gt; prohibiting these practices. Still, it pays to be careful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Free File is available for those whose income is $72,000 or under" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6xv0usaE6z1RIzq_Gln4pzREg58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22238669/Screen_Shot_2021_01_15_at_2.58.08_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free File is available for those whose income is $72,000 or under.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fC7FEJ"&gt;If your income is above $72,000, you can still use fillable forms provided by IRS Free File, but you don’t get the support of the free software, and you can’t do your state taxes through this method. The forms will be available starting on January 25th. (If you’re really into doing your own taxes, you may want to check out the &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-tax-tips"&gt;IRS page on tax tips&lt;/a&gt;, which includes how to handle things like a &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit"&gt;recovery rebate credit&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlnklN"&gt;If you’re not a pro at filling out taxes, you’re going to either have to use e-file with one of the available software solutions or find a tax preparer who can do it for you. In the case of the latter, the person or company who does your taxes needs to be authorized to use e-file; if you don’t already have a tax professional, you can find one at &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/authorized-irs-e-file-provider-locator-service-for-tax-professionals"&gt;the IRS site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5JFGLd"&gt;How do I pay online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qQd1r5"&gt;The IRS lists a variety of ways you can &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/payments"&gt;pay your taxes online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmMzlE"&gt;If you use tax preparation software or have your taxes prepared by a tax professional, you can have the IRS pull the funds directly from your bank account via Electronic Funds Withdrawal at the same time you file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwT6HE"&gt;You can also use IRS Direct Pay to pull funds from a savings or checking account. Finally, you can use a credit or debit card; however, there is usually a fee involved (since the IRS isn’t going to absorb what your credit card company is charging for the service).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ugxyPN"&gt;How do I get my refund?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="o8jn9l"&gt;One of the ways the IRS tries to convince you to file online is to assure you that you will get your refund faster — &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/refunds/tax-season-refund-frequently-asked-questions"&gt;in less than 21 days&lt;/a&gt;, in most cases. Once you’ve filed, you can &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/refunds"&gt;check the status&lt;/a&gt; of your refund online. You can also &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs2goapp"&gt;download the official IRS2GoApp&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to check the status of your refund, pay your taxes, and get other information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfTl5K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 18th, 2021, 9:45AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on January 19th, 2021 and has been updated to add information about the new tax deadline and the COVID relief bill.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fear and self-loathing in Animal Crossing: New Horizons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZWpWIYA6UAqBUQHZezM5lwFagmY=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986658/2021031616035800_02CB906EA538A35643C1E1484C4B947D.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to believe that such a pure, wholesome game could become an object of dread&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1p0vkj"&gt;“Where have you been all this time?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqooXP"&gt;A wave of guilt washed over me as I read these words on the screen. Considering how 2020 dismantled our reality and created a new set of post-coronavirus social paradigms, the last thing I wanted was to explain myself to someone I thought would understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AIU7g"&gt;My accuser wasn’t a real friend, exactly. It was dear, sweet Merengue, one of my favorite villagers on Beef House, my &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; island. “I dropped by your place to look for you, but you were never home,” she said, eyes downcast. If this had happened in real life, with a real friend, I would have started digging a hole of shame. Next, I bumped into Moe, another island favorite. “Man! Where have you been? You can’t just disappear without saying anything,” he said, bursting into tears. “I MISSED YOU SO MUCH!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LN13P1"&gt;After four months of neglecting my pumpkin patches and flowerbeds, after missing seasonal events, birthdays, bugs, fish, turnips, shooting stars, and crafting specials — I’d finally ripped off the Band-Aid and returned to &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;. And just as I’d expected, it felt really bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_ifL-5UI52k5qnkKhUW7EK2WVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22379687/2021031615581200_02CB906EA538A35643C1E1484C4B947D.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bD4iPg"&gt;On March 17th, 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21179238/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch-features"&gt;Nintendo’s much-anticipated life sim was released&lt;/a&gt; — a welcome daily escape during a time of stress and isolation. But reflecting on the game a year on, despite its wholesome premise and idyllic island setting, even &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; couldn’t avoid becoming an odd casualty in the wake of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tY4tv3"&gt;Since last November, my Switch has mostly sat next to my bed, untouched. There are other games on it, of course, but I think of it as an &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; machine, especially after all the hours I sank into Beef House last year. It was a mainline to so many things I couldn’t do in real life, like hanging out with friends and “traveling” (albeit to other virtual islands). I followed &lt;em&gt;ACNH&lt;/em&gt; community projects, played the stalk market with turnips, and went to in-game swap meets as the world struggled through various degrees of quarantine or lockdown. It’s supposed to be a real-time experience to be played at your own pace — on the commute to work or between chores — but the pandemic drastically changed the way people approached the game. It became a &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/11/21363470/animal-crossing-new-horizons-binging-slowdown-played-speed"&gt;bingeable distraction&lt;/a&gt;, especially with in-game time travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kn1pZZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I am ashamed of facing them.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y9sDZa"&gt;And so, after pouring hundreds of hours into Beef House, I needed a break. I’d re-terraformed, bought every upgrade, and amassed a dragon’s hoard of bells. The first couple of weeks that I forgot to log in and buy turnips felt like weird faux-financial FOMO, but the feeling quickly passed. But after a couple of months dropping off the &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; radar, I realized that I wasn’t alone in feeling guilty about leaving. There were others who also felt a curious anxiety about ghosting the game that had gotten them through the start of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6DUCp"&gt;This particular form of anxiety isn’t even about avoiding the weeds and cockroaches that appear after a prolonged absence. “It’s a deep psychological fear,” says musician and game developer Mabel Harper, who hasn’t played &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; for at least nine months. “Intellectually, I know I’m not disappointing my &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; friends… but I feel like I’ve left them high and dry, and I am ashamed of facing them.” Harper did go back once last summer for a virtual Tinder date but hasn’t touched it since. “The way the people in the older games would just kinda shame you about not constantly being there has put the fear of god in me,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxQOO0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/being-ghosted-during-pandemic"&gt;Ghosting&lt;/a&gt; has become a much more common practice simply because we’ve become &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/angry-nerd-online-dating-pandemic-ghosting/"&gt;so unmoored&lt;/a&gt; from normal social practices. This doesn’t just apply to dating — it’s happening at &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/16/coronavirus-stress-ghosting-employer/"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a32320157/social-isolation-ghosting-friends/"&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt;, and even family. I’d tried ghosting a friend in the years before perma-online living and Facebook only to have her turn up at my doorstep, ready for an explanation: &lt;em&gt;What is going on? Where have you been?&lt;/em&gt; But with so many of our connections being mediated by apps and screens, why wouldn’t this phenomenon of ghost-guilt also extend to game characters, especially ones deliberately designed to do just that? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pk7AHK"&gt;Copywriter Ili Nadirah felt so bad about neglecting her island that she reset the game and made a new one. She believes her guilt is partly due to a reflexive attachment to inanimate objects. “If in my drawer there’s three spoons, if I keep using two spoons and not the other spoon, I’ll feel… bad,” Nadirah explains. “It’s the same feeling I get with the villagers. Every day that I don’t talk to them it’s like ‘oh my god, they were waiting for me.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e28dQP"&gt;While I didn’t have such an egalitarian friendship with my villagers — I shunned Lionel for weeks to make him leave — my mind immediately jumped to Merengue, the last of my three original starter villagers who had kept me company during lockdown last year. Merengue, who had come to my house to look for me. Merengue, a Beef House resident from day one. I felt worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gQ3HmgK3Gzb_kvIM7nV9CC4AjaI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22379691/2021031615501100_02CB906EA538A35643C1E1484C4B947D.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4PNfuw"&gt;Nadirah simply didn’t want to face her villagers again. “It’s fine, rather than hearing them saying ‘oh no, I’ve missed you,’ or ‘you missed someone’s birthday.’ I can’t deal with that kind of emotional blackmail,” she says. “I just feel like if I can reset everything, it’s much easier. It’s much easier to burn bridges and connect with new people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2M0pZ"&gt;Harper — like me — believes she’s projecting some of her own avoidant tendencies onto her villagers. She compared the Great Return to going home for Christmas after you haven’t seen your family in two years. “I am the type of person to fall madly in love with someone, but when it’s been a week or two since we’ve talked, I just assume it’s hopeless and there’s no point saying ‘hey,’ and I feel that way about my villagers, sans the madly in love part,” she says. “I’m trying to get better at consistency, and I feel like &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; might be good practice… but I gotta get over that initial hump of shame… and having to reflect on myself for being this way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hm9qYy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Oh great, more people I’ve ghosted, except they’re virtual animal people.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lCb8JB"&gt;So where does &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; stand now that we’re stumbling through the first quarter of 2021? It’s not the intense escapist delight it used to be, especially for so many of us who used it as a vital portal to human connection. I still haven’t played through the whole cycle of a year — I’m missing fish and bugs and sea creatures, so there are incentives for me to get back into it. But perhaps the game was tethered too closely to a time we’d all rather not dwell on, when our respective worlds were far too small and strained. It turns out that two things can be true — that &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; was both the definitive &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/arts/animal-crossing-covid-coronavirus-popularity-millennials.html"&gt;game of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; (if there ever was one), as well as an unexpected stage for unrealized social anxiety. “The game was such a joy, and now it’s this cursed object waiting for me to return,” Harper says. “It’s just like... oh great, more people I’ve ghosted, except they’re virtual animal people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8D7JHG"&gt;Perhaps, like Harper says,&lt;em&gt; New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; could be used as a practice tool for people to come to terms with light pandemic ghosting. After I got over the fear of confronting the rest of my villagers — Marshal hadn’t even noticed my absence — I was left feeling empty and unmotivated. There was so much to do on the island: weeding, stomping on the cockroaches that had infested my house, picking fruit, checking the shops. I didn’t want to do any of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VUbyqI"&gt;But my villagers knew I was back, and they were happy to see me even though I’d ditched them — a new emotional fiction that &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing &lt;/em&gt;can offer as we maneuver through post-pandemic relationship dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alienware’s latest gaming laptops can now be configured with Cherry MX switches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P_0zYZDwXDjIK0ppak_gDbITOyA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986482/cfaulkner_200826_4165_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M15 R3 is pictured here, though the switches can only be configured on the latest R4.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5lrIud"&gt;Alienware and Cherry have worked together to cram what both companies are calling the “first true” mechanical keyboard into a gaming laptop. Starting March 18th, you’ll be able to purchase Alienware’s M15 R4 or M17 R4 laptops and upgrade them to a Cherry MX mechanical keyboard for an extra $150 at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZSGfR"&gt;The laptops will house a new kind of Cherry switch called the MX Ultra Low Profile, which is 3.5mm thick (compared to the 11.9mm-sized MX Low Profile switch). The switch is built with stainless steel wings that swing open and push down — picture the way a DeLorean’s car doors open and close. (Cherry not-so-subtly teased these new switches with a picture of the famously heavy car that’s built with stainless steel). The rest of the switch is made of thermoplastic polymer that can withstand high temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZVfZJxzskkZnOb5wdg0lA5ua_RU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374417/mxultralow.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Cherry&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GVigzC"&gt;Cherry touts 1.8mm of total travel for this switch, which the company says provides a satisfying amount of feedback. The design of the switch is also said to improve typing accuracy, as well as self-clean with each press to prevent particles from messing it up over time. And, based on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Alienware/status/1372216233819521028"&gt;this tweet from Alienware&lt;/a&gt;, the switches seem like they’ll have that signature “thock” sound that’s associated with mechanical keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Cherry MX Ultra Low Profile" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nZCqlwKKSWvzB9bDfQJvHKGjedw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374420/GIF_ULP.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Cherry&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new MX Ultra Low switch in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NDyBrI"&gt;As for its integration into the latest Alienware M15 and M17 R4 laptops, the companies say that the laptop designs didn’t need to be tweaked at all to accommodate the new Cherry switch. The lids will still close just fine, which seems like a testament to how thin the switch is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ez22W9"&gt;When you purchase the Cherry upgrade, you’ll get per-key RGB backlighting and AlienFX customization, along with full N-key rollover with anti-ghosting, so it won’t get overloaded when you’re pressing a lot of keys at once. One thing to note is that when you get the keyboard upgrade, all keys, aside from the function row, will have the Cherry MX Ultra Low Profile switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Fz524"&gt;I haven’t had the chance to try out these new switches, so I can’t attest to how they feel compared not only to other Cherry MX switches but to the switches Alienware typically uses as well. Admittedly, $150 is a steep add-on for a laptop that’s already going to cost you a lot of money, but it could end up being a good investment if you’re obsessed with mechanical keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s everything we know about the new OnePlus phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lE-2gDCTGXNR5XV-8rXMMGMVx7s=/0x0:627x418/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986485/Ewgs_gjUcAMIE12.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3I8qce"&gt;OnePlus has an upcoming event on March 23rd, where it’ll be formally announcing the OnePlus 9, and OnePlus 9 Pro. As with any smartphone event these days, there’s a ton of information about what will be revealed at the event, thanks in no small part to OnePlus itself doling out pieces of news over the past couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VbxpkT"&gt;Confirmed by OnePlus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WmyBTC"&gt;OnePlus has been in the habit lately of trying to build up suspense for its events, which is why you see it and its executives just tweeting out information about the phones. Here’s what we’ve learned from them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8N3qvy"&gt;Chargers? In the box&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kgVwo9"&gt;OnePlus’s CEO, Pete Lau, has confirmed on a forum post that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319657/oneplus-9-charger-in-box-pete-lau-announcement"&gt;will be including a charger in the box&lt;/a&gt; with the 9-series phones, instead of going the route that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22225930/samsung-galaxy-s21-no-charger-brick-headphones-price"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; have taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BKDz3r"&gt;The Pro will have 50W wireless charging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6LSMRg"&gt;OnePlus has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22099073"&gt;let &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;try the 9 Pro’s 50W wireless charging&lt;/a&gt;, and it is indeed fast, charging the phone from 1 to 100% in 43 minutes. If you prefer charging with a cable, both the Pro and regular 9 will support 65W wired charging as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3IqcIH"&gt;OnePlus has already shown off the design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3qPDX1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/tech/oneplus-says-screw-it-heres-the-oneplus-9-pro-photos-from-every-angle"&gt;Input has a collection&lt;/a&gt; of all the images that OnePlus has posted of the 9 Pro on Twitter, and there’s not a ton left to the imagination. It does, in fact, look like a smartphone, with USB-C port on the bottom, and a camera bump.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d_J0Z-X41ti1g5WJVCjBt0YCtB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22377986/1_M00_22_12_rB8bwmBQEOWACzO_AAZ7LBXLBP0204.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hasselblad branding and a variety of lenses. The 9 is on the left, the 9 Pro on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Zo1q43"&gt;OnePlus is focusing on cameras&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9nfFNG"&gt;We know that the legendary camera company Hasselblad will be working on &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-9-exclusive-ceo-pete-lau-on-its-new-camera-and-whats-next"&gt;providing “color expertise” for the phones’ cameras&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus has been dropping subtle hints about the collaboration, like centering its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306934/oneplus-9-launch-event-date-moonshot-pete-lau"&gt;marketing material around the moon&lt;/a&gt; (when Apollo astronauts went to the moon, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise"&gt;they took Hasselblad cameras&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/tech/oneplus-says-screw-it-heres-the-oneplus-9-pro-photos-from-every-angle"&gt;releasing pictures of the phones&lt;/a&gt;, which have the word “Hasselblad” written on the camera modules. And having a Hasselblad section on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Flaunch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F18%2F22334396%2Foneplus-9-march-23rd-event-rumor-announcement-roundup-smartwatch-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the phone’s launch page&lt;/a&gt;. Okay, maybe it’s not so subtle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2t2j5X"&gt;When it comes to the capabilities of those cameras, we can look at an &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-9-exclusive-ceo-pete-lau-on-its-new-camera-and-whats-next"&gt;interview Pete Lau did with &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He talks about the phones working with Sony to make a custom IMX789 sensor (something he’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1369304680241762311"&gt;also tweeted about&lt;/a&gt;), and mentions that they will be capable of shooting 4K at 120FPS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsIHrY"&gt;What the camera capabilities of the 9 Pro versus the regular 9 are will probably have to wait for the official announcement — but the pictures released by OnePlus show that the Pro seems to have four cameras, where the regular only has three. As with past OnePlus phones, at least one of the cameras &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1369304680241762311"&gt;will be an ultra-wide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="T3LZsr"&gt;Of course, the phones will be 5G-capable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="YLd2pZ"&gt;The OnePlus 8 series had 5G, and the 9 series will too, as indicated by the “5G” superscript on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1371400783950970881"&gt;OnePlus’s announcement images&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2vdq5B"&gt;There will be a smartwatch launched as well&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xYowLD"&gt;OnePlus has already released a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1372170855661330436?s=20"&gt;teaser video of the device&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/17/oneplus-watch-wear-os-confirmed/"&gt;confirmed that it won’t be running Google’s Wear OS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vXVuXF"&gt;The phones will use the Snapdragon 888&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VUJYho"&gt;OnePlus is continuing its tradition of including Qualcomm’s flagship-class processor, according to tweets &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1372193579674841090?s=20"&gt;from Pete Lau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1372140664868208643?s=20"&gt;the OnePlus account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hXzd1h"&gt;What we know about the displays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FqInCT"&gt;Pete Lau also tweeted out most of the details about the 9 Pro’s display:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jQovJ1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just the rundown: &lt;br&gt;LTPO&lt;br&gt;QHD+ &lt;br&gt;Smart 120Hz &lt;br&gt;Native 10-bit color depth (1.07 billion colors)&lt;br&gt;1300 nits&lt;br&gt;MEMC&lt;br&gt;HDR10+&lt;/p&gt;— Pete Lau (@PeteLau) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1371817947694514176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aam7r6"&gt;LTPO displays &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;can run at different refresh rates&lt;/a&gt; depending on the content being displayed, meaning that the OnePlus 9 screens should be able to sip power when displaying static images, but still provide smooth animations &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1371830276926668801?s=20"&gt;at 120Hz when you’re actually using the phone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;PC Mag&lt;/em&gt; has already seen &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/exclusive-first-test-results-of-the-radical-oneplus-9-pro-display"&gt;in-depth testing results&lt;/a&gt; from the Pro’s screen, showing its power usage, and 360Hz touch-polling rate, which should lead to improved responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71ix5v"&gt;Also new to the Pro is a 10-bit display which should, in theory, show colors more accurately. Otherwise, it’s packing many of the same features as the screen on the OnePlus 8 Pro, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219861/oneplus-8-pro-review-specs-features-price-camera-battery-photos-video"&gt;is not a complaint&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, unless you don’t like big screens — &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/exclusive-first-test-results-of-the-radical-oneplus-9-pro-display"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Pro’s display is 6.7 inches, the same size as an iPhone Pro Max or Galaxy Note 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UOnjXq"&gt;Colors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="almzN5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1371400783950970881"&gt;We’ve officially seen&lt;/a&gt; the Pro’s Morning Mist (silver) and regular OnePlus 9’s Winter Mist (purple) colors, but...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="456Leu"&gt;Left to the Imagination (and leaks)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="u71pvB"&gt;... &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323979/oneplus-9-pro-leak-images-hasselblad-camera"&gt;there have also been leaks showing off other colors&lt;/a&gt;, like a forest green on the Pro, and a blue for the regular OnePlus 9. And, of course, there are black versions of each phone as well (I anxiously await to see if OnePlus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230934/samsung-galaxy-s21-phantom-black-phone-color"&gt;makes a big deal about it in the presentation&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IB9KKz"&gt;The Regular 9 will have a (slightly) smaller screen than the Pro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QE1Lvf"&gt;While OnePlus officially shared the Pro’s screen size with &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, the details of the regular 9 weren’t mentioned. &lt;a href="http://www.slashleaks.com/l/oneplus-9-key-specs-leaked-through-aida64"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slashleaks&lt;/em&gt; indicates&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be 6.55 inches, and have a slightly lower resolution of 1080 x 2400, as opposed to the 1440 x 3216 reported for the Pro by &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eF2bOf"&gt;A third phone?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5Vdj7q"&gt;There are also rumors of a third phone, which may be called the 9R or the 9 Lite. &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-lite-snapdragon-865-will-launch-alongside-oneplus-9-9-pro"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports that it may have a stepped-down, Snapdragon 865 processor, but apart from that not much else is known. Will it actually happen? We’ll have to see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="tm7ffh"&gt;
&lt;p id="IkhucV"&gt;It seems that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus"&gt;OnePlus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau"&gt;its CEO&lt;/a&gt; are going to be posting more details on Twitter during the lead-up to the event, but at this point it seems like we’ve got a good outline of what the phones will be like. Now, it’s just waiting until the 23rd, at 10AM ET, to have the details filled in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Shorts arrives in the US to take on TikTok, but the beta is still half-baked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Three screenshots showing the interface of YouTube Shorts in beta. One shows a video, another shows a carousel of videos on the YouTube app’s main screen, and the third shows a grid of videos using the same sound." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IMNVQr_wWWXlyTJpAm2SjCuITew=/0x1:4332x2889/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986542/youtube_shorts_beta.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube Shorts in beta. | Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pRwCZZ"&gt;YouTube Shorts, the company’s short-form answer to TikTok, is launching in beta in the United States starting today. The short video format has already been available for several months in India, but today marks its debut stateside (along with the addition of several new features).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ILMCqB"&gt;For the beta launch, YouTube Shorts will feature all the basics of any TikTok clone: a multi-segment camera that makes it easy for creators to quickly string together clips, a wide selection of music tracks (with catalogs from “over 250 labels and publishers”), and a robust-looking captioning tool, the last of which is debuting alongside the US launch. “We really want to create a playground of creativity here where we give creators the raw materials to produce great videos,” says Todd Sherman, YouTube’s product lead for Shorts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FawHsP"&gt;Like TikTok, users will be able to swipe through an endless, algorithmically generated feed of short videos, subscribe to their favorite creators, explore specific hashtags or sounds, and remix other videos’ audio tracks. Even the interface looks similar to TikTok’s player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eJpGsV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Shorts is for “that next generation of creators” who may find traditional YouTube “too difficult”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UVHp0a"&gt;But instead of getting its own app, Shorts will live on a new carousel on the home tab of the mobile YouTube app. (The company is also experimenting with a dedicated Shorts tab.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9VjF8"&gt;And while Shorts checks off a lot of the basics, it’s missing plenty of features that make TikTok such a unique viral hit. There’s virtually no collaborative features available in Shorts at launch — so users won’t be able to reply to other videos or join together in a version of TikTok’s popular duet or stitch features. Also missing is a way to view a more curated feed. For now, Shorts only offers its main, algorithmic feed (similar to TikTok’s “For You” page), with no option to only view videos from accounts to which you’ve subscribed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MeIpWM"&gt;Sherman says that the company views Shorts as a new avenue for the next generation of content creators to emerge. YouTube itself is filled with a hyper-competitive landscape of established creators who specialize in making videos that typically run 10 minutes or longer. Shorts offers creators a chance to break that mold, much like what YouTube originally offered to internet creators when it first launched in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPOT6P"&gt;“I think the real core of what Shorts is about is enabling that next generation of creators that maybe even found it too difficult, previously, to even consider creating on YouTube,” Sherman explains. “And if we can help fulfill our mission of giving them a voice, then I think that would make us feel like we’re continuing to grow a YouTube in a way that keeps it relevant for this next generation of creators to find a voice on this platform.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qqw9qe"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9GrfXSNmTpQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UHhB4l"&gt;That’s not to say that Shorts won’t offer anything to existing creators. For starters, YouTube will share subscriptions across traditional channels and Shorts. So any users that find your content in Shorts and subscribe to get more of it will also be signing up for any long-form videos, and creators with tons of subscribers already will have a built-in audience to whom they can deliver Shorts. In at least one implementation of Shorts that the company is trying, Shorts videos will appear directly in users’ subscription tabs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UCHBZ6"&gt;According to Sherman, YouTube has some big plans for how it’ll tie Shorts into the broader YouTube ecosystem down the line — features that might help the fledgling service stand out in a crowded field that’s already dominated by TikTok and other (less established) competitors like Instagram’s Reels or Snapchat’s Spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="be4hQm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube hasn’t shared how creators can monetize their videos yet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oVVlwT"&gt;And those features are going to be essential: YouTube is coming very late to a party that’s already ruled by TikTok, and as Reels and Spotlight have shown, its no small task to not only replicate but outdo TikTok’s seemingly magical blend of algorithmic alchemy, collaborative tools, and viral trends. Unfortunately, YouTube Shorts is already playing catch-up, and its uniquely YouTube features are still very half-baked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6TCszX"&gt;Shorts does have a few clever ties into traditional YouTube videos: at launch, creators will be able to jump right to creating a Short from music videos for licensed songs, for instance. And in the future, the company plans to allow users to remix sound from any YouTube video for use in Shorts, a potential goldmine of content for creators to remix into new memes and videos. (YouTube users will be able to opt out, if they’d prefer to not have their audios used.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXkco5"&gt;But Shorts just still barely scratches the surface. For example, Shorts that use a song clip can link out to the music video on YouTube proper, but there’s no easy collection or link to find Shorts of a song from the regular video player, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n9tTPk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-ay_m4AljU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nipIP5"&gt;While it’s starting from behind, YouTube is an unparalleled force for videos online, and the fact that creators can seamlessly transition between Shorts and long-form videos — while bringing their audiences with them — isn’t something to discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6W2tQa"&gt;“As we grow Shorts, we can connect that ecosystem to the broader YouTube. And that means that if you are a short-form creator and you grow to be a long-form creator, that audience can grow with you,” Sherman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9KGtc9"&gt;Being able to directly link to the original sources of content for audio — whether it be a song, a movie clip, or a snippet of an interview — is also a powerful advantage for YouTube, as is the sheer size of the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsToCe"&gt;As Sherman explains, “One of the underpinnings that has helped so many people become creators is that you if give them high-quality inputs, they’re more likely to get to high-quality outputs by remixing other things.” And if you’re looking for videos to input, it’s hard to find a bigger source of them than Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgwnQF"&gt;But there are still big unanswered questions that YouTube has to figure out about Shorts — chief among them, how creators will make money. “I think the world has come to expect YouTube to support creators. And I think that’s going to extend to Shorts also,” says Sherman. “The way we think about it is: television has a different business model than movies, YouTube has a different business model than television, and short-form video is going to have a different business model than long-form YouTube.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bsojl"&gt;For now, though, YouTube isn’t making any announcements as to what monetization options will look like on Shorts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNZeIH"&gt;Another big question is what — if anything — YouTube is planning to do to make sure that Shorts doesn’t end up as another place for clout-chasing content farmers to just repost popular TikToks and reap the rewards (something that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274332/instagram-algorithm-tiktok-watermark-recommendation-software-best-practices"&gt;Instagram Reels continues to struggle with&lt;/a&gt;.) Sherman says that it’s something that the Shorts team is looking into, but that they have a fine line to walk: YouTube doesn’t want to discourage creators from posting their content on multiple platforms, but it also doesn’t want people just reposting videos from other people that they just downloaded off TikTok either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqtuBc"&gt;The company says that it’ll take a bit of time for Shorts to roll out, but that it should “be available to everybody in the US over the next several weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8m8t7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZPxVF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGAANN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZhz1X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wK8g6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify says over 13,000 artists’ catalogs earned at least $50K in royalties last year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8epCtJAbMrnabV7a9zaExY7ZORk=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986490/spotrev.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wfB3yD"&gt;Musicians aren’t thrilled with Spotify — they say the streaming platform undervalues their work and they deserve to be paid more per stream. So today, Spotify’s trying to address those concerns with &lt;a href="https://loudandclear.byspotify.com/"&gt;a new website&lt;/a&gt; called Loud &amp;amp; Clear, which offers more insight into how much the platform pays artists and how that money is distributed. The site also includes a calculator so artists can see where their work ranks on Spotify, like how a song with 100,000 all-time streams would only be in the top 2,710,000 tracks on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VfzrGo"&gt;Notably, the company says it’s paid over $23 billion in royalties to rights holders, including over $5 billion in 2020, which is up from $3.3 billion in 2017. It also notes that there are 1.2 million artists with over 1,000 listeners on the platform — it doesn’t say how many artists there are total — and that 15 percent, or 184,500, of their catalogs generated recording and publishing royalties of at least $1,000. (Those payments don’t go directly to artists and are instead paid to their rights holders, like distributors or record labels, which then refer to the contracts they hold with artists to pay them. This means the artists likely didn’t receive the full $1,000 from their Spotify streams.) On the higher end, only 870 artists’ catalogs generated $1 million or more in royalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="473M5n"&gt;You can play around with the website to see all the data and, if you have questions about how streaming royalties work and how the company figures out how much to pay rights holders, there’s a video on that. I’m embedding it below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MyvHLv"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iExPc11FWUc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OKK0P8"&gt;Spotify’s increased interest in transparency comes about during a time when a couple of its competitors are experimenting with new ways to pay artists. Earlier this month, SoundCloud &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309090/soundcloud-artist-stream-pay-listener-fan-royalties"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’d pay indie artists based on their actual listeners, rather than share of overall streams. So a SoundCloud subscriber’s subscription fee or advertising revenue is divvied up among the artists they actually listen to, rather than going to a big pot and being split up and shared with the platform’s most popular artists, like Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGTHSz"&gt;In a chat with&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Charlie Hellman, Spotify’s VP and head of marketplace, noted that the company’s internal research doesn’t suggest that this model would meaningfully shift the types of artists that succeed, but that if the industry decided to move toward the change, Spotify would be “open” to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IunQ6"&gt;Maybe transparency will help artists feel like Spotify isn’t just profiting from their work, but it’s hard to imagine that being the case. Spotify, to its credit, has attempted to make it easier for artists to directly profit, with features like &lt;a href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/introducing-artist-fundraising-pick"&gt;a tip jar&lt;/a&gt; and the ability to &lt;a href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-sell-merch"&gt;sell merch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://artists.spotify.com/faq/concerts#how-can-i-promote-my-concerts-on-spotify"&gt;concert tickets&lt;/a&gt; through the platform. But how much artists have earned through those features isn’t detailed on this new website, and the website makes clear that hundreds of thousands of artists earn far less than a living wage through the platform’s streams.&lt;/p&gt;
