    <title>Forza Motorsport 7 will be driving into the sunset in September</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dS4U2N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Motorsport 7 &lt;/em&gt;will no longer be available to purchase from the Microsoft Store or play on Xbox Game Pass after September 15th, 2021, as &lt;a href="https://forzamotorsport.net/en-us/news/forza-motorsport-7-end-of-life"&gt;it’s reaching “end of life” status&lt;/a&gt;. The game won’t be completely going away — if you own it you’ll still be able to download and play it, and the multiplayer will still be accessible, but anyone without the game won’t be able to buy the digital version. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ForzaMotorsport/status/1420792916742590464?s=20"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Forza &lt;/em&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, this is happening because the game’s licenses to use real-world cars and tracks are starting to expire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Mf6YO"&gt;If you’re a long-time &lt;em&gt;Forza &lt;/em&gt;fan, you may have seen this happen before. Games in the series have historically &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/by-september-xbox-wont-have-a-single-forza-motorsport-game-for-sale/"&gt;been delisted around four years after their release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Horizon 3 &lt;/em&gt;was &lt;a href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/360052097274-End-of-Life-for-Forza-Horizon-3"&gt;delisted in September 2020&lt;/a&gt; after being launched in September 2016, and &lt;em&gt;Motorsport 6&lt;/em&gt; was removed from Microsoft’s online store &lt;a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-6-to-be-delisted-next-month/"&gt;in September 2019&lt;/a&gt;, following its launch in September 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ROwJqO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft’s Game Pass adds some complication to &lt;em&gt;Motorsport 7&lt;/em&gt;’s delisting&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vFKFuP"&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Motorsport 7&lt;/em&gt;, there’s the complication of Xbox Game Pass. The game will no longer be available on the service after September 15th, which leads to an interesting question: what about the people who didn’t buy the game, but bought DLC for it to play with the Game Pass version? &lt;a href="https://forzamotorsport.net/en-us/news/forza-motorsport-7-end-of-life"&gt;Forza says&lt;/a&gt; that anyone in this situation will receive a “token” that will let them keep playing the game. The token will be sent to players by August 2nd, and will have to be redeemed before September 15th, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lQE1N2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Not dumb at all! Forza games have to go unlisted after several years because the third party licenses that we use to feature real-world cars, tracks and other elements will begin to expire.&lt;/p&gt;— Forza Motorsport (@ForzaMotorsport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ForzaMotorsport/status/1420792916742590464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F8qx5l"&gt;When &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ForzaMotorsport/status/1420792916742590464?s=20"&gt;the Forza twitter account&lt;/a&gt; tweeted that the games are being delisted because of licenses expiring, fans were quick to point out that some other racing games don’t seem to have this issue. For example, &lt;em&gt;Need For Speed Rivals&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://guides.gamepressure.com/nfsrivals/guide.asp?ID=23145"&gt;which features real cars&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was launched in 2013 and is currently &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fneed-for-speed-rivals%2Fc3vm0tmwnz5m" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale in the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reached out to EA to get an idea about how it licenses cars for the games, but didn’t immediately receive a response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mo87Ol"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It becomes difficult to check out older Forza titles, even if they’re well worth playing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DvjWBm"&gt;The Forza model does seem curious: the games clearly have a lot of work put into them, and they’re often held up as a standard for how good racing games can look. Then, after about four years, they become much harder to buy. One of my colleagues mourned the loss of the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;Horizon 3&lt;/em&gt;, which he considers to be the best game in the series. I’ve never played it, and would love to know what makes it so good — but I can’t get the game (used physical copies are available, but seemingly not for PC, and I don’t own an Xbox).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZ9Rwy"&gt;This isn’t necessarily to point fingers at or shame the Forza team. As &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22559909/ncaa-college-football-nil-rules-pay-players-ea-sports-video-game"&gt;EA Sports and the NCAA have shown&lt;/a&gt;, digitizing the real world into a playable form can be messy when there’s people or brands involved. What’s more, the makers of hyper and super-cars, like the ones featured in Forza, can be especially protective of their brand. Famously, Ferrari reportedly sent musician Deadmau5 &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/ferrari-sent-deadmau5-a-cease-and-desist-about-his-purr-1627640534"&gt;a cease and desist letter&lt;/a&gt; for customizing his car. It’s just odd that, for whatever reason, this is how Forza does the licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldC9YM"&gt;While it may be unfortunate that &lt;em&gt;Forza Motorsport 7&lt;/em&gt; is being taken off Microsoft’s virtual shelves, there is a silver lining: if you want to get it before it’s gone, the game’s Standard, Deluxe, and Ultimate editions &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-US%2Fp%2Fforza-motorsport-7-standard-edition%2F9n3nk5ww05ht" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are all 75 percent off&lt;/a&gt;, selling for $9.99, $14.99, and $19.99 respectively. &lt;a href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/4404442728339-End-of-Life-for-Forza-Motorsport-7-"&gt;According to Forza’s support article&lt;/a&gt;, they’ll be on sale until September 15th, and the game will still be playable after it’s no longer available to purchase. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood’s public trading is off to a rocky start</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BWt4uu8mLYStsMtDv-_xnYS9DsE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69653064/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LYeasp"&gt;Robinhood started trading at $38, dropped about 10 percent, recovered, but still closed down 8 percent at $34.90 on its first day of trading. It’s the worst first day among 51 firms that raised as much as Robinhood or more, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-29/robinhood-flirts-with-worst-debut-ever-for-ipo-of-its-size"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also bad news for Robinhood’s experiment at offering retail investors a chunk of the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtpJZH"&gt;Robinhood’s shares priced at the bottom of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-ipo-prices-at-38-a-share-11627515866"&gt;the targeted price range of $38 to $42 a share&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps because of concerns about volatility or perhaps because Robinhood wanted to ensure a pop for its retail investors. And though Robinhood had said it would allocate up to 35 percent of its shares to retail, only 20 percent actually went to retail, which “indicated less interest than expected,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/technology/robinhood-stock.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Iapm2f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Robinhood is synonymous with the rise of meme stocks and retail investing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9qnPZ6"&gt;Because the stock traded down, institutional investors — those who traditionally buy IPOs and who bought the majority of this one — may be leery of future IPOs if there are a lot of retail investors involved, according to Robert Le, an analyst for Pitchbook. That may mean bankers and other companies will avoid giving retail investors as much access to future IPOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HcZq7X"&gt;A bad first day of trading may not mean much for Robinhood in the long run. I mean, Facebook had a disastrous IPO in 2012 — pricing at $38, doing not much of anything its first day, and then falling during the following trading days. Facebook’s current share price, by the way, is $358.32. It is arguably successful! So I don’t know what today means for Robinhood the company. Besides, Robinhood sold shares to its customers — and they may be very loyal investors if they like the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqjZLz"&gt;Now, it may be that retail investors aren’t trying to maximize their returns, &lt;a href="https://business.vanderbilt.edu/bio/josh-white/"&gt;says Josh White&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of finance at Vanderbilt University, who was previously a financial economist for the Securities and Exchange Commission. They might just be doing some &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-07-02/robinhood-ipo-filing-is-a-lesson-in-meme-finance"&gt;gambling&lt;/a&gt;. “Investors are trying to maximize their happiness, not their wealth,” White says. “A lot of people get utility — fun or joy — out of trading stock.” Maybe, he suggests, this is better than going to a casino or gambling on DraftKings because companies can use the money to invest in jobs and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRK6nG"&gt;Robinhood is synonymous with the rise of meme stocks and retail investing. In fact, in a complaint &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2021/comp-pr2021-141.pdf"&gt;the SEC filed today&lt;/a&gt; against Nikola founder Trevor Milton, it says that Milton “embarked on a relentless public relations blitz aimed at a class of investors he called ‘Robinhood investors.” The complaint goes on to say that Milton tracked the number of new Robinhood investors who got into Nikola’s stock as a sign of success. Milton is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599726/nikola-founder-securities-fraud-charge-milton"&gt;being charged with securities fraud&lt;/a&gt;; Nikola, which peaked in price above $65 last year, is now worth $12.26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHlvV8"&gt;If those retail investors lose a lot of money, that may be trouble for brokers — not just Robinhood. “Eventually, these are going to be customers that all brokerage firms want to attract,” White says. “If they lose a lot of money now, are they going to exit investing altogether?” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s new PS5 beta update also fixes one of its silliest flaws</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ek7dTTLJ8EjzoGCErZUamTyb6to=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69653009/vpavic_4278_20201030_0234.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Reqltx"&gt;The first major system update for Sony’s PlayStation 5 is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599593/sony-ps5-m2-ssd-support-beta-features"&gt;arriving in beta form today&lt;/a&gt;, finally letting you expand the console’s 667GB of usable storage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to"&gt;by adding your own PCIe Gen 4 SSD&lt;/a&gt; as well as testing new UI options and expanding 3D Audio support. But the full changelog also includes a few features that Sony didn’t highlight to press — including a way to easily update your DualSense controller if you press the wrong button!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ej2eJy"&gt;You see, the PS5 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22539827/ps5-playstation-controller-how-to-update-dualsense"&gt;currently has a very silly flaw&lt;/a&gt;: the only time you can update your controller is when you boot the console. And if you say no or accidentally press the O button instead of X, you can’t trigger that update until 24 hours have passed (or you tweak your PS5’s internal clock to cheat it). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NuTZKY"&gt;But in Beta 2.0, there’s now a dedicated menu for that under &lt;strong&gt;Settings &amp;gt; Accessories &amp;gt; Controllers &lt;/strong&gt;called &lt;strong&gt;Wireless Controller Device Software. &lt;/strong&gt;Please forgive my grainy photo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JpEzWmf0VrVFYyYU8nBAvbY1Mj8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22749298/IMG_1280.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uoYI6x"&gt;You’ll still see controller update prompts when you launch the console, too — and hitting the circle button will still instantly dismiss them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oAvlI"&gt;The beta also makes one of our other UI frustrations slightly better: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/21591497/sony-playstation-5-ps5-turn-off-difficult-menu-ui-confusing-design"&gt;the ability to easily turn off the console&lt;/a&gt;. It’s still a mystery why Sony switched away from letting you long-press the PS button to requiring extra taps, but at least now you can change how many taps it takes. Pressing the hamburger / start button in the PS5’s quick actions menu now lets you drag any of them (including the PS5’s digital power button) to a different position in that menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TBHEw"&gt;Separately, did you know the PS5 lets you set up all kinds of parental controls for your kid on what they can play, watch, and do, and it lets you remotely approve their requests over the web? I didn’t realize that, and the beta update now lets you see and respond to those asks through the latest version of the mobile PlayStation App, not just via email.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EUb04bhTpwAOVKxj6arU81WxYw0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22749344/IMG_1284.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gBIavSeOCdV60N_MpG7hdSLqU_g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22749355/PXL_20210729_195331602.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Phh51A"&gt;Frankly, it still needs work: it’s a convoluted process that kicks you out to a web browser for setup, requires your kid to be signed into a PlayStation Network account (not just a local profile), has you set up all kinds of limits, and kicks you out to a web browser &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; (requiring you to log in) when you want to approve a request. And once you let your kid play a particular game, they get to keep playing until you remove it from the whitelist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zsj0hp"&gt;What I want is a simple rich phone notification that effectively lets me tap “yes, you can play this for 30 minutes” or “not right now, kid” and be done with it right away. Perhaps there’s time before the 2.0 software goes gold? Or perhaps in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZxc6O"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OwP6V"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon gives Alexa a new iOS widget and the ability to assign reminders </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2qah7ziH0OcDsOww6Ov7J6mGxB4=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69653005/dseifert_201025_4263_00010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EOnxCe"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/?node=23564416011"&gt;has updated the Alexa app on iOS&lt;/a&gt; so that you can access the voice assistant right from your home screen via a new widget. Everyone can use the assistant to remind specific members of your household to do tasks through a new “assign reminders” skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxukMk"&gt;Due to the somewhat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21574112/google-new-gmail-widget-ios-14-limitations"&gt;restrictive nature of the widgets on iOS&lt;/a&gt;, the new Ask Alexa widget isn’t so much Alexa itself as it is a link directly to the iOS app. But if you have the Alexa widget placed on any of your screens and you’ve already given the Alexa app permission to use your iPhone’s mic, you’ll be able to start making requests with a tap.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YRfihEo33Uu2B-L45YtQP7ZL8ck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22749259/iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA_gAAAfQCAYAAABRxXU3AAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAJ8WlUWHRYTUw6Y29tLmFkb2Jl.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ask Alexa widget in iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ovSwOc"&gt;And now those requests can get a bit more granular. Amazon’s given Alexa the ability to assign reminders to specific members of your household if they have a Voice Profile set up on the same Amazon Alexa account. So if you say “Alexa, remind Jeff to take the lasagna out of the freezer at 10AM,” Alexa will be able to deliver the reminder to the right person, at the right time, through the Alexa app. You can add profiles to your Alexa account in Settings under Your Profile, and Amazon says you can assign relationship nicknames to each one, like mom, dad, daughter, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vn4r96"&gt;Alexa picks up new features and skills on a monthly basis, but Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586033/amazon-alexa-widgets-featured-skill-api-developers-echo-show-screen"&gt;also announced plans in June&lt;/a&gt; to open up Alexa even further to third-party developers. Among many new APIs, developers will be able to create custom widgets for the Echo Show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x0kID9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon will let devs compete for your Echo Show’s screen and everything else Alexa just added ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586033/amazon-alexa-widgets-featured-skill-api-developers-echo-show-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LuJ0Ze"&gt;As stores reopen and in-person shopping picks back up, the surge in demand for Amazon purchases has finally started to wane — not &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;, to be clear, but just enough to frustrate investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1T479j"&gt;From April through June, Amazon saw $113.1 billion in sales of products and services, growing 27 percent year over year. That’s an enormous amount of money, but investors were hoping for a bit more, around $115 billion, and Amazon’s stock has been slipping since releasing the figures in &lt;a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results-2dcdc6a32/default.aspx"&gt;its Q2 2021 earnings report&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="szUb6c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AWS is picking up speed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cSFrk1"&gt;But there was one spot investors are happy to see, and it helps to explain the company’s recent executive shuffle. Amazon Web Services did $14.8 billion in net sales, up 37 percent year over year. That substantial growth outpaced Amazon as a whole and AWS’s prior Q2, when it grew by 29 percent. It was the sole business bright spot that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"&gt;Andy Jassy, Amazon’s new CEO&lt;/a&gt;, found worthy of mentioning in his remarks accompanying the release, saying “we’ve seen AWS growth reaccelerate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JJDZA"&gt;Jassy had been in charge of AWS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22563671/andy-jassy-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos"&gt;up until July 5th&lt;/a&gt;, when he was elevated to CEO to replace Jeff Bezos, who left to go &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRje0TBHGPS/"&gt;eat Skittles in space&lt;/a&gt;. The cloud division has always been a powerhouse for Amazon, accounting for most of the company’s operating income. While its growth had slowed during the pandemic, the division now seems to be, as Jassy said, reaccelerating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ny2Ktu"&gt;As for the rest of Amazon, the concern from investors over a company that merely made $113.1 billion in a three-month span may stem from two places. For one, last year Amazon was growing way faster — it saw 40 percent growth in net sales this time in 2020, versus 27 percent this year — though one might recall that a certain global pandemic was picking up during those months, encouraging a boom in online shopping. But secondly, the other tech giants have done quite well this quarter, beating investor expectations, making Amazon the odd one out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N97EQW"&gt;Prime Day was also held in June this year, which likely helped juice those numbers. Amazon said 250 million items were purchased, more than any prior Prime Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yH1Cm"&gt;“As the quarter progressed, people were at home less as restrictions and lockdowns eased in some of our largest geographies, including the US and much of Europe,” Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on a call with investors. As a result, he said, spending by Prime members “moderated compared to the peak of the pandemic.” There was a drop in categories like cleaning supplies and computer monitors, which people bought more of this time last year, but don’t need in the same numbers again this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmx5Og"&gt;There have been signs that the growth of online shopping as a whole is starting to slow down. Growth is still growth, but it means that Amazon and its investors can’t expect to see gains quite as enormous as the ones that happened in 2020, as much of the world tried to avoid indoor shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzwuKB"&gt;Olsavsky said Jassy has “hit the ground running” but didn’t offer any guidance on whether he would be bringing immediate changes to the company. “Expect Andy and his unique brand of positive attitude and optimism,” he said on the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UMkuU"&gt;Jassy hasn’t offered any indication of how he’ll steer the company differently from Bezos either, but today’s numbers help to show why he’s in charge. AWS remains a bright spot, and its leader now has the rest of Amazon to look after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YkFsc3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 29th, 6:42PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with remarks from Amazon’s earnings call.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why wildfire smoke can be worse than other air pollutants</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-CLIMATE-FIRE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SN46av2PD0fa0Knno9dCdVs9QkQ=/0x0:5463x3642/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69652639/1234191295.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A haze of wildfire smoke and clouds is seen at sunset in an aerial image taken during a flight from Seattle to Los Angeles as Western wildfires, including the Bootleg, Dixie, and Tamarack fires, continue to burn in Oregon and California.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CKh6RC"&gt;The explosive growth of wildfires in the Western US has spewed smoke across the landscape, creating a growing threat to public health. Driven by climate change, the 2020 fire season was so bad that it &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-04/california-fire-season-record-4-million-acres-burned"&gt;doubled&lt;/a&gt; the previous record in California for acres burned, and at-home monitoring of the smoke’s effects on air quality became &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21440343/air-quality-sensors-wildfire-smoke-pollution-climate-change"&gt;almost commonplace&lt;/a&gt;. This year’s season got off to a devastating start and has already darkened skies &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/map-watch-july-s-wildfire-smoke-travel-across-country-n1275343"&gt;on the East Coast with smoke from West Coast&lt;/a&gt; wildfires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xavTsn"&gt;Smoke isn’t your ordinary air pollution. The tiny particles found in smoke can be up to 10 times more harmful to human health than soot from other things like tailpipes and factories, according to research published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21708-0"&gt;journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nubqpp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tiny particles found in smoke can be up to 10 times more harmful to human health&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O7ujRH"&gt;The researchers looked at fine particles, also called PM2.5, that are 30 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair follicle. When a fuel burns, whether it’s gas or vegetation, it sends these fine particles up into the air and sometimes into our bodies. Fine particles from wildfire smoke led to 10 percent more respiratory hospitalizations than there would be without the smoke, the study found. Pollution from other sources, while still harmful, increased hospitalizations by just around 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCdPCf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Rosana Aguilera, the lead author of that study and a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Diego. She walked us through what she and other researchers are doing to better understand what wildfire smoke means for our health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBQSmQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ti7AJQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are “fine particles,” and why are we worried about them? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7n6Wo"&gt;The research group I work in studied the fine particles because it’s one of the main components of wildfire smoke. These particles are unique. Their chemical composition can vary in relation to the materials that are burning. There’s a myriad of potential compounds that can be present in wildfire smoke and fine particles like carbon, heavy metals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="eOCzlv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Wildfire smoke as a source of emissions is becoming more predominant”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pApS0S"&gt;We are focusing now on these fine particles that are found in wildfire smoke because, in some regions in the US and in the world, wildfire smoke as a source of emissions is becoming more predominant. Here in California, it’s definitely one source of air pollution that seems like it’s going to be increasing in the near future. There are some publications that support the idea that wildfire smoke will be one of the main sources of fine particulate matter in regions like the Western US, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jR1BTf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What effect can those fine particles have on human health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rls3Wl"&gt;It’s one of the air pollutants of concern because it’s small enough to penetrate our respiratory system and go deep into the lungs. It potentially also enters the bloodstream and from there, can travel to other organs. It can cause difficulty breathing. It can produce irritation and exacerbate conditions like asthma and other respiratory diseases and cardiopulmonary conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSjsXp"&gt;We deal mainly with acute effects, the response that we get after you’re exposed to wildfire smoke for some days. My research group is not specifically looking at long-term effects at this point, but I think it’s an area of research that needs to be expanded. It’s a bit more complicated to look at long-term exposure because you have to follow individuals who are exposed to multiple wildfires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrLfUd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how does wildfire smoke compare to air pollution from other sources like cars, trucks, and industry? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnqhHP"&gt;We found that wildfire smoke can be more harmful in terms of an increase of hospitalizations when compared to just looking at non-smoke fine particles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VPrzUI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Traffic emissions might be very different in composition from wildfire smoke”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Faarp2"&gt;Traffic emissions might be very different in composition from wildfire smoke. We haven’t really looked at the chemical composition of these fine particles with respect to their sources. But some toxicological studies have looked into more detail into that, and they find that the toxicity of wildfire smoke might be increased. If it goes through a structure, then it might pick up some chemicals found in houses and other buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Y0JwF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What impact do you hope your research will have? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCoPwx"&gt;We want to start looking more into these differential impacts of fine particles with respect to the sources of emissions and also try to look for some more of the chemical composition of different wildfires as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VM0B9f"&gt;If there’s a greater impact for wildfire smoke, and if wildfire smoke is going to be one of the main sources of this type of pollution in the future — or if it is already — we need to better understand why is it more harmful? And then what impact can we expect in the long term?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden wants states to pay people $100 to get vaccinated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Organization Assists Rural Mississippi Delta Residents With Rides To Nearest Vaccination Sites" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eJt13pYXVRj1sE7LglpLH_B2GHM=/4x0:3997x2662/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69652619/1231516435.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OPdWH7"&gt;The Biden administration wants states and local governments to give $100 to “every newly vaccinated American,” the Treasury Department said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Phil_Mattingly/status/1420826432830386177"&gt;statement today&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the latest federal effort to improve vaccination rates as COVID-19 continues to surge around the country, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmp4Go"&gt;States could use funding from the American Rescue Plan to fund the payments. The administration is not mandating&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the incentive, but the Treasury Department said it was partnering with the Department of Health and Human Services to help governments roll it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6xnAk"&gt;New York City &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/28/nyregion/new-york-vaccine-mandate-one-hundred-dollars.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; this week that it would give $100 to anyone who got a shot at one of the city-run vaccination sites. “I think when someone says here’s $100 for you, that’s going to make a big impact,” Mayor Bill De Blasio said on Wednesday. The program starts Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVYJHX"&gt;Financial incentives may help nudge some people to get their shot, Elisa Sobo, an anthropologist at San Diego State University who studies vaccine hesitancy, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/28/nyregion/new-york-vaccine-mandate-one-hundred-dollars.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Some people who have until now been on the fence will see $100 as a good reason to get off of it.” But it won’t be an incentive for everyone. “Some folks will find the offer insulting; others will use it as ‘proof’ that the vaccine is no good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4xoLC"&gt;Vaccination rates in the United States had been dropping steadily since April. They’ve started to slowly tick up again as people in states with major outbreaks — which had the lowest levels of vaccination — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-28/new-vaccinations-are-rebounding-in-the-u-s-s-covid-hotspots"&gt;sign up for shots&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOeY0T"&gt;Biden is also expected &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/27/politics/vaccine-mandate-for-federal-employees-under-consideration/index.html"&gt;to announce a vaccine mandate&lt;/a&gt; for federal workers today. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uncontrolled firing from Russian module causes brief ‘tug of war’ on International Space Station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MPNShGet72uBOudJ-JumUcRnq68=/107x0:1259x768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69652616/E7d_eh9VoAUNhlN.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Russia’s Nauka module | Roscosmos&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9MDxrZ"&gt;The International Space Station unexpectedly shifted in orbit on Thursday when thrusters on a newly docked Russian module began firing uncontrollably. The thrusters reoriented the football-field-sized laboratory’s position by as much as 45 degrees, NASA said. The station is back under control, a NASA spokesperson said, and its seven-person crew of astronauts, including three US astronauts, are safe, according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aiMBUy"&gt;The erroneous thruster firings from Russia’s Nauka module, a new 23-ton multipurpose laboratory, began a few hours after it docked to the ISS at 12:25PM ET, NASA spokesman Rob Navias said. Mission control at NASA’s astronaut headquarters in Houston first noticed the space station deviate from its normal position a few minutes later, triggering an automatic alert to the astronauts on board. By 12:42PM ET, the space station had lost control of its positioning, NASA’s ISS manager Joel Montalbano said during a press conference on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rLAvva"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re in a little bit of a tug of war between thrusters firing...”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yTnrZQ"&gt;The station, an ornate science laboratory with 16 pressurized living and cargo modules, was pitching off track by about 1.5 degrees each minute, NASA officials said. Thrusters on another side of the space station, from Russia’s Zvezda service module, fired up to counter the force from Nauka in what NASA’s mission control communicator described as a “tug of war.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adOtF4"&gt;“Just to update you guys,” mission control communicator Drew Morgan told US astronauts from Houston, “right now we’re in a little bit of a tug of war between thrusters firing from both the [service module] and [Nauka]. We are sorting through the best course of action right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BsunOt"&gt;Nearly an hour later, at 1:29PM ET, mission control in Houston and Moscow regained control of the station and wrested it back to its normal position. “The [Nauka] thrusters are no longer firing, we are back in attitude control, rates are stable,” Morgan told the US astronauts. “It’s safe to say that the remainder of the day is no longer going to happen as scheduled.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A7k2neDJiknXBR7_WbZzxFjvEug=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22749495/51303205654_9184fb87c2_k.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;NASA/Johnson Space Center&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The International Space Station’s Russian segment, with US segment continuing toward the left, is photographed on July 8th, 2021, as the orbital lab crosses over the Atlantic Ocean 273 miles up.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDezRn"&gt;Navias said the crew was safe. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the erroneous thruster firings — Roscosmos, Russia’s space agency, would lead the investigation into the cause, Montalbano said. Seeing the ISS deviate from its attitude like it did on Thursday under the influence of errant jet firings is “definitely not something that happens on a regular basis,” Montalbano added, guessing an event like Thursday’s has only happened roughly three to four times in the space station’s 20-year history. The station’s other partners at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and the European Space Agency were on call monitoring the health of the station during the event, Montalbano said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LN15jb"&gt;The mishap forced NASA to postpone Boeing’s planned launch of its uncrewed Starliner capsule to the ISS, which was slated for Friday at 2:53PM ET. The launch is now scheduled for Tuesday, August 3rd at 1:20PM ET, the agency said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OJDjy5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nauka has had a rough journey to the space station&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lpx42I"&gt;Nauka, which means science in Russian, launched from Russia’s Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan last Wednesday after weeks of 11th-hour delays caused by issues with the module’s guidance system. Even though it launched last week, the module has a long history — its development started in 1995, and it was originally slated to launch in 2007. But launch delays and several changes to its design and purpose pushed its deployment back by years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7dZXw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ria.ru/20210728/nauka-1743271183.html"&gt;Nauka ran into problems almost immediately upon entering space&lt;/a&gt;. The spacecraft deployed its solar arrays 13 minutes after launch without a hitch, but propulsion and communications issues prevented the spacecraft from entering its intended orbit. Engineers and mission control in Moscow scrambled to come up with a fix, eventually powering up the spacecraft’s secondary thrusters to prevent Nauka from falling out of orbit and burning up in Earth’s atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQItU8"&gt;Nauka regained its footing in a normal orbit and carried on with its eight-day trek to the space station, where it docked autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X4VlsE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 29th, 6:10PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds information from NASA officials speaking at a press conference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5PV4f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vi5MRe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Annapurna showed off lots of cool games at its first showcase</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SvW0HqO9BRixyWUj6Xpg2FUd5vk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69652368/AIShowcase_Stray_005.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stray.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qo7MaI"&gt;Thanks to games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/14/17007592/florence-iphone-ipad-review-monument-valley"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Florence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16774194/gorogoa-game-review-iphone-switch-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gorogoa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15421938/what-remains-of-edith-finch-review-ps4-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Remains of Edith Finch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Annapurna Interactive has steadily become one of the most exciting indie game publishers around. And at its first showcase event, the publisher showed that there’s plenty more in the works. In less than 30 minutes, Annapurna revealed some exciting new partnerships and showed off upcoming games that involve everything from being a cat to hunting demons in heaven. Here’s everything that was shown off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="odCDZ2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8R-splyERsI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CZGbwm"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stray&lt;/em&gt; turns you into a cyberpunk cat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZWff5"&gt;Arguably the highlight of the event was the debut gameplay trailer for &lt;em&gt;Stray&lt;/em&gt;, a game set in some kind of forgotten cyberpunk city in which you play as a lost cat. It looks like a great action-adventure game, albeit one where you can nuzzle robots and scratch up a couch. It’s slated to launch on PlayStation and Steam in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RmaLkf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZDj13Mz2voM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wr3ue5"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Artful Escape&lt;/em&gt; gets a release date and star-studded cast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yDcHg7"&gt;Gorgeous musical adventure &lt;em&gt;The Artful Escape&lt;/em&gt; sends players on a “psychedelic, multidimensional journey” that involves lots of killer guitar riffs. It also has a killer cast: the game will feature voice work from the likes of Michael Johnston, Caroline Kinley, Lena Headey, Jason Schwartzman, Mark Strong, and Carl Weathers. It launches September 9th on Xbox and PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0aGvmh"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/evbrPS8xw8w?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hnp2PG"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Storyteller&lt;/em&gt; lets you build your own narrative&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8aVBLw"&gt;One of the brand-new announcements was &lt;em&gt;Storyteller&lt;/em&gt;, which is a bit of a puzzle game where the goal is to create a story. You’re given a theme, characters, locations, and other narrative elements, which you can then mix-and-match using what looks like a very intuitive drag-and-drop system. It’s listed as coming “soon” to both the Switch and Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vkJDLo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pt9M6WumjtE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WPJ4bx"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt; is getting an expansion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="AT18l8"&gt;The mysterious sci-fi adventure &lt;em&gt;The Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt; is about to get even bigger: an expansion, called &lt;em&gt;Echoes of the Eye&lt;/em&gt;, is due to launch on September 28th. The trailer is delightfully cryptic, so it looks like fans will have to wait to see what it really entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qmRjuP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hA7aG1C5FU0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="64Fjj1"&gt;A closer look at &lt;em&gt;Neon White&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TPrEDS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neon White&lt;/em&gt; looks to be quite the departure for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/1/17806888/donut-county-game-la-los-angeles-ben-esposito-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Donut County&lt;/em&gt; creator Ben Esposito&lt;/a&gt;. It’s described as a speedrunning first-person shooter “about exterminating demons in Heaven,” and the new gameplay trailer gives a better idea of what that really means. It’s expected to launch later this year on Switch and PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3xanBc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1xC9uHfgzwU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TxnXPE"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Solar Ash&lt;/em&gt; is coming in October&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="piwa8p"&gt;The team behind &lt;em&gt;Hyper Light Drifter&lt;/em&gt; is returning with another gorgeous action game, and now we know when it’s coming out. &lt;em&gt;Solar Ash&lt;/em&gt; will be out on October 26th on PC and PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pTKM5j"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2uwLG_-69EQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vBe3sb"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A Memoir Blue&lt;/em&gt; explores memory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JZSPPu"&gt;Another new announcement, &lt;em&gt;A Memoir Blue&lt;/em&gt; is described as “a poignant story of a mother and daughter, experienced through memories cherished and memories suppressed.” It currently doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to a huge range of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6jm0Eo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CeyXnAn-7wY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2iouwS"&gt;A gameplay trailer for &lt;em&gt;Skin Deep&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Vt2O64"&gt;Blendo’s next release looks to make the world of immersive sims just a little bit weirder. The sci-fi game is about “sneaking, subverting, and sabotaging, all while not wearing shoes,” according to the developer. You can get a sense of what that means in the gameplay trailer above.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q4hTss8rPRyMzsn3h7B7zzJhPNE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745662/0000004150.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everyday Shooter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="odgQoX"&gt;A number of new partnerships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uIVTgg"&gt;In addition to new games, Annapurna also announced publishing deals with a quartet of exciting developers. That includes Jessica Mak, best known for the musical games &lt;em&gt;Sound Shapes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Everyday Shooter&lt;/em&gt;, as well as horror studio No Code and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/11/18306140/falcon-age-game-ps4-psvr-outerloop-vr-virtual-reality"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Falcon Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; developer Outerloop Games. The publisher is also working with a new team called Ivy Road, led by &lt;em&gt;Stanley Parable&lt;/em&gt; creator Davey Wreden and Karla Zimonja, formerly of &lt;em&gt;Gone Home&lt;/em&gt; developer Fullbright.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JbriaHi1d5_5RwvF9qqMnr7hNN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19933496/11307R1ZIfdvILCMdVuXXAd33Cd1sdYWx79Vz_fNw7X4BTx0Ll9eARsm_PQg6Gr1uCW_rDhFODf_yIT0xyIGtz88RUor7U3z.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Telling Lies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XU8Txz"&gt;Old games, new platforms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uL5hsY"&gt;Some of the publisher’s more popular games are also hitting new platforms in the near future. Both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/23/20828666/telling-lies-review-steam-iphone-sam-barlow-interactive-thriller-her-story"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Telling Lies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Gorogoa&lt;/em&gt; are coming to Xbox Game Pass, &lt;em&gt;The Pathless&lt;/em&gt; is coming to Steam on November 16th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506636/i-am-dead-review-pc-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Am Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is coming to Xbox and PlayStation on August 9th, and &lt;em&gt;Edith Finch&lt;/em&gt; will jump to mobile with an iOS port on August 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
