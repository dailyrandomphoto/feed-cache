    <title>Report: Valve is secretly building a Switch-esque portable gaming PC </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7gRf_Sryp6F-EcWBrlJ6_SLrBZU=/0x51:2000x1384/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341336/valve.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An early version of the Steam Controller.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WQIKF6"&gt;Nearly a decade after introducing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17190394/valve-steam-machines-steamos-section-hidden-pc-gaming-living-room"&gt;an ill-fated line&lt;/a&gt; of Linux gaming PCs dubbed “Steam Machines,” PC gaming giant Valve is &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/exclusive-valve-is-making-a-switch-like-portable-gaming-pc/"&gt;reportedly trying its hand at hardware again&lt;/a&gt; — with its own handheld gaming computer a la the Nintendo Switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWeogu"&gt;That’s the word &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/exclusive-valve-is-making-a-switch-like-portable-gaming-pc/"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;’s Sam Machkovech&lt;/a&gt;, who claims to have multiple sources attesting that Valve has been working on such a device: a touchscreen, touchpad, button, trigger, and dual-joystick-equipped portable that’ll likely run Linux and an array of specially optimized Steam titles. It should have the ability to dock, a la Nintendo Switch, via a USB-C port, too. &lt;em&gt;Ars &lt;/em&gt;suggests it could arrive as soon as the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blzr6e"&gt;It appears to be called SteamPal, or Neptune, according to &lt;a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamTracking/blob/3d8e7591e4464298b89c98d72a6c1b4a697db9af/ClientExtracted/steamui/6.js"&gt;a recent code dump&lt;/a&gt; collected by SteamDB:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0dYbVoUZtzehUD29UqHoZWZfsIg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539193/steampal.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vQ3qWg"&gt;Gabe Newell himself also cryptically teased at some sort of announcement regarding Steam and consoles earlier this month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZPFcOi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Gabe Newell has teased either Valve or Steam's games coming to consoles in this calendar year, at a public Q&amp;amp;A held in a public school yesterday morning. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TbKnrc6fZn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TbKnrc6fZn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tyler McVicker (@Tyler_McV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tyler_McV/status/1392172423722774528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ip51RY"&gt;Valve didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KevIYg"&gt;Could Valve build such a thing? It’s absolutely possible. We’ve written about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/18/22237379/aya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison"&gt;a recent explosion of portable gaming PCs&lt;/a&gt; thanks to new Intel and AMD chips, and while they’re still a good bit fatter and with shorter battery life than the Nintendo Switch, they’re getting more efficient and powerful every year. I’ve been testing an early version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/18/22237379/aya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison"&gt;Aya Neo&lt;/a&gt; for months, and it’s been a great companion for&lt;em&gt; Persona 4 Golden &lt;/em&gt;couch sessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kiN6Pi"&gt;We have many burning questions, though, like whether the Linux gaming ecosystem (and perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20952028/steam-valve-code-stadia-xcloud-cloud-gaming-service-competitor-streaming"&gt;streaming games&lt;/a&gt;) are compelling enough to sell people on a dedicated portable, and whether Valve will do what it takes to make such a system succeed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TeANXc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data="{&amp;quot;stories&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;We play with the Steam Machine, Valve's game console of the future&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5063760/we-try-the-steam-machine-valves-video-game-console-of-the-future&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Steam Machines are here: how Alienware is realizing Valve's console dream&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5281824/steam-machines-are-here-how-alienware-is-realizing-valve-console-dream&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Don't buy a Steam Machine&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/5/8733139/valve-steam-machine-half-baked&amp;quot;}]}"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="X7XD6A"&gt;The original Steam Machines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/5/8733139/valve-steam-machine-half-baked"&gt;failed for a wide variety of reasons&lt;/a&gt;, including a lack of exclusive titles and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/10/5295632/valve-steam-machines-at-ces-2014"&gt;a lack of control over partners&lt;/a&gt; that were allowed to build boxes that didn’t make sense, but Valve’s own hardware game was pretty strong: I poured one out for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price"&gt;the Steam Controller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/19/18103672/valve-discontinues-steam-link-streaming-set-top-box"&gt;Steam Link&lt;/a&gt; respectively a few years back, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102584/valve-index-steamvr-headset-review-shipping-today"&gt;the Valve Index&lt;/a&gt; is still considered the top-tier PC VR headset for a variety of reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CiqruJ"&gt;If Valve builds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20976012/half-life-alyx-valve-series-future"&gt;more of its own games&lt;/a&gt; and takes an active role in optimizing for such a system, I’d definitely be interested. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The affordable Nokia G10 is coming to the US with a great support policy </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-oi9I7P-KVhAD_xvug49ZfCuhVc=/0x0:3242x2161/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340974/nokia_G10_DTC_DESIGN_desktop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia G10 offers big battery life and two years of Android OS platform updates.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BvUpmj"&gt;HMD’s Nokia G10 is coming to the US with a big battery, a low $149 price, and a surprisingly good security support schedule. &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/nokia-g10-price-release-date-availability-us_id132341"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phone Arena&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the G10 — &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Android-Unlocked-Smartphone-6-52-Inch/dp/B093QPTSK7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for preorder&lt;/a&gt; now at Amazon — will go on sale directly through Nokia’s website later this week. The G10 was first announced in Europe last month alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22371937/hmd-nokia-x20-x10-g20-g10-c20-c10-android-phones-release-date-news-features"&gt;five other midrange devices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjuST1"&gt;Low-cost Android phones aren’t typically known for great software support. It’s common for manufacturers to offer only two years of security updates on an infrequent schedule and typically just one (or no) OS platform updates. HMD is breaking with that norm by offering two years of OS platform updates — Android 12 and 13 in this case — and three years of security updates, a policy that should see the G10 through a few years of use. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bR8p2017Y-BtAPtfc8-gQQNjAqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539021/nokia_G10_emotional_range.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia G10 is offered in the “dusk” color pictured here as well as a dark blue “night” flavor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jElELM"&gt;The Nokia G10’s other specs include a 6.5-inch 720p display, huge 5,050mAh battery, MediaTek G25 chipset with 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and a 13-megapixel rear camera accompanied by 2-megapixel macro and depth sensors. It’s expected to go on sale Thursday, May 27th at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nokia.com%2Fphones%2Fen_int%2Fnokia-g-10&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22453332%2Fhmd-nokia-g10-price-availability-security-updates" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nokia.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A courtroom artist’s view of the Epic v. Apple trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tim Cook gestures evocatively towards Judge Yvonne Gonzales Rogers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lE7uk8cn9Jacg8XaD-oZq211HyA=/0x220:3557x2591/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340850/IMG_2803.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Drawn by Vicki Behringer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Eight of the artist’s favorite sketches from the three-week court proceeding&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="nMUQgm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Monday, lawyers &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452035/epic-apple-antitrust-trial-final-arguments"&gt;&lt;em&gt;gave final statements in the &lt;/em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;em&gt; case&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, finishing up just over three weeks of in-court proceedings that gave an unprecedented look at how Apple manages the iOS App Store. Both images and audio from the proceedings were tightly controlled (as is often the case in federal courtrooms), so the only images came from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://courtroomartist.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;courtroom artist Vicki Behringer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, who saw much of the trial from an assigned seat to the right of the jury box. We invited Behringer to share eight of her favorite sketches from the trial, showing off both her skill as an artist and her unique perspective on the case. -Russell Brandom, policy editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Katherine Forrest gives opening remarks at the Epic v. Apple trial" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZ6LAdpYyhSupMzmAg25GAvxIrs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539000/image0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mJW8Rx"&gt;This shows opening statements by Epic Games attorney Katherine Forrest. It was my first day at the trial and my first sketch. There were plexiglass barriers all around the courtroom as a COVID precaution, and the attorneys wore plastic shields covering their faces. When I saw this graphic, showing a wall being built around the iPhone, I started to understand what was at stake in this trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Epic CEO Tim Sweeney on the stand, protected by a plexiglass shield." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_abZ_CrHLf6xCQdDHVwojlzuvoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539007/IMG_2808.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L0NiV3"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney is the one that started this whole case, so I knew his testimony was going to be interesting. I just loved listening to how he started the company and what the game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is all about. I had no idea. Once again, I realize there is another entire world that I know nothing about. The programming, creativity, and talent it takes to create these games absolutely amazes me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5YOvO"&gt;I try to finish all my sketches within one to one and a half hours. Some take longer. I have to budget my time while I am sketching in the courtroom. I have very strict deadlines and since the news is now a 24-hour cycle with the internet, my media clients need their sketches as soon as possible to go with their stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PuXpZsG6K41WmVeMzP_ZwhV2Bi0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539001/IMG_2802.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cKUMEo"&gt;I’ve sketched Phil Schiller two or three times now in the &lt;em&gt;Apple v. Samsung&lt;/em&gt; trials, so his face feels like an old friend. I always love hearing him talk about the history of Apple. I took my time here and decided to sketch the entire courtroom. Obviously it is not to scale. The number of people allowed in the courtroom was severely reduced, but there were still many, many attorneys to sketch, and every time a witness changed, they would play musical chairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple executive Mike Schmid appears before the court." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3M03qMJ_AbAmmpOuWKIxL7TnCqY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539005/IMG_2797.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UE5PQ5"&gt;This is Mike Schmid, the head of Apple’s gaming department, questioned by Apple attorney Jay Srinivasan. Seeing as I am not a gamer, all of the wonderful artwork that goes into the games is quite delightful for me, but I had to move so fast that there wasn’t time to sketch it. Schmid was grilled pretty hard on the cross-examination by Epic’s attorney, but at the break they both relaxed and seemed to be happy to see each other. Maybe they were just happy to have gotten through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Craig Federighi addresses the court" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vQz-0e9feCmSqvXeGXrFLgO4Cow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539006/IMG_2801.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rylrYo"&gt;Craig Federighi was a wonderful subject with his perfect white hair and dark eyebrows. People with subtle features are far more difficult, but Craig was a joy. He discussed the precautions that Apple takes to prevent its users from malware, viruses, and the like. I make a mental note to always update my software!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tim Cook gestures evocatively towards Judge Yvonne Gonzales Rogers" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BHtS8KG32XOlDZ9ntO10mjf0C2g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539009/IMG_2803.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Drawn by Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bgvbQi"&gt;I like this sketch because not only did I get a different angle on Tim Cook’s face (which is fantastic), but it was an important moment in his testimony. Judge Gonzalez Rogers was asking some really interesting questions of him which didn’t sound very favorable toward Apple. His confidence seemed to waver just a bit, but he answered the questions clearly and did his best to justify Apple‘s position. It felt like a pivotal point in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erO46K"&gt;I wanted to put in a gesture with the judge’s hand, but didn’t feel I had enough time. Sometimes hands can take as long as drawing the face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An expert witness addresses the court, and a pie chart detailing malware infection data is displayed in the lower left-hand corner of the drawing." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qpeGL-4KRad1JwdY6NRdBdKkUN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539010/IMG_2799.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cjjq7R"&gt;The second week was mostly expert witnesses. I like the sketch because this professor had some interesting things to say about how safe Apple devices were. I know he is an Apple witness, but if his statistics are correct, it’s quite amazing! In the sketch, I added a couple of other people in the courtroom that I usually don’t have time to include. The court reporter and the judge’s deputy. When I am doing an actual trial, I try to make sure I get a sketch of everyone in the courtroom at some point. Everyone is important, even if they are not one of the main attorneys or witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A wider view of Tim Cook’s testimony, including legal representatives from both sides at the edges of the frame." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b15aw8YQ5jmXx36yPYq8PjQ6PZY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539012/IMG_2805.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PxUJ9p"&gt;This is when Tim Cook first took the stand, being questioned on direct by Apple attorney Veronica Moyé. I was so nervous while sketching him because I knew it had to look exactly like him; everyone knows what Tim Cook looks like. I had studied some photographs of him and thought I was ready. Unfortunately, when he took the stand there was a huge reflection on his face shield. I could not see some of the important details. I kept peering through my binoculars waiting for him to turn his head. Finally he did and I was able to get a good view of his face. That was such a relief!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ytbVfv"&gt;I had heard this was his first time taking the stand, but I would never know it. He was quite calm, confident, and charismatic. He said so many positive things about Apple it was easy to like him. Later, I had the opportunity while finishing a sketch of him in the hallway to meet him. He seems to be a very nice man. I was shocked to see he has beautiful blue eyes. I did not realize that while sketching him — between the shadow from the light above, the reflection of his visor, and his glasses, his eyes were obscured. Something tells me I will be sketching him again since there could be more Apple trials in my future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees are going public about workplace issues — and there’s no going back</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Employees say the recent leaks might have changed the tech giant forever&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="hdqgIN"&gt;Even to the workers who wrote the letter, the leaks came as a shock. Apple employees rarely speak to the media, particularly about the company culture. In Silicon Valley, Apple operates with an unprecedented level of secrecy, managing personnel issues and product launches with complete authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWSzRq"&gt;The culture has benefits for employees. People work at Apple because they are design fanatics. The elegant hardware products are seen by many as unmatched in the tech industry. Fewer leaks mean fewer distractions and more time to focus on the work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpoIWU"&gt;The company also has an aura of prestige. Working at Apple is widely seen as the pinnacle of success in the tech industry, even more than the company’s biggest rivals. If Google is a sprawl of creativity and ideas, Apple represents a workplace of organization and vision. People don’t go there for a few months or a year; they stay for decades. The tenure makes employees loyal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcSQsd"&gt;So it was surprising, to some, when the company hired Antonio García Martínez, a former product manager at Facebook who’d written a tell-all book about Silicon Valley. García Martínez’s tone in the book was brash and misogynistic — it didn’t match with Apple’s carefully managed public image and commitment to diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXCzDg"&gt;After he arrived, multiple female Apple employees went public about their concerns on Twitter — a rarity at a company where employees are discouraged from sharing their opinions about work. “I have been gutted, as many other folks at Apple were, with the hiring of Antonio García Martínez,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1392618677644767238"&gt;wrote Apple engineer Cher Scarlett&lt;/a&gt;. “I believe in the strength of community we have at Apple, &amp;amp; that the culture we’ve built can weather this. I also believe in leadership to do the right thing, whatever that is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wSWOAJ"&gt;Then, a group of workers wrote a letter calling for an investigation. “Given Mr. García Martínez’s history of publishing overtly racist and sexist remarks about his former colleagues, we are concerned that his presence at Apple will contribute to an unsafe working environment for our colleagues who are at risk of public harassment and private bullying,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAfjZf"&gt;Within hours, the letter had well over 1,000 signatures. It was leaked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That evening, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433437/apple-hire-antonio-garcia-martinez-out-petition-investigation"&gt;García Martínez was fired&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="23NoeK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Either somebody is a very good actor or there’s someone else who felt like the letter was going to disappear unless it became public.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qAV2X6"&gt;The events stunned even the letter writers. They’d expected the note to cause a stir inside Apple, but they hadn’t intended for it to become public. “The leak was very shocking to everybody who was vocal and involved in writing the letter,” says one worker who asked to remain anonymous for fear of professional retaliation. “Either somebody is a very good actor or there’s someone else who felt like the letter was going to disappear unless it became public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWpPLf"&gt;A week after &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; published the García Martínez letter, a group of Muslim employees at Apple penned a note calling for the company to release a statement in support of Palestine. When Tim Cook didn’t respond, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446059/apple-employees-palestinians-support-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;the letter was leaked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btgiYM"&gt;The two letters, and their leaks, are signs of a slow cultural shift at Apple. Employees, once tight-lipped about internal problems, are now joining a wave of public dissent that’s roiling Silicon Valley. Employees say this is partly because Apple’s typical avenues for reporting don’t work for big cultural issues. They also note the company rolled out Slack in 2019, allowing workers to find and organize with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDwuVf"&gt;Now, some are beginning to feel that the company culture has harmed diversity and inclusion efforts. “Apple’s secrecy works great for protecting our customers and our products, but it hinders inclusion and diversity,” says an anonymous employee. “There’s a lack of education around what is confidential versus what is your protected speech and you should speak up about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7BYeP"&gt;Public organizing, particularly on social media, has been enormously successful in Silicon Valley, allowing workers to wrestle power away from management. At Google, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/technology/google-forced-arbitration.html"&gt;it’s led the company to end forced arbitration for all full-time employees&lt;/a&gt;. At Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;it’s spawned massive unionizing campaigns&lt;/a&gt;. Now, it seems to be Apple’s turn. “Suddenly at Apple, as everywhere else, managers can only stand back and watch as workers reshape the bounds of what will be permitted at work,” &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-hire-that-roiled-apple?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0MzY0NzEsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM2MzgyMjIwLCJfIjoieUhrVDgiLCJpYXQiOjE2MjE4Nzk1NTcsImV4cCI6MTYyMTg4MzE1NywiaXNzIjoicHViLTc5NzYiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.OrzoB0_ydpKdfXH27yXSKixg4BC4YNvkEg0aRslStko"&gt;wrote Casey Newton, founder and editor of &lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dkfvxs"&gt;There’s no sign the leaks will extend to Apple’s product launches. This is the part of the business that Apple cares about most — and it has gone to great lengths to dissuade employees from leaking. In 2018, the company &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/apple-warns-employees-to-stop-leaking-information-to-media?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;sent out a note threatening to fire and even sue workers who shared product information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAbGT3"&gt;The company also has a structure in place to prevent employees from sharing — or even finding out about — product information before it’s public. Employees sign project-specific NDAs and are dissuaded from telling their spouses about their work. Their badges only open certain doors at the company’s Cupertino, California headquarters. Prior to the pandemic, most engineers were barred from taking products in development home from the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwufxD"&gt;The culture of secrecy has bled over into many aspects of Apple’s culture. But employees say it is enforced more through norms than through rules. “The habit of secrecy is self-enforcing once established,” an anonymous employee says. Most of the time, problems are escalated internally and quietly resolved without the public ever finding out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CdElUJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How do you report someone who has done something, but hasn’t done something to you specifically?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JERiFA"&gt;That didn’t happen when García Martínez was hired at Apple. Female employees weren’t sure who would care about their concerns. “For women, it was especially sensitive because the things that were being highlighted [from &lt;em&gt;Chaos Monkeys] &lt;/em&gt;were all very misogynistic, so it felt very personal, but at the same time, who do you report it to?” asked an anonymous worker. “How do you report someone who has done something, but hasn’t done something to you specifically?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AjuKx4"&gt;Apple employees are quick to point out that they’ve been organizing internally for years. In 2020, they pushed the company to move away from using the terms “master” and “slave” in engineering contexts where one process controlled another, part of an &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tech-confronts-use-labels-master-slave/"&gt;industry-wide shift away from the labels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K8h1YG"&gt;They also called for Election Day and Juneteenth to become paid company holidays in a letter last year. “Apple is one of the most influential companies in the world,” they wrote. “While there is undeniable momentum behind the Black Lives Matter civil rights movement, we can and should be setting a better standard for other companies to follow. We believe we have an opportunity with Election Days to be a leader that forges ahead of the rest.” The push was largely successful. On July 24th, 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-24/apple-to-give-employees-paid-time-off-to-vote-in-u-s-election?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; the company was giving workers four hours off to vote on Election Day. Employees in the United States get Juneteenth off this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NVAHl"&gt;Apple management might not love what is happening — it’s not very Apple-y, after all — but if employees maintain their secrecy surrounding its products, the firm might not care enough to crack down. Workers can tweet about Apple, just not Apple products. And they likely will: as one anonymous employee told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in the wake of the García Martínez letter, “I think this has forever changed the culture of Apple.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1U7ks"&gt;Apple declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Knockout City’s virtual dodgeball is even more chaotic than the real thing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y93kAWQn4-0xenv35RTr3JBerhc=/114x0:1341x818/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340785/koc_screenshot_16x9_5.jpg.adapt.crop16x9.818p.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Knockout City. | Image: EA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9hIWFL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; took me back to childhood games of dodgeball with a single sound: “whumphf!” That one noise, which you’ll hear a lot as dodgeballs bounce every which way, represents just how well the game’s virtual version of dodgeball mimics the real thing — including all of the chaos you might remember from games on the playground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tSMFn9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; is made by EA and &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit&lt;/em&gt; developer Velan Studios, and its primary mode involves three-on-three matches against online opponents. In each match, you’ll scoop up dodgeballs littered around the city-themed maps and launch them at your unsuspecting targets. When you charge up a throw, the game automatically locks onto a target, meaning you don’t have to worry about precise aim. &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; is more about timing your shots to try to catch your opponent off-guard, which the game encourages by letting you do things like curve or feint a shot to mix up your tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FrY0Cg0qt15oG7YdBi0DDR4wSm8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22538721/koc_screenshot_16x9_1.jpg.adapt.crop16x9.818p.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: EA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Somebody catching a ball in Knockout City.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wUsmR4"&gt;Like in real dodgeball, though, a key part of &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just throwing the ball, but also catching it, which you can do with a well-timed press of a trigger. And if you do catch a thrown ball, it will fly a little faster when you next throw it. I love trying to time catches. It adds &lt;em&gt;Paper Mario&lt;/em&gt;-like timing to battles (though at a much faster pace) and forces you to think more about your positioning not just for offense, but for defense as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvK2Qu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; also offers some fantastical elements that you won’t find in real-life dodgeball. Each match has a special type of dodgeball with unique powers, like a bomb ball that explodes on impact. My favorite was the multiball, which gives you three dodgeballs right at your fingertips, kind of like the triple shell item in &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3l2kHN"&gt;And at any time, you can turn &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt; into a ball so your teammates can scoop you up and toss you at an opponent for a quick knockout. Balling up for a teammate is almost like handing them a present — one they can launch at an unsuspecting person at high velocity — and it’s a great tool to assist your teammates whenever you want, without any communication required. Be warned, though, your enemies can also pick you up when you’re in ball form, meaning they might just throw you off the map for an easy point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ymh8dw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DJVyyojmY1E?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ybluW9"&gt;Like real games of in-person dodgeball, there’s often a lot going on in &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt;. That can make it easy to lose track of things and get knocked out by a shot you didn’t see coming. And occasionally, matches can have long lulls where you’re running around the map by yourself, dodgeball in hand, hunting for an opponent. Sometimes I wish the maps were just a bit smaller to force more confrontations. But at their best, &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; matches are fun and chaotic. Dodgeballs flying left and right will keep you, your teammates, and your opponents in a thrilling dance of dodging, catching, throwing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkF5CN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just about outsmarting your opponents in dodgeball, though; the game also gives you lots of ways to customize your character, including the clothes they’re wearing and even your victory pose. You can earn more cosmetics from completing in-game challenges, leveling up your “street rank” (which is like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass), or by buying them from the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-like in-game store.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YFazOyhPf813w4kvlmrSYM7MjR8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22538729/koc_launch_crew_screenshot_16x9.jpg.adapt.crop16x9.818p.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: EA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s all sorts of ways to customize your character.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D3C7tG"&gt;If you want to check out &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt;, EA is offering the full version of the game for free until May 30th on every platform where it’s available, which includes PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; supports both crossplay and cross-progression, so you can play with your friends no matter what platform they’re on and bring your progress over to other platforms. After the trial ends, the game will cost $19.99 — though if you have an EA Play or an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, you’ll have access to the game with one of those, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZPi59"&gt;While it’s free, I highly recommend giving &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; a chance. I think it really captures the feeling of playing dodgeball in video game form — and it feels so good when you nail a game-winning shot with a satisfying “whumphf.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0f5RAP"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Knockout City &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available now on the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7gfaa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Electric vehicle startups hit speed bumps after raising tons of cash</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XYr1cLpiD36BJO1-dsWkbVs05Hg=/0x2:1926x1286/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340719/PQBU5ZZ2RBFZDJCY3QZKFRLHA4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lordstown Motors&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8d1vKO"&gt;Electric vehicle startups have raised an absurd amount of money in the last year by merging with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition companies&lt;/a&gt;, or SPACs. That money — billions of dollars, collectively — was supposed to be enough to help each of them start fighting for space in a market dominated by Tesla. But many of these startups are still having trouble getting rolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OConG1"&gt;EV startup struggles are not new. Most of the ones focused on passenger vehicles that are still around spent years grappling with the inherent, unavoidable difficulties of automotive manufacturing. Now, though, the bruises of that fight are developing in broad daylight — all while they try to beat deep-pocketed legacy automakers to the punch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="41S2B5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Startups going public makes it much easier to see where the problems are&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vc2GTr"&gt;Ohio-based Lordstown Motors raised nearly $700 million when it went public late last year and has backing from America’s largest automaker, General Motors. But it’s spending faster than expected — it lost $125 million in the first quarter — and on Tuesday, the company said it needs more cash in order to hit its goal of making its first 2,200 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302966/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-truck-ev-endurance-unveiling-pence"&gt;electric pickup trucks&lt;/a&gt; by the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1Kajx"&gt;California-based Canoo went public in December and has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;replaced its leadership team&lt;/a&gt;. The new one has upended the startup’s business model and largely thrown out the projections that were used to raise &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev"&gt;around $600 million during last year’s merger with a SPAC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWiuTn"&gt;Startups that have announced SPAC mergers but have yet to complete them have run into some trouble, too. Lucid Motors again delayed the release of its luxury electric sedan, the Air, in order to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-25/lucid-motors-ceo-rawlinson-confronts-havoc-in-supply-chain"&gt;address quality assurance issues raised by its investors&lt;/a&gt;. When it does go public, the California startup is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;looking to add $4.4 billion&lt;/a&gt; to the sizable war chest it started building when Saudi Arabia pledged some $1.3 billion in exchange for majority control in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivwOb0"&gt;Another California EV startup working on a luxury electric vehicle, Faraday Future, is set to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22247942/faraday-future-spac-merger-public-psac-property-solutions-nasdaq"&gt;raise $1 billion when its own SPAC merger is complete&lt;/a&gt;. But this week, Faraday Future &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805521/000121390021028758/ea141550-8k_property.htm"&gt;told investors&lt;/a&gt; that it needs to recalculate basically all of the financial projections it made so far in order to follow new guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other startups have had to make similar adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="iME4JD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The pandemic has only made things harder&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EB8zrV"&gt;Some of these problems are the result of bad timing. These companies are trying to debut vehicles at a time when the pandemic has put a ton of stress on the automotive supply chain. Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson told &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-25/lucid-motors-ceo-rawlinson-confronts-havoc-in-supply-chain"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday that “COVID has wrecked havoc with our process.” On Tuesday, Lordstown Motors &lt;a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the pandemic has created “significantly higher than expected expenditures for parts/equipment, expedited shipping costs, and expenses associated with third-party engineering resources.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="krArAu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10368711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JTue46"&gt;But these startups also rushed to become public companies so they could take advantage of the deluge of money during the SPAC merger boom. That has left them scrambling to cope with the demands of being listed on a major stock exchange. On Canoo’s first earnings call as a publicly traded company, for example, an analyst called out the startup’s head of investor relations for not returning emails. In response, CEO Tony Aquila admitted to the team being “overwhelmed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rs6HZC"&gt;Not all of the side effects of this rush to market have been so frivolous, though. Nearly all of these startups have disclosed so-called “material weaknesses” in their internal financial practices in filings with the SEC. Faraday Future &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001805521/000121390021020004/fs42021_propertysolutions.htm"&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; that, among other things, it “did not design and maintain effective controls for communicating and sharing information between the legal and accounting and finance departments,” and that it was not able to “address the identification of and accounting for certain non-routine, unusual or complex transactions” — which is notable considering the startup’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;well-documented history&lt;/a&gt; with unusual and complex financial transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99y3gx"&gt;Fisker Inc., which raised $1 billion in its own merger last year, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001720990/000119312520313931/d92481d424b3.htm"&gt;admitted to weaknesses&lt;/a&gt; in its	“risk assessment process, including as it relates to fraud risks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33zVJJ"&gt;What’s more, multiple electric vehicle startups are now under government investigation. The SEC is probing Lordstown Motors over claims that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;misrepresented the number of preorders for its trucks&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441025/canoo-sec-investigation-spac-merger-projections"&gt;investigating Canoo’s SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the recent executive departures. Both the SEC and the Department of Justice have opened investigations into hydrogen trucking startup Nikola, which was one of the earliest electric vehicle companies to go public in a SPAC merger. And if that weren’t enough, all of these startups have been hit with multiple securities fraud lawsuits from shareholders alleging they were misled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Jbt8U6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More money, more problems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JqSUZf"&gt;Only Lordstown Motors and Lucid Motors remain committed to starting production by the end of 2021, which means most of these startups are still a long way away from generating revenue, let alone turning a profit. The only exception so far is Fisker Inc., which sold $22,000 worth of merchandise in the first quarter — though the cost of those sales was $17,000, meaning the company netted just $5,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L32lCA"&gt;Without any near-term revenue, these EV startups are now in a sort of race to get into production before their massive piles of cash run out. And some are already looking for more help, buoyed by the fact that many of them were able to use funds from the SPAC mergers to wipe out any existing debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nohMTU"&gt;Fisker Inc. founder Henrik Fisker has already said he is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-25/fisker-says-ocean-suv-production-is-on-schedule-for-late-2022"&gt;open to borrowing money&lt;/a&gt; to make sure his company meets a late 2022 production target. Lordstown Motors said Tuesday that it is looking to borrow against some of its assets (which include a former GM factory and equipment). It’s also talking to strategic investors and is in the running for a loan from the Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program, from which Tesla once borrowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="itsmtM"&gt;If the startup isn’t able to raise more money, Lordstown Motors CEO Steve Burns said it will have to cut its production target to around 1,000 trucks this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="GfLgwF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We wanted to make sure everybody knew the worst, worst case”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoQ7zf"&gt;“We wanted to make sure everybody knew the worst, worst case is we are still making pickup trucks this year,” Burns said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BiEstR"&gt;Lordstown Motors is especially under pressure, as the startup is focused on making and selling its electric pickup, the Endurance, exclusively to commercial customers. But Ford not only just revealed an all-electric version of its bestselling truck, the F-150, it also showed off a fleet-focused version with a cheaper base price than the Endurance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5APYcO"&gt;Burns, without mentioning the Detroit automaker or its new truck by name, said this week the F-150 Lightning launch helped prove that electric pickups are now a “mainstream” idea. He remained confident that Lordstown Motors could beat Ford to market, as the Lightning is not supposed to go on sale until the first half of 2022. But, he said, it “would be crushing to have the lead, have a first market mover, and not be able to fulfill [that goal].” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden opens up California coast to offshore wind</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-ENERGY-ELECTRICITY-WIND" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SLMDjoX-vhqi9iLmeIGmoiymT0M=/595x0:3790x2130/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340587/614802192.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Wind turbines, of the Block Island Wind Farm, tower above the water on October 14, 2016 off the shores of Block Island, Rhode Island. The first offshore wind project in the US has created more than 300 construction jobs and will deliver the electricity demands for the entire island. / AFP / DON EMMERT | Photo credit should read DON EMMERT/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ATGuxM"&gt;Offshore wind is headed west. The Biden administration announced today that it will open up parts of the Pacific coast to commercial-scale offshore renewable energy development for the first time. The geography of the West Coast poses huge technical challenges for wind energy. But rising to meet those challenges is a big opportunity for both President Joe Biden and California Governor Gavin Newsom to meet their clean energy goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUawUQ"&gt;There are two areas now slotted for development off the coast of Central and Northern California&lt;strong&gt; — &lt;/strong&gt;one at Morro Bay and another near Humboldt County. Together, these areas could generate up to 4.6GW of energy, enough power for 1.6 million homes over the next decade, according to a White House &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/25/fact-sheet-biden-administration-opens-pacific-coast-to-new-jobs-and-clean-energy-production-with-offshore-wind-development/"&gt;fact sheet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hwPek4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A clean energy future is within our grasp”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BN4rQ8"&gt;“I believe that a clean energy future is within our grasp in the United States, but it will take all of us and the best-available science to make it happen,” Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland said in a statement today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FscKj"&gt;Joe Biden set a goal of getting the nation to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419206/smart-grid-renewable-energy-power-sector"&gt;100 percent clean electricity by 2035&lt;/a&gt; in a race to avoid falling deeper into a global climate crisis. Biden also wants to transition the entire US economy to clean energy by 2050. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VF96al"&gt;California has a similar economy-wide clean energy &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/9/11/17844896/california-jerry-brown-carbon-neutral-2045-climate-change"&gt;deadline for 2045&lt;/a&gt;. Newsom called today’s offshore wind announcement “historic” and “game-changing” for California in a statement and press call today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jG2669"&gt;To reach his bigger targets, Biden plans to scale up offshore wind energy capacity from just 42 megawatts today to &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/29/fact-sheet-biden-administration-jumpstarts-offshore-wind-energy-projects-to-create-jobs/"&gt;30,000 by 2030&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430981/offshore-wind-farm-commercial-scale-federal-approval-vineyard-wind-massachusetts"&gt;first commercial-scale offshore wind farm&lt;/a&gt; received federal approval earlier this month. There are more than a dozen more projects waiting for approval, all of which are off the East Coast of the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nAxRi"&gt;Compared to the East Coast, waters off the West Coast get deeper much faster. That has stymied offshore wind development. So the White House says it’s looking into deploying pretty futuristic technology there: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22448187/ge-floating-turbine-offshore-wind-farm-energy"&gt;floating wind farms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="F4m7Rm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Deploying pretty futuristic technology &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6sCPS8"&gt;Until now, technical constraints have generally prevented companies from installing turbines that are fixed to the seafloor in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;waters more than 60 meters deep. That’s left nearly 60 percent of offshore wind resources out of reach, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2020/floating-offshore-wind-rises.html"&gt;the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)&lt;/a&gt;. With the development of new technologies that could let wind turbines float in deeper waters, it looks like those resources might finally be within reach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFFZzX"&gt;The Department of Energy says that it has funneled more than $100 million into moving floating offshore wind technology forward. There are only a handful of floating turbines in operation today, and no commercial-scale wind farms yet anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVZJQ6"&gt;The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management still needs to officially designate the areas off the California coast as &lt;a href="https://www.boem.gov/renewable-energy/state-activities/what-wind-energy-area-wea#:~:text=Renewable%20Energy-,What%20Is%20A%20Wind%20Energy%20Area%20(WEA)%3F,apparent%20environmental%20and%20user%20conflicts."&gt;Wind Energy Areas&lt;/a&gt; for development and complete an environmental analysis. The plan is to auction off leases for the area to developers in mid-2022. It’s also working with the Department of Defense to make sure the projects don’t interfere with its ongoing “testing, training, and operations” off California’s coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lf8XP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJOZrf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NHicP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5tl1Wz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first trailer for Last Night in Soho shows a neon-filled time-traveling ghost story</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/InhHiG_0GU_g1XL097cteNp4FrY=/159x0:3312x2102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340273/Screen_Shot_2021_05_25_at_9.53.10_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Focus Features&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9twlIf"&gt;Being a young person in the city is hard enough without being haunted by a cabaret singer from the 1960s, but that’s exactly what Thomasin McKenzie (&lt;em&gt;Jojo Rabbit)&lt;/em&gt; appears to be dealing with in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/edgarwright/status/1397205817879928835?s=20"&gt;the first trailer for Edgar Wright’s &lt;em&gt;Last Night in Soho&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The film is set to premiere in theaters in October, but the trailer seems like a nice taste of Wright’s clever style through a horror lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKw9HQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last Night in Soho &lt;/em&gt;follows McKenzie as Eloise, a young fashion fan who seemingly has the ability to dream herself into the past. The problem is she isn’t herself when she visits London’s West End in the 1960s; she’s Anya Taylor-Joy’s Sandy, a singer who, if the trailer is anything to go by, probably shouldn’t be dating whoever Matt Smith is playing (“Jack,” &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9639470/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast"&gt;according to IMDb&lt;/a&gt;). Things take a turn toward the ghostly from there as the past bleeds into the present. It turns out dreaming you’re Taylor-Joy isn’t as chill as I assumed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bsxyCi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tB9WUIv9KH8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C6nF9F"&gt;The film’s distributor, Focus Features, describes &lt;em&gt;Last Night in Soho&lt;/em&gt; as a “psychological thriller,” which is a notable change of pace from Wright’s usual preference for action and comedy. Wright’s toyed with horror before in &lt;em&gt;Shaun of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;, but the &lt;em&gt;Soho&lt;/em&gt; trailer, with its neon reds and blues and focus on knives and / or stabbing is also harkening back to popular Italian “giallo” horror films — specifically the work of director Dario Argento, even more specifically, his 1977 film &lt;em&gt;Suspiria&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RyaSIf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18011868/suspiria-movie-review-dakota-johnson-luca-guadagnino-remake-2018"&gt;The 2018 remake of &lt;em&gt;Suspiria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;leaned more into the gruesome body horror of “what if witches ran a dance school?” (In short, bodies can twist in horrifying ways.) But where that film didn’t really pick up Argento’s love of dramatic lighting and synths, Wright seems primed to at least carry forward some of that mantle with &lt;em&gt;Last Night in Soho.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDk7mS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last Night in Soho&lt;/em&gt; will hit theaters in October, with a more specific release date to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3cXVi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now buy Asus’ gaming-ready ROG Phone 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k21J-gQWk1woZxBGM5nLi9PVksc=/0x0:1875x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340185/Screen_Shot_2021_05_25_at_9.54.34_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3x5FZD"&gt;Asus’ ROG Phone 5 is now available in the US &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202105AM210000001/ROG5-ASUS-ROG-Phone-5---6.78%E2%80%9D-FHD%2B-2448x1080-HDR-144Hz-Display---6000mAh-Dual-Cell-Battery---64MP%2F13MP%2F5MP-Triple-Camera-with-24MP-Front-Camera-%E2%80%9316GB-RAM---256GB-Storage-5G-LTE-Unlocked-Dual-SIM-Cell-Phone"&gt;from its official store&lt;/a&gt;, with a price tag of $999.99. It’s Asus’ latest maxed-out gaming phone, with all of the top-notch specifications: a Snapdragon 888 Plus, 144Hz display, front-facing speakers, and a massive 6,000mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpw3uf"&gt;Asus says the Ultimate and Pro versions of the phone will be available later this year. We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;reviewed the Ultimate in March&lt;/a&gt; and found that it was a good phone that went a little — okay, maybe a lot — overboard with its specs. The vanilla version available for sale today, though, is perhaps a bit more reasonable: it “only” has 16GB of RAM (as opposed to the Ultimate’s 18GB), has half the storage (256GB instead of 512GB), and features an RGB logo on the back instead of an entire OLED screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CpyEWY"&gt;The other thing the regular version is missing is the extra touch-sensitive buttons that provide an alternative to touchscreen controls (though it does still have two of the ultrasonic sensors). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csxmTC"&gt;For those who want more buttons, though, there’s always &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202105AM250000006/ROG5-ASUS-ROG-Phone-5-and-Gamepad-Bundle"&gt;the gamepad bundle&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202105AM220000003/ROG5-ASUS-ROG-AeroActive-Cooler-5"&gt;AeroActive Cooler 5 accessory&lt;/a&gt;, which has two buttons built in. They do cost extra — with the gamepad bundle coming in at $40 more than just the phone and the cooler costing $70 — but that’s still likely going to be way less than shelling out for the Ultimate version.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft teases a ‘next generation of Windows’ announcement ‘very soon’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FTshAnN9c8ArmLLCFFEBURqpyCk=/170x0:1430x840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340125/Windows_10_Sun_Valley_refresh.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g9eIsg"&gt;Microsoft isn’t talking about its big Windows plans at Build 2021 this week, and that’s because the company is preparing to detail what’s next for its PC operating system separately. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella teased this announcement during his Build keynote this morning, revealing he has been testing “the next generation of Windows” in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qeVKgM"&gt;“Soon we will share one of the most significant updates to Windows of the past decade to unlock greater economic opportunity for developers and creators. I’ve been self-hosting it over the past several months, and I’m incredibly excited about the next generation of Windows. Our promise to you is this: we will create more opportunity for every Windows developer today and welcome every creator who is looking for the most innovative, new, open platform to build and distribute and monetize applications. We look forward to sharing more very soon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="iMG5Mx"&gt;Microsoft has been working on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393655/microsoft-windows-app-store-overhaul-apps-games-rumor"&gt;new app store for Windows&lt;/a&gt; in recent months, alongside some significant UI changes to the operating system. Nadella appears to reference the store changes here, with a promise to unlock a better economy for developers and creators within Windows itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wrewyG"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label='Microsoft teases "next generation" of Windows|102301' data-volume-uuid="3c11e080c" data-volume-id="102301" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-397" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OwDOtX"&gt;This will likely include some significant changes to the Windows Store, allowing developers to submit any Windows application — including browsers like Chrome or Firefox. Rumors have suggested Microsoft may even allow third-party commerce platforms in apps, so developers could avoid Microsoft’s own 15 percent cut on apps and 12 percent cut on games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtSptU"&gt;Nadella’s specific mention of a “next generation of Windows” is interesting, too. Microsoft typically refers to everything as “Windows 10,” and this language could suggest the company is preparing a more significant shift with Windows branding than just the user interface alone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0wK5hIBQpwDqXN5Oh6VdVEkH-SY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19247642/akrales_190930_3649_0349.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 10X was supposed to ship this year before it was canceled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Pn6KYs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442421/microsoft-windows-10-x-canceled-official"&gt;Microsoft confirmed last week&lt;/a&gt; that Windows 10X, its OS originally built for dual-screen devices, will no longer ship. The software maker is now bringing the best bits of Windows 10X, a simplified version of Windows, into the main version of Windows 10 instead. We’re expecting to see some significant UI changes to Windows under something codenamed “Sun Valley.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HedK09"&gt;Some of that work has already started, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313037/microsoft-windows-10-new-system-icons-ui-overhaul-sun-valley"&gt;new system icons&lt;/a&gt;, File Explorer improvements, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422553/microsoft-windows-95-era-icons-removal-windows-10-update-sun-valley"&gt;end of Windows 95-era icons&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is also focusing on improving the basic foundations of Windows, with fixes for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407995/microsoft-windows-apps-rearranging-sleep-resume-fix-directx-12"&gt;rearranging apps issue&lt;/a&gt; on multiple monitors, the addition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336240/microsoft-windows-10-auto-hdr-pc-gaming-directx-11-12"&gt;Xbox Auto HDR feature&lt;/a&gt;, and improvements to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410088/microsoft-windows-10-bluetooth-aac-support-update"&gt;Bluetooth audio support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CiQ8hb"&gt;Nadella says we’ll hear more about the future of Windows “very soon,” so we’d expect some type of announcement or event in the coming weeks ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
