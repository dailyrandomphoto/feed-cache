    <title>Why smartwatch-measured blood pressure still isn’t ‘ready for primetime’ </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Cardiologists are looking forward to the future of blood pressure tech — but the field still needs to catch up&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="as9z79"&gt;It’s been over two years since Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18236373/samsung-galaxy-watch-blood-pressure-monitoring-health-fda"&gt;first announced&lt;/a&gt; that its Galaxy Watch would be able to measure people’s blood pressure. The feature is available in a number of countries, including South Korea, but not in the United States — the company is still awaiting Food and Drug Administration clearance. In the meantime, other smartwatch companies have started experimenting with blood pressure tech in a bid for monitors on their devices. Fitbit &lt;a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/fitbit-study-blood-pressure/"&gt;announced a study&lt;/a&gt; trialing a blood pressure monitor in April, and Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652120/apple-watch-blood-pressure-temperature-sleep-diabetes"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; working on its own version, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TCjjb"&gt;Adding a blood pressure monitor to smartwatches could arguably be more important for users’ cardiovascular health than the heart rate and rhythm monitors they have now, says says Ann Marie Navar, a cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. “Blood pressure measurement is something we need to do a lot more a lot of,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QxttbM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re not ready for primetime yet”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rB3WNm"&gt;But it’s still not clear how reliable smartwatch-measured blood pressure could be. Measuring blood pressure is much harder than tracking heart rate and rhythm, and getting it right is arguably even more important. “We’re not ready for primetime yet,” says Jordana Cohen, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania who studies hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ahlwoF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squeeze-free methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rBbhrS"&gt;Having more ways to easily take blood pressure measurements at home could be a big benefit to people with hypertension (high blood pressure) or other concerns. Pressure measurements taken exclusively in a doctor’s office are often unreliable: some people have higher blood pressure in-office because they’re anxious about the visit, while other people have masked hypertension — high blood pressure at home, but normal blood pressure at the doctor. “We don’t pick it up unless we have people check their blood pressures at home,” Navar says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMlcML"&gt;There are plenty of at-home blood pressure cuffs that take the standard approach: a cuff gets strapped onto a patient’s upper arm. Inflating the cuff cuts off blood flow, and the device measures the pressure blood is putting on vessel walls when blood starts flowing again as the compression is released. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A watch displaying blood pressure reading on a person’s wrist." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fL4YZRBaCQ7y9mqa1QgY_h8vNEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22855694/1090712796.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Omron HeartGuide device has a built-in blood pressure cuff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SbciQc"&gt;Right now, there’s one wearable device cleared by the Food and Drug Administration to measure blood pressure: a device from medical equipment company Omron, which has an inflatable cuff inside the band that lets it take blood pressure measurements at the wrist using the traditional squeezing method. Unlike smartwatches that are hoping to add blood pressure to existing tech, Omron’s HeartGuide is extremely specialized. It’s even marketed as “a wearable blood pressure monitor in the innovative form of a wristwatch”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0P4Mj"&gt;Smartwatch companies like Samsung and Fitbit are taking another approach. They are using light sensors on the smartwatches to calculate blood pressure. It’s a big challenge, says Wendy Mendes, a psychophysiologist at the University of California San Francisco who works with Samsung on its tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ma3Gk2"&gt;Samsung’s approach is based on a measure called pulse transit time, which is the time between the contraction of the heart and when the pulse arrives at a particular body part, like the wrist. It’s correlated with blood pressure. “The faster that pulse transit time is, the more the vessels are tightening — that’s what’s making the pulse travel faster,” Mendes says. Optical sensors also check if vessels are tightening or widening. An algorithm then uses those two bits of information, along with heart rate, to estimate blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvomnI"&gt;Fitbit is a few steps further back in the process — it doesn’t have any blood pressure features available but has a handful of &lt;a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/fitbit-study-blood-pressure/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; underway looking at the relationship between the metrics already collected by its devices and blood pressure. They’re focusing on a measure called pulse arrival time. It’s similar to pulse transit time but measures the pulse at a slightly different time than Samsung does, says Eric Friedman, vice president of research at Fitbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A watch sits next to a phone in a photo illustration. The watch has an image of a heart, and text that says “your watch will start measuring automatically” The phone displays a photo of a person wearing a white shirt. One of the person’s arms has a watch, the other has a blood pressure cuff." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPoRBVrFnWmihZUEuogKCGcm-E0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22855654/Samsung_Health_Monitor_App_Blood_Pressure_dl2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A press image of Samsung’s Health Monitor Application with Blood Pressure Measurement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HTc5YB"&gt;There’s a limitation to both of these strategies: generally, they can only reliably measure &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; blood pressure. Mendes could strap a watch on and find out if someone’s blood pressure was higher in the morning than it was when they went to sleep the previous night, but wouldn’t be able to tell what the raw number it started at was without benchmarking the device off of a standard blood pressure cuff. “Almost all of these sensors are going to be good at changes,” she says. “But to get the level, you have to calibrate it.” Samsung suggests users recalibrate the blood pressure monitor on their smartwatches &lt;a href="https://www.wareable.com/samsung/how-to-take-blood-pressure-on-samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-8321#google_vignette"&gt;every four weeks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="op2V2I"&gt;Apple’s blood pressure feature is still in development and has not been formally announced. It would reportedly just give people information on trends in their blood pressure — if it’s increasing or decreasing — rather than a raw measure, which requires the calibration step used by Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-blood-pressure-measure-wrist-thermometer-in-watch-11630501201"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a more realistic approach, Cohen says, because the techniques used in smartwatches are much more capable of detecting relative changes in blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QgRdsB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t have the hubris to view it as something that’s coming out any day now.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3OCqv"&gt;The sensors currently common in smartwatches probably won’t be able to measure blood pressure without calibration against an outside cuff, Mendes says. “I do think it’s possible, but I don’t think the technology is there yet,” she says. It’s a herculean task, Friedman says. “There have been whole books written around why this is an impossible thing to solve,” he says. “I don’t have the hubris to view it as something that’s coming out any day now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GT6h5x"&gt;That’s why Fitbit is taking a broad approach and is considering all the ways it might be able to incorporate pulse arrival time and blood pressure into the data it offers users, Friedman says. Even if companies can’t directly measure blood pressure through a watch, they might be able to use metrics like pulse arrival time to give people information about &lt;em&gt;swings &lt;/em&gt;in their blood pressure (like Apple is reportedly pursuing) or their general fitness levels. “We’re ultimately looking at the maximal health impact we can achieve, and there are a lot of things that would also be quite satisfying,” Friedman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="20GzBr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validating the tech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YoRqfP"&gt;There’s more and more data available on non-cuff blood pressure monitors — movement in the right direction, Navar says. “There’s been a lot of progress in terms of trying to validate that technology against what we would consider more of a gold-standard blood pressure measurement,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWEAzu"&gt;Right now, the only way to access Samsung’s blood pressure feature in the US is through Mendes’ research program at the University of California San Francisco, &lt;a href="https://mybplab.com/"&gt;My BP Lab&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks stress and blood pressure. The team asked 123 participants to spend a week taking blood pressure readings using both a blood pressure cuff and a Samsung Note 9 phone (which includes the same sensor as the smartwatches). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FNrT8M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s so, so important that we get it right,”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hurdvY"&gt;The analysis, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8346904/"&gt;published in July&lt;/a&gt;, found that the blood pressures calculated by the Samsung device had “moderate to strong agreement” with pressures measured by an FDA-approved cuff. The results were about as close together as the results from two different FDA-approved cuffs were each other, Mendes says. The results held for people of varying skin tones and ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oy5FiS"&gt;Navar hopes to see public data on devices made by companies like Fitbit and Apple, as well. “We’ve seen companies really hold themselves to a higher standard, and I think the clinical research community is really demanding it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSNIEW"&gt;Still, Cohen says the data available so far isn’t enough to make her confident in blood pressure tracked through a smartwatch. “I wouldn’t recommend somebody use it to diagnose hypertension or for monitoring or treatment of high blood pressure. Not yet,” she says.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Fitbit Sense" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ItrQXnja0IvpfQnm2hCerg1ojA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21812132/sense2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fitbit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitbit wearables don’t measure blood pressure yet, but the company is studying whether it can use other metrics, like pulse arrival time, to measure people’s blood pressure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kdiN0Z"&gt;It’s important to get right — maybe more important than something like heart rate, Cohen says. “High blood pressure is such a major risk factor for stroke, major cardiac events, and kidney disease,” she says. “It’s so, so important that we get it right, because if devices are giving you an inaccurate reading, you can get very false reassurance that your blood pressure is normal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKOJKj"&gt;Cohen’s seen multiple patients with inaccurate data collected through blood pressure-monitoring wearables purchased overseas, or that don’t make the type of medical claims that would require clearance from the FDA. “I had one patient that had one of those watches that she got from overseas, and she was convinced her blood pressure was perfect,” she says. A monitoring test showed that it was actually 50 points higher than what the watch said. The patient was so reluctant to accept that determination that her care team had to run a second test. “She wouldn’t accept the values,” Cohen says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ll0EGc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have to be cautious”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="isoqp5"&gt;Clinicians will have to carefully examine any new device on the market to make sure it’s working well enough to trust in different groups of people, including people with high or abnormal blood pressure, Navar says. “It may work in someone with totally normal blood vessels, but does it work in an older person who may have stiffer blood vessels? We have to be cautious,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iH02GD"&gt;Blood pressure is relatively easy to double check with a medical-grade cuff at home or in the doctor’s office, Navar says. She’d want to use that as a backup for patients with smartwatches, at least at first. “I’d probably want to make sure that, if somebody is using one of these watches to measure their blood pressure, that we check it against a more standard measure,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="iWZ0yR"&gt;If smartwatches are able to run the validation gauntlet and prove that they can reliably track blood pressure, it could help expand the options people have to manage a health condition at home. “I love the idea of more people checking their blood pressure at home, and anything to help people do that is wonderful,” Cohen says. “But it needs to be accurate or it’s of no value.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTPfhe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjKVR4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Helen Mirren finds a side door into Harry Potter with a new game show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Celebrity Sightings During the Dolce&amp;amp;amp;Gabbana Alta Moda In Venice" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LFscZ1ypEvpwwntEYm1fT_hIX_o=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69868666/1337108167.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hm8PV0"&gt;Dame Helen Mirren is a wizard, reader. Or a witch. Or maybe a concerned Muggle? The details don’t really matter; either way, the Oscar award-winning actress is hosting a new &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; quiz show later this year to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the film series. &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Hogwarts Tournament of Houses &lt;/em&gt;will be simultaneously broadcast on Cartoon Network and TBS, with plans to eventually stream on HBO Max as well, &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/helen-mirren-host-harry-potter-hogwarts-tournament-houses"&gt;WarnerMedia announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ue3WeO"&gt;The four-part special “will unveil Wizarding World fans willing to put their &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; knowledge to the test for the ultimate honor to be named House Cup champion,” according to WarnerMedia. Mirren will shepherd the latest expansion of the &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; franchise and lend “some British grandeur” to the proceedings, adds Tom Ascheim, Warner Bros. president of global kids, young adults, and classics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oy6eTa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Another British film legend checked off the list&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cjvFwP"&gt;In many ways, it was only a matter of time. Across eight films, and now several spinoffs, &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; has featured a majority of the United Kingdom’s stars of stage and screen. It was honestly unusual Mirren hadn’t popped up in some way. Now she can, through an equally unusual game show loophole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbVWlG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Hogwarts Tournament of Houses&lt;/em&gt; is slated to air later this year. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has also reached out to determine when it will hit HBO Max. We’ll update you if we learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenSea’s product chief is out after insider NFT flipping accusations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E4HlSTPy9mIv55UgBqfkRWE6f9I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69868094/acastro_210329_1777_nft_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k5idZc"&gt;OpenSea head of product Nate Chastain, who was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676075/opensea-insider-information-nft-trading-nate-chastain"&gt;recently accused of&lt;/a&gt; a form of NFT insider trading, appears to no longer be working for the company. His Twitter bio now includes the phrase “Past: @opensea.” OpenSea has not publicly named the employee involved in the incident, but CEO Devin Finzer says the NFT trading platform asked for and received their resignation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gv6eC"&gt;Yesterday, Finzer &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/employee-information-use-at-opensea/"&gt;put up a blog post&lt;/a&gt; saying an employee used knowledge gained from working at the company to purchase NFTs that were about to be posted to the popular trading site’s homepage (and would thus likely go up in value). While an investigation is apparently still ongoing, OpenSea does say that it’s implemented clearer rules to prevent employees from doing this kind of thing in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="VMHrQj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="bjhElS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have a strong responsibility to our community, and we take any breach of trust incredibly seriously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We've taken additional steps to address this and are investing in policies that move the space towards greater transparency and openness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Update: &lt;a href="https://t.co/NWExSdThOf"&gt;https://t.co/NWExSdThOf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Devin Finzer (dfinzer.eth) (@dfinzer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dfinzer/status/1438550045293436928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JxI9US"&gt;The incident came to light after the NFT community began digging into transactions in Chastain’s public wallet. Community members, taking advantage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22654785/blockchain-explained-cryptocurrency-what-is-stake-nft"&gt;the blockchain’s openness and semi-transparency&lt;/a&gt;, were able to find transactions that seemed to indicate that he was secretly flipping NFTs. The community members also say that the transactions show that this flipping earned the employee thousands of dollars or more — you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676075/opensea-insider-information-nft-trading-nate-chastain"&gt;read more about the investigations and accusations here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06DEVg"&gt;Chastain has yet to make a public statement or acknowledge the situation in any way. However, his Twitter profile, and OpenSea’s blog post, would seem to indicate that his time at the company is over. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s latest FCC filing reveals a mysterious new controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nintendo Switch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/repAeI8bJJic4tXsu7stEfEgoCc=/100x0:4300x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69868086/NintendoSwitch_hardware_Joy-Con_02.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FbrH6n"&gt;Nintendo may have a new wireless controller in the works based on &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/BKEHAC043"&gt;this FCC listing the company filed Thursday&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-files-fcc-listing-for-new-mystery-controller/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Vooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The new device has received the model number HAC-043, which, if it matters, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/13/20803344/nintendo-switch-snes-controller-fcc-listing"&gt;is one model number higher&lt;/a&gt; than Nintendo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/16/20869382/nintendo-wireless-snes-controller-for-switch-now-available-on-sale"&gt;wireless SNES controller from 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzasG9"&gt;Nintendo submitted a 180-day request for confidentiality to the FCC on July 26th that hides more revealing details of the device, like photos and actual schematics. But there are still a few details to share. The device is wireless and uses Bluetooth, and it appears to draw more power at 3.5mW than &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/BKEHAC015"&gt;the Joy-Con’s 2.7mW&lt;/a&gt;. FCC label placement, which can sometimes reveal a bit more of how a device actually looks, also suggests whatever it is would be a departure from the single label that Joy-Con use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U_3iP6vgZW9p-IpbUHXo0WGUPjs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22855324/Screen_Shot_2021_09_16_at_9.33.34_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two labels on a very mysterious rectangle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0wQPEG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/rumour_it_looks_like_nintendo_will_soon_unveil_a_new_controller_for_switch"&gt;Some speculate&lt;/a&gt; the new controller could replicate another old console’s controller like the wireless SNES controller did for the SNES. Maybe Nintendo could finally pull the trigger on a wireless N64 or GameCube controller for even more retro gaming? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CK3ut"&gt;There’s also the possibility of a new Pro Controller to go with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;the OLED Nintendo Switch coming in October&lt;/a&gt;. Nintendo has been tight-lipped about what Joy-Con revisions will come with that new console — specifically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/10/22570868/nintendo-oled-switch-joy-con-drift"&gt;refusing to say if it fixes Joy-Con drift&lt;/a&gt; — but maybe there’s something in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPtWYd"&gt;Either way, given Nintendo’s track record, it’s safe to expect the unexpected. The company does, and largely gets away with doing, whatever it wants. It randomly added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674704/nintendo-switch-bluetooth-audio-software-update"&gt;Bluetooth audio support to the Switch via a software update&lt;/a&gt; just this week, after years of pleading from gamers. A new controller could be as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/18/17253574/nintendo-labo-review-switch-learning-diy"&gt;exciting and odd as Nintendo Labo&lt;/a&gt; or as bog-standard as a slightly tweaked version of the Pro Controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppWUVO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will treat coordinated rule breakers using real accounts like troll farms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FJZPFQOEjYT1mhdcQsScDRTpm10=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69867936/jbareham_180409_2445_0001_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Cemvq"&gt;Facebook is expanding its playbook for tackling “coordinated inauthentic behavior” to cover similar campaigns that don’t involve impersonation. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-facebook-target-harmful-coordination-by-real-accounts-using-playbook-2021-09-16/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; first reported&lt;/a&gt; the new policy, which Facebook apparently says is in its early stages. Practically speaking, it means moderators can take broader actions than banning individual accounts or posts when they break hard rules, aiming to stop coordinated attempts to harass users or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611309/instagram-banned-accounts-business-impersonation"&gt;get them banned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MdBcf"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; points out, Facebook acknowledged in January that its coordinated inauthentic behavior (or CIB) rules had limits. “We have little policy around coordinated authentic harm,” an internal report &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/full-facebook-stop-the-steal-internal-report"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;admitted, referring to the Stop the Steal campaign to overturn the US presidential election. “What do we do when a movement is authentic, coordinated through grassroots or authentic means, but is inherently harmful and violates the spirit of our policy?” The report suggested things like adding “friction” to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552752/facebook-stopthesteal-ban-twitter-parler-discord-trump"&gt;growth of movements&lt;/a&gt; like Stop the Steal — ultimately, it ended up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225643/facebook-stop-the-steal-ban-inauguration-day-capitol-mob-attack"&gt;banning the phrase&lt;/a&gt; from Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdMtVK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;cites two types of incidents where Facebook might target “groups of coordinated real accounts that systemically break its rules”: mass reporting, where people falsely report another user for policy violations, and brigading, or a coordinated campaign to target someone for harassment. Some of these incidents could involve state-sponsored groups that are similar to government-backed “troll farms” but use &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/how-vietnams-influencer-army-wages-information-warfare-facebook-2021-07-09/"&gt;participants’ real Facebook accounts&lt;/a&gt;. Others could be independent — coordinated by political movements or groups of fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meVOGB"&gt;Facebook expanded on the news &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/removing-new-types-of-harmful-networks/"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, discussing a category it dubbed “coordinated social harm” and planned to crack down on. As an example it cited actions against the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-56675874"&gt;conspiratorial Querdenken anti-vaccination movement&lt;/a&gt; in Germany, whose members it said “used authentic and duplicate accounts to post and amplify violating content” including health misinformation. “While we aren’t banning all Querdenken content, we’re continuing to monitor the situation and will take action if we find additional violations to prevent abuse on our platform and protect people using our services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BsoR9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added further detail from a Facebook blog post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This Dell gaming laptop with an RTX 3050 is just $750</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uuQ6yXDn2gtXyVgnuecNl2TNgXA=/0x0:1463x975/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69867859/Dell_G15_Press_Image_3.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qd2DeV"&gt;Grabbing any of Nvidia’s new GPUs for less than a grand is unheard of, but today, you can grab a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDeals091621/https://deals.dell.com/en-us/productdetail/afwj" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell G15 gaming laptop for just $750&lt;/a&gt;, nearly $300 off the initial list price. It may not have the same extraterrestrial curb appeal as Dell’s Alienware laptops, but this G15 still has muscle where it counts. This 15-inch laptop manages to pack in an RTX 3050 graphics card and an 11th Gen Intel Core-i5 CPU, which is ideal for supplying the high refresh 120Hz FHD display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YFKLfz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10756456"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VEO4Iq"&gt;A trio of USB-A ports provides ample connectivity for peripherals or external storage, and a Type-C connection allows the G15 to dock and connect with an external display. There is also the option to use the built-in HDMI port to connect to your monitor or TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQ33io"&gt;As with most manufacturers, you do get the added bonus of a one-year limited hardware warranty, as well as a 12-month subscription to McAfee LiveSafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ImA9Sj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best gaming laptops for 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"},{"title":"Nvidia expects GPU supply constraints for the ‘vast majority’ of 2022 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="J2DBM2"&gt;This laptop does come with a couple of caveats, however. The standard 256GB SSD this laptop comes packaged with won’t last very long unless you supplement it with some type of external storage, and the 8GB of RAM does leave a bit to be desired. The G15 is also a little on the beefier side, weighing in at just shy of six pounds, meaning it’s hardly the most portable laptop. Still, it’s certainly light enough to tote around if you needed to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ku8JuW"&gt;With the current shortage of GPUs slated to extend well into 2022, buying a system with a new graphics card built in seems to be the best way to get your hands on one currently that isn’t a secondhand markup. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s new commitments on climate misinformation miss the point, activists say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Climate Change Activists Continue Their Protest" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xVOubqCicdfxtgctEhK3yO-IqTA=/2x0:2998x1997/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69867817/1181412886.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An Extinction Rebellion environmental activist mother group protest outside Google UK HQ demanding they stop climate deniers profiting on their platforms on October 16, 2019 in London, England.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Ollie Millington/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TSCK5U"&gt;Lies about climate change still fester unchecked on Facebook, environmentalists say, even as the social media giant announces new climate initiatives. The company today &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/tackling-climate-change-together/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that it’s beefing up a “Climate Science Center” with more facts, quizzes, and videos. It’s also investing $1 million in grants to groups “working to combat climate misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhMi6d"&gt;Those efforts still don’t get at the root of the problem. Trying to funnel Facebook users to a “science center” doesn’t actually stop climate deniers from posting false information that can spread like wildfire on the platform. And Facebook continues to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/05/facebook-fossil-fuel-industry-environment-climate-change"&gt;accept&lt;/a&gt; advertising dollars from oil and gas companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="CbDXbw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Those efforts still don’t get at the root of the problem.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BJPSbg"&gt;“Facebook knows the super-spreaders of climate disinformation and should put an end to their repetitive lies,” Michael Khoo, co-chair of the climate disinformation coalition at the nonprofit Friends of the Earth (FOE), said in a statement today. “Facebook and other tech platforms must take far stronger action to limit the super-spreaders, and not put the burden on ordinary users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoOjmI"&gt;One of the most recent bouts with misinformation on climate solutions like renewable energy took place during a deadly blackout and sudden cold snap in Texas last February. Posts spread on social media that falsely claimed frozen wind turbines were primarily at fault for the outages. In reality, the severe cold affected just about every energy source, not just renewables, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287130/texas-natural-gas-production-power-outages-frozen"&gt;frozen natural gas infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; played a huge role in the blackouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpyAXp"&gt;In a new &lt;a href="http://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Texas_Disinfo_Report_final_v4.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released today, Friends of the Earth analyzed the top 10 “highest-performing” Facebook posts falsely blaming wind turbines for blackouts. Less than 1 percent of interactions — including likes, comments, and shares — were with posts that carried a fact-check label, which Facebook places on posts that have been reviewed by the platform’s third-party fact-checkers. FOE argues that without fact-checking, misinformation can spread both within and outside of the platform to mainstream media and politics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNyZC6"&gt;Facebook defends its handling of misinformation in the wake of the winter storm.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Many of the examples in the report cited as not having labels are simply positions that the [FOE] disagrees with,” Facebook said in an emailed statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tl6Fls"&gt;The posts FOE analyzed include several from &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt; that quote Tucker Carlson saying things like, “Green energy inevitably means blackouts,” and “global warming is no longer a &lt;a href="https://www.houstontx.gov/mayor/Climate-Impact-Assessment-2020-August.pdf"&gt;pressing concern in Houston&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve solved that problem. The bad news is they don’t have electricity. The windmills froze so the power grid failed.”&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/feb/16/natural-gas-not-wind-turbines-main-driver-texas-po/"&gt;Neither statement is true&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDqJh8"&gt;Friends of the Earth also looked into the top 10 performing posts that shared a viral image of a drone defrosting a wind turbine. The image was actually &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-9953125062"&gt;taken years earlier&lt;/a&gt; and had nothing to do with the power outages. Ninety percent of those posts did carry Facebook’s fact-checking label, according to the FOE report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6fTop9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Misinformation about renewable energy online can have real-world consequences&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OJN3CB"&gt;Misinformation about renewable energy online can have real-world consequences. Following the disaster, lawmakers in Texas lambasted wind power and cited the outages while &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/texas-lawmakers-are-using-the-blackouts-to-make-fossil-1846583275"&gt;pushing bills&lt;/a&gt; to boost natural gas and place new fees on renewables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVZcay"&gt;Facebook also got flak today for the money it makes from oil and gas advertising. “The  company often talks about its commitment to tackling climate change, but it continues to allow its platform to be used by the fossil fuel sector to undermine science-based climate action,” Faye Holder, a program manager at climate and energy think tank InfluenceMap said in a statement today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBxizH"&gt;Twenty-five companies from the oil and gas sector spent nearly $9.6 million on Facebook ads last year, InfluenceMap found in a &lt;a href="https://influencemap.org/report/Climate-Change-and-Digital-Advertising-a40c8116160668aa2d865da2f5abe91b#"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; it released last month. Those ads had been viewed over 431 million times. Facebook rejects ads that its independent fact-checkers rate as false or misleading, the company said in its emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkJcqi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The verdict is in: watch the new PS5’s heatsink put to the test</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jgMIu8gOqkfR7JeGdg68H3JCjcw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69867701/vpavic_4278_20201030_0247.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hyCzXf"&gt;Sony’s new, lighter PS5 model with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22646963/sony-new-ps5-model-lighter-smaller-heatsink-teardown"&gt;a smaller heatsink&lt;/a&gt; has been put through extensive testing by &lt;em&gt;Gamers Nexus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and ultimately, it doesn’t seem that there are significant enough differences between the two models to seek one over the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CFk7E"&gt;“We overall haven’t seen any major downsides to either heatsink,” Steve Burke, editor-in-chief of &lt;em&gt;Gamers Nexus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgWuGA8cExo"&gt;said in a video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;“It seems to be [that] the fans make a decent difference, but not enough of one where you should pursue purchasing a specific fan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZgS0z"&gt;“We also wouldn’t really recommend pursuing a specific console,” Burke continued. “The 1100 [the revised console] versus the 1000 series [the launch console] ... they’re not, in our testing, that different. There are a lot of ways to test these things. Maybe there’s a scenario we haven’t found yet. But we’re not seeing a huge difference. At least, not one that should make you go crazy on eBay trying to find a specific unit. And don’t overpay for one, either, at least if you can avoid it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ubBDS"&gt;That said, if you’re interested in learning about the finer details of the differences between the new PS5 and the old PS5, it’s worth watching &lt;em&gt;Gamers Nexus&lt;/em&gt;’ &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/VgWuGA8cExo"&gt;nearly 37-minute long video&lt;/a&gt; comparing the two designs. &lt;em&gt;Gamers Nexus &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt; collaborated on testing the different models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IUpfKO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VgWuGA8cExo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G6DDzG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8-97fwkO78"&gt;in its own lengthy but interesting video that’s worth watching&lt;/a&gt;, also observed only small differences in the two versions of the PS5. “The experience of owning [the 1100 series] was basically identical [to the 1000 series],” concluded &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;’s Rich Leadbetter. He shared similar sentiments &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-playstation-5-cfi-1100-review-better-or-worse-than-the-launch-console"&gt;in an article on &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TwWoaX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y8-97fwkO78?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u517HF"&gt;It seems likely that Sony is planning to roll out the CFI-1100 series PS5 as the new de facto model, so if you’re still on the hunt for one of the elusive consoles, you may end up with the revised version. But based on &lt;em&gt;Gamers Nexus’&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry’s&lt;/em&gt; testing, it doesn’t appear you need to worry too much about which version you get.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A short history of every time Apple CEO Tim Cook praised augmented reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tim Cook stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BFSuuOJCdScY2AnKMm3g_j2QVS4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69848232/tim-cook-apple-stock-0563.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Cook has been singing the praises of AR for five years&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ERzUQ0"&gt;Tim Cook has just marked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;10 years as Apple’s CEO&lt;/a&gt;, and while he’s grown Apple into the most valuable company in the world, it’s reasonable to argue he hasn’t yet introduced a signature, industry shaking product like Apple co-founder Steve Jobs did with the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqO7Qo"&gt;But if you’ve been following Apple for a minute, you’ve probably heard Cook talk about the game-changing potential of augmented reality. While he once said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/28/4374482/tim-cook-apple-wearable-google-glass"&gt;hard to see the appeal of Google Glass&lt;/a&gt;, the AR wearable that proved unpopular with consumers, he’s held a consistently positive opinion on AR since at least 2016. While most of the industry was putting all its eggs in the VR basket, Cook repeatedly expressed support for what he views as the far superior AR. This would become a running theme: AR good, VR not so good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3j429"&gt;It seems likely that AR may become the hallmark of Cook’s tenure, as long as Apple executes on a winning idea. While that’s not exactly guaranteed — Apple has yet to unveil an AR headset or glasses — Cook’s frequent comments about the tech keep the topic in the news and reassure investors and customers that Apple is working on it. In September 2021, he went as far as to call himself “AR fan number one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZIIDx"&gt;AR features are already available on the iPhone and iPad. And while hope is starting to fade that Apple will release a mixed reality device in 2022, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;latest rumors suggest&lt;/a&gt; the company is still forging ahead with some kind of AR / VR headset to be released in the not-distant future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5jIE1"&gt;Here’s a brief history of all the times Tim Cook said he was convinced AR was the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LR10VY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; Cook says in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/26/12290920/apple-augmented-reality-ar-tim-cook"&gt;quarterly earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that “AR can be really great.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wX7rQO"&gt;“We have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run, we think there’s great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity. The number one thing is to make sure our products work well with other developers’ kind of products like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;, that’s why you see so many iPhones in the wild chasing pokemons.” (Cook pronounces it “pokey-mans.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3BaXv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2016: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/exclusive-apple-ceo-tim-cook-prefers-augmented-reality/story?id=42064913"&gt;Cook tells &lt;em&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an interview that he believes AR is a bigger deal than VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtE9kB"&gt;“There’s virtual reality and there’s augmented reality — both of these are incredibly interesting. But my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEwdho"&gt;AR “gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present, talking to each other, but also have other things — visually — for both of us to see. Maybe it’s something we’re talking about, maybe it’s someone else here who’s not here present but who can be made to appear to be present.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WB8GUn"&gt;“There’s a lot of really cool things there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqvA1V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; Cook makes a brief mention of AR in a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2016/08/13/tim-cook-the-interview-running-apple-is-sort-of-a-lonely-job/?utm_term=.71cfafb58188"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; profile&lt;/a&gt;: “I think AR [augmented reality] is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology. So, yes, it’s something we’re doing a lot of things on behind that curtain that we talked about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfFqeu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2016: &lt;/strong&gt;In an appearance at Utah Tech Tour, Cook goes into detail about &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/02/tim-cook-talks-steve-jobs-need-for-encryption-at-utah-tech-tour-video/"&gt;how crucial AR may become&lt;/a&gt; and why he views it as superior to VR — while stressing that AR presents significant technology challenges before it can be adopted for mass consumerism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="s4U9pW"&gt;In terms of it becoming a mass adoption [phenomenon], so that, say, everyone in here would have an AR experience, the reality to do that, it has to be something that everyone in here views to be an “acceptable thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fE5O2T"&gt;And nobody in here, few people in here, think it’s acceptable to be tethered to a computer walking in here and sitting down, few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something, because we’re all social people at heart. Even introverts are social people, we like people and we want to interact. It has to be that it’s likely that AR, of the two, is the one the largest number of people will engage with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyxSDF"&gt;I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day, it will become that much a part of you, a lot of us live on our smartphones, the iPhone, I hope, is very important for everyone, so AR will become really big. VR I think is not going to be that big, compared to AR. I’m not saying it’s not important, it is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mfq3v"&gt;I’m excited about VR from an education point of view, I think it can be really big for education, I think it can be very big for games. But I can’t imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you’re sitting in here with me. But I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now, if the technology was there, which it’s not today. How long will it take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wx2VTE"&gt;AR is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there. But it will happen, it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it. Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="o5nJLd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkV78RZ73Mw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d6ivZT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; Cook &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-ceo-tim-cook-on-virtual-reality-theres-no-substitute-f#.qel1aEjdb"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that while “VR has some interesting applications,” AR is superior to VR because “there’s no substitute for human contact. And so you want the technology to encourage that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LWV7WX"&gt;Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it’s profound. We might ... have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right? And so I think that things like these are better when they’re incorporated without becoming a barrier to our talking. ... You want the technology to amplify it, not to be a barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8zwWMG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2017: &lt;/strong&gt;Cook &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/apple-tim-cook-boss-brexit-uk-theresa-may-number-10-interview-ustwo-a7574086.html"&gt;expands his thoughts on AR’s potential&lt;/a&gt;, adding a new comparison: AR is a big idea, like the smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qlZDkX"&gt;I’m excited about augmented reality because unlike virtual reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on what’s happening presently. Most people don’t want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can’t do that because you get sick from it. With AR you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHlQnM"&gt;I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don’t have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it’s for everyone. I think AR is that big, it’s huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives. And be entertaining. I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone, it’s not a product per se, it’s a core technology. But there are things to discover before that technology is good enough for the mainstream. I do think there can be a lot of things that really help people out in daily life, real-life things, that’s why I get so excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ywuu2K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; In a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-06-15/apple-s-tim-cook-on-donald-trump-the-homepod-and-the-legacy-of-steve-jobs"&gt;wide-ranging interview with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Cook details his vision for AR at Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="b2MVpL"&gt;I think it is profound. I am so excited about it, I just want to yell out and scream. The first step in making it a mainstream kind of experience is to put it in the operating system. We’re building it into iOS 11, opening it to ­developers—and unleashing the creativity of millions of people. Even we can’t predict what’s going to come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5fDe2"&gt;There’s some things that you can already get a vision of. We’ve talked to IKEA, and they have 3D images of their furniture line. You’re talking about changing the whole experience of how you shop for, in this case, furniture and other objects that you can place around the home. You can take that idea and begin to think this is something that stretches from enterprise to consumer. There’s not a lot of things that do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hboXPl"&gt;You’ll see things happening in enterprises where AR is ­fundamental to what they’re doing. You’re going to see some consumer things that are unbelievably cool. Can we do everything we want to do now? No. The technology’s not complete yet. But that’s the beauty to a certain degree. This has a runway. And it’s an incredible runway. It’s time to put the seat belt on and go. When people begin to see what’s possible, it’s going to get them very excited—like we are, like we’ve been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DIea6k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; At an &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41590323"&gt;event at Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, Cook responds to a student who asks what technology he would consider “transformative.” Cook says there are widespread uses for AR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYUKHM"&gt;“I’m incredibly excited by AR because I can see uses for it everywhere. I can see uses for it in education, in consumers, in entertainment, in sports. I can see it in every business that I know anything about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JpVYm"&gt;“I also like the fact that it doesn’t isolate. I don’t like our products being used a lot. I like our products amplifying thoughts and I think AR can help amplify the human connection. I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite. There are clearly some cool niche things for VR but it’s not profound in my view. AR is profound.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJlluP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; In an &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/exclusive-apple-ceo-tim-cook-future-of-fashion-augmented-reality"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Vogue UK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Cook says while Apple wasn’t looking to build a “giant database of clothes,” it would support companies in the AR space who were doing this work. “If you think about a runway show in the fashion world, that’s a great application of AR because some of these, you want to see the dress all the way around, you do not want to just see the front,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;, noting how many runway shows are livestreamed and not just visible to an in-person audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBEvu6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; With the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15742736/apple-arkit-augmented-reality-platform-wwdc-breakdown"&gt;introduction of its ARKit platform on iOS 11&lt;/a&gt;, Cook says in a quarterly earnings call that &lt;a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2017/11/the-transcript-of-todays-opening-statement-from-apples-ceo-on-fiscal-q4-2017-is-now-available.html"&gt;Apple has created&lt;/a&gt; the world’s largest augmented reality platform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GdJYqz"&gt;There already are over a thousand apps with powerful AR features in our App Store today with developers creating amazing new experiences in virtually every category of app aimed at consumers, students and business users alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RV7Y54"&gt;Put simply, we believe AR is going to change the way we use technology forever. We’re already seeing things that will transform the way you work, play, connect and learn. For example, there are AR apps that you interact with virtual models of everything you can imagine from the human body to the solar system. And of course you experience them like you’re really there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="je9Rb6"&gt;Instantly education becomes much more powerful when every subject comes to life in 3D. And imagine shopping when you can place an object in your living room before you make a purchase – or attending live sporting events when you can see the stats on the field. AR is going to change everything&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DM0tys"&gt;This is not quite what came to pass (more on that later). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJAyaa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; Post-ARKit launch, Cook admits he &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/apple-iphone-tim-cook-interview-features-new-augmented-reality-ar-arkit-a7993566.html"&gt;thinks AR technology&lt;/a&gt; for headsets or glasses isn’t yet up to par as far as Apple is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ag0KHY"&gt;“I can tell you the technology itself doesn’t exist to do that in a quality way. The display technology required, as well as putting enough stuff around your face — there’s huge challenges with that. The field of view, the quality of the display itself, it’s not there yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMoVt4"&gt;“We don’t give a rat’s about being first, we want to be the best, and give people a great experience. But now anything you would see on the market any time soon would not be something any of us would be satisfied with. Nor do I think the vast majority of people would be satisfied.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvKmAY"&gt;“Most technology challenges can be solved, but it’s a matter of how long.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiQf8M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2018: &lt;/strong&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2018/02/01/apple-inc-appl-q1-2018-earnings-conference-call-tr.aspx"&gt;Apple’s Q1 earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, Cook describes “great excitement” around augmented reality among customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5QNWq"&gt;“Augmented reality is going to revolutionize many of the experiences we have with mobile devices, and with ARKit, we’re giving developers the most advanced tools on the market to create apps for the most advanced operating system running on the most advanced hardware. This is something only Apple can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yOGiC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2018: &lt;/strong&gt;Cook tells &lt;em&gt;NowThisNews&lt;/em&gt; during an interview about Apple’s Watch that AR is poised to become indispensable. “I think that one day we will wonder how we ever lived without it,” Cook says of AR. “We can have a much more enhanced conversation with the power of AR.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZOOfV"&gt;“The future is now,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EZs5TM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vX9xBB_vBsc?rel=0&amp;amp;start=433" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VO88JU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2020: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/tim-cook-ar-war-ducks-healthtech"&gt;Cook tells an audience in Dublin, Ireland&lt;/a&gt; that augmented reality “is the next big thing” and that it will “pervade our entire lives.” He gives an example of a company using AR and described its potential uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ImgYq0"&gt;Yesterday, I visited a development company called War Ducks … in Dublin – 15 people and they’re staffing up and using AR for games. You can imagine, for games it’s incredible but even for our discussion here. You and I might be talking about an article and using AR we can pull it up, and can both be looking at the same thing at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDw6RA"&gt;I think it’s something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5lTJJO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2021:&lt;/strong&gt; During an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/apples-ceo-is-making-very-different-choices-from-mark-zuckerberg.html?showTranscript=1"&gt;interview with journalist Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; Cook agreed with her that augmented reality is “a critically important part of Apple’s future.” He imagines AR being used in health, education, retail, and gaming. “I’m already seeing AR take off in some of these areas with use of the phone. And I think the promise is even greater in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsfUXn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2021:&lt;/strong&gt; In &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/UU6MtPwT_5c?t=547"&gt;an interview with tech YouTuber iJustine&lt;/a&gt;, Cook said that he was AR’s number one fan and reiterated his hopes for it as a collaboration tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nqOlVs"&gt;I am so excited about AR. I think AR is one of these very few profound technologies that we will look back on one day and went, how did we live our lives without it? And so right now you can experience it in thousands of ways using your iPad or your iPhone, but of course, those will get better and better over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfPD0k"&gt;Already it’s a great way to shop, it’s a great way to learn. It enhances the learning process. I can’t wait for it to be even more important in collaboration and so forth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fBwShJ"&gt;So I’m AR fan number one. I think it’s that big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoCvwM"&gt;After a comment from Justine about the future impact of AR, he continued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JFbx8T"&gt;I mean, simple things today that you can use it for, like if you’re shopping for a sofa, or a chair, or a lamp, in terms of really experiencing it in your place, we’ve never been able to do that before until the last couple years or so. And that’s at the early innings of AR. It will only get better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NExGsI"&gt;What’s Apple’s plan for AR?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MZhJMH"&gt;Clearly, Tim Cook has been bullish on AR for a long time. But so far, Apple’s biggest foray into AR remains the 2017 launch of ARKit — which use iPhones’ and iPads’ cameras and sensors to overlay images in 3D space when the device is pointed at a given area — for iOS 11. ARKit is available across Apple’s devices, which meant a lot of &lt;a href="https://github.com/olucurious/Awesome-ARKit"&gt;cool little projects&lt;/a&gt; by amateur AR enthusiasts. When ARKit launched, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15742736/apple-arkit-augmented-reality-platform-wwdc-breakdown"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt; that the tech had the potential to allow Apple to catch rival Google in the AR space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dv9YB6"&gt;But despite the interesting early projects, ARKit hype fizzled after a few months. It’s not totally clear why, because it was released at the height of the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; craze when AR finally had a popular mass-market application for a devoted fan base. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565654/pokemon-go-5-billion-fifth-anniversary-revenue-analytics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;itself is still wildly profitable&lt;/a&gt;, raking in a billion dollars a year on average, but we haven’t seen a larger movement.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikGTfK"&gt;Since ARKit, Apple has made other, smaller steps forward with AR apps for the iPhone. In May 2019, it introduced its &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/14/statue-of-liberty-ar-ios-app/"&gt;Statue of Liberty AR app&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1128412203932049408"&gt;Cook tweeting&lt;/a&gt;, “The Statue of Liberty app is just the beginning of how AR will transform the way we connect with our world’s treasures.” In July 2019, it introduced augmented reality art sessions for iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hh9exC"&gt;In addition to Tim Cook’s constant cheerleading of the technology, there are other signs that Apple is moving toward an AR future. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/natbro/status/1155849145350909954"&gt;hiring of people like Nat Brown&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of Microsoft; listing &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/08/01/apple-lists-ar-vr-jobs-reportedly-taps-executive-who-finalizes-products/"&gt;dozens of AR and VR job postings&lt;/a&gt;; acquisitions including &lt;a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/05/28/apple-buys-german-augmented-reality-firm-metaio/"&gt;Metaio in 2015&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/26/15877520/apple-sensomotoric-instruments-acquisition-ar-vr-eye-tracking"&gt;SensoMotoric in 2017&lt;/a&gt;; and patents on things like “&lt;a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=09383582&amp;amp;SectionNum=1&amp;amp;IDKey=4E2221DF6AD9&amp;amp;HomeUrl=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526d=PALL%2526p=1%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r=1%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526s1=9,383,582.PN.%2526OS=PN/9,383,582%2526RS=PN/9,383,582"&gt;head mounted display&lt;/a&gt;” devices all demonstrate its steady progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WuEKr7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s AR hardware is perennially two years away&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BbknTJ"&gt;Reports started &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-is-working-on-an-ar-augmented-reality-vr-virtual-reality-headset-powered-by-a-wireless-wigig-hub/"&gt;trickling out in 2018&lt;/a&gt; that Apple had a timeline to launch both an AR headset and AR glasses. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/apple-s-ar-push-will-start-with-ipad-and-culminate-with-glasses"&gt;The company had 1,000 engineers&lt;/a&gt; working on its VR and AR initiative — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-04/apple-augmented-reality-headset-executive-leaves-company"&gt;codenamed “T288”&lt;/a&gt; — which were expected to include a combined VR and AR headset to be released in 2021 or 2022, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;, with a pair of sleeker AR glasses predicted to launch in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqsIdJ"&gt;The latest reporting from &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-ar-vr-headset-will-need-connection-to-other-device-such-as-iphone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;however, indicates that an Apple AR / VR headset may need to rely on the processor of another connected device like an iPhone (similar to the early Apple Watch models), and that Apple is working on a custom chip for the helmet-like headset that might take at least another year to arrive. Some aren’t as bullish on the glasses-like variant either; &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; suggests Apple could still release that in 2023, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks&lt;/a&gt; a 2025 release is more likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2d0mj"&gt;It shouldn’t be all that surprising that Apple has taken its time making AR hardware. It is, after all, the company that introduced the AirPower wireless charging pad, showed it off to the world, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;canceled the product because it wasn’t up to company standards&lt;/a&gt; — and that was just an charging accessory, not a potentially new computing paradigm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrJyTD"&gt;So it’s to be expected that Apple would take its time on an AR or VR headset. After hyping the potential for AR all this time, Cook surely doesn’t want Apple to repeat the failure of Google Glass by launching iGlasses too soon, and definitely not before the technology meets Apple’s very high bar.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Surprise! Deltarune Chapter 2 drops September 17th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v-P6C4EhB00ko2MeTZaIuUyEapY=/87x0:951x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69867523/sc6709.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;toby fox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f2runu"&gt;The next chapter of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18047410/undertale-spinoff-sequel-deltarune-toby-fox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deltarune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is coming and I am beyond excited. In a surprise announcement, Toby Fox, creator of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16151292/undertale-playstation-4-vita-release"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series, revealed &lt;em&gt;Deltarune&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/em&gt; will be released on Mac and PC on September 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LCr3Ct"&gt;The news came on September 15th during a livestream of &lt;em&gt;Deltarune Chapter 1&lt;/em&gt; put on to commemorate &lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;’s sixth anniversary. Hosted by three dads from Fangamer — a gaming merchandise retailer — the &lt;em&gt;Deltarune&lt;/em&gt; livestream featured hideous dad-approved shirts, canned laughter typical of a ‘90s sitcom, and commentary from Toby Fox himself via a skateboarding &lt;a href="https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Annoying_Dog"&gt;Annoying Dog&lt;/a&gt; proxy with a text-to-speech voice. You can (and should) check out a VOD of the wholesome stream here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3MBrBD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rksOYId-cNA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JWQsF9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deltarune&lt;/em&gt; is the much anticipated follow-up to Toby Fox’s award-winning indie RPG &lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;. The game follows the human Kris as they live and attend school in a town populated entirely by monsters. One day, Kris and the school bully Susie fall into an alternate reality known as the Dark World and are tasked with restoring the light and bringing balance to the land. Along the way, they meet Ralsei and Lancer, two “darkners” who help (and sometimes hinder) Susie and Kris’ quest.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMwfE6"&gt;Unlike &lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Deltarune&lt;/em&gt;’s release was broken up into installments, the first of which came out in October 2018. Two years later, &lt;a href="https://deltarune.com/update-092020/"&gt;Fox wrote an update&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Deltarune&lt;/em&gt;’s progress, sharing how game design considerations and health problems had slowed development but that he was confident the next chapter of &lt;em&gt;Deltarune&lt;/em&gt; would come soon. Now, a year after that announcement that coincided with &lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;’s fifth anniversary, the next chapter of &lt;em&gt;Deltarune&lt;/em&gt; is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iB0iZl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;See you soon. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Z19tzGlRmW"&gt;https://t.co/Z19tzGlRmW&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/hKU0st0LCb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hKU0st0LCb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— UNDERTALE / DELTARUNE (@UnderTale) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UnderTale/status/1438330666869878787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GS4REG"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://deltarune.com/help/"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, console ports of &lt;em&gt;Deltarune&lt;/em&gt; are not on the table at the moment, and it is unknown if this chapter will be available for free like &lt;em&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/em&gt; was. &lt;em&gt;Deltarune Chapter 2&lt;/em&gt; hits Mac and PC September 17th and you can catch up with &lt;em&gt;Deltarune Chapter 1&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://deltarune.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
