    <title>Best Chromebook 2020</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best Chromebook for every type of user&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GGbxNY"&gt;The best Chromebooks aren’t just laptops that run a few Android apps anymore. Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chromebook can be more useful than a mediocre Windows laptop. That’s why our pick for the best Chromebook of 2020 is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnwyna"&gt;The best Chromebooks are known to deliver good value. The message that many people actually want &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers. Many of the best Chromebooks are around $500 or $600, though there are good options in the higher and lower ranges as well. The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you’ll be happy with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUTNYw"&gt;For the first time, the quality of Chromebooks in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they’re all sourcing their components from the same factory. That’s great news if you’re comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMCGia"&gt;Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we’ve selected the Lenovo Chromebook Duet as the best Chromebook for shoppers on a budget. Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2020 include the Asus Chromebook Flip C434, Google Pixelbook Go, the Google Pixelbook, and the HP Chromebook x360. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4UgFhp"&gt;An honorable mention is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;, a gorgeous laptop with a unique color and 4K AMOLED display, which didn’t quite make this list because of its unfortunately short battery life. We’re looking forward to reviewing Lenovo’s Flex 5 Chromebook with a thin 2-in-1 design, and the affordable IdeaPad Flex 3 Chromebook which has a unique chassis and an SD card reader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4TuU"&gt;What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the best Chromebook of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KQRVus"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfZy92"&gt;Best Chromebook of 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LpXHDz"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy. With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you’ll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarhIJ"&gt;The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting. There’s even an HDMI port, which you don’t see on a thin Chromebook every day. And (most importantly) the 10th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem. The Spin’s speakers aren’t great, and there’s no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX2USx"&gt;In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that’s excellent in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For students or anyone looking for a small secondary device, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great affordable pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QjxyUU"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P8MGAD"&gt;Best Chromebook on a budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xJq778"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price. It’s an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfnBmb"&gt;The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you’re just browsing and don’t plan on using a super heavy load. It also uses a version of Chrome OS that’s made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that’s optimized for tablet use. When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze. But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93jX9I"&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks. The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there’s no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim. But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price. It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Chromebook Flip C434 is the best Chromebook of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KoNNR1"&gt;3. Asus Chromebook Flip C434&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d76D4s"&gt;Best 14-inch Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nprrDB"&gt;Asus has a strong history of making good Chromebooks, but the C434 is something special. It’s nearly unique among this class of laptops in offering a big 14-inch screen in a laptop body that’s much closer in size to a 13-inch model. It pulls off that trick by minimizing the bezels around the screen, which is the same thing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/4/15961740/best-laptop-microsoft-windows-apple-macbook-hp-dell-lenovo"&gt;best Windows laptops&lt;/a&gt; have been doing lately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMlKx4"&gt;Asus nailed the basics, too. The keyboard is great to type on, though it does have the annoying problem of being hard to see in dim lighting because the backlight is the same color as the keycaps. The trackpad is accurate, and I appreciate that there’s not only a USB-A port but that the two USB-C ports are on opposite sides of the laptop so you can plug in on the side you prefer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VTxl8W"&gt;There’s even a microSD card slot for expanded storage — and you might need it, as it only comes with 64GB. The processor isn’t the most powerful one you can get in a Chromebook in this price range, but it should be enough for most tasks, especially if you follow our recommendation to get the model with 8GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a larger device with more power, one of the best Chromebooks you can buy is the HP Chromebook x360 14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C2SoIE"&gt;4. HP Chromebook x360 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rtrWbQ"&gt;Powerful Chromebook with a sleek design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rGvI"&gt;If you’re looking to get more power and you don’t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with the i3 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUDxQ"&gt;While we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn’t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="epP0CZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508136"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go has a stylish and portable design with a standout keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SStRnG"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s4tmgA"&gt;Best Google Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WMItcT"&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds. It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M72CDq"&gt;Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports. Battery life is also impressive. The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem. But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCvQ3C"&gt;The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn’t top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price. But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lZOrDL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508145"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a premium design, the Google Pixelbook is a good Chromebook for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oKAVKP"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UgIG1H"&gt;Thin Chromebook with beautiful hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ptwU2G"&gt;Google hasn’t updated the Pixelbook since its 2017 release, but if you’re looking for a convertible premium Chromebook, it’s still competitive. It has a beautiful design, combining aluminum and Gorilla Glass with silicone palm rests, and sports a bright touchscreen with 2400 x 1600 resolution. The 3:2 aspect ratio offers extra space compared to 16:9 panels and makes it more comfortable to work in multiple apps and windows without having to zoom out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rv26rE"&gt;The Pixelbook doesn’t have the latest Intel processors since it’s an older product. Still, its Core i5 and 8GB of RAM should be able to handle everyday browsing and multitasking just fine. We also got around eight hours of battery life under a fairly heavy load. The keyboard and touchpad are both fun and comfortable to use — and as a neat bonus, the speakers fire up through the hinge, so audio sounds clearer than it does on many convertible laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvzNEI"&gt;Note: Google appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449640/google-pixelbook-discontinue-chromebook-laptop"&gt;discontinuing the Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, but some models are still available through Google’s store and other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wNILY1"&gt;7. Dell Inspiron 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sajnTX"&gt;Premium 2-in-1 with a built-in stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6nUXhF"&gt;It’s a bit heavy as Chromebooks go, but the 3.99-pound Inspiron 14 is still a sturdy convertible device with brushed aluminum chassis that gives it a premium look. It has a spacious backlit keyboard and a nice 1920 x 1080 display with accurate colors. With an 8th Gen Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, it delivers snappy performance for streaming, browsing, multitasking, and even more demanding artistic tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX7aDx"&gt;Speaking of artists, the Inspiron 14 comes with a stylus, which lives in a dedicated socket inside the chassis so you don’t have to worry about losing it. Thanks to electromagnetic resonance technology (EMR), it doesn’t need batteries or any kind of charge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="X6cCFz"&gt;8. Samsung Chromebook Plus v2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YGLlQl"&gt;Best Samsung Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E0uFW7"&gt;The convertible Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 is far from a budget purchase. But it does offer a lot for its price, including a built-in battery-free stylus and an extra front-facing camera for quick photos of blackboards or job sites. (The camera above the keyboard is also surprisingly high-resolution — it’s a 13-megapixel sensor with autofocus.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKmhZX"&gt;The V2 also has a nice design on par with that of other premium Chromebooks, including an aluminum lid and a sturdy hinge. It’s fairly portable at 2.9 pounds, and it has a microSD slot in addition to its two USB-C ports and headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re able to spend a bit extra for some serious power, the Asus Chromebook Flip C436 is a good Chromebook for you, offering great battery life and a super light build.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="URploe"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21206912/asus-chromebook-flip-c436-review-chromeos-android"&gt;Asus Chromebook Flip C436&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WREbTq"&gt;A pricey, premium Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DSD92E"&gt;Disappointing battery life (just over five hours of multitasking and seven hours of looping video) and a hefty price tag keep the Chromebook Flip C436 from topping this list, especially considering the lower price but similar offerings of its predecessor, the Chromebook Flip C434. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4Kg8L"&gt;Still, if money isn’t an object for you, there’s a lot to like about the 2-in-1 C436. It has a nice, compact, convertible chassis — unlike many convertible devices, it’s actually light enough (2.4 pounds) to feasibly be used as a tablet for an extended period of time. Inside, it has a comfortable and snappy keyboard and a fingerprint reader in the top corner of the deck. The audio is good: there are two Harman Kardon-certified speakers in the hinge, as well as one on each side of the cover. And it’s powered by a 10th Gen Intel Core i3 that performs quite well under a heavy browsing load. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqzqH2"&gt;The C436 is a pricey Chromebook, but it certainly looks and feels premium. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="gXRhON"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Riot Games is working on a massively multiplayer online (MMO) roleplaying game in the &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; universe, Riot’s VP of IP and entertainment, Greg Street, tweeted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/1339724117973483520"&gt;on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lIocDX"&gt;“My recent job at Riot has been to help develop the League universe, which we’re going to need!” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/1339722821761605632"&gt;Street said&lt;/a&gt;. “My new job is to kick off a big (some might say massive) game that many of you, and many Rioters, have been asking us to create.” If the deliberate use of the word “massive” in that quote wasn’t enough of a hint, in a reply to another Twitter user, Street confirmed the game &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/1339724117973483520"&gt;is an MMO&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l2idUn"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I have news!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My recent job at Riot has been to help develop the League universe, which we’re going to need!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because it is time. My new job is to kick off a big (some might say massive) game that many of you, and many Rioters, have been asking us to create.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS We’re hiring&lt;/p&gt;— Greg Street (@Ghostcrawler) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/1339722821761605632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It is an MMO&lt;/p&gt;— Greg Street (@Ghostcrawler) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/1339724117973483520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6I3HSy"&gt;The new MMO isn’t entirely surprising, as Riot has been working to expand the &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; universe into other games and mediums as of late. Riot has released a &lt;a href="https://playruneterra.com/en-us/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League-&lt;/em&gt;themed card game&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/events/teamfight-tactics"&gt;auto-battler&lt;/a&gt;. In 2021, the company plans to launch a mobile and console version of the main game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519658/league-of-legends-wild-rift-open-beta-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends: Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and a spinoff &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21012514/league-of-legends-riot-indie-game-ruined-king-the-game-awards-tga"&gt;single-player, turn-based RPG&lt;/a&gt; for consoles and PC&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;An animated series, &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;, is also scheduled &lt;a href="https://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/dev/an-update-on-arcane/"&gt;for 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and there are two &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/19/12970138/league-of-legends-mechs-vs-minions-board-game"&gt;board&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408504/league-of-legends-tellstones-board-game-spinoff"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; that further flesh out the lore. Riot appears to be following the same formula as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In fact, the studio even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18099147/league-of-legends-marvel-comics-game-lore-riot"&gt;partnered with Marvel for &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; comic books&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCFgeB"&gt;Street worked on &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; for nearly six years, according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fgreg-street-b356447%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F18%2F22187980%2Friot-games-league-of-legends-mmo-greg-street#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;his LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, so hopefully he can bring some of what has made that game such a hit to this new &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; MMO.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft offers Cyberpunk 2077 refunds for all digital sales, but it’s not pulling the game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/McKvaUuFlbEJMtbtQx1_tJyv5Lo=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548894/Cyberpunk2077_No_Future_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LOcvFI"&gt;Microsoft says it’s now offering &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; refunds to anyone who has purchased the game via its Microsoft Store. While the company has been offering refunds to some customers already, Microsoft is now expanding this to cover anyone who has purchased the game digitally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DczLQQ"&gt;“We know the developers at CD Projekt Red have worked hard to ship Cyberpunk in extremely challenging circumstances,” explains a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “However, we also realize that some players have been unhappy with the current experience on older consoles. To date, we have granted refunds to the vast majority of customers who have requested one. To ensure that every player is able to get the experience they expect on Xbox, we will be expanding our existing refund policy to offer full refunds to anyone who purchased Cyberpunk 2077 digitally from the Microsoft Store, until further notice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E2zt4F"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Cyberpunk 2077: To ensure that every player can get the experience they expect on Xbox, we will be expanding our existing refund policy to offer full refunds to anyone who purchased Cyberpunk 2077 digitally from the Microsoft Store, until further notice. &lt;a href="https://t.co/04TcniwVzy"&gt;https://t.co/04TcniwVzy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xbox Support (@XboxSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxSupport/status/1339983446865801224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kA9POC"&gt;If you’re interested in a Microsoft Store refund, you can follow the steps on &lt;a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/buy-games-apps/refund-orders"&gt;Microsoft’s support page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrIuTo"&gt;The refund policy expansion follows days of complaints around bugs, crashes, and the way the game runs on base PS4 and Xbox One consoles. Sony also moved to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;refund unhappy &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; players&lt;/a&gt; this week and even removed the game from the PlayStation Store. Microsoft isn’t going as far as Sony to fully remove the game, as the title is still listed and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fcyberpunk-2077%2Fbx3m8l83bbrw%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available on the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYrJhR"&gt;Sony and Microsoft’s moves to refund players come just days after &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; developer CD Projekt Red said people unsatisfied with their purchase on the PS4 or Xbox One should request a refund. CD Projekt Red has also committed to releasing patches to improve the game, with one due in the coming days and more significant patches planned for January and February.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Skype now has Microsoft Teams’ fun Together Mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vuv3FYeKtBiGFITzhHOhbzhoI7M=/4x0:1627x1082/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548817/skypetogethermode.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skype’s new Together Mode option featuring Verge staff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KqZmXl"&gt;Microsoft is bringing one of its best Teams video calling features over to Skype this week. Together Mode, which uses AI to segment your face and shoulders and place you together with other people in a virtual space, is now available in Skype. You’ll need at least five people all with webcams to enable the feature, and it will place everyone into a virtual environment as if they’re sitting next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1Bdap"&gt;You don’t even need the Skype app to take advantage of Together Mode, as it works through the web version of Skype without the need for an account. Skype users can create a Meet Now meeting and share the link with anyone to join.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T6dUER3FAs8UqN3HoqQp7y0Y4Do=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20073111/togethermode.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Together Mode in Microsoft Teams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2hXemb"&gt;Microsoft first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317526/microsoft-teams-together-mode-dynamic-view-new-features"&gt;launched Together Mode&lt;/a&gt; back in July for pandemic-era meetings, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21337326/nba-microsoft-teams-together-mode-basketball-virtual-experience-fans"&gt;NBA started using the feature&lt;/a&gt; to bring basketball fans courtside in a virtual experience during live games. Still, it’s surprising to see a Microsoft Teams feature make its way to Skype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbTqY3"&gt;Millions of people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232401/zoom-300-million-users-growth-coronavirus-pandemic-security-privacy-concerns-response"&gt;flocked to Zoom&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year when the pandemic forced many to work from home and socialize with friends through video calls. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200844/microsoft-skype-zoom-houseparty-coronavirus-pandemic-usage-growth-competition"&gt;Skype largely missed out on this big moment&lt;/a&gt;, as Microsoft has increasingly turned its focus toward Teams for video calling and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jabnqG"&gt;Alongside this new Together Mode feature, Microsoft is also adding its Large Grid Mode feature to Skype so you can see everyone’s video stream at the same time. This &lt;a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/release-notes-for-skype-867/38e7d783-fa26-4289-a857-7f6056c633de"&gt;latest version of Skype&lt;/a&gt;, available across Windows, Mac, Linux, and the web, also includes more background options and lets people add friends to ongoing calls by using their phone number.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There is no ‘best’ time to release new Mandalorian episodes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E2OFG9yQ5xP5A7au0JRIwfWzYzI=/75x0:483x272/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548489/mando_finale.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hm4zrI"&gt;For the last eight weeks, waking up on Friday morning has come with a gamble for many &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fans: check Twitter to see the latest headlines &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188706/the-mandalorian-season-2-episode-8-rescue-star-wars-grogu-skywalker-saga"&gt;watch the new &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; before anyone has a chance to spoil it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VV4Rjt"&gt;This week’s episode of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;is a perfect example. The second season finale includes some moments that Twitter’s trending tags and “news for you” curated topic sideline are already ruining. Without getting into spoiler territory here (and use this as a warning to stay away from Twitter if you haven’t seen the finale yet), one of the proposed solutions to this problem seems simple: release the episodes at a later time. Instead of dropping episodes at 3AM ET, why not pivot to 8 or 9PM ET, similar to how &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;used its 9PM slot on Sundays?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZQUuj"&gt;It’s complicated, and it’s important to remember the desire to change the time episodes drop is largely coming from a US audience. There are a couple of key factors to remember here that didn’t impact &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;quite as much:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uAjBwy"&gt;Disney Plus is a global streaming service that debuts its originals at the same time in every region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DlJGiN"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;is a family show, enjoyed by young kids as well as adults&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GqGye0"&gt;Having episodes up early on Friday gives people the weekend to enjoy if they don’t care about spoilers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="hBW8J1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;didn’t run into many of these issues. HBO is still a primarily domestic service, with episodes airing in international territories through other carriers (like Sky in the UK) the next day. HBO can focus on its American audience because that’s where the majority of its customers are. Disney can’t. About 25 percent of Disney Plus’ overall subscriber base is &lt;a href="https://www.afaqs.com/news/media/of-868-million-disney-subscribers-30-are-from-disney-hotstar-company-is-eyeing-350-million-subs-globally-by-2024"&gt;signed up through Hotstar in India&lt;/a&gt;, and the company is rapidly rolling out the streamer to other big regions, like Latin America. While the US is still a major market, it’s not the sole area Disney has to focus on. And 9PM ET on Sunday is too late or too early for a number of other countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUueo0"&gt;Unlike &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;also isn’t a family show. Sure, families &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;watch it together, but it’s likely not the type of series that parents are sitting down with their seven-year-old child to watch. &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;is a show that families with young kids watch together — Baby Yoda is more than just a plot device — and 9PM ET is too late. This came up in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Slack today when I was complaining about waking up at 6:30AM to watch the episode before starting work, which requires Twitter. 9AM ET is great for the UK crowd (5PM their time), but it’s still early, and it’s even earlier for the West Coast of the US. While it seemed like 7 or 8PM ET would be a good compromise, that means it’s 4PM PT for the West Coast crowd (a little early on Friday) and midnight for people in the UK. Better, and one that I prefer, but not perfect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Kqm3s"&gt;Then there’s the most obvious point: not everyone who is watching &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;is starting their days with Twitter or Instagram or TikTok. They might not even see the spoilers — or they possibly don’t care. What a blissful life! For these &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;fans, having the episode drop early on Friday gives them Friday evening and the entire weekend to watch whenever they want. This question — “What is the best time to release new &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;episodes?” — doesn’t apply to them, really, because they’re not bothered by spoilers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zG5QvU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘The Mandalorian’ &lt;/em&gt;is a show that families with young kids watch together, and 9PM ET is too late&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vhqDaZ"&gt;Is there a good time to release new &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;episodes? Depending on who you ask and where they live, the answer varies — but the reason people are asking for episodes at a certain time doesn’t. Fans want that feeling of appointment viewing back. It’s a phrase that we last used with &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad &lt;/em&gt;before it. It’s the anticipation of a new episode (&lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;certainly has that) and making sure you’re situated in front a TV or laptop or phone right when the episode begins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzTRaC"&gt;By the time the episode ends, Twitter is full of jokes and gasps depending on what played out over the last few minutes. Friends who have gotten together for watch parties are bouncing. Memes start spreading. Watching a big show feels more like a communal affair than a solitary activity — something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22151466/avengers-endgame-disney-2020-black-widow-infinity-war-pandemic-streaming-theaters"&gt;we really needed this year&lt;/a&gt;. People want &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;earlier or later because they &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;to experience it with the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NOt21n"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;is the biggest TV event of the year. It’s the thing that rolls around every Friday and we bemoan our friends to hurry up and finish watching because we want to talk about it. People are waking up at different times, they’re busy with kids in the morning, or have any number of other priorities that mean they can’t sit down and watch &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;at 6 or 7 in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfLhnw"&gt;It’s nearly impossible to find a perfect time that works for everyone, so releasing episodes at midnight PT &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;make the most sense, especially in a streaming-dominant world where preference and choice define the watching experience. It just sucks that an event-type show as big as &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;can’t really ever create the same beautiful, appointment TV, communal viewing experience that &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;provided. I predict it’s an issue we’ll see grow as the major streamers expand globally. Think &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;, but again and again. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to keep the bike boom from fizzling out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r1Am_c5giPcg6onGRkpdlHj42xM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548275/VRG_ILLO_4348_BikeBoom.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Og6Kxu"&gt;This year, millions of people turned to bicycles as a safe and socially distanced way to get out of their homes, shake off that cabin fever, and get some fresh air, and suddenly — thanks to COVID — bikes were &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;. But unless concerted efforts are made to ensure people can continue to cycle safely and in great numbers, all those bikes may soon be gathering dust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqrAXv"&gt;Things looked grim at first, with bike sales plummeting as cities went into lockdown. But as the year plodded along, bike sales started really getting up to speed. Popular bikes went on backorder. Local shops and big-box retailers struggled to keep up with demand. The humble bicycle emerged as one of the rare winners of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MBJDR"&gt;For the first time in, well, a century, the playing field was tilted in favor of bikes. Driving rates dropped around the world as people sheltered in place. Cities closed down streets to cars to encourage walking and biking, or repurposed parking spaces for outdoor dining. Some cities, like Paris, Brussels, Seattle, and Oakland, announced plans to make these spaces permanently car-free, in the hopes of encouraging more sustainable transportation to fight climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y0yuPn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For the first time in, well, a century, the playing field was tilted in favor of bikes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s6UlMX"&gt;But the cars are coming back because the cars always come back. Vehicle miles traveled in the US were only down 9 percent in September compared to last year, after dropping nearly 40 percent in April during the height of the first wave. The cycling community is worried about the sustainability of this latest boom. “This could be a once-in-a-generation chance to bolster our ranks by sharing the joy of cycling,” &lt;a href="https://www.bicycling.com/culture/a32781813/keep-new-riders/"&gt;Eben Weiss wrote in &lt;em&gt;Bicycling &lt;/em&gt;magazine in June&lt;/a&gt;. “The last thing we need is to send these new riders back to their SUVs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxsnHw"&gt;The need for the bike boom to roll on beyond the pandemic is about more than the love of cycling, though. You’ll literally breathe easier when you start replacing more car trips with bicycles. We’re talking less carbon emissions, less traffic congestion, and a healthier population — the essential ingredients that make people happier and less stressed out. In the &lt;a href="https://happiness-report.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/WHR20.pdf"&gt;World Happiness Report 2020&lt;/a&gt;, countries with &lt;a href="https://ecf.com/resources/cycling-facts-and-figures"&gt;high bicycle use&lt;/a&gt; tend to be among the happiest overall, like the Netherlands (ranked sixth; daily bike use: 43 percent), Denmark (ranked second; daily bike use: 30 percent), and Finland (ranked first; daily bike use: 28 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnDSo7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bike boom, by the numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0t01z"&gt;A staggering $4.1 billion worth of bikes (excluding e-bikes) were sold in the US between January and October 2020, a 62 percent increase over the same period in 2019, according to the NPD Group, which tracks retail trends. E-bikes showed even more momentum, with $490.8 million in US sales for a 144 percent increase year over year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7alosh"&gt;It’s not just in the US, of course. Europeans are projected to buy an extra 10 million bikes per year by 2020, a whopping 47 percent more than the annual number in 2019. And China, where most of the world’s bikes are manufactured, exported over 40 million bikes in the first nine months of 2020, a number four times the EU’s annual bike production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28dqiS"&gt;Major bike manufacturers saw a huge windfall, with companies like Giant and Dorel (parent of Cannondale, Schwinn, Mongoose, and Pacific) reporting substantial revenue increases throughout the year. And popular e-bike brands like VanMoof, Rad Power Bikes, Gocycle, and many others all say they are doing record sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kiBk4u"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haters gonna hate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJcd9I"&gt;Wall Street is betting that the bike boom will eventually fizzle because they’re ghouls who don’t believe we can have nice things. (Kidding, kidding — please don’t tank my retirement account.) Actually, they assume that Americans will eventually ditch their new two-wheeled friends once a vaccine is widely available — which is a pretty low opinion of our level of commitment, so it’s probably accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBCKBR"&gt;Bike stocks plunged last month on the news that Pfizer had developed an effective coronavirus vaccine, &lt;a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2020/11/13/wall-street-thinks-the-bike-boom-is-over-and-thats-the-problem/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Streetsblog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Giant fell 9 percent, Dorel Sports fell 7.6 percent, and bike parts maker Shimano fell 13.1 percent in one day. A month later, those stocks are still trading lower than at their summer peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5tdVUe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Our enthusiasm for bikes has waxed and waned in the past&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nvyNVL"&gt;Our enthusiasm for bikes has waxed and waned in the past. The invention of the “safety bicycle” with its chain-driven transmission in the 1890s led to one of the biggest bike crazes of all, but it couldn’t survive the advent of the automobile. Another boom in the 1970s, spurred both by the introduction of 10-speed derailleur racing bikes and the oil crisis, faded after gas prices became more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nH4SB5"&gt;Bikes may once again be flying off the shelf, but &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-biking-driving-commute-aa3b4059-958f-4f82-b84f-b0f6d486468c.html"&gt;Americans are actually biking less than in previous years&lt;/a&gt;. This is likely due to the steep drop in overall commuting rates as more workers chose to work from home. It would seem that recreational biking isn’t enough to offset the difference. But we’re also driving a lot less, too. It remains to be seen how it will shake out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoPX3u"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to sustain the boom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YL9Yc9"&gt;It gives me no joy to report that our best hope to keep people riding bicycles may rest with the federal government. The upside is the fixes may be as simple as providing money to cities for protected bike lanes, as well as approving financial incentives like tax credits for new bike and e-bike purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4opw4"&gt;The best way the government can encourage more cycling is to reform automobile regulations, which is likely a heavier lift. Currently, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) assigns safety ratings to new cars and trucks through its New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). But this rating is based solely on risks posed to automobile occupants — and not the danger posed to vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E8z6J9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It gives me no joy to report that our best hope may rest with the federal government&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rV2LKF"&gt;The number of cycling fatalities grew &lt;a href="https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/motor-vehicle/historical-fatality-trends/deaths-by-type-of-incident/"&gt;38 percent from 2008 to 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, the US recorded the highest number of pedestrian deaths in 30 years. This is related to the increase in big SUV and truck sales. The number of pedestrians killed by drivers of oversized vehicles has skyrocketed by 81 percent in the last decade, according to a report released last year by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cb1Ly3"&gt;The European Union’s version of the NCAP is different and obviously better. Vehicles receive a five-star review only if they can demonstrate an ability to come to a complete halt — or at least slow down — before colliding with a pedestrian or cyclist. Under President Obama, NHTSA began the process of &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/12/16/2015-31323/new-car-assessment-program"&gt;revising NCAP to address safety of those outside the vehicle&lt;/a&gt;; under President Trump, that effort was abandoned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0vgim"&gt;President-elect Joe Biden could easily revive these efforts. And given Biden’s affinity for two-wheeled transportation — the incoming president spent a recent Saturday on what looked to be a &lt;a href="https://www.bicycling.com/news/a34728527/joe-jill-biden-delaware-bike-ride/"&gt;delightful bike jaunt around the paved trails of Cape Henlopen State Park in Delaware&lt;/a&gt; — there is hope that he will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaqcSL"&gt;Don’t get me wrong, it will be a fight. Or more accurately, it will be a turf war, as bikes will need to take physical space away from cars to maintain any forward momentum. But there are a lot of positive signs that bikes can gain the upper hand. Bike-share systems are setting records for ridership, and the popularity of electric scooters are helping to send the message to cities that a commitment to protecting the environment starts with protecting those who choose two wheels over four. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJgW5h"&gt;The push to protect cyclists and encourage more biking began long before COVID; let’s keep the fight going after the pandemic is over. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: Two new Google antirust cases and an AirPods Max review </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max earcup removed" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6xXH0EyRgeu85YDcw4g1bvVtJx0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548235/npatel_201209_4332_0060.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QTMjBY"&gt;It seems like there’s no sign of tech news stopping for the holidays. In &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;s &lt;/em&gt;last regular episode of 2020, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Dieter Bohn and Nilay Patel bring on senior reporter Adi Robertson and editor Chris Welch to explain the biggest stories in tech from this past week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jd5sEh"&gt;In the first half of the show, Adi explains two (!) more antitrust cases brought against Google this week: one from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178988/google-antitrust-ad-tech-lawsuit-texas-attorney-general-paxton"&gt;Texas attorney general&lt;/a&gt; and the other from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22186994/google-search-antitrust-lawsuit-colorado-nebraska-state-ags"&gt;a coalition of 38 states&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;breaks down their arguments about Google’s alleged anti-competitive behavior around ad tech and search manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2gnAW"&gt;In the second half of the show, &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; shift gears to a review of the latest product announcement from Apple: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;the AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;. Chris reviewed the new $550 headphones for the site, and he details his experience on the show — from comfortability to design and sound quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaKqS2"&gt;There’s a whole lot more in between all of that — like a privacy debate between Facebook and Apple, some rumors about the next Samsung flagship phones, and the ability to “ProRAW” image capture on the iPhone 12 Pro — so listen through to hear it all. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Time is running out to snag these deals before the holidays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Animal Crossing: New Horizons" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1PhGMFVJ1TXjHlYYFe8JwAYBbt4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548233/Switch_ACNH_0220_Direct_Layout_SCRN_11_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons for the Nintendo Switch offers some much-needed joy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cpkgON"&gt;The holidays are upon us, and we’re just about to enter crunch time for gift-getting. If you haven’t made your selections, it’s possible that gifts might not get where they need to go on time — unless you pay for rush shipping or you take advantage of curbside pickup services. I know that’s a lot of pressure, but if you’re ready to make a few purchases for tech fans in your life, we have a few last-minute suggestions that also happen to be good deals. Depending on the retailer, these might not arrive in time for the holidays, but it’s the thought that counts, right? You’ve got this!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rb-rYrx0aIIqbpRvhnYsRL7skeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19927387/DSCF5984_1_2.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lMg7Sf"&gt;Google’s latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21400695/google-pixel-buds-2-2020-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Pixel Buds&lt;/a&gt; wireless earbuds rarely see a discount, but they’re $35 off at online store Antonline. Normally $179, &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/google/pixel_buds"&gt;they’re $144&lt;/a&gt; when you enter the code &lt;strong&gt;antfarm&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. This deal is available until December 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yO3sUFwh9SHcxCjhbb_m1O4BWY8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21699852/IMG_0626-1.0.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FRSHkA"&gt;Sony’s ever-popular WH-1000XM4 wireless, noise-canceling headphones are $278 at several retailers, which is the same $72 discount we’ve seen pop up a few times this season. Normally $349, they’re a solid option if you want high-end sound and effective noise cancellation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9kcIwS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9523565"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1lhEhV"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro are still selling for a great price at Woot. $190 is the best price heading into the holidays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eGiBjG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LiwFZ5"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show series of smart displays just got Zoom support, so you can easily boot up a video call with family over the holidays. The most affordable model is the Echo Show 5, which is just $45 at a few retailers. If you want a bigger display and better sound performance, check out the Echo Show 8 for $80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g4uAJZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="yjmxPa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NLClPI"&gt;Giving your home Wi-Fi signal a boost is never a bad idea. If you or a loved one has a one-router setup that just isn’t cutting it with the work-from-home lifestyle that the pandemic has forced us into, check out this deal on a three-pack of Eero 6 mesh Wi-Fi routers. Normally $279, you can get them for $223 at Best Buy and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kyOOYe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603441"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ScwMZ2"&gt;If you’re new to the Nintendo Switch and are in need of some games, a few of the best are discounted, including &lt;em&gt;Pok&lt;/em&gt;é&lt;em&gt;mon Sword&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shield, Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2VlfjW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="DEjyKW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514849"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="QdeD6P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10241211"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="turCoo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zreOKq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s holiday event brings back airplanes</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TBxLaG9xeb1R9Ge9xyFFuwQ2rKw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548224/fortnite_snowmando_quest_frost_squad_and_snowmando_outfits_1920x1080_2177b76f5c5c.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LYRfLK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s annual holiday event is back, and this time, it brings a surprise: the return of airplanes. “&lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/operation-snowdown-starts-now-in-fortnite-unlock-free-outfits-take-flight-and-more"&gt;Operation Snowdown&lt;/a&gt;,” as it’s called, lasts from December 18th to January 5th, and it adds the expected to the game, including a snowy map and free unlockables like a soldier snowman called Snowmando. Everyone who logs in before January 5th will also get a free caroling emote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sO2KGL"&gt;The biggest feature, though, is the return of airplanes. The timing is perfect: planes were first introduced in season 7, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128743/fortnite-season-7-trailer-details-battle-pass"&gt;back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, which was also a winter-themed update for the game. (There was even a militarized Santa character.) They were later removed, and it sounds like their latest appearance will be short-lived as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uIgCMh"&gt;In addition to the new missions and free unlockable cosmetics, the event will also include a rotating selection of limited time game modes, starting with the return of Air Royale. There will also be new holiday-themed items for purchase, including a shifty-looking candy cane man.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NBzyDm"&gt;It’s been a busy month for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;a massive supervillain-themed live event&lt;/a&gt;, the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;kicked off its latest season on December 2nd&lt;/a&gt;, introducing new characters like the Mandalorian and Baby Yoda. Since then, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166187/fortnite-master-chief-halo-the-walking-dead-the-game-awards"&gt;Master Chief&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22151470/fortnite-god-of-war-kratos-skin-now-available"&gt;Kratos&lt;/a&gt; have joined the battle royale game, and Epic has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176382/fortnite-epic-120-fps-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;continued to improve &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on next-gen consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1SbcAl"&gt;For a show about a tiny alien, &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; sure had a huge impact. The first season of the series helped sell millions on Disney Plus, the company’s Netflix-style streaming service, while simultaneously showing how the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; universe could translate to prestige television. It was, to put it succinctly, a hit — one that became even more popular thanks to the adorable Baby Yoda. Er, I mean, &lt;em&gt;The Child&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwG2Cb"&gt;The second season, meanwhile, faces a very different challenge. Not only does it have to live up to the hype generated by season 1, but it’s also releasing at a time when many of the biggest movies and TV shows have been indefinitely delayed due to the ongoing pandemic, making it arguably the biggest entertainment release of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9llms4"&gt;To help you keep track of everything related to the show — reviews of the latest episodes, analyses on what its success means for Disney’s business, and yes, cute pictures of Baby Yoda — we’ve created this landing page to gather up all of the biggest &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; stories in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5C5C7"&gt;If you need to stay up to date — this is the way.&lt;/p&gt;
