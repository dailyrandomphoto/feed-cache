    <title>Dell XPS 13 OLED review: more pixels, more money</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 OLED open on a table. The screen displays a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PsiB3M7WzHEs8SHxacpdDnxP8uc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69449719/mchin_20190905_4631_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Dell XPS 13 OLED.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CN1B9P"&gt;If you’ve been waiting for a 13-inch laptop with the best display technology out there, Dell now has an option for you. Dell has finally released an &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=VergeDellXPS13OLEDReview061121&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fnew-xps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fxn9310cto235h" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OLED version of its XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m typing this review on it right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7d1kN"&gt;The test unit I was sent has a Core i7-1185G7, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. The OLED configuration costs exactly the same as an identically specced non-OLED 4K model ($1,699.99), and $300 more than an identically specced FHD touchscreen model. Nothing else about this XPS is new: it has the same thin and light build, the same tiny bezels and webcam, the same glass-fiber palm rests, and the same 16:10 aspect ratio as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;past couple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221003/dell-xps-13-2020-review-core-i7-specs-features-price"&gt;Dell XPS 13s&lt;/a&gt; I’ve reviewed. So the considerations here really come down to how much you need an OLED screen and what you’re willing to sacrifice for it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="m94km9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dell XPS 13 (late-2020) review: greatness, refined","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"},{"title":"Best laptop 2021: 15 best laptops you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 seen from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G4OcF4ImdiKj6q7kChY6-3Kif2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653795/mchin_20190905_4631_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It looks just like the previous XPS 13.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RVuPNN"&gt;The display itself is great. It’s a 3.5K (3456 x 2160) panel with a claimed 100,000:1 contrast ratio. It maxed out our colorimeter, covering 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut. It’s not as bright as the FHD model but is still plenty bright, maxing out at 369 nits. I had no problem using the device outside and was usually using it below 30 percent brightness while indoors. Numbers aside, it delivers a really gorgeous picture with bright and vibrant colors and sharp details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I03TfK"&gt;The downside, of course, is that there is some battery life impact. I haven’t reviewed the 4K Dell XPS 13, so I can’t speak to that unit’s longevity. But compared to the FHD model I reviewed, the OLED model struggles on the battery life front. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 OLED closed seen from the left side on a wooden table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NU9n_cQXEdnfVi_xRWOvCtjGnHc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653796/mchin_20190905_4631_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not too many ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="imSQve"&gt;Battery life, for context, has been a huge selling point of other XPS 13 models. I averaged nine hours and 15 minutes using the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=VergeDellXPS13OLEDReview061121&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fnew-xps-13-touch-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fxn9310cto230h%3Fconfigurationid%3D7d01f270-b71e-4488-a6e9-56ab3a967927" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;FHD model&lt;/a&gt; as my primary work driver around 200 nits of brightness. With the OLED model, I was getting about five hours from the same workload at the same brightness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vJCWF"&gt;That’s... well, that’s a big gap. And it should be a serious consideration if you’re thinking of purchasing this device. After all, the FHD display is still pretty darn good. The blacks on my review unit weren’t as deep as they were on this OLED panel, but the picture it delivered was still fantastic and not something my un-artistic eyes had any problems with. (On the other hand, the non-OLED 4K display also doesn’t seem to have great battery life, &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/dell-xps-13-2020"&gt;per&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/dell-xps-13-model-9310-4k"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Dell-XPS-13-9300-4K-UHD-Laptop-Review-16-10-is-the-New-16-9.464337.0.html"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;. So the OLED is more competitive with that model, especially since it’s the same price.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Intel Evo sticker on the bottom right corner of the Dell XPS 13 OLED." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4pV_lRH5nBqf-s_oJRzfriPIvb8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653797/mchin_20190905_4631_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s Evo-certified, despite the battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cXIOBO"&gt;For that reason, I would still recommend that most people go for the FHD XPS 13 over the OLED model. Five hours is not great battery life, but it’s especially not great for an ultraportable laptop this close to the $2,000 mark. It’s certainly a dealbreaker for me, even if everything else about a laptop is perfect. It means I’d have to have this thing plugged in multiple times a day, even though one of its primary benefits is supposed to be that it’s light enough to carry around wherever. I want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpazZ4"&gt;Meanwhile, as nice as the OLED screen is, I can’t imagine it’ll make a huge quality-of-life difference to all but the most discerning of viewers. It certainly shouldn’t be a big enough difference to outweigh a $300 premium and a four-hour hit to battery life. If you’re someone for whom the OLED is worth the price, you probably know who you are. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 OLED lid on a wooden table seen from the top." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dURjdBErq8wET1b1gVuT4iDFsec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653798/mchin_20190905_4631_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buy it for $1,699.99.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="NPjFM7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10606062"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Beats announces $149.99 Studio Buds earbuds with active noise cancellation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QgCrrFNMKZpmYLR95-kVeol0Sss=/0x0:1665x1110/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69449666/3FAM_COMP_KV_WhiteBG_RGB_v3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Beats&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mu6IjI"&gt;Beats today announced its second pair of true wireless earbuds, the new Beats Studio Buds.  Priced at $149.99 and available in red, black, or white, the Studio Buds have a much different, more compact design than the previous Powerbeats Pro. There are no ear hooks on these, nor any stems, and that results in a very lightweight, comfortable fit. Preorders start today in the US and Canada from Apple and other retailers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Cancelling-Earbuds-Built-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B096SSCV5K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fbeats-by-dr-dre-beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earphones-beats-red%2F4900921.p%3FskuId%3D4900921&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and the earbuds will be available in stores on June 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7Lt2e"&gt;The Studio Buds include active noise cancellation, IPX4 water and sweat resistance, and can last for up to five hours on a charge. (If you leave noise cancellation off, they can eke out eight hours of continuous playback. They also use USB-C for charging — there’s no wireless charging, unfortunately — and either earbud can be used independently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDwELo9-MOlt2IXkYhsfvqgJWvs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657571/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_10.13.54_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beats&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Studio Buds have a sleek, lightweight design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O8qH2S"&gt;Interestingly, Beats is supporting both iOS and Android features with the Studio Buds. On iPhone, you get the familiar, easy AirPods-like setup and Control Center integration. They can also do hands-free “Hey Siri” commands. On Android, Beats now works with Fast Pair and Google’s Find My Device features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HlBrz"&gt;Beats came up with an all-new acoustic architecture design for the Studio Buds, which have  8.2-millimeter drivers, and the company claims you can expect “outstanding stereo separation and low harmonic distortion across the frequency curve so you hear every note.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loR4Kw"&gt;If you’re wondering how the Studio Buds might stack up to the AirPods Pro or other competitors, I’ve been spending some time testing the just-announced earbuds, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22297011"&gt;read my full review of the Beats Studio Buds here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beats Studio Buds review: big ambition, imperfect execution</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Beats tried to do a lot at once — probably too much — with its new earbuds&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="YY8TLa"&gt;The new Studio Buds are Beats’ second pair of true wireless earbuds and follow the Powerbeats Pro, which remain my pick for the best all-around earbuds for fitness purposes like running or hitting the gym. With its latest pair, Beats is hoping to attract a much wider audience. That starts with the price, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Cancelling-Earbuds-Built-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B096SSCV5K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which is $149.99&lt;/a&gt; — a full $100 less than the AirPods Pro. For the first time in Beats earbuds, they include active noise cancellation. And with other new features, Beats is extending an olive branch to Android users, which might come as a surprise for a brand that’s owned by Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSlAkF"&gt;Beats says it has put an incredible amount of work into how the Studio Buds sound. That’s where they’re supposed to exceed expectations for the price. But you don’t get everything under the sun for $150; the most obvious missing piece is wireless charging. And their noise cancellation and transparency modes don’t keep pace with some pricier earbuds, including the AirPods Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="170UiG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10605844"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YCRpFH"&gt;The Studio Buds have a small, light stem-less design that loses the ear hooks of the Powerbeats Pro. They look downright miniature in comparison. And the weight difference is also substantial: each of the Studio Buds is 5.1 grams, which is far more comfortable on your ears than the 20-gram Powerbeats Pro. They’re also slightly lighter than the AirPods Pro, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro, Anker’s Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro, Jabra’s Elite 85t/75t, and many others on the market. There’s a tiny micro-venting hole meant to reduce that clogged-up pressure feeling in your ear, and Beats includes the standard three sizes of silicone ear tips. Fit is a big plus; the Studio Buds feel extremely comfortable and never fatigued my ears at any point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pxu9b74Hlrtv0mppsw60BH15a4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657483/DSCF4186_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Studio Buds are much smaller than the previous Powerbeats Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BRCiyN"&gt;Beats leaned on learnings from its prior earbuds (and those from Apple) as it worked on this design; it also went through some prototyping with consumers to land on the final form factor. The outward-facing side is contoured around a diagonal pill-shaped “b” button. It’s tactile and actually presses in instead of relying on capacitive touch sensors. I greatly prefer this approach since you won’t have to deal with accidental presses as often when adjusting the earbuds. The button only requires a light press, so you’re not constantly jamming the buds deeper into your ears. Controls work identically on both sides: press once to play / pause, twice to skip tracks, three to go back, and long-press to toggle between ANC on / transparency / off. You can customize the long-press to activate a voice assistant instead, but that’s as far as Beats lets you switch things up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gma9wU"&gt;The oval charging case is mercifully way smaller than the giant one that holds the Powerbeats Pro, and the red color of my review unit is quite eye-catching. There’s also something reassuring about how strongly the Studio Buds are magnetically pulled into their slots. I’m hopeful these will avoid the occasional only-one-earbud-actually-charged failures of the Powerbeats Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sGvBfVOHAlKqpDIQbDEl_g4wlUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657689/DSCF4150_Edited_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The charging case is also much more pocketable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MnIpuA"&gt;I’d say the most curious thing about the Studio Buds hardware is what’s been left out: there’s no Apple-made chip inside these. The Powerbeats Pro, Powerbeats, and even the $50 Beats Flex neckband earbuds all have one of Apple’s branded chips inside — either the H1 or W1 — for features like instant setup, automatic pairing across all Apple devices that are signed in to your iCloud account, and audio sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GV5m4y"&gt;Despite the lack of Apple silicon, Beats has managed to replicate some of those conveniences through software. The Studio Buds support hands-free “Hey Siri” voice commands. When you pop open the case near an iPhone for the first time, you’ll see the familiar setup screen (or at least something close) slide up from the bottom, just like with AirPods or other Beats products. The Studio Buds even have special integration in Control Center: you can switch between noise-canceling and transparency modes from here just as you can with the AirPods Pro. They’ll also automatically play &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;Apple Music’s new Dolby Atmos spatial audio tracks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zc0YdryhvbS2pdaO2u1oOJp3-DI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657522/beatsios.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite having no Apple chip inside, the Studio Buds replicate some AirPods features through software.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6SJFtd"&gt;But the illusion only stretches so far. If you go looking for them, you’ll notice MIA features that would’ve been present if the Studio Buds contained a proper Apple chip. Pairing them with your iPhone does&lt;em&gt; not &lt;/em&gt;sync them across your other iCloud devices. Audio sharing is nowhere to be found. And the Studio Buds lack the ability to automatically hop between an iPhone, iPad, and Mac based on whichever one you’re actively using. (They don’t have multipoint, either.) These are minor sacrifices, but they do put the Studio Buds behind Apple’s headphones or even other Beats models in terms of supporting Apple’s ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MQGZobYriTob3jes0osz-_O1RaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657477/DSCF4104_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a tactile “b” button on each earbud for controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J_1tGg-5HbFirbYaxZHFLpsu19E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657476/DSCF4102_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case has enough juice for two extra top-offs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fOp5tN"&gt;My hunch is that Beats likely had to leave out Apple silicon in order to include Android-specific features. The Studio Buds go farther than any of the company’s recent products in accommodating Android listeners. First of all, they charge via USB-C. They also support Fast Pair, so they’ll automatically be linked to your Google account after initial setup. Both the earbuds and case now natively appear in Android’s Bluetooth settings, where you can see their battery status or see the location where they were last paired to your phone. (This means the earbuds support both Apple’s Find My network and Google’s equivalent.) But you don’t get hands-free Google Assistant, which was probably a bridge too far for an Apple-owned company to make happen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WPqk0BPZKcrl6ez-IRTBqyo1LhU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657533/android.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beats now supports native Android features like Fast Pair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aVfFdp"&gt;Now onto the sound. The Beats Studio Buds feature a new driver architecture, so while the company aimed for its signature “powerful” sound, there’s a noticeable difference when you compare these to the Powerbeats Pro. Each has its own strengths. If you care most about driving bass to keep you motivated during exercise, the older earbuds still edge these out. The Powerbeats Pro sound still comes through as punchier to me. But the Studio Buds are better balanced with increased clarity and separation across the frequency range. Whereas the Powerbeats Pro tend to deemphasize the mids, they’re not as lost in the shuffle here. The EQ has improved refinement, though it’s still the usual curve that lifts the bass and treble, and highs can sometimes give off more sibilance than I’d prefer. Overall, the Studio Buds sound plenty good, but for all of the talk about proprietary acoustic diaphragms and custom-built drivers, Beats isn’t flipping the script on what to expect for this amount of money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLQeRO"&gt;And it needs to do better elsewhere. Passive noise isolation on the Studio Buds still leaves something to be desired. Even with a good seal, you’re not going to feel especially blocked off from the outside world. And unfortunately, Beats’ noise cancellation system is one of the weaker showings you’ll find in this price range. Beats says it dynamically adapts the strength of noise cancellation based on ambient noise, but I was underwhelmed in most scenarios where I tested it. The Studio Buds do a poor job at eliminating basic traffic street noise, which makes me wary of how they’d manage on a plane. The transparency mode also lacks the natural feeling of the AirPods Pro and other premium buds like the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. You don’t have to spend a hundred dollars more to get better results: to my ears, Amazon’s second-generation Echo Buds surpass the Studio Buds in both noise cancellation and transparency mode for less money than the Beats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="fEy0XW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10605857"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dPNF3r"&gt;Battery life is rated at around five hours with noise cancellation active or eight without, and the case can provide two additional top-offs. The Studio Buds are rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance, making them workout-ready and splash-proof. And you can use either earbud independently if you want to keep one of your ears free. Voice call performance was pretty rough outdoors in busy environments, and callers found it difficult to make out my voice from the background noise. Things improved some indoors, but mic performance is another area where the Studio Buds lag competitors and their compact design might be working against them. Another annoyance is that these buds don’t have any kind of sensors to detect when they’ve been removed from your ears, so music won’t pause automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t5DdrjvwzwPRaBjnLjoAVMhbH3k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657478/DSCF4120_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Studio Buds can last for five hours with noise cancellation on or eight with it off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3gqVMt8RSea7mFrg2fCoodvCL-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657482/DSCF4162_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;They’re also rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NPAK9f"&gt;There are aspects of the Beats Studio Buds that I really like. They’re remarkably comfortable and have simple, easy controls. It’s good that the company is shifting to a more even-handed strategy that appeals to both iPhone and Android users. And the sound is enjoyable and detailed, if not earth-shattering for $150. But they settle for mediocre active noise cancellation, lack wireless charging, and come with an incomplete grab bag of Apple ecosystem bells and whistles. It feels like Beats tried to do a little too much all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="t3XExT"&gt;If you already have the Powerbeats Pro and are happy with them, there’s not much about the Studio Buds that warrants an upgrade. Like a lot of rivals battling it out at this price, they’re perfectly adequate, but they lack any one must-have standout thing. Considering the cultural clout that the Beats brand still possesses, that still might be enough for them to be a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bo8d5Q"&gt;Father’s Day is coming up this weekend. Not to nag, but time is running out to buy a gift and have it delivered on time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22410178/fathers-day-best-gift-ideas-tech-gadgets-tools"&gt;We’ve put together a gift guide&lt;/a&gt; that’s full of fun ideas. And with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;Prime Day 2021&lt;/a&gt; just around the corner on June 21st and 22nd, more and more products are available with a discount. You’ll find today’s best deals just below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dELr0N"&gt;The 2021 version of Amazon’s Echo Buds are $80 for Prime members today, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Buds/dp/B085WTYQ4X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing $40 less than their original price&lt;/a&gt; (you’ll need to be logged into your Prime account to see the lower price). If you want a wireless charging case, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085WTWYS4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that model costs $100&lt;/a&gt; — also reflecting a $40 discount. Amazon has been discounting many of its own tech products in the lead-up to Prime Day 2021, but this is one of its most appealing deals yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JSqamO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to sign up for Amazon Prime","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21493780/amazon-prime-sign-up-day-deals-sale-price-free"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="AgIFjq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;audio expert &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Chris Welch posted a review&lt;/a&gt; for this model in mid-May, and he called the new Echo Buds “smaller, lighter, and more comfortable” than the previous generation and said that they have better noise cancellation. For the price, he thought they have “satisfying” sound quality and a great passthrough mode to help you hear your surroundings without removing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8ibx9S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="weNNaq"&gt;Another great deal is on Google’s Nest Audio smart speaker. Originally $100 each, Best Buy &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743407508072594734#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has every color for $75&lt;/a&gt; and Google’s eBay storefront is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F224299001839%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeEchoBuds40off061421%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F14%2F22532977%2Famazon-echo-buds-deal-prime-day-google-nest-audio-hub-fathers-day" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling the blue-colored model for $75&lt;/a&gt;. This is the lowest price that we’ve seen yet. The Nest Audio is the successor to the original Google Home speaker that released in 2016, and the newer model brings improved audio quality, as well as the ability to connect to a second speaker for stereo sound. Check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dan Seifert’s review&lt;/a&gt; if you want to learn more about the Nest Audio before buying one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pBGpd8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503894"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OlEuo5"&gt;Google’s second-generation Nest Hub is also seeing a sizable discount. Originally $100, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743409769677447969#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s now $80 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This new model can track your sleep by using a Soli radar chip to monitor movements. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In Dan Seifert’s review&lt;/a&gt;, he says “this new sleep tracking feature works very well — it’s by far the easiest and most comfortable way to track sleep that I’ve tested.” Otherwise, it’s great as a digital photo frame, like the previous generation. If you can put up with its sluggish speed, you’ll get better audio performance than Google’s first-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P8k9qD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625445"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aDLfUA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PMT4T11?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s Halo costs $70&lt;/a&gt; for Prime members today — another lowest-ever price to amp up anticipation for Prime Day. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This fitness tracker&lt;/a&gt; includes a six-month membership ($3.99 per month after that) to a service that’s filled with unique features, like being able to use your smartphone’s camera to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22465737/amazon-halo-fitness-phone-camera-measure-movement-health" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;assess your “Movement Health.”&lt;/a&gt; It can also do a body fat scan, in addition to tracking simpler metrics like your sleep and physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vTGLV8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10269519"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1usZpH"&gt;One of the latest Fire TV Edition models is cheaper than ever for Prime members. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Insignia’s new 55-inch 4K Fire TV Edition television is $350&lt;/a&gt; (usually $500), and it has Fire TV software built in, so you don’t need to purchase a standalone streaming box. This is one of the few Fire TV Edition models that supports HDR10, but another standout feature is its HDMI ARC and eARC support, letting you push audio from the TV to a soundbar with just an HDMI cable instead of requiring additional audio cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ErNegW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10605845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The Legion 5 Pro is Lenovo’s best gaming laptop yet</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Packed with power and stellar features for a great price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="AGA19r"&gt;The Lenovo Legion 5 Pro makes a lot of things seem easy. At its core, it’s a gaming laptop that plays games very well. But it also has a wonderfully expansive 16-inch QHD (technically WQXGA, since it’s 2560 x 1600) resolution display that’s great for gaming and other use cases. Notably, this is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7"&gt;16:10 aspect ratio screen&lt;/a&gt;, and my eyeballs appreciate the luxury of having more stuff to look at without needing to scroll or resize windows to fit within view. Lenovo’s combo of a taller, high-resolution screen is what you’ll want in your next gaming laptop, even if you don’t know it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMK5UO"&gt;This laptop is full of other delights, like its TrueStrike keyboard. It’s a &lt;em&gt;stuffed &lt;/em&gt;layout, with a numpad, a full row of function keys, and dedicated media keys, yet it’s comfortable to use and thoughtfully arranged. It doesn’t come at the expense of a sizable, responsive trackpad, either. For any kind of media, the Legion 5 Pro also has better-than-average speakers that are actually pleasant to listen to, as opposed to most gaming laptop speakers that make me writhe in anguish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fzFMI"&gt;There are a handful of recent gaming laptops that have the Legion 5 Pro beat with a thinner build — not that I’d call Lenovo’s 16-inch model thick, per se. Still, it wears its larger size well with a slick design that doesn’t forget to include a good amount of ports. Also, this laptop allows for user-upgradeable RAM and storage (it has two RAM slots and two M.2 slots), which is a perk that thinner gaming laptops usually can’t achieve due to space constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YQ8lhG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10602138"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AgMx5b"&gt;Every laptop has compromises, but the few that Lenovo’s Legion 5 Pro has aren’t as apparent as they are in some other models. I’m willing to overlook its average battery life and paltry 512GB of storage, as it’s priced &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;competitively &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-Legion-5-Pro-16-0-AMD-Ryzen-7-5800H-16GB-512GB-NVMe-TLC-SSD-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3070-Windows-10-Home-82JQ008NUS%2F231609645&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at $1,529.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo Legion 5 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/khIUMlJ2ktXDrUOk3uifG72ZgZ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653564/cfaulkner_20210608_4624_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legion 5 Pro is a looker, at least compared to other gaming laptops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo Legion 5 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fXh7yzRcU3Fc4HIwqX1x1kKCoWk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653553/cfaulkner_20210607_4624_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This laptop has air exhausts at its rear and on its sides, and it doesn’t get too warm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="3ZUbam"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10602891"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5CBRSH"&gt;The configuration that’ll be available at Walmart in late June features 16GB of RAM and 512GB of NVMe storage — both of which are user-upgradeable (though half a terabyte fills up awfully fast these days). AMD’s octa-core Ryzen 7 5800H processor is powering the show, along with a capable variant of Nvidia’s RTX 3070 with 140W of maximum graphics power and a 1,560MHz boost clock speed. Paired with its higher-res display, this hardware can provide respectable frame rates across the board, even in titles that feature demanding ray tracing settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WU0XnZ"&gt;Getting right into the performance, I ran a few demanding games at its native 2560 x 1600 resolution with the highest possible graphics settings. &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt; ran at an average of 59 frames per second; &lt;em&gt;Horizon: Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; hit 73 frames per second. Both are respectable results, especially given that this laptop is running them at higher than 1080p resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXOoIL"&gt;Even games with ray-traced graphics fared well, including &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;. With &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;’s ray-traced shadows and Nvidia’s DLSS feature turned on, it ran at an average of 63 frames per second (DLSS lowers the render resolution, then relies on an AI model to touch up the aliasing and textures to look nearly just as good as running a game at native resolution, without as much of a hit to performance). With &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, a game that has more ray tracing graphics options, the Legion 5 Pro maintained a steady 45 frames per second with all of the most demanding settings and DLSS on — an impressive feat. Turning down the ray tracing features to medium instead of high (with DLSS still on) boosts the average frame rate to around 60 frames per second. Without any ray tracing effects, the 5 Pro can run &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;at the display’s native 1600p resolution at around 70 frames per second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo Legion 5 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rGSNX8KDBsSD6QPBoU_OzUhML00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653560/cfaulkner_20210607_4624_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The display has thin bezels, but Lenovo didn’t forget to include a webcam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo Legion 5 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mhsELSKUxgnfuF0UQGePEpxVAz4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653551/cfaulkner_20210607_4624_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legion 5 Pro has a healthy amount of ports on its rear. There are more around the sides.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s9j0Z8"&gt;Some context is necessary to understand how those numbers stack up against our current favorite gaming laptop, the slightly more pricey Asus ROG Zephyrus G15, which has a 1440p QHD screen (slightly lower resolution than this one), a faster octa-core Ryzen 9 5900HS processor, and an RTX 3070 with a lower 100W power ceiling. The results come out in favor of the Legion 5 Pro, as it squeezed just a few more frames per second out of each game (&lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t tested on the G15 during our review period), a testament to its higher-powered GPU being able to push impressive frame rates to an even higher-res 1600p resolution display. It’s all the more impressive that the 5 Pro doesn’t get too loud or hot during gameplay. It exhausts warm air out the left and right sides, as well as on the back. During the winter months, the flow of toasty air seems like a perk if you use a standalone mouse off to the side, but it might be annoying if you get warm easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llevmo"&gt;I recently tested the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22518545/alienware-m15-r5-ryzen-edition-review-7-5800h-nvidia-rtx-3060-features-specs-performance"&gt;Alienware M15 R5&lt;/a&gt;, which has the same Ryzen 7 5800H processor, but with an RTX 3060 with 125W of maximum graphics power. Like the Legion 5 Pro, this model has user-upgradeable RAM and storage. Though, the M15 R5’s $1,616 configuration comes with a 1080p display, so its GPU is under far less stress than the faster one in Lenovo’s. Given that this Lenovo Legion 5 Pro is priced at about $50 more — and is superior in several ways outside of performance — I’d just suggest you forget about Alienware’s model, as you’ll get less for your money there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Y-shaped logo illuminates white when the laptop is on, and it glistens when it’s off. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo Legion 5 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8p_g-52ZMiNqvOCe9M-5-XzOH70=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653561/cfaulkner_20210607_4624_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo crammed so much into this keyboard layout, but it’s still easy to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xntF0H"&gt;The high frame rates are easier to appreciate here than on some other models because of Lenovo’s 165Hz refresh rate G-Sync display. Games feel responsive, and they look great. The panel specs say that it can reach 500 nits of brightness, and that it’s certified for color accuracy by X-Rite and Pantone. I didn’t have tools on hand to put those claims to the test, but the colors look accurate and the screen gets bright enough to make it possible to work outdoors or to sit next to a window that’s giving off some glare without squinting to see text or images. I didn’t need to turn the brightness up higher than halfway for most tasks, and that setting seems like the peak brightness of some gaming laptops that I’ve used before (the ROG Zephyrus G15 claims to reach 300 nits of brightness). Turning up the brightness while gaming made the experience appear more cinematic, like watching on a bright TV. Viewing angles are wide and generous, too, and it provides a serviceable image on lower brightness settings if you’re trying to conserve battery. Lastly, I appreciate how thin the bezels are surrounding the display — even the chin bezel at the bottom is barely there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13ZFSx"&gt;The 5 Pro has an 80Wh battery that lasts for about four and a half hours under normal productivity (not gaming) use, and that’s with all of the usual battery-saving measures taken. I dialed in the efficiency settings to “better battery” mode in Windows 10 and to “hybrid mode” in Lenovo’s preinstalled Vantage software to ensure the Legion 5 Pro isn’t relying solely on the RTX 3070. This result isn’t nearly as good as some other powerful gaming laptops we’ve tested that have one of AMD’s Zen 3 CPUs inside, like Alienware’s M15 R5 that provides about seven hours, the eight-plus hours we saw with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt; (while powering a QHD screen), and over nine hours in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="njXK7z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10602911"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7VMaYk"&gt;Four and a half hours of battery life isn’t bad for a gaming laptop, considering two to three hours was both expected and excusable in 2019 and 2020 models. But the competition has raised the bar in this department in such a way that this weaker performance is one of the Legion 5 Pro’s more glaring issues. Its 300W power brick is also quite large. Lenovo earns some props, though, for supporting USB-C charging (up to 65W), and its Rapid Charge Pro feature that claims to quickly recharge the laptop up to 50 percent in 30 minutes (it actually recharged a &lt;em&gt;staggering &lt;/em&gt;80 percent from zero in less than 30 minutes). But still, if longevity is essential for you, this might knock the Legion 5 Pro off from being a top pick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMKxf9"&gt;As I mentioned earlier, Lenovo’s TrueStrike keyboard is very good. It has four-zone programmable backlighting with 1.5mm travel per key and 100 percent anti-ghosting. It was effortless for me to adapt to the layout and feel both in and out of gameplay. Lenovo says it increased the size of its precision trackpad by 23 percent based on user feedback on previous Lenovo Legion gaming laptops. The Legion 5 Pro has a 720p webcam, which delivers passable image quality. Some of Asus’ gaming laptops that we recommend don’t feature a webcam, but in case that’s a deal-breaker feature, you might be glad to find one here. It has an electronic on / off switch on the right side of the chassis, as the bezel hosting the webcam is apparently too thin for Lenovo to fit in a physical cover over the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo Legion 5 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dVCG-0knLay3Ilmnuf6KObVvwuo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653555/cfaulkner_20210607_4624_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most of the ports are around back, but the left side hosts this USB-C port and a headphone combo jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo Legion 5 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IkpPmm_coFCAOsyLVqeecBp7IBQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653554/cfaulkner_20210607_4624_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The electronic switch for the webcam and a USB Type-A port are on the right side of the Legion 5 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KgdrUs"&gt;Trying to figure out which gaming laptop offers the most value can make your head spin. It’s easy to find powerful models, but it’s far less simple to find one that’s multifaceted to handle more than just games. The Legion 5 Pro doesn’t get everything right — namely battery life. But it’s the gaming laptop to beat right now when it comes to powerful specs, a big, high-res display, and a handful of other niceties, like decent sound quality, a good keyboard, and user-upgradeability. It earned a spot at the top alongside Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G15, with user-upgradability and power in place of Asus’ good battery life and lightweight design. Now, we’ll have to wait to see how Asus answers with its Intel-based &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22425078/asus-intel-zephyrus-m16-gaming-laptop-tiger-lake-h-chips"&gt;ROG Zephyrus M16&lt;/a&gt;, a 16-inch gaming laptop with a similar 16:10 aspect ratio display.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft to end Windows 10 support on October 14th, 2025</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bhb6kCBxm4HB7OUFuf5adZ3XCFo=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69449073/windowslogo_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dante D’Orazio / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="chG9SQ"&gt;Microsoft is ending support for Windows 10 on October 14th, 2025. It will mark just over 10 years since the operating system was first introduced. Microsoft revealed the retirement date for Windows 10 in an updated &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-home-and-pro"&gt;support life cycle page&lt;/a&gt; for the OS. &lt;a href="https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/251736/windows-10-support-ends-on-october-14-2025"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thurrott&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that this is the first time Microsoft has ever described the end of support for Windows 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ajzah0"&gt;It’s not clear exactly when the support document was updated, but &lt;em&gt;Thurrott&lt;/em&gt; reports it only previous documented “when specific Windows 10 versions would leave support,” and not the entire OS. It could be another hint that a new version of Windows is on the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DnZw65"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft keeps dropping Windows 11 hints&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7bFXyG"&gt;Microsoft has been dropping lots of hints that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466394/microsoft-windows-11-launch-teaser-rumors"&gt;ready to launch Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. The software maker is holding a special Windows event to reveal the “next generation” of the OS next week. The event starts at 11AM ET, and the event invite includes a window that creates a shadow with an outline that looks like the number 11. Microsoft execs have also been teasing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453222/microsoft-windows-next-generation-announcement-sun-valley-build-2021-keynote"&gt;“next generation of Windows” announcement&lt;/a&gt; for months, and one even described it as a “new version of Windows” recently. Microsoft also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528115/microsoft-windows-11-startup-sound-new-teaser-video"&gt;teased Windows 11 during an 11-minute video&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0cwxe"&gt;We’re expecting Microsoft to announce a new version of Windows with significant user interface changes, and an overhaul to the Windows Store. Microsoft has been working on something codenamed “Sun Valley,” which the company has referred to as a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;.” There will be many other changes, so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466394/microsoft-windows-11-launch-teaser-rumors"&gt;read our previous coverage for what to expect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X_SH6v9iEEDYwVrtRSrlYFtbWGM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22495503/Windows_10_Sun_Valley_refresh.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’re expecting to see a new version of Windows soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YhQCiN"&gt;Microsoft originally committed to 10 years of support for Windows 10, with an original mainstream end of support date set for October 13th, 2020. That mainstream end of support has not yet commenced, as Microsoft has been introducing regular updates and extending active Windows 10 support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsFc2I"&gt;We’re still not in the extended support phase of Windows 10 yet, which is the period when Microsoft doesn’t add new features to an operating system and simply maintains support with bug fixes and security patches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGT8NG"&gt;Windows 10 has been an unusual release for Microsoft, as it moved away from its typical cadence of releasing a new version of the OS every few years. Instead, Microsoft moved Windows to more of a service, updating it twice a year with new features. Microsoft may have described Windows 10 as “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/7/8568473/windows-10-last-version-of-windows"&gt;the last version of Windows&lt;/a&gt;,” but it has now been nearly six years since its release and Microsoft looks ready to move on to something new.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon wants you vaccinated, so here’s $180 AirPods Pro and other accessory discounts  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9-ZJMAVDO75nkdN07lIyy9_DAPc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448997/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U7IgN6"&gt;Verizon is joining &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/today-the-first-winners-of-washington-states-covid-vaccine-lottery-will-be-chosen/"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/odh/media-center/odh-news-releases/odh-news-release-05-28-21"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; in offering a financial incentive to get the COVID vaccine: its customers who have gotten at least one dose can get a 10 percent discount on accessories, from either its online or physical stores. To sweeten the deal even more, Verizon is letting customers stack that discount on top of sale prices, which can be used to get some pretty solid deals. It’s unclear if or how you’ll have to prove your vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKbanD"&gt;For example, Verizon has the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/apple-airpods-pro-headphones/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro on sale&lt;/a&gt; until June 20th, and the 10 percent discount brings them down to $180 from their normal price of $250. If you’re more a fan of headphones and can snag the discount, you’ll be able to pick up Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/sony-wireless-noise-canceling-over-the-ear-headphones/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;delightfully named WH-1000XM4s&lt;/a&gt; for $270. The offer could also be a way to get a nice little discount on a lower-priced item you’ve been considering, like a Samsung wireless charging pad or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/anker-soundcore-liberty-air-2-true-wireless-in-ear-headphones/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s Soundcore Liberty Air 2 headphones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIShJB"&gt;The offer is also valid for first responders, nurses, teachers, and military members. Any customers who are eligible will have from June 15th to July 31st, 2021 to &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/discounts/vaccination/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fill out a questionnaire&lt;/a&gt; and receive their promo code, which can be redeemed until August 15th. While accessories that are on sale can be discounted, Verizon says that, for whatever reason, accessories whose prices end with a .97 can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3HiJf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lordstown Motors CEO resigns after investigation into preorders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Trump Tours New Lordstown Endurance Electric Pickup Truck" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2B8-WIXRczI5bVD_6XOAyyo9CLU=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448950/1228771026.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zAyIMY"&gt;Steve Burns, the CEO of General Motors-backed startup Lordstown Motors, has resigned following an investigation into allegations that he and other executives lied about preorders for the company’s electric pickup truck. The startup’s chief financial officer Julio Rodriguez has also resigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dzPwU"&gt;The resignations come just weeks after Lordstown Motors admitted that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"&gt;needs more money to execute on its production plans for the pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; and its auditor saying the company may run out of cash, despite raising nearly $700 million late last year. It’s one of many electric vehicle startups &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"&gt;running into trouble&lt;/a&gt; after going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1Pfh3"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-results-special-committee-investigation"&gt;investigation found&lt;/a&gt; that while Lordstown Motors said on multiple occasions that a majority of the 100,000 non-binding preorders it collected were from commercial fleets, this was not the case. It discovered that “one entity that provided a large number of pre-orders does not appear to have the resources to complete large purchases of trucks,” and that other companies on the list “provided commitments that appear too vague or infirm to be appropriately included in the total number of pre-orders disclosed.” The firm’s probe also confirmed that Lordstown Motors paid a company to drum up around 1,000 preorders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S6ID4p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some preorders were from a firm that lacked the resources to buy the trucks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xUJEUb"&gt;“We thank Steve Burns for his passion and commitment to the company,” the startup said in a statement. Burns will be temporarily replaced by Angela Strand, who is an independent board member at Lordstown Motors, though she formerly worked at Burns’ previous EV startup, Workhorse. Becky Roof, a certified public accountant and former CFO, will temporarily replace Rodriguez. “We have complete confidence in Angela and Becky, and our expanded leadership team, to effectively guide the company during this interim period,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bh52Vl"&gt;The probe, which was conducted by law firm Sullivan and Cromwell, was launched in March after short-selling firm Hindenburg Research &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt; that made a number of allegations of potential wrongdoing at Lordstown Motors. At the heart of the report was Hindenburg’s belief that the EV startup had misled investors about the viability of preorders it touted in late 2020 and early 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2w3er9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Lordstown Motors wants to avoid the ‘carnage’ of failed EV startups","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21173309/lordstown-motors-steve-burns-interview-ceo-gm-ohio-factory-trump"},{"title":"Lordstown Motors probed by SEC for allegedly misleading investors","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WIQTmz"&gt;The research firm made other claims about Lordstown Motors’ progress on its electric pickup truck, and that one of the startup’s prototypes had caught fire. The law firm says that these other parts of the report are “in significant respects, false and misleading,” and that “the viability of Lordstown Motors’ technology and timeline to start of production are not accurate.” The fire, the firm said, was an isolated incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PwwCkv"&gt;Lordstown Motors is also facing an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that was opened following Hindenburg’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8jhvP"&gt;Founded in 2019 by Burns, Lordstown Motors bought a recently shuttered GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio in a deal that then-President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21173309/lordstown-motors-steve-burns-interview-ceo-gm-ohio-factory-trump"&gt;billed as “GREAT NEWS” for the state&lt;/a&gt;. Trump had been putting pressure on GM to do something with the factory, and his administration celebrated the transaction and Lordstown Motors as a result. Lordstown Motors brought the truck to the White House for &lt;a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/09/trump-shows-off-lordstown-motors-pickup-truck-at-white-house-on-the-eve-of-cleveland-presidential-debate.html"&gt;an event in September 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and then-VP Mike Pence attended the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302966/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-truck-ev-endurance-unveiling-pence"&gt;reveal of the Endurance pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; a few months earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vytht5"&gt;The startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;went public late last year&lt;/a&gt; and raised $675 million in the process. GM was one of the highest-profile investors, committing $25 million in cash to Lordstown Motors and around $50 million of “in-kind” contributions that helped the startup buy the plant and equipment. It owns around 5 percent of Lordstown Motors and while it had the opportunity to nominate a director to the board during the merger, it ultimately didn’t. GM declined to comment on the resignations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dffiKn"&gt;GM was involved in another EV startup, Nikola, that Hindenburg Research published a report about. That startup also juggled its leadership and is currently under investigation from the SEC and the Department of Justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lIJS6j"&gt;Burns previously ran Workhorse, an electric vehicle startup that’s struggled to get a commercial delivery van business off the ground. The Endurance pickup truck actually began its life at Workhorse. When Lordstown Motors was formed, Workhorse licensed the intellectual property for the truck to Burns’ new startup in exchange for around $20 million. Workhorse owns 10 percent of Lordstown Motors, though the value of that stake has dropped from around $330 million at the end of 2020 to below $200 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U8bj0A"&gt;Workhorse had spent years trying to win the contract for the United States Postal Service’s next-generation delivery vehicle, and had promised Lordstown Motors the right to bid on the manufacturing portion of the deal.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HgCDwP"&gt;The two-shot COVID-19 vaccine made by Novavax is 90 percent effective against the disease, the company &lt;a href="https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-90-overall-efficacy-and"&gt;said today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8AeAZr"&gt;The Novavax shots are a different type of vaccine than the ones already available: it’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266897/coronavirus-vaccine-development-strategies-pros-cons"&gt;protein-based vaccine&lt;/a&gt; that directly delivers bits of the coronavirus spike protein, which the body then makes antibodies against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCHQSc"&gt;Novavax tested its vaccine in 29,960 people across the US and Mexico who were randomly assigned to get either the vaccine or a placebo injection. There were 77 cases of COVID-19 in the study: 14 in people who’d received the vaccine, and 63 in the group that got a placebo. All 14 cases in the vaccine group were mild. In the placebo group, ten cases were moderate and four were severe, showing the shots protect against more serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSG8vY"&gt;The trial ran when the Alpha coronavirus variant, first identified in the United Kingdom, was widespread in the US. The results confirm that the shots protect against that form of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIscWl"&gt;The results are similar to those from the clinical trial Novavax &lt;a href="https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3"&gt;ran in the UK&lt;/a&gt;, which found that the shots were around 89 percent effective. That trial was also run at a time when the Alpha variant was widespread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFsaZW"&gt;The US has already authorized three COVID-19 vaccines and has secured enough of those vaccines to vaccinate the entire population of the US. Still, Novavax says it plans to submit its vaccine to regulators in the US and around the world by this fall. By that point, the US regulatory agency, the Food and Drug Administration, may have already granted full approval to the Pfizer / BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHSjce"&gt;If the FDA does approve any vaccines, Novavax may not be able to apply for the speedier emergency authorization process that the other three vaccines went through — that process is technically only open if there are no fully approved products to treat a condition. However, because Novavax has already been in discussions with the FDA, it may still be able to go that route, Stanley Erck, the company’s CEO, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/14/health/covid-vaccine-novavax.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkzezR"&gt;Novavax had &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/05/10/novavax-coronavirus-vaccine/"&gt;manufacturing problems&lt;/a&gt; this spring that forced it to push back estimates for when it could file for regulatory clearance and provide vaccines. The company has an agreement with the COVAX initiative, which is securing vaccines for low- and middle-income countries, for &lt;a href="https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-gavi-execute-advance-purchase-agreement-covid-19"&gt;1.1 billion doses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
