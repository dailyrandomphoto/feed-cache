    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vQ4THZ"&gt;Apple’s long-rumored AirTags trackers could launch alongside a wide array of third-party accessories, if retailer listings and leaked photos &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/19/third-party-airtags-accessories/"&gt;pulled together by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;are accurate. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F402768710040&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22393404%2Fairtags-accessories-keychain-leaked-photos-listings-trackers-tile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F985731193%2Fleather-airtags-cover-airtags-cases&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22393404%2Fairtags-accessories-keychain-leaked-photos-listings-trackers-tile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt; sellers, and even &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fankishi-Bluetooth-Tracker-Cover-Bluetooth-Finder-Case-for-Airtags%2F490638502&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, are already selling keychains to attach the trackers to a set of keys. Images of apparent silicone straps have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1384320511824437248"&gt;also leaked&lt;/a&gt;, showing how the trackers could be strapped to bigger items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxTkXP"&gt;After being rumored for over a year, Apple’s Tile-like trackers are widely expected to be officially announced later today at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22385362/apple-event-ipad-airpods-pencil-tv-tags-rumors-spring-loaded"&gt;Spring Loaded event&lt;/a&gt;. Reports indicate the trackers themselves will be small discs equipped with Bluetooth and ultra-wideband radio chips, which users can track with Apple’s Find My app. At this point they’ve been leaked basically everywhere: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/30/20841204/ios13-code-apple-tile-location-tracking-tag-find-my-app"&gt;iOS code&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/18/21142249/apple-tags-iphone-kuo-location-tracking"&gt;analyst reports&lt;/a&gt;, and even a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21205994/apple-airtags-name-confirmed-tile-tracker-rumor-leak"&gt;support video&lt;/a&gt; from Apple.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xd8yq1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;AirTags third-party accessories are already ready. &lt;a href="https://t.co/lvv1elJ6iY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/lvv1elJ6iY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DuanRui (@duanrui1205) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1384320511824437248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0HGDQC"&gt;While there’s no guarantee that these accessory manufacturers are working off official information supplied by Apple, these leaks give a good indication of how they plan on supporting the trackers once they’re official. They follow earlier leaks from January about AirTags accessories from &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/07/accessory-makers-preparing-for-airtags-launch/"&gt;Nomad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/27/spigen-airtags-accessory-for-late-october-release/"&gt;Spigen sub-brand Cyrill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6Iuf7"&gt;Apple’s approach to attaching AirTags to your personal belongings is different from Tile, its main competitor in the space. Tile produces trackers in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20901686/tile-tracker-mate-pro-slim-sticker-release-date-news-features"&gt;variety of different form-factors&lt;/a&gt; depending on what they’re designed to track, whether it’s a credit card shaped device for a wallet, or a tracker with a hole that’s designed to go on a keychain. In contrast, Apple seems to be producing just a single form-factor, and relying on accessories to attach it to your belongings. It’s an interesting difference that might make Apple’s trackers more versatile, albeit slightly worse tailored to some cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2JUZE"&gt;Apple’s Spring Loaded event is due to take place later today at 1pm ET, where the AirTags are expected to be announced alongside the company’s new iPad Pro lineup and more. You’ll be able to watch along live on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-events%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22393404%2Fairtags-accessories-keychain-leaked-photos-listings-trackers-tile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s Event website&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBYVNuky1M"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EPOS’ new $119 H3 wired gaming headset is basic, but comfortable</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Not the most affordable wired model, but it’s a solid choice&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="2mv4vU"&gt;The gaming audio company EPOS has debuted a new wired gaming headset called the H3. It’s not as exciting as its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241197/epos-gtw-270-hybrid-truly-wireless-earbuds-usb-c-gaming-bluetooth"&gt;GTW 270 truly wireless earbuds for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, and depending on your needs, its short list of features might not be worth &lt;a href="https://www.eposaudio.com/en/us/gaming"&gt;its $119 price&lt;/a&gt;. But a few things stick out in the H3’s favor after spending a few days with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Ujxlu"&gt;EPOS has a knack for using a rotating dial for volume controls on its headsets, and if you read my review of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;Microsoft’s excellent Xbox Wireless Headset&lt;/a&gt;, you know I’m all about dials. On the outside of the H3’s right earcup, there’s a dial controlling the volume that’s easy to adjust with two fingers. Opposite that, on the left earcup, there’s an articulating boom microphone that can be muted when it’s in the up position. Any time it’s lowered, the mic will be on, unless you mute it on your device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BShUPq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10455187"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JoZtS0"&gt;I also like that these have broad compatibility with consoles, mobile devices, and PC — not that they’re the first to do this. The H3 includes two swappable braided cables, one made for PC that extends from the headset and splits into a dedicated audio 3.5mm plug and a microphone plug (most desktops and some gaming laptops feature both of these ports). There’s also a cable that outputs to a single 3.5mm plug that can go into a phone, a controller, a PC, an Oculus Quest 2, or any other device you own with this kind of audio jack. I do wish that EPOS included a 3.5mm-to-USB-C adapter to broaden compatibility further for devices that lack a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EPOS H3 gaming headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5SIT14rnGAaqK8h_gvT5k-lvAR0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455586/eposh3volume.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;EPOS&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the right side of the H3, you’ll find this volume knob.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XEGnIk"&gt;You don’t have to spend $119 on a wired gaming headset to get features like the ones I explained above, but the H3’s comfort and sound performance help to justify their price. The earcups fit snug around my head, but not too snug, and they have a wide range of motion (though they don’t swivel to lay flat on the chest.) The headband’s size adjustments snap into place and don’t move, even when I yank the headset off. The passive noise isolation of the ear cups is decent, partially because of the closed-back design, but its plush pads do a better-than-average job at keeping outside sounds out because the cups can be tilted to fit your head shape. I’m short on qualms about the build quality, though the earcups might not be as good a fit for people who have larger ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oisMiq"&gt;The H3 is a solid performer when it comes to gaming and listening to music. Its closed-back earcups provide a clear, balanced sound without an overwhelming amount of bass. Yet, the palpable bass line in “&lt;em&gt;Book of Slim&lt;/em&gt;” by Gene Harris &amp;amp; The Three Sounds came through just fine. Switching over to games, I was happy with how games like &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank (2016)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; sounded on the H3 while connected to a PS5 controller. The sound quality rivals many of the sub-$150 headsets I’ve tried in my gaming headset buying guide.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EPOS H3 gaming headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sNWBy4WEPCnP3Wr9Qjb9ZBb1vdg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455569/eposh3text.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;EPOS&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The mic is muted when it’s flipped up, as it is in the picture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zbWdoo"&gt;The microphone quality is also solid for the price, picking up all of the little details in my voice. It’s easy to tell my “p’s” from the “t’s” in voice recordings. It sounded crisp when connected to my PC, and within Google’s Recorder app while plugged into my Pixel 3 via a USB-C dongle. I got similarly good results plugged into my PS5 controller. Though, I wouldn’t suggest this headset over a dedicated microphone, if you’re planning on making any podcast appearances soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WimWAS"&gt;Other than the USB-C adapter that I wish was included, the other big omission from the H3 compared to other headsets in its price range is the lack of microphone monitoring. I love being able to hear my own voice, but I swear I’m not a narcissist. Monitoring is useful to hear someone yelling for you across the room when you’re distracted in a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZBjtQ"&gt;If you aren’t totally sold on going wireless for your gaming headset because you don’t want another device to recharge, or some other reason, the H3 is a solid alternative. Its sound quality and comfort mostly make up for not having many features. That said, its price borders on what you’ll pay for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;one of several good wireless gaming headsets&lt;/a&gt; that have many more features.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VanMoof’s PowerBank is a range extender and problem solver</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBeagqR-mH1S0rkF-dNuij3LVL4=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154571/IMG_6371.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;VanMoof S3 with PowerBank arriving at Castricum aan Zee from Amsterdam.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;We put a new 2021 S3 model to the test on a three-hour ride&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="JbfiF9"&gt;VanMoof, maker of some of our favorite electric bikes, just announced the PowerBank, a range extender that also charges the internal battery of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22162936/vanmoof-x3-long-term-review"&gt;X3 models&lt;/a&gt;. Not only does the emotional-support battery promise to ease range anxiety by extending VanMoof e-bike commutes by a claimed 45 to 100 km (28 to 62 miles), it also addresses VanMoof’s biggest limitation: non-removable batteries that enable a sleek look, but could necessitate hauling the 19-kg (42-pound) bikes indoors to be charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uqwqkr"&gt;I’ve had a new VanMoof S3, improved for 2021 (more on that later), with the PowerBank since Friday. After 3 hours in the saddle on two 90-minute rides, I can attest to the extended range and more convenient charging. It’s not cheap and it’s not perfect and I didn’t go quite as far as VanMoof claims, but the PowerBank makes a compelling case for purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGtIVa"&gt;The 378Wh capacity PowerBank attaches in seconds (about 20 of them). It has an on / off button so you can choose when it charges the larger 504Wh battery found inside both the full-sized S3 and smaller X3 e-bikes. It charges from a standstill or while riding, and adds an extra 2.8 kg (6.2 pounds) to the total weight of the bike. That’s a reasonable (and unnoticeable) tradeoff if it means never having to carry the bike up the stairs to your apartment again. It also adds &lt;a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/en-US/electric-bikes/powerbank"&gt;$348&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/en-NL/electric-bikes/powerbank"&gt;€348&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/shop/en_gb/accessories/vanmoof-powerbank"&gt;£315&lt;/a&gt; to the cost of a bike that already starts at $1,998 / €1,998 / £1,798.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMwhAS"&gt;The PowerBank sits in a permanent mount you must first attach to the S3 or X3 e-bikes. The PowerBank battery then wedges into the frame and locks in place with a supplied key, and is further secured with two velcro straps. A third velcro strap is used to keep the charging cable from flopping around as it snakes up to the underside of the top tube and into the bike’s charging port. I rode on some rather bumpy brick roads and didn’t hear a single rattle from the assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz9Nfr"&gt;The thick velcro straps, while being inelegant, blend nicely into the dark black S3 model. But the straps and bulky battery are visually jarring on the smaller, light blue X3 e-bike. The PowerBank is not compatible with earlier VanMoof e-bikes like the S2 or X2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q0JzXbWzUhwgOZ3PZtn2NgfGHps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455393/386907_VanMoof_X3_light_powerbank_LANDSCAPE_261280_large_1618826044.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: VanMoof&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light blue VanMoof X3 fitted with a PowerBank. Eww.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t9uMvF"&gt;While a first for VanMoof, range extenders are not uncommon amongst e-bike makers, especially for electric mountain bikes. Last month Specialized announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360180/specialized-como-sl-ebike-review-price-specs"&gt;Como SL commuter e-bike&lt;/a&gt; with an optional $449.99 range extender that it says adds about 31 miles (55 km) of range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UyDCor"&gt;Over the weekend I tested a PowerBank fitted to a brand new VanMoof S3 on a 76.7 km (47.7 miles) round trip from Amsterdam to the coastal hamlet of Castricum aan Zee, and back. That’s beyond the 60 km stated range of a VanMoof ridden at max power, and far beyond the 47 km I managed during my S3 range test in April of 2020. VanMoof claims that a fully charged S3 battery coupled to a PowerBank has a range of between 105-250 km (65-155 miles), depending upon the level of powered assist you’re using. I wasn’t anywhere close to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gQjNfB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Extended my range by about 70 percent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q7od9g"&gt;I rode at full power (level 4) on exceedingly flat Dutch terrain making liberal use of the Turbo Boost button. A bit more than half of my testing was directly into a fairly strong 14-knot headwind, the rest benefited from a 6-knot tailwind. In total, I’d estimate that I could have ridden about 80 km (50 miles) before both the S3 and PowerBank batteries were empty. In other words, the VanMoof PowerBank coupled to the new S3 extended my range by about 70 percent compared to 47 km (29.2 miles) I managed last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S09mBV"&gt;In my testing, I noticed that the S3 battery emptied faster than the PowerBank could recharge it while riding at max power with lots of Turbo Boost button presses. (VanMoof confirmed this behavior after my testing was complete.) So rather than risk having to stop and recharge on the way home (or ride in a less fun economy mode), I took advantage of a 20-minute ferry wait to top off the S3 battery when it was showing just 15 percent remaining. I likely would have made it the final 7.9 km home even without the top-up, but the whole point of having a PowerBank is to avoid range anxiety and I was in a hurry to get back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYKBpb"&gt;As to my buttocks, well, I should give the VanMoof’s custom saddle honorable mention. It’s surprisingly comfortable, and the first time I’ve ridden it — my S3 review bike was fitted with a different saddle last year. While I did notice a bit of discomfort &lt;em&gt;down there &lt;/em&gt;when climbing onto the bike for my return journey, it was far less than expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEEM4v"&gt;Despite my test coming in below the &lt;em&gt;lowest&lt;/em&gt; range estimate for the PowerBank, VanMoof still stands by its numbers. “It should give most riders an additional 45-100km range depending on conditions and an individual’s use-level,” said the company in an email response to my findings. Apparently, my aggressive riding style, weight (190 pounds / 86 kg), height (6 feet / 183 cm), and ambient conditions at testing make me an outlier.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PowerBank can be charged on or off the bike using the charger supplied with the X3 or S3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W74Q8L6qvYsBfgBfCN2cI2DYLRI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455614/verge_DSC_4299_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PowerBank can be locked into place on a mount that must first be installed on the bike.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="fOYObB"&gt;Some other observations...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UN1fRD"&gt;VanMoof e-bikes don’t provide a USB charging port for phones mounted on the handlebar and the arrival of the PowerBank doesn’t change that. That’s an oversight in my opinion. A range extender enables riders to travel longer distances, which often requires GPS navigation on a phone operating at peak brightness and paired with Bluetooth headphones for turn-by-turn directions and maybe some music playing over your 4G / 5G connection. My three-year old iPhone wasn’t up to the task, which meant tethering it to yet another battery I had to carry in my jacket. I forgot about the cable when I stopped off at a ferry crossing, nearly causing me to topple over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEdSOA"&gt;VanMoof says a USB port was considered but was ultimately left off for “waterproofing reasons.” Shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="grIF1h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The best VanMoof e-bikes yet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dOhzJM"&gt;I should also note that the S3 I tested was one of the models that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;recently added support for Apple’s Find My tracking network&lt;/a&gt;. While that was the headline item, VanMoof’s X3 and S3 e-bikes were also upgraded with improved on-bike displays that are more visible in direct sunlight, and electronic shifters that are more accurate. I complained about the display readability in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;my review last year&lt;/a&gt; and it is slightly improved. More importantly, the e-shifter seems much improved over the S3 variation that I reviewed at launch in April of 2020. At the time I said it glitched on 2 out of 100 shifts, but the automatic four-speed on my new S3 glitched about 1 out of 100+ shifts over my three hours of riding. I characterize a glitch as an unexpected mechanical “clink” sound, a surprise free-wheel of the pedals when you expect to feel resistance, or an obvious feeling of being in the wrong gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JxiY3b"&gt;VanMoof, unlike many e-bike makers, is able to constantly improve the hardware and software of its e-bikes because it has a dedicated factory and relatively tight control over a supply chain of custom VanMoof parts. That means it doesn’t have to compete for Shimano shifters or Bosch motors, for example, which left many bike manufactures without parts for months after the recent surge in e-bike demand. Good thing, too. The first shipments of S3 and X3 models were plagued by issue rates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;as high as 10 percent&lt;/a&gt;, the company co-founders told me last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFRKL6"&gt;VanMoof says it also improved the internal wiring of its bikes for better resistance to weather, added new pedals for better grip, and new fender flaps to reduce excess splash on wet roads. It also made the shipping boxes more environmentally friendly — important when you consider that VanMoof ships around 12,000 of those giant boxes a month, as of September 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hU561A"&gt;All this is to say that the 2021 S3 and X3 models, the ones with the “Locate with Apple Find My” label printed under the top tube, are the best VanMoof e-bikes yet, which really is saying something. The new PowerBank option is just icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google adds Pac-Man, Hello Kitty, Gundam mechs, and more to AR search</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tSry71UehtkravCv4F8zsfnc5n4=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154559/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_14.42.54.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XhwWeH"&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/japanese-characters-ar/"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; a bunch of popular Japanese characters to its AR feature in mobile search, which has previously featured &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/12/22171601/google-adds-augmented-reality-ar-animals-search-3d"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21400577/google-arts-and-culture-augmented-reality-prehistoric-creatures-museum-exhibits"&gt;historical artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308071/google-search-augmented-reality-animals-dinosaurs-tyrannosaurus-rex-velociraptor-triceratops"&gt;dinosaurs&lt;/a&gt;. The list of characters is taken from Japanese pop culture including anime, TV, and video games, with names like Pac-Man, Hello Kitty, mechs from Evangelion and Gundam, and more. The feature works on Google search on Android and the iOS Google app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZPAyI"&gt;When you enter the characters’ names, you’ll see an option to “see in your space” below the main search result, and that’ll let you drop a 3D model into your camera view. The models can appear at various degrees of scale, with an option to render at life size, though I’m not sure quite how accurate those measurements are. I was under the impression that Hello Kitty was five apples tall, for example, but she towered over my desk when I tried it out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZWUeQCTnyOqYovKVVuZ75ZcySc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22456500/AR_Anime_EN.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rsGC8u"&gt;The full list of characters is here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mFnxoh"&gt;Ultraman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wgSY13"&gt;Ultraman Zero&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ekhymm"&gt;Ultraman Belial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="N2dwUs"&gt;Gomora&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cemAjs"&gt;Evangelion (EVA-01 Test Type)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Li0tRu"&gt;Gundam (Odysseus Gundam, Xi Gundam, Penelope)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="R9NXaz"&gt;Cogimyun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8eVr2V"&gt;The drums from &lt;em&gt;Taiko no Tatsujin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1zvXYs"&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6heNrj"&gt;Pompompurin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0S44KJ"&gt;Little Twin Stars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mXYV1I"&gt;Google says that Pac-Man is by far the most searched-for character out of the list, with more than twice as many searches as for Hello Kitty at #2. Apparently, the top country for Pac-Man searches is Peru.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung wants to make sure nobody’s tracking you with its SmartTags</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZtbP4-MBz5379RsEJqeswdCxn2c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154296/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jhUeDv"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/pressreleases/evolving-for-the-better-smartthings-ecosystem-gives-galaxy-users-better-control-over-their-connected-devices"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that customers will soon be able to scan for unknown Galaxy SmartTags trackers using Samsung’s SmartThings Find service. The feature, called Unknown Tag Search, will be coming to the SmartThings app starting next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOZPGR"&gt;Users will be able to scan the nearby area for any SmartTags that don’t belong to them but that are moving along with them. This feature could be a big win for safety, providing an easy way to make sure that nobody’s tracking you with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;tiny SmartTag&lt;/a&gt; that they slipped in your backpack, purse, coat pocket, etc. It’s a nice feature if you’re concerned about the privacy or security implications of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;Tile-like tracking devices.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz0wkF"&gt;Samsung also announced that its assistant, Bixby, will gain the ability to find SmartTags. If you’ve placed a SmartTag on a certain item and named it, you’ll be able to use Bixby to find that tag. For example, if you’ve got a SmartTag on your keys, you could say “hi Bixby, where are my keys?” and it will set off the tag’s ringer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CG1j9Q"&gt;Apple currently has a feature similar to Unknown Tag Search &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313659/apple-find-my-app-item-safety-alerts-prevent-stalking"&gt;in the iOS 14.5 beta&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems like it would be a natural fit for the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;long-rumored AirTags&lt;/a&gt; item trackers. The company is hosting its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22385362/apple-event-ipad-airpods-pencil-tv-tags-rumors-spring-loaded"&gt;“Spring Loaded” event&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow, so perhaps we’ll see Apple officially unveil its rumored competitor to Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTags.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition is now free for PS4 and PS5 owners</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Horizon Zero Dawn" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JmCwX50MCz70y_RkSd3zGhfD-4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69153960/Outro.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image:&amp;nbsp;Guerrilla Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1sO8gL"&gt;Sony and Guerrilla Games’ PS4 hit&lt;em&gt; Horizon Zero Dawn &lt;/em&gt;is now available, free of charge, to PS4 and PS5 owners. PlayStation owners on both consoles can redeem a free digital copy of the game until May 14th at 8PM PT / 11PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H07eii"&gt;The free copy Sony is offering is the &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA10237_00-HRZCE00000000000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Complete Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, meaning you get not only the base game but some extras, including the &lt;em&gt;Frozen Wilds &lt;/em&gt;expansion and a digital artbook. Unlike the PS Plus free games, which require an active subscription to the service, Sony is giving away the game for free, no strings attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3nSHIa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The promotion is part of Sony’s Play at Home initiative&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Yc7AP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; was originally released in 2017 as a PS4 exclusive. Players control a young hunter named Aloy who roams a post-apocalyptic world dominated by machines while searching for clues about her past. The game is also receiving a sequel titled &lt;em&gt;Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;, which is slated to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21294561/horizon-forbidden-west-ps5-release-date-2021-guerrilla-games-details-playstation"&gt;launch sometime this year on the PS4 and PS5&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDABm0"&gt;The promotion is part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297009/ratchet-and-clank-free-ps4-ps5-playstation-sony"&gt;Sony’s “Play at Home”&lt;/a&gt; initiative, which aims to encourage PlayStation owners to stay home during the pandemic by incentivizing players with free games until June. Additionally, Sony is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350340/ps4-ps5-games-sony-astro-bot-rescue-mission-play-at-home-psvr"&gt;also giving away nine titles&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;em&gt;Astro Bot Rescue Mission&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Enter the Gungeon&lt;/em&gt; for free until April 22nd at 8PM PT / 11PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parler will relaunch on Apple’s App Store next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a Parler logo is seen behind a..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1cz50eEVSzl-LzVPheLh799FFrs=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69152391/1230591907.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Thiago Prudêncio/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WwqCuM"&gt;The embattled social network Parler is slated to reappear on iOS on the week of April 26th, following its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391943/apple-parler-app-store-lawmakers-hearing-google-play"&gt;re-acceptance into Apple’s App Store&lt;/a&gt; earlier today. However, the iOS app will block some content that’s available on the Android and web versions of Parler — a compromise that apparently satisfies Apple’s developer guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DdlQdH"&gt;Parler announced the news in a press release. Interim CEO Mark Meckler said the company had “worked to put in place systems that will better detect unlawful speech and allow users to filter content undesirable to them, while maintaining our strict prohibition against content moderation based on viewpoint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ymeJ98"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple reversed its ban earlier today&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tzQTy2"&gt;Apple reaccepted Parler after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324028/apple-parler-app-store-ban-upheld-nazi-symbols"&gt;months-long ban&lt;/a&gt; under pressure from lawmakers, two days before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22376127/apple-senate-judiciary-hearing-klobuchar-app-store-google-play-antitrust"&gt;a hearing on Apple’s App Store policies&lt;/a&gt;. The company said Parler — which promotes itself as a less strictly moderated alternative to Facebook or Twitter — had engaged in “substantial conversations” with Parler, resulting in a set of proposed changes that would meet Apple’s content policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzrKz1"&gt;According to Parler’s press release, that includes filtering some content on iOS. “While the App Store version of Parler will prohibit some posts that Parler allows, those posts will still remain visible on the web-based and Android versions of Parler,” the release notes. Parler didn’t elaborate on what kinds of content that would include, but Apple broadly requires a system for filtering “objectionable” material posted by users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ueCEao"&gt;Apple, Google, and Amazon all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"&gt;banned Parler&lt;/a&gt; after the January 6th attack on the US Capitol, saying Parler had failed to police violent threats and hateful content. Parler sued Amazon, which it had worked with for web hosting, but the suit has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310873/parler-amazon-aws-lawsuit-antitrust-hosting-free-speech"&gt;so far fared poorly&lt;/a&gt; in court. Google has continued to bar Parler from its Play Store, but users can install the app directly on Android — making the ban far less of a liability.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oatly investors should beware climate change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oprah-Backed Vegan Milk Brand Oatly Said To Plan 2021 U.S. IPO" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dRGwWNLZNL1vF3Q2-7NR8RveoMU=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69152269/1228558733.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9rqkqr"&gt;Oatly is going public, so out of prurient interest, I picked up their &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1843586/000119312521121323/d123209df1.htm"&gt;registration statement&lt;/a&gt;. Did you know: a risk factor to Oatly’s business? Climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="we8JpK"&gt;In 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission provided guidance about how to apply climate change disclosures — since it might be required in the risk factor section, among other places. And according to the SEC, investor demand for climate change disclosures has “&lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-climate-change-disclosures"&gt;grown dramatically.&lt;/a&gt;” The SEC is mulling over whether existing disclosures are good enough, and it has &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-climate-change-disclosures"&gt;requested feedback from the public&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3pD4T"&gt;Oatly’s registration provides a nice demonstration of that interest: the risks of climate change laid out bluntly by a corporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3sEUCl"&gt;“Our ability to ensure a continuing supply of high-quality oats and other raw materials for our products at competitive prices depends on many factors beyond our control,” the materials say. Well, yes, this is true for many kinds of agricultural products. There’s some hemming and hawing about what might happen if a supplier goes bankrupt or whatever. Fine. Then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="wo2iBO"&gt;Additionally, the oats from which our products are sourced are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, frosts, earthquakes, hurricanes, pestilence and other shortages and disease, which can adversely impact quantity and quality, leading to reduced oat yields and quality, which in turn could reduce the available supply of, or increase the price of, our raw materials. The monocultures that we use are also sensitive to diseases, pests, insects and other external forces, which could pose either short term effects, such as result in a bad harvest one year, or long term effects, which could require new oat varieties to be grown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="x7NHWg"&gt;This is the first time I’ve seen “monocultures” referenced in a regulatory filing. It’s been used three times, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/q=monocultures&amp;amp;dateRange=all"&gt;per the SEC’s search&lt;/a&gt;; “monoculture,” no plural, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/q=monoculture&amp;amp;dateRange=all"&gt;has been used about 80 times&lt;/a&gt;. It is something of a surprise to see this jargon — it refers to a lot of a single crop being grown on a large scale — in a registration statement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQ478F"&gt;If you are, like me, from farm country, “monoculture” pretty much just describes the farming as you know it. The idea is that it’s more efficient, more profitable, and easier to manage, letting farmers specialize in a specific crop, such as oats. It also means more pesticide use, and when pests arise, it’s easier for them to wipe out &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/09/coffee-rust/616358/"&gt;a shocking amount of plants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Zjmgx"&gt;Monocultures &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;a risk factor. Banana wilt, for instance, is tied &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28791467/"&gt;closely to industrial banana production&lt;/a&gt; and the overwhelming number of Cavendish bananas that are planted. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1164556319303516"&gt;Rotating crops&lt;/a&gt; may help prevent the bacterial disease, though. In oats, crown rust, stem rust, barley yellow dwarf virus, oat smut, and other diseases are seen in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhCPZX"&gt;But this isn’t what dropped my jaw. Instead it was: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JMCDjl"&gt;There is also the concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. If such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for oats and other raw materials that are necessary for our products. Due to climate change, we may also be subjected to decreased availability of water, deteriorated quality of water or less favorable pricing for water, which could adversely impact our manufacturing and distribution operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X8DDR0"&gt;North Dakota, Wisconsin, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa are among &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/191084/top-10-us-states-by-production-value-of-oats/"&gt;the top US producers of oats&lt;/a&gt; — so events like the August 2020 derecho may screw up your oat milk. It &lt;a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/agriculture/2020/10/09/usda-iowa-acres-farmers-unable-harvest-grow-more-than-third-850-000-corn/5937329002/"&gt;destroyed 850,000 acres of crops&lt;/a&gt; in Iowa alone. Derechos are fairly normal in the plains, but the August 2020 one was &lt;a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2020-extreme-weather-climate-change-hurricane-derecho-wildfire"&gt;notable for its scale and destruction&lt;/a&gt;. It’s possible that climate change will make storms like it more likely — one scientist &lt;a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2020/09/10/think-2020-disasters-wild-experts-see-worse-future-iowa-derecho-climate-change-hurricanes-wildfires/3458296001/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Des Moines Register&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that “I strongly believe we’re going to look back in 10 years, certainly 20 and definitely 50 and say, ‘Wow, 2020 was a crazy year, but I miss it.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xk6puN"&gt;Happy investing!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Geico data breach exposed customers’ driver’s license numbers for more than a month</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nqwRlQ"&gt;Insurance company Geico suffered a data breach earlier this year that exposed customers’ driver’s license numbers for more than a month, according to a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455630/DL3_IndNoticeLttr_CA_Redacted.pdf"&gt;data breach notice&lt;/a&gt; filed with the attorney general of California. First reported by &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/geico-driver-license-numbers-scraped/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Geico says in the notice that it has fixed the security issue that led to the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69ydfQ"&gt;“We recently determined that between January 21, 2021 and March 1, 2021, fraudsters used information about you – which they acquired elsewhere – to obtain unauthorized access to your driver’s license number through the online sales system on our website,” the notice reads. “We have reason to believe that this information could be used to fraudulently apply for unemployment benefits in your name.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jkL7OZ"&gt;The notice does not indicate how many customers may have been affected or whether the breach was confined to California. But &lt;a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/databreach/reporting"&gt;California law states&lt;/a&gt; that “any person or business that is required to issue a security breach notification to more than 500 California residents as a result of a single breach” must submit a copy of the notice to the attorney general’s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqY5se"&gt;State unemployment offices have been inundated with claims over the past year, with millions of people unemployed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Some &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/washington-halts-unemployment-payments-for-two-days-after-finding-1-6-million-in-fraudulent-claims-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/"&gt;states reported a sharp rise in fraudulent claims&lt;/a&gt; last spring, which were discovered when people began receiving notifications about unemployment benefits for which they never applied. Most US states require identification such as a driver’s license to file for unemployment benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KbPih"&gt;Geico did not immediately reply to requests for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Genesis’ first electric car is way less exciting than its concept EVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O-dl29J8lpTKhvcdhod0Ko9Hq-I=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69152115/2276_ElectrifiedGenesisG80.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Genesis&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="elOzdB"&gt;Genesis, Hyundai’s luxury brand, has &lt;a href="https://www.genesisnewsusa.com/en-us/releases/217"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; its first all-electric car. It’s called the Electrified G80 because, well, Genesis took the existing G80 sedan and is refitting it to run on electricity. The carmaker claims it will travel about 427 kilometers (roughly 265 miles) on a full battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MVWxv"&gt;It’s a very straightforward idea that pales in comparison to some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/23/11294762/genesis-new-york-concept-car-announced-new-york-auto-show-2016"&gt;truly exciting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17174294/genesis-essentia-is-an-electric-gt-with-an-awesomely-retro-futuristic-bubble-roof"&gt;concept cars&lt;/a&gt; Genesis has shown off &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35983440/genesis-x-concept-revealed/"&gt;over the years&lt;/a&gt;, many of which are purported to be electric. Basically none of those progressive styling choices and daring ideas are coming across in the Electrified G80. It’s also not mold-breaking like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"&gt;Hyundai’s Ioniq 5&lt;/a&gt; sedan or Kia’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357654/kia-ev6-revealed-specs-photos-electric-car-release-date"&gt;EV6&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are built on the parent company’s new e-GMP electric vehicle platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ixpmty"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10455081"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E2MHzY"&gt;That’s obviously by design, as Genesis will try to sell customers on something that looks and feels more familiar. And the Electrified G80 will borrow a &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt; from the e-GMP — namely, the high-voltage tech that allows for fast recharging as well as two-way charging, meaning the G80 will be able to power all sorts of electric appliances. But it’s unclear what other work Genesis put into the rest of the G80’s electric underpinnings, as the company has said it’s saving the full e-GMP platform for its future electric SUVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdqOPu"&gt;Genesis’ first electric production sedan was debuted at Auto Shanghai 2021, and it will be sold in China, but Genesis says the electric sedan is also coming to North America. The car will be all-wheel drive and can make a 0-to-60mph run in under five seconds, and there are plenty of luxury touches, like a road noise-cancellation feature and a camera-aided adaptive suspension. But Genesis didn’t otherwise share any specifications, pricing, or release dates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9bSAQ"&gt;Fitting an electric motor and battery in a car designed to run on an internal combustion engine may be cost-effective for the automaker up front, but it naturally leads to compromises that you wouldn’t have to make if you created an EV from the ground up. Genesis has teased at some big ideas in the past with its electric concepts, but the luxury brand is clearly not going to try to realize them with the Electrified G80. &lt;/p&gt;
