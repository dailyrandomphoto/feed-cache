    <title>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition cuts multiplayer in favor of single-player improvements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Po-a5wtjsREc_Fob1jw3mwe1x44=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757109/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition__EDENPRIME_3840x2160.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rnEauq"&gt;When the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21518322/mass-effect-legendary-edition-original-trilogy-remaster-announced"&gt;enhanced remake&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect &lt;/em&gt;trilogy arrives, it won’t include multiplayer. According to longtime &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect &lt;/em&gt;developer Mac Walters, the team would have had to put in an immense amount of effort to bring the feature to the &lt;em&gt;Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;. “At some point we had to draw a line,” the project director said in a briefing about the game. “We’ve talked about doing the remaster for some time now, and at least at one point in time everything was on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2riBX"&gt;BioWare introduced multiplayer to the final installment of the trilogy, &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt;. Although “these aren’t insurmountable challenges,” Walters said, they would have required focus on features outside of the single-player experience: how to incorporate crossplay or what to do with people who still play &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt;’s multiplayer today. “How do we honor that, how do we bring them in, can we somehow bridge that gap,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pIcsF"&gt;When the game launched in 2012, multiplayer served a narrative purpose as well. The game’s ending is partly dependent on the player’s “galactic readiness,” a combination of factors like player choice, resources, and success in competitive matches; a high readiness level helps usher in the game’s top-tier endings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nEzPy"&gt;Speaking with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Walters said the game has been rebalanced. Not only is multiplayer removed as a factor, but players who choose to skip directly to &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3 &lt;/em&gt;without playing previous games won’t be penalized. “It is intended to get those best endings, or the higher tier endings — I won’t say which one is best or worst — but obviously playing will be easier,” he said. “We just basically took that section out and redistributed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4n6s4F"&gt;Although some players might be disappointed by the game’s missing multiplayer, Walters said that, ultimately, it came down to creating the best-possible cohesive story experience. “The overall &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; is a better representation of the original trilogy because we’re able to focus on those single-player moments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBfEa6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; will launch May 14th on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BioWare is finally improving Black character customization in Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xPHm34M9UYCjnh46wCb39zS3TUE=/559x0:3799x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757137/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition__OMNIBLADE_3840x2160.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sAMgYe"&gt;Although the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; trilogy allowed players to create their own Shepard, the game had  limited options for making non-white characters. Environment and character director Kevin Meek told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that improving options for people of color was one of its top priorities when it came to &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming remastered collection. “If you have type 4 hair or a really dark skin tone or if that’s the Shepard you wanted to play as, you just did not really have that option in the original Mass Effect,” Meek said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWMsS7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; packages all three games with all of their corresponding DLC. Although the game won’t add new story content, it does overhaul its graphics and expand some gameplay elements to make them more modern. In returning to the series, BioWare had an opportunity to fix its shortcomings in the game’s original design. “There are certain hairstyles that just don’t work, especially for the female Shepards,” Meek said. “There was very little there that supported that at all. There was long flowing hair options, you can color it black, but those didn’t really work.” The team began by making a list of hairstyles it was missing, then working out textures. “You can’t put a really tight, really clean buzzed cut with shiny, shiny hair,” Meek said by way of example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tak0iU"&gt;In deciding which hairstyles to incorporate into a modernized game set in the future, the developers aimed for more “timeless” options. “The difference between style and fashion,” Meek said. Part of the improvements to the game’s fade hairstyles, for example, includes “sci-fi futuristic patterns” buzzed into the sides. “You don’t want to grab people’s attention, you just want it to fit within the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect &lt;/em&gt;universe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdNDYL"&gt;In addition to new hairstyles, skin tones, and more, the game is also improving on its “iconic” FemShep — a player-voted model that didn’t appear until the trilogy’s final installment. The canon character model’s late inclusion was “really limiting” for many players. “It’s pretty unfair for the people playing as females, you go through all of these moments throughout &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt; and then you get to &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt; and you’re just given this choice of do you want to continue with your Shepard, or do you want to switch your visuals completely,” Meek said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v94a6I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; will launch May 14th on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Asffpw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5QnMcR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition won’t add new content — or more gay romances</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a3xWK-nyyZImHZKQ07Ml6jHDxF8=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757112/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition__THANE_3840x2160_LEGENDARY.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4gmkUk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21518322/mass-effect-legendary-edition-original-trilogy-remaster-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will stick to a faithful retelling of the game’s story and already-made DLC, with no new narrative elements on the way. Speaking about the enhanced trilogy during a briefing, project director Mac Walters said while the team did consider incorporating new content, ultimately, BioWare decided against it. “Honestly we had looked at, is there stuff on cutting room floors and things like that that we could bring in?” Walters said. “And a lot of times that isn’t really in a state where you can just resurrect it and use it. It actually would require rebuilding from scratch and at that point you’re diverting effort away from the remastering of everything else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pchLBR"&gt;That also applies to hopes that the game might incorporate more queer romance options. “We’re not changing anything in the story or the way the characters or the plot points worked out,” Walters told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a separate interview. Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mass-effect-2-jack-gay-pansexual-fox-news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TheGamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported that &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 2&lt;/em&gt;’s crewmate, Jack, was originally conceived as pansexual. &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 2 &lt;/em&gt;writer Brian Kindregan told the outlet that “the short version is, a lot of us were asked pretty late to focus the relationships on a more traditional kind of vector.” On &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GameAnim/status/1354195336953139201"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, former BioWare cinematic animator Jonathan Cooper said that another crewmate, Jacob, was also once intended to be romanceable for same-sex characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Fgzr2"&gt;Asked about the allegedly cut relationships, Walters said that “no one ever said we couldn’t do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Gs5EZ"&gt;“Honestly the writing team generally, and all the creators, are given a ton of freedom in bringing their vision — obviously we compromise with each other,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “You work together to sort of build a great character or story moment or something like that and there’s compromise there.” In regards to media scrutiny from outlets like Fox News, Walters said that it would have “probably spurred us on to do other things” in the series. “No one has ever come to me and said we can’t do this because the media says so,” Walters said. “Never.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JV09uB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; will launch May 14th on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition brings a much-needed overhaul to the trilogy on May 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6-HzZPQ9RW1pK6BILGjP7GjzxY8=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757117/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition___REAPERS_3840x2160.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vjwzN4"&gt;Remastering a series like &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; — not quite a full remake of the trilogy, but more substantial than a port — is a thorny task. It requires work on all three games and dozens of downloadable content packs. There are fan expectations, from players who want to see a beloved universe preserved to those who are still salty about how it all ended. As Mac Walters, &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition &lt;/em&gt;project director, put it: “We talk about it sort of like we were restoring a beautiful, beloved car. But then it quickly turned into sure, if that car had been buried in cement, and every time you tried to clear off some of the cement you were worried about dinging the paint, or ripping off a mirror.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmCeuE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21518322/mass-effect-legendary-edition-original-trilogy-remaster-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, coming May 14th for PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and backwards-compatible with current consoles, packages the Shepard trilogy into one game. That includes over 40 DLC packs released during the series’s run, as well as &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/5/2927531/mass-effect-3-extended-cut-announced"&gt;extended cut&lt;/a&gt;. The game’s story will stay intact, including its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/5/2927769/bioware-mass-effect-3-finale"&gt;controversial ending&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking about the extended cut of &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt;, Walters referred again to developers caught in a cycle of always wanting to fix one last thing. “The extended cut was really that opportunity for us to add a little bit more love and a little bit more context around the ending,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sziJGK"&gt;The first &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; game launched in 2007, and the final game came out in 2012. There are more than a few elements of the game that are dated. “The opportunity now to be able to go back with all of those lessons learned and with all of the advancements … [has] been a dream for me,” Walters, a longtime developer on the original series, said. That includes returning to familiar characters and worlds. “You don’t often get a chance to revisit a lot of these things.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B9puXb4i-9PMXav1gw1uq8V4MPc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268932/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition_ILLUSIVEMAN_3840x2160.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lSL6BB"&gt;When it comes to making games, Walters said that developers have to learn to eventually let go. “You have to kind of say we’re done with the game and we’re moving on.” With &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; being a trilogy, the team was able to take that “developer angst” and use it for the next game. “Over the course of three games, we were fortunate enough to sort of build on that and really bring the game and the franchise kind of to where we saw it in our minds’ eye at the very beginning.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnQoKV"&gt;In the new remaster, all three entries can be accessed from a single menu, with players able to start from any game they choose. The tweaks range from a more convenient, comical ability to skip through elevator rides faster to overhauling the look of entire levels like Eden Prime, the very first world players are introduced to in &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 1&lt;/em&gt;. “Ultimately what this was about was bringing this forward onto the current gen and for future generations as well, with the kind of fidelity and taking off some of the edges that people would expect with that,” Walters said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xMcUg5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Eyelashes like spider legs or potato-shaped heads&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U6kVVX"&gt;The changes throughout the series, especially in the first game, are hard to miss. In a presentation offering a direct comparison, characters who previously had curious features — eyelashes like spider legs or potato-shaped heads — now look sleek. Game textures, a well-known buggy feature of &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 1,&lt;/em&gt; in particular, have been fixed to actually resemble the materials they’re meant to be. The team has apparently squashed hundreds of bugs that stuck around throughout the original trilogy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVSpbZ"&gt;“It wasn’t that long ago that if you made a very expansive, large playbox kind of game, you could be excused for all sorts of bugs,” Walters told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a separate interview, reflecting on the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/3/16/14944840/mass-effect-andromeda-animations-final"&gt;memeable nature&lt;/a&gt; of bugs these days. “They expect a lot. They expect us to do our jobs, and part of our jobs is shipping a game to quality, bug-free as much as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GTbiUA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8i53TtQ6IQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T9lbf1"&gt;But it’s not always so simple. Walters compares it to trying to take a family photo with every relative, plus their pets. “You can imagine that you’re gonna take about 1,000 photos near the end, and one of them’s going to work. That’s the one you ship, and it’s as close as possible.” But look closely, and you start to see that someone has their eyes closed. And in the photos before and after, someone’s passed out in the background. “There’s a lot of challenge there, but no excuse,” Walters said. “I think the expectation from fans more and more is that you ship a quality game period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oy2QJ0"&gt;As for whether he enjoys all of those memes? “It’s funny if it’s someone else’s bug,” Walters said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHDhXH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will pay $61.7 million to Flex drivers after wage theft allegations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sAHqZ-ADHZjMPEhy91HzRTVf9Co=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756983/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jIdNkl"&gt;Amazon will pay $61.7 million to Flex drivers to settle allegations of stolen tips, after &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/02/amazon-pay-617-million-settle-ftc-charges-it-withheld-some"&gt;an extensive investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The figure represents the total amount of allegedly withheld tips over the two and a half years that Amazon Flex’s controversial base pay system was in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJ2SMy"&gt;“In total, Amazon stole nearly one-third of drivers’ tips to pad its own bottom line,” FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra said &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1587003/20200102_final_rchopra_statement_v2.pdf"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;, accusing Amazon of “expanding its business empire by cheating its workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u4dkyk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In total, Amazon stole nearly one-third of drivers’ tips to pad its own bottom line”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8Y8ekB"&gt;The practice of using tips to pay drivers’ base salaries generated significant outcry when it was &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-amazon-drivers-tips-20190207-story.html"&gt;revealed by the&lt;em&gt; Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;’ Johana Bhuiyan in February 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon initially defended the practice, saying drivers still received 100 percent of the tips sent by customers, even in instances when those tips displaced base pay that would otherwise have been provided by Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6v6HVP"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/amazon_flex_complaint.pdf"&gt;the FTC complaint&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon used this ambiguity to recruit drivers with promises of high base wages and the potential for significant tips — then pad its own bottom line by using tipped income to make up much of the paid base wage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G73iuu"&gt;In hiring materials materials, workers were told they would keep 100% of their tips, and separately guaranteed a base wage between $18 and $25 per hour. The drivers were not informed that the tips would sometimes be used to reimburse the base wage, resulting in some of the tipped amount going to Amazon rather than the driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dANprM"&gt;“Amazon received hundreds of complaints from drivers after enacting the change, as drivers became suspicious when their overall earnings decreased,” the commission said in its official statement. “Drivers who complained received form e-mails falsely claiming that Amazon was continuing to pay drivers 100 percent of tips.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdguCQ"&gt;Amazon became aware of the FTC’s investigation in May of 2019, when the commission issued a civil investigative demand for records relating to the Flex program. Amazon discontinued the practice &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20828550/amazon-delivery-drivers-tips-end-base-salaries-flex"&gt;in August 2019.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITfLxh"&gt;According to the FTC, the two years during gave Flex an advantage over competing delivery services, allowing the company to recruit a significant base of drivers by advertising the inflated base pay. “By the time this scheme was exposed in late 2019, Amazon Flex was far more established,” wrote Commissioner Chopra. “This conduct raises serious questions about how Amazon amassed and wielded its market power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euNYP0"&gt;Amazon reported $11.6 billion in profits over the course of 2019, with the Flex program accounting for just a tiny portion of the company’s operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WLUVPo"&gt;DoorDash and Instacart both maintained a similar base-wage system, although neither company is part of today’s settlement. Instacart reversed its policy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/10/18218329/doordash-amazon-flex-instacart-tipping-policies-controversy"&gt;in February 2019&lt;/a&gt;, shortly after the&lt;em&gt; LA Times&lt;/em&gt; reporting brought it to light. DoorDash &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/nyregion/doordash-tip-policy.html"&gt;made similar changes&lt;/a&gt; the following July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Z1fBV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rceX9V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJyfKk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdrI2U"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s next headquarters is a glass poop emoji covered in trees</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Yq8uB"&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/amazon-offices/the-next-chapter-for-hq2-sustainable-buildings-surrounded-by-nature"&gt;unveiled the design&lt;/a&gt; for the next portion of its Arlington, Virginia headquarters, and one building stands out far from the rest: a swirling glass tower covered in trees that rises to a point above the rest of the city’s skyline. Amazon calls the building “the Helix” because its corkscrew shape is supposed to take inspiration from “the natural beauty of a double helix.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VY7ZSP"&gt;It also — it must be said — bears a distinct resemblance to the swirling poop emoji, though with some healthier colors mixed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SIdPw"&gt;On the inside, the Helix will be filled with a “variety of alternative work environments” that Amazon employees can use. On the outside, there’ll be two sets of spiraling paths dotted with local plants that you’ll literally be able to hike up. (Though you may want to bring a water bottle — the renders seem to show stairs along the whole route, suggesting it’s a steep path up.) The building will be 350 feet tall, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-unveils-outdoorsy-new-hq2-renewing-its-commitment-to-offices-11612267200?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon says that it plans to offer public tours on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AmYL_W4YIkzmhwcHYPXzf7Hl6uY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275666/mt_vernon_trail_reduced.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A render of Amazon’s Helix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cpwJpm"&gt;Amazon has a similar standout structure at its Seattle headquarters. There, it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/29/16944706/amazon-mini-rainforest-workspace-spheres-seattle"&gt;the Spheres&lt;/a&gt;, three connected glass globes filled with greenery. Its design is echoed in the similarly glass-and-green Helix, albeit at a much larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0kpIO"&gt;The Helix is still just a proposal, so Amazon will need to get local approval before construction on the building can start.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/81464DMFaEMMvohbCshBFu_W0m8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275667/dogpark_reduced.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gxX5Xu"&gt;Along with the Helix, Amazon also unveiled plans for other parts of its Arlington campus. It’s also planning to construct three 22-story buildings. Between them, Amazon plans to create a plaza filled with green space and a dog run that’ll all be open to the public. The company is planning to make room for retail stores and restaurants, and, of course, food trucks. There’ll also be parking for 950 bicycles, according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5VTQ1"&gt;The first phase of Amazon’s Arlington headquarters &lt;a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2019/12/16/first-phase-of-amazons-permanent-hq2-in-pentagon-city-approved/"&gt;was approved&lt;/a&gt; in December 2019. Construction is &lt;a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/its-been-exactly-2-years-since-amazon-announced-hq2-would-be-built-in-arlington"&gt;now underway&lt;/a&gt; on a pair of 22-story towers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber is buying alcohol delivery service Drizly for $1.1 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ff93fbRwjs80mdvjuOeICx1SSpc=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756963/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xBY8kV"&gt;Uber &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210202005693/en/Uber-to-Acquire-Drizly"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s buying alcohol delivery service &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrizly.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F2%2F22262155%2Fuber-drizly-alcohol-delivery-service-eats-postmates#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Drizly&lt;/a&gt; in a deal worth $1.1 billion, as the ride-sharing company continues to build out its stable of food and other delivery services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDUnmd"&gt;The eventual plan is for Drizly’s marketplace of beer, wine, and liquor to be integrated into the existing Uber Eats application, giving Uber users a one-stop shop for both food and drink deliveries. The existing Drizly app will stick around, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IiyziZ"&gt;Drizly is effectively an online delivery storefront for existing local liquor stores. The company partners with local sellers and then enlists delivery drivers — similar to Uber Eats — to handle the delivery. The service is now available in over 1,400 cities across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="inNQlC"&gt;This deal marks the latest delivery-focused move on Uber’s part in recent months, even as it’s begun to sell off the less profitable parts of its business. Last year, Uber sold off its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;autonomous vehicle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22086597/uber-sells-flying-taxi-elevate-joby-aviation"&gt;flying taxi divisions&lt;/a&gt; as it sought to be more profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFa1JV"&gt;Those moves followed Uber’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287128/grubhub-just-eat-takeaway-merger-uber-deal-antitrust"&gt;failed attempt&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21255936/uber-grubhub-offer-buying-all-stock-delivery-service-eats-meals-merger"&gt;purchase GrubHub&lt;/a&gt; last year, along with a successful acquisition of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21312447/uber-postmates-acquisition-announced-food-delivery"&gt;Postmates over the summer&lt;/a&gt; for $2.65 billion. The company has also recently started to move into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315159/uber-grocery-delivery-launch-cornershop-latin-america-canada"&gt;on-demand grocery delivery&lt;/a&gt;, beginning in Latin America and Canada, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fuber-health-expands-to-include-prescription-delivery%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F2%2F22262155%2Fuber-drizly-alcohol-delivery-service-eats-postmates#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;expanded its Uber Health service&lt;/a&gt; to add prescription delivery. The acquisition of Drizly fits neatly into the expanding delivery-focused approach for Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQHCSb"&gt;It’s a strategy that makes sense. While futuristic projects like self-driving cars or on-demand flying taxis sound cool on paper, neither has resulted in any real profitable products. And in a bruising 2020 that saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551683/uber-q3-2020-earnings-revenue-loss-delivery"&gt;Uber post record losses&lt;/a&gt; as travel plummeted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, delivery services remained a bright spot on Uber’s ledger, growing massively, thanks to a similar COVID-induced spike in customers wanting to order in more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sCNY4"&gt;Notably, these new delivery services are all businesses that rely on contract workers. Uber recently spent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551136/uber-prop-22-victory-national-q3-2020-earnings"&gt;millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; as part of a lobbying campaign in California to avoid classifying those workers as employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;through Prop 22&lt;/a&gt;. (A group of Uber and Lyft drivers is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227042/uber-lyft-prop-22-lawsuit-overturn-drivers-california"&gt;currently suing&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that it “illegally” excludes drivers from California’s workers’ compensation program.) That’s in contrast to the parts of the company that Uber is winding down, like the autonomous vehicle program, which relied on full-time employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qau3U9"&gt;Uber and Drizly expect the deal to close sometime in the first half of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eero’s Wi-Fi 6 mesh router bundle is back down to its Black Friday price</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8OCEr0"&gt;Black Friday 2020 saw many great deals, especially on Eero’s products. If you are looking to improve your Wi-Fi situation at home, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-eero-6-3-pack/dp/B085WSCTS4?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=be0daa10b51fb94192247b0f9b3fa744&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725880696356465941" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have the Eero 6 mesh router three-pack (which includes one mesh router and two extenders) back down to its Black Friday price of $223, a nice drop from its usual cost of $279. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkQbdA"&gt;When planning your setup, keep in mind that while the Eero 6 mesh router includes two Ethernet ports, the two Eero 6 extenders that come in this bundle do not include any. Alternatively, you can buy two &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eero-6-Router/dp/B085VM9ZDD?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=0f0775c8ab5999fe980102572df0f698&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eero 6 routers&lt;/a&gt; for $206 if you want to wire Ethernet to your routers across different areas in your home. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Glitch in the Matrix is quirky, creepy, and way too unreal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Glitch in the Matrix screenshot" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Jbo2v6RGy54k9tzfbwNIZ9K3Vw=/286x0:2014x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756897/50610561366_c27761b7b5_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sundance Institute&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tVA928"&gt;In February 2003, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/story/the-matrix-made-me-do-it"&gt;a 19-year-old named Joshua Cooke&lt;/a&gt; shot his parents to death in their Virginia home. Cooke told his lawyers that he believed he was living in the Matrix, a simulated universe outlined in the 1999 Keanu Reeves blockbuster of the same name. Cooke pleaded guilty, and the defense was never used. But years later, he still offers a chilling, painful account of the moment he realized that killing another human being felt nothing like an action movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZNELH"&gt;This is arguably a spoiler for &lt;em&gt;A Glitch in the Matrix,&lt;/em&gt; a new documentary about the simulation hypothesis — the idea that our reality is actually artificial. But it’s key to explaining why the movie never comes together. &lt;em&gt;A Glitch in the Matrix&lt;/em&gt; is a quirky overview of a popular and intriguing philosophical conundrum: what if we’re living in a video game? It’s also a film about people who take that conundrum &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; seriously. But it never reconciles those elements. It’s like watching a dinner party conversation about paranormal activity where one guest is sharing wrenching stories about the spirits of dead loved ones and the other is quoting lines from &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6y5WhG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The most interesting sections describe how believing in a video game can change your life&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9Iv6nc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Glitch in the Matrix&lt;/em&gt; is directed by Rodney Ascher, known for acclaimed documentaries &lt;em&gt;The Nightmare&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Room 237&lt;/em&gt;. The film is framed by a &lt;a href="https://www.openculture.com/2014/02/philip-k-dick-theorizes-the-matrix-in-1977-declares-that-we-live-in-a-computer-programmed-reality.html"&gt;1977 lecture from&lt;/a&gt; science fiction author Philip K. Dick, who became convinced of the simulation hypothesis after an anesthetic-fueled religious experience. Its core is extended interviews with a few present-day believers who have had metaphysical epiphanies, appearing through Zoom calls where they’re obscured by sci-fi cartoon-character overlays. Gradually, they lay out their own reasons for believing in a virtual world where other people may or may not actually exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n98nHg"&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;Room 237&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/12/4216422/room-237-director-rodney-ascher-weird-world-shining-conspiracy-theories"&gt;gave obsessive &lt;em&gt;Shining&lt;/em&gt; fans space&lt;/a&gt; to present elaborate theories about its meaning, &lt;em&gt;A Glitch in the Matrix&lt;/em&gt; offers a smorgasbord of justifications for a simulated universe. You’ll find sober probability estimates from philosopher Nick Bostrom, who &lt;a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/symbsys205/BostromReview.html"&gt;popularized simulation theory in a 2001 essay&lt;/a&gt;, alongside speeches from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837874/elon-musk-says-odds-living-in-simulation"&gt;well-known proponent Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; and clickbait pseudoscience like the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory#Manifestations_and_types"&gt;Mandela Effect&lt;/a&gt;, which posits that widely misremembered pop culture references are evidence of parallel realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCkOcR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Glitch in the Matrix&lt;/em&gt; suffers from having woefully little reality, though&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The Zoom interviews are understandable during the COVID-19 pandemic, but they’re frustratingly abstract, offering no sense of what it means to actually live your life convinced the world is fake. Instead, the film is mostly spliced together from low-budget animations and copious movie and video game clips. The most compelling details get only a passing mention — like a participant who mentions motivating himself to “level up” in life and try new things, reasoning that this will make him more interesting to an otherworldly observer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sbSfoH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Why can’t you make friends? Because nobody else is human&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BwUdYA"&gt;Beyond any factual arguments, the simulation hypothesis seems to offer reassuring answers in a scary and irrational world. Why do celebrities senselessly drain their bank accounts or torch their reputations? Because they’re being controlled by a bored player character. Why would a suicidal man &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/authorities-probe-how-airline-employee-could-steal-plane/"&gt;steal and crash an empty plane&lt;/a&gt;? Because he knew he could just log out. Why can’t you make friends? Because nobody around you is really human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p49pcU"&gt;As the last question suggests, this path can lead to some very dark places. At least one participant acknowledges that his convictions might stem from social anxiety. &lt;em&gt;A Glitch in the Matrix&lt;/em&gt; briefly references &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/17991274/npc-meme-4chan-press-coverage-viral"&gt;the nihilistic 4chan “NPC” meme&lt;/a&gt;, which (although the film never mentions it) far-right partisans adopted to paint political enemies as literal automatons. And then there’s Cooke — whose killings seem motivated more by straightforward mental health problems than sci-fi delusions, but who methodically details how &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; consumed his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxHWrw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Glitch in the Matrix’s&lt;/em&gt; version of simulation theory is basically intelligent design for sociopaths. The film’s most interesting parts are about why people believe it, not whether it’s true. But it spends far too long on scattered and remarkably unconvincing arguments  presented with a tone of wide-eyed, innocent fascination — a tone that, as figures like Cooke enter the picture, feels increasingly distracting and downright creepy. And if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think other people are real, &lt;em&gt;A Glitch in the Matrix&lt;/em&gt; probably won’t persuade you otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney’s bundle that includes Disney Plus, ESPN Plus, and ad-free Hulu is widely available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disney Plus ESPN Plus Hulu bundle" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6SyVFika6QNAtrsLfP3BnsLZZ1E=/0x35:1396x966/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756862/disney_plus.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qAanMQ"&gt;Disney’s latest bundle combining Disney Plus, ad-free Hulu, and ESPN Plus for $18.99 per month is now available. This package was first announced in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168484/disney-streaming-bundle-ad-free-hulu-disney-plus-espn-price-release-date"&gt;December 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and it actually first started rolling out for new subscribers to Hulu. The news today is that the &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/707630/9358?sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sign-up page is accessible to more people&lt;/a&gt; looking to subscribe. The cheaper bundle that includes Hulu with ads sprinkled in is still available for $12.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeI8jl"&gt;This is a good value for people who’ve been patiently waiting (since Disney Plus launched in late 2019) for a bundle that includes the ad-free version of Hulu. With this one, you’ll save about $6 per month by getting all three of these services. Purchased outside of a bundle, Disney Plus costs $6.99 per month, ESPN Plus is at $5.99, and ad-free Hulu is $11.99 each month. So, it’s like you’re getting the ESPN Plus service for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbocjK"&gt;Now is an especially good time to consider jumping on, as Marvel Studios’ debut TV show, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/disney"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is running through its first season and seems to be worth watching. The next big Disney film to hit the service (and theaters simultaneously), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22250271/raya-and-the-last-dragon-trailer-watch-disney-plus-premier-access-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;will launch on March 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
