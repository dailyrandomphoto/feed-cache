    <title>First flight test for NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter pushed to Wednesday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Stbpub_rH8IYvuSpE182JbrU3eA=/0x62:1578x1114/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106684/PIA24581.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GhxL8g"&gt;NASA engineers have decided to delay the Ingenuity helicopter’s debut flight on Mars to at least Wednesday, April 14th, after running into a minor computer glitch during a rotor spin test late Friday night, the agency said on Saturday. The tiny craft is healthy, but engineers need some more time to review telemetry data from the unexpected hiccup before proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="On4tsu"&gt;Ingenuity, a mini four-pound helicopter that arrived on Mars February 18th attached to NASA’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;Perseverance rover&lt;/a&gt;, was initially slated to carry out its first flight test late Sunday night (or, mid-day Mars time). The first bits of data on whether the flight attempt was successful was expected to come early Monday morning, around 4AM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wHfcD"&gt;But data from a high-speed rotor test carried out on Friday showed the test sequence “ended early due to a ‘watchdog’ timer expiration,” &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25795/ingenuitys-blades-are-released/"&gt;NASA said&lt;/a&gt;. It happened as Ingenuity’s computer was trying to switch from pre-flight mode to flight mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0qGUr"&gt;Ingenuity’s “watchdog timer” is just that — a software-based watchdog that oversees the helicopter’s test sequences and alerts engineers if anything looks abnormal. “It helps the system stay safe by not proceeding if an issue is observed and worked as planned,” NASA said in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PD4ocC"&gt;NASA emphasized the craft is healthy, and Ingenuity is still in good contact with engineers at the agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="790zTJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22366887/nasa-mars-rover-perseverance-ingenuity-helicopter-drops-off"&gt;Ingenuity was deployed&lt;/a&gt; by Perseverance on the Martian surface on April 4th, kicking off a 31-day clock in which five flight tests are planned. For its first flight demonstration, the helicopter will ascend 10 feet above the surface and hover for about 30 seconds, aiming to achieve the first-ever powered flight on another world. Depending how the first test goes, subsequent tests will involve Ingenuity soaring to higher altitudes and buzzing around within its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346773/nasa-mars-ingenuity-helicopter-perseverance-rover-flight-zone"&gt;running track-shaped flight zone&lt;/a&gt; at Mars’ Jezero Crater.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook spent $23 million for CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s security in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vVU0OnzOEuKz-iOe3mZsbY453DU=/0x0:5157x3438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106640/1201476988.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d0kgVF"&gt;A new filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that Facebook spent more than $23 million last year on security for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook’s annual reviews of company security “identified specific threats to Mr. Zuckerberg,” according to a  &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680121000022/facebook2021definitiveprox.htm"&gt;proxy statement filed Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5fk6H"&gt;“He is synonymous with Facebook, and as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,” the proxy says of the Facebook CEO’s role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppohbs"&gt;The company’s annual review of security programs showed the costs of protecting Zuckerberg and his family rose in 2020 mainly due to COVID-19 travel protocols, increased security coverage during the 2020 US election season “and other periods with increased security risk,” as well as rising costs for security personnel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5AIES"&gt;The “all other compensation” section of the proxy statement shows Facebook spent $23 million for personal security at Zuckerberg’s residences and for travel for him and his family. The CEO also got an additional $10 million to put toward security personnel and other security costs. The cost of base security was up to $13.4 million last year, compared to $10.4 million the year prior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhByCd"&gt;“The compensation, nominating &amp;amp; governance committee believes that these costs are appropriate and necessary in light of the threat landscape and the fact that Mr. Zuckerberg has requested to receive only $1 in annual salary and does not receive any bonus payments, equity awards, or other incentive compensation,” according to the proxy statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SqRM3L"&gt;Also in the proxy filed Friday, Facebook said it will put forward a proposal at its May 26th shareholder meeting to offer personal security to non-employee directors from time to time, which it says is necessary due to “ongoing scrutiny faced by our directors as a result of their service on our board of directors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ern7kK"&gt;Facebook approved personal security services for some of the non-employee directors in January and February “in light of the high level of scrutiny faced by our company and our executive officers and directors, as well as the dynamic and charged atmosphere following the 2020 U.S. elections and the attack on the U.S. Capitol Building on January 6, 2021,” according to the proxy statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYeSlE"&gt;A January report by the Tech Transparency Project found that some extremists rioters at the Capitol attack had used &lt;a href="https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/capitol-attack-was-months-making-facebook"&gt;private groups on Facebook for months&lt;/a&gt; to plan and coordinate the January 6th insurgency, despite &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4kbd5KqbIM"&gt;remarks by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg&lt;/a&gt; that the “events were largely organized on platforms that don’t have our ability to stop hate, don’t have our standards and don’t have our transparency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1Ij1A"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUAvsM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDFNKI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Zu1J0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujMqXR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAoLFa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The team behind Age of Empires IV wants you to learn history while playing the game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/blSolxAoNmpnI23s7V0mXX59Ctw=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106611/aoe4_campaign_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DeQa2j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; games have always taken place against a historical backdrop, but Microsoft and Relic Entertainment want to take things even further with &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV&lt;/em&gt;. The game will feature narrated documentaries throughout the campaigns, time period-accurate language and music, as well as art and game design that looks to take inspiration from both world history and the history of the &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; franchise. On release, &lt;em&gt;Age IV &lt;/em&gt;will focus on the Middle Ages, having players start with small agrarian villages and build up to castles and kings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vY425V"&gt;While players can experience hundreds of years of history in a single match, the game will also feature campaigns that let players go through real-life stories that span generations. So far, the only one announced has been the Norman conquest starting with the Battle of Hastings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4j6gCv"&gt;The campaigns in &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; have always added some historical context to the battles and missions you’ll be doing, but in &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV,&lt;/em&gt; each will be accompanied by documentary footage shot on location. The team behind the game says this is in celebration of history but also works to give players context around what they’re doing. It’s easy to see how this could add to gameplay: skirmishes are fun, but knowing &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you want to win a battle can really add to the drama of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zcNiFL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The game wants to present plenty of historical context during every game mode&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dI5SU5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22372742/age-of-empires-fan-preview-new-civilzations-ambush-siege-features"&gt;We got to see some&lt;/a&gt; of the documentary footage in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OJ14RVFDGQ"&gt;the Fan Preview event&lt;/a&gt;, and it looked like the type of thing that would fit in on Netflix or The History Channel, complete with narration, props, and actors in costume. During an interview, Emma Bridle, the director of customer voice for &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires,&lt;/em&gt; told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that she had grown up in England but learned things about British history from the campaign documentaries. (That is great to hear because, as an American, it’ll be even more of a learning experience because I know almost absolutely nothing about British history.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPip_5vP5f0bKIxyDQvK_apS7c8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22434728/Age_of_Empires___Fan_Preview_5OJ14RVFDGQ_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part of the re-enactments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HaInLp"&gt;The team is also hoping to bring history to life through the audio: starting out, civilizations will be speaking in the ancient versions of their tongues. For example, if you’re playing as the English, you probably won’t be able to understand your units at the beginning of the game, as they’ll be speaking a version of English that’s unrecognizable to modern-day players. However, as you progress, you’ll start to understand more and more of what they say as the language evolves toward what we speak today. Similarly, the music starts as a stripped-down score with only a few instruments, evolving throughout the game to be a full orchestra as your civilization advances. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ypeu4jUglFCf8yq3UUz6m7OWc-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22432875/AOEIVBuilding.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;According to the game’s art director, the golden people were inspired by illuminated manuscripts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WS9WRx"&gt;In between talking about real-life history, the team also talked about the history of &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; as a franchise and how &lt;em&gt;Age IV&lt;/em&gt; will continue and evolve its legacy. To anyone who’s played an &lt;em&gt;AoE&lt;/em&gt; game, the art style will look instantly familiar but will have additional flourishes like the golden illuminated people that show the work being done on your buildings. The developers also talked about taking a look at the design of the old game to try to figure out what mechanics and behaviors were deliberate design decisions and which were due to technical limitations that could be tweaked and expanded upon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFPHkw"&gt;As someone who is a fan of &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; but is generally ignorant about history, I’m looking forward to being able to learn as I play. While previous games in the franchise did have historical dressing, I can’t say they taught me much. Perhaps that will change with &lt;em&gt;Age IV.&lt;/em&gt; But it seems that the game wants to present plenty of historical context during every game mode, both about ancient civilizations and not-so-ancient games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Everything we learned about Age of Empires IV’s new civilizations, campaigns, and wololos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LGTXc5zc-EPlIY_23Q82V6JvN90=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106533/aoe4_naval_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7EMU9b"&gt;We haven’t heard much about &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/22/16182760/age-of-empires-iv-development-microsoft-pc-release-date"&gt;since it was announced in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ve finally been given a look at the game, which includes the Mongols and Delhi Sultanate as playable civilizations. Microsoft and developer Relic Entertainment showed off a healthy amount of gameplay footage as well as new features and civilizations coming to the series &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OJ14RVFDGQ"&gt;in a “Fan Preview” event&lt;/a&gt;. The game also has a release window: fall 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhNIzS"&gt;The last main entry in the long-running historical strategy series &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires_III"&gt;was released in 2005&lt;/a&gt;, and the new game looks to build on the formula created by previous entries, while adding features made possible by 15-ish years of technological improvements. That includes the obvious things — like 4K and HDR — to more strategy game-centric upgrades, like new pathfinding that will accommodate tons of units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NUEI7x"&gt;According to the team behind the game, there will be eight civilizations in the initial release of the game. So far, we know four of them: the Mongols and Delhi Sultanate are making their first appearances in &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt;, and the Chinese and English will be returning. So far, there hasn’t been a lot of information about the unique abilities and traits of each civilization. However, we did get to see that the Delhi Sultanate will include elephant units and that the Mongols will have the ability to pack up and move their buildings and towns (which is mind-blowing to see in action).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r9tZy1q0LDg4dju75xP_B92QyY8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430111/aoe4_mon_008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A highly portable Mongol camp.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7vJynW"&gt;During a Q&amp;amp;A, Relic talked a lot about adding asymmetry to civilizations; the team wanted to make sure that each played differently, with the randomly generated maps playing to different civilizations’ strengths and weaknesses. For example, a wide-open map could benefit the Mongols with their highly mobile units and towns, while a map with a lot of chokepoints could benefit the defense-heavy English. There will still be similar classes of units, but the developers wanted to make sure that players could switch up the gameplay style if they wanted to and even main a certain civilization if they really like its mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxqoRG"&gt;The game’s creators also talked about the evolution of campaigns, which act as a sort of story mode in &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt;. They revealed that there would be four campaigns in the game but only shared details about one: the Norman conquest. I’m not enough of a history buff to know anything about that, but it seems like the game will be trying to teach me. The team talked extensively about the fact that campaigns would include documentary footage with narration about the real-life historical events that you’ll be playing through.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7A3PVL767VmQbkJjCZcocmu3LJE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430127/aoe4_campaign_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I bet this campaign screenshot is really cool if you know the historical context.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S5bYYy"&gt;The game will also include some new mechanics. The studio showed off a very interesting feature called stealth force, which allows players to create ambushes where enemies will not be able to see their units hiding and waiting. It’s a feature the creators hope will not only add excitement and tension to gameplay, but will actually give you a reason to keep scout units around, as you’ll need to make sure there isn’t an entire army hiding along your route. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pk1guGRtwQwt181BNG9l5AEXl_g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430116/aoe4_campaigngameplay_004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6A6j98"&gt;The event also showed off wall combat, where units were able to fight both in front of and on top of castle walls, and siege mechanics, where a base could be surrounded by units and — as the name implies — siege weapons. These two mechanics should help to make raiding and defending castles more strategic. We also got a brief glimpse at an area-of-effect wololo, something that’s very intriguing for fans of &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; and memes alike. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1WupBug5fkr4ChDJhHC1KuQDsik=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430110/Age_of_Empires_IV_Broll_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wololo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sWbDqn"&gt;Fans of older entries in the series also have things to look forward to. The developers talked about &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV&lt;/em&gt; being a spiritual successor to &lt;em&gt;AoE II&lt;/em&gt;, while still incorporating some elements from &lt;em&gt;III,&lt;/em&gt; such as the addition of choice into the aging-up mechanics. The Definitive Edition of &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;II&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;III&lt;/em&gt; are also getting updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOMzqL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt; is getting its second expansion pack, titled Dawn of Dukes, which will focus on Eastern Europe. Co-op will also be coming to the game at some point this year, which will allow you to play through certain campaigns and battles with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUUAcH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt; is getting the United States added as a civilization in an update. Cleverly, the update will be free if you play through a challenge, but players who don’t want to go through the effort will be able to purchase it from Steam or the Microsoft Store. It was also revealed that the first &lt;em&gt;AoE III: Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt; expansion is being worked on and will feature African civilizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTLJ1f"&gt;As someone who played hundreds of hours of &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires II&lt;/em&gt;, I’m excited for the tech tree advancements in &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, I’d also love more details, especially after such a long wait since the announcement. What other civilizations will we get to play? What do the plans for future expansions look like? Will there be fun cheat codes? These questions are unanswered for now, but it seems like it won’t be entire age before we find out. I look forward to finding out that I forgot everything about how to play the game and immediately getting crushed by an easy AI when it finally releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BANN4W"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;will be available on Windows 10 PCs through Steam, the Microsoft Store, and Xbox Game Pass for PC in fall 2021.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RverNg"&gt;For more than a year, a group of workers in Bessemer, Alabama have campaigned to unionize their warehouse under the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), hoping to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;force the retail giant to collectively bargain with its warehouse workers&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. On Friday, those hopes came to an abrupt end. In a unit-wide election, workers at the warehouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;voted against unionization by a more than 2-1 margin&lt;/a&gt;, with 738 votes in favor to 1,798 against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvVDHs"&gt;It’s a devastating loss for the RWDSU and the labor movement broadly. The union is still fighting the result — filing objections and arguing that Amazon’s campaign violated labor law — but those challenges are unlikely to change the result. After dreaming of a domino effect that could unionize Amazon warehouses across the country, organizers are now fighting to keep that dream alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2FLyUC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our labor law is stacked against the people it’s meant to protect”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gquXJ9"&gt;But while the lopsided result was a surprise to many, it’s part of a long, frustrating history for American labor organizers. In simple terms, not very many American workers are unionized, and organizers are used to facing an uphill battle in unionizing new workplaces. Outside of government jobs, just &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm"&gt;6.3 percent of US workers&lt;/a&gt; belong to a union, a number that has fallen slightly over the past 10 years. Southern industrial workers have been a particularly sore point for the labor movement, with similar drives losing out at &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/15/733074989/tennessee-workers-reject-union-at-volkswagen-plant-again"&gt;a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.labornotes.org/2017/08/why-did-nissan-workers-vote-no"&gt;a Nissan plant in Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. Seen in that context, the Bessemer loss is less of a surprise victory for Amazon and more of a depressing return to the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g977bn"&gt;“It’s a blow to the labor movement, but it’s part of a pattern that’s been going on in corporate America for a long time,” says Professor Dan Cornfield, a labor sociologist at Vanderbilt University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeOb7j"&gt;Another force working against organizers is US labor law, which gives employers broad leeway to promote an anti-union message in the workplace. Amazon had campaigned aggressively against the union in recent months, posting anti-RWDSU flyers in warehouse bathrooms and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;bombarding workers with targeted text messages&lt;/a&gt;. But while organizers saw those tactics as fighting dirty, they’re all within the bounds of current law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8alpvI"&gt;“Our labor law is stacked against the people it’s meant to protect,” says Rebecca Kolins Givan, an Associate Professor at the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations. “It’s extremely hard for workers to organize a union and ridiculously easy for employers to bully them out of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="eB0U9R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a lethal combination for workers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQMd2a"&gt;Tactics like the “captive audience” meeting — in which employers force workers to attend anti-union workshops as part of their job — are particularly controversial among labor activists. “Part of the problem is that the law gives the employer too much latitude to interfere,” says Benjamin Sachs, Kestnbaum Professor of Labor and Industry at Harvard Law School. “So the union can’t challenge a lot of what Amazon did, like captive audience meetings, because the law is that the employer has the right to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1GJgU"&gt;Some are also pointing to &lt;a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/bessemer-alabama-amazon-union/"&gt;tactical missteps made in the campaign&lt;/a&gt;. Organizers minimized house calls with workers because of the pandemic, instead focusing on reaching workers in the area immediately outside the warehouse. There was also significant confusion over the unit itself, with organizers underestimating the number of eligible workers by thousands in the early stages of the campaign. While the 1,060-vote margin might seem daunting, it’s dwarfed by the thousands of in-unit workers who did not cast a ballot at all, whether because of indifference or intimidation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aurohb"&gt;For Cornfield, the most important force was the economics of the region. Like much of the country, &lt;a href="http://www2.labor.alabama.gov/"&gt;Alabama’s unemployment rate spiked during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, going from 2.6 percent to 13.6 percent from March to April. It was a huge economic shock to the region, and may have put a dark cloud over the union effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwQXTg"&gt;“If an employer does behave aggressively and much of the workforce has experienced recession level unemployment,” Cornfield says, “that’s a lethal combination for workers who might otherwise see the merits of unionization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySRrEJ"&gt;Now that the Bessemer fight is over, there’s a lot labor groups can do to level the playing field. There’s particular hope that, under Biden, the National Labor Relations Board will start to change the rules around captive audience meetings and other tactics. The PRO Act, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/09/975259434/house-democrats-pass-bill-that-would-protect-worker-organizing-efforts"&gt;currently awaiting a Senate vote&lt;/a&gt;, would go even further, establishing monetary penalties for executives who skirt labor laws, among other measures. But in the meantime, any future efforts to organize Amazon warehouses will face much longer odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CKOcB"&gt;“I know the outcome is not what a lot of people wanted to hear,” said Michael Foster, one of the leading RWDSU organizers in Bessemer, in a press conference on Friday. “But I believe this is the foundation for something great… by no means is this the end.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The week in NFTs, ranked</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rEodcf9wWg9rJwBaLzi1e8eAev4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106239/acastro_210329_1777_nft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NdFXNU"&gt;It’s another day in 2021, and so of course it’s another day where someone, somewhere is launching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;an NFT&lt;/a&gt; in hopes of making a ton of easy money. This week’s NFT launches were headlined by some big names — M.I.A., Tfue, Spike Jonze — and collectively posed the question: can you still, nearly a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;Beeple’s blockbuster NFT sale&lt;/a&gt; at Christie’s, make a stupid amount of cash off these things in part by being in the right place at the right time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngUUdo"&gt;The answer, it seems, is mostly yes. And several of this week’s NFT creators were clearly here for just that possibility. Not that this NFT thing was always the exclusive realm of fine art — I present to you &lt;a href="https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:322068:0x63f69c262122fac7fa4a1bf4eb599f63d7cb6506"&gt;this golden Pringles can&lt;/a&gt; that raises its eyebrows at you as if to say &lt;em&gt;come and try me &lt;/em&gt;— but there’s a clear feeling of function (making money) over form (being a piece of artwork) with some of these latest projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPBm9K"&gt;Because I cannot look away from the endless stream of NFT launches — good, bad, fascinating, and facepalmingly dumb — I now present you with a list of my favorite / least favorite of the last seven days. I assure you, this list is nowhere close to comprehensive; it is merely a collection of the NFTs I could remember off the top of my head while writing this story. There are truly too many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BIT3o1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="vNTX8T"&gt;6. Tfue’s NFTfue collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="bt3dpl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My NFTfue auction is now LIVE on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/opensea?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@OpenSea&lt;/a&gt;! Head over to &lt;a href="https://t.co/gm72oFIlY1"&gt;https://t.co/gm72oFIlY1&lt;/a&gt; or tune into my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joinClubhouse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@JoinClubHouse&lt;/a&gt; session tonight to learn more about the collection! &lt;a href="https://t.co/unSqzit1zl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/unSqzit1zl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tfue (@TTfue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TTfue/status/1380295162849595393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tILDpc"&gt;Tfue, a popular esports player and Twitch streamer, launched &lt;a href="https://www.nftfue.com/"&gt;an NFT series&lt;/a&gt; based around cartoony versions of himself inserted into major video games. The videos look like they were quickly thrown together by &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/01/27/267018900/for-taiwanese-news-animators-funny-videos-are-serious-work"&gt;the Taiwanese studio&lt;/a&gt; that makes those uncomfortably unnecessary animated news clips. There’s also a series of NFT bobbleheads, which, at least, come bundled with a physical bobblehead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5tRuNZ"&gt;“This NFT is digitally signed by Tfue, the physical Bobblehead is not signed,” the sales page warns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAfm89"&gt;The team Tfue worked with expects the NFTs to sell for “somewhere between $300,000 and a million,” &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/04/06/tfue-nft/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xN0qlM"&gt;5. 100 Thieves’ 100 Thieves NFTs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="T0YraC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;100 Thieves Enter Infinity NFT Collection&lt;br&gt;Live Now&lt;a href="https://t.co/me5zV37mOx"&gt;https://t.co/me5zV37mOx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/FiWtreeiSi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/FiWtreeiSi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 100 Thieves (@100Thieves) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/100Thieves/status/1379509538592710657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QQ2Woc"&gt;The hugely buzzy esports group 100 Thieves, which counts Drake as a co-owner, launched a series of NFTs showing their logo imposed on a vibey animation of a spinning, metallic galaxy. There are eight versions of the same animation with different color combinations used on each one. It’s kind of like buying a pin or sticker from your favorite sports team, except in this case, &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/100Thieves/enter-infinity-gateway-001-19807"&gt;it’ll cost you 3 Ether&lt;/a&gt;, or around $6,250.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="peBCAe"&gt;4. A film anthology featuring Flying Lotus and Spike Jonze&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="uEozD5"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kQSOTN"&gt;I have no idea what you’re really buying here when you buy the NFTs associated with this collection of short films. What does it mean to own a film’s NFT, when presumably that film will continue to be screened and sold by the actual owner of the movie?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AqsPHK"&gt;Each of the short films &lt;a href="https://nftfest.io/"&gt;in this collection&lt;/a&gt; (save for one) is being sold individually as an NFT, and then the anthology as a whole (plus that additional short) is being sold as an NFT, too. Buyers get the ever-ambiguous NFT, plus a Blu-ray of the film and a display featuring a clip from the shorts. Whoever buys the anthology will get a full box set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjAC1n"&gt;The one thing I do think is compelling here is the pitch for the anthology: most of the proceeds are meant to be put back into making films so the creators can make a second volume of the anthology. I doubt NFTs are the future of film financing, but they might help supplement a Kickstarter someday soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0I0tId"&gt;3. M.I.A.’s old art NFTs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="6fOXd2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"GIFTY_1"   &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MIAuniverse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@MIAuniverse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I wanted to reference the timescale and evolution of GIFs using my own work."  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For her entrance into NFTs, M.I.A. minted the first video she made in 1996 when she was in art school.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Auction starts tomorrow → &lt;a href="https://t.co/GppykJJNga"&gt;https://t.co/GppykJJNga&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/6vTP2IKxbF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6vTP2IKxbF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Foundation   (@withFND) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/withFND/status/1379974426830069763?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8iCUH3"&gt;M.I.A. put a few NFTs up on &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/"&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt; that include some old artworks of hers. Two of them are just &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/MIA/gifty-2-19511"&gt;short&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/MIA/gifty-1-19509"&gt;clips&lt;/a&gt; of herself from the late ’90s doing a weird dance / possible exercise class routine, and truthfully they are great. There’s also some &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/MIA/kala-coyn-17865"&gt;kaleidoscopic GIF of a coin&lt;/a&gt; that sold for 25 Ether, or around $52,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QtG2Ao"&gt;2. Another 200+ year old auction house is selling an NFT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="UsqQi3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Coming to our online saleroom 12-23 April, 'REPLICATOR' by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Mad_Dog_Jones?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Mad_Dog_Jones&lt;/a&gt; is the first NFT in company history.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YyhtiO"&gt;Phillips, Christie’s slightly younger neighbor in London, is getting into NFTs with the sale of &lt;a href="https://www.phillips.com/mdj"&gt;an artwork called &lt;em&gt;REPLICATOR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r54Vtv"&gt;At its most basic, the work is just a short video clip of a photocopier. But the twist is that the NFT will produce additional NFTs over time, all of which will be owned by the buyer of the initial work. Those NFTs will in turn produce more NFTs, and some NFTs can “jam,” stopping further replication but producing a unique “jam artwork.” After seven generations, the works will stop reproducing (so it will not be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;total &lt;/em&gt;ecological nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, like the rest of the blockchain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCuwNZ"&gt;The NFT seems like a reseller’s dream, since they’ll be in possession of a growing number of works that can be split up and resold. And what are NFTs (all of cryptocurrency, really) about if not making a questionable investment and reselling it years later for inexplicable returns?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mmA99x"&gt;1. The Fyre Fest sandwich&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="0gHjHe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The dinner that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fyrefestival?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@fyrefestival&lt;/a&gt; promised us was catered by Steven Starr is literally bread, cheese, and salad with dressing.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fyrefestival?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#fyrefestival&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/I8d0UlSNbd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/I8d0UlSNbd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Trevor DeHaas (@trev4president) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trev4president/status/857776562615308288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 28, 2017&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m6DTrh"&gt;At first glance, this looks like a grift on a grift: an NFT sale, of a tweet, of a photo, &lt;em&gt;from Fyre Fest&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373477/fyre-fest-tweet-sandwich-auction-nft-medical-expenses"&gt;is being put up for auction&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of raising $80,000. But the seller, Trevor DeHaas, is using the sale to fund medical bills to pay for a kidney transplant — turning it into a sort of GoFundMe in the latest bizarro horror story from America’s health care system, as my colleague Kim Lyons &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373477/fyre-fest-tweet-sandwich-auction-nft-medical-expenses"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; in a story speaking with DeHaas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oI6bPB"&gt;Honestly, this is the ultimate NFT sale, and it deserves a $69 million price tag.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>For many, COVID-19 vaccines come with a side of side effects</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtkY1f"&gt;Getting a COVID-19 vaccine comes with a lot of benefits. There’s the protection against a world-altering virus, the ability to travel more safely, and hanging out in people’s houses again. There are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/business/covid-19-vaccine-krispy-kreme-donuts.html"&gt;also doughnuts&lt;/a&gt;. But there’s also &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778441"&gt;a pretty good chance&lt;/a&gt; that a vaccine will be accompanied by a few unwelcome side effects. Most of these are pretty benign — like a sore arm or fatigue. Some are more serious, but those are also extremely rare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfkShI"&gt;Here’s a cheat sheet&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to help you figure out what to expect after your COVID-19 shot.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMmkKj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some common side effects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tw5nkv"&gt;Your arm might feel sore after you get the shot, and there might be some redness or swelling near the injection site. There’s also a chance that you could develop a headache, fever, muscle pain, chills, fatigue, or nausea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wN4AMa"&gt;This is all according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html"&gt;has a helpful &lt;/a&gt;page about side effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Yxj1SY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NM2a9q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I notice something else, not on that list? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NiM9Br"&gt;The CDC’s list is of the most common side effects — there may be others that occur less frequently, or that haven’t shown up in studies yet. Researchers are still gathering data on vaccines and their side effects. In fact, one brand-new study is looking for a possible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374523/covid-vaccine-period-heavy-survey"&gt;connection between vaccines and irregular menstrual cycles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oV0MZV"&gt;As with any medical treatment, take note of your symptoms and if any concern you, talk to your doctor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhnU6o"&gt;If you’re in the US and you want to help researchers gather data about vaccine side effects, you can also enroll in the CDC’s v-safe program once you get your shot. It’s a smartphone-based system that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html"&gt;asks you about your side effects&lt;/a&gt; after you get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSDOZe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve heard it’s the second shot that gets you — is that true? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ix3B7z"&gt;Yes, if you get a two-dose vaccine like Pfizer or Moderna, your symptoms may be more intense after your second shot than they were after your first. It’s not inherently a bad thing — it means that your body has learned its lesson from the first dose, and your immune system is now ready to fight off the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfbBqG"&gt;“Your body is primed by that first dose of vaccine.” said Melanie Swift, co-chair of the COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation and Distribution Work Group at Mayo Clinic &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/understanding-covid-19-vaccine-side-effects-why-second-dose-could-feel-worse/"&gt;in a Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/a&gt;. “The second vaccine dose goes into your body, starts to make that spike protein, and your antibodies jump on it and rev up your immune system response. It’s kind of like they’ve studied for the test. And it’s acing the test.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A person gets their first shot of a COVID-19 vaccine in Los Angeles on April 9.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jtdWCn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is more likely to get side effects? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mu22N"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-vaccine-side-effects-women-younger-adults-2021-4"&gt;Younger people&lt;/a&gt; are more likely to see side effects. The immune system gradually weakens as you get older, this is called immunosenescence. Younger people’s immune systems are more likely to react strongly to a vaccine, making them more likely to feel side effects as their bodies go through a practice run of fighting off an infection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTokuY"&gt;Women are also more likely to report side effects after getting a shot. Many women tend to have stronger immune responses to vaccines in general, and the COVID-19 vaccines are no different. But other factors, including gender bias in trial design, and inconsistent reporting &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/04/10/covid-vaccine-women-report-more-side-effects-than-men-heres-why/7139366002/"&gt;might also play a role&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ez2odz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;know &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m going to be sore — should I take something ahead of time? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LoHuwP"&gt;No. “It is not recommended you take over-the-counter medicine – such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or acetaminophen – before vaccination for the purpose of trying to prevent vaccine-related side effects.” the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/prepare-for-vaccination.html"&gt;page on preparing for your COVID-19 vaccination&lt;/a&gt; says. Researchers aren’t sure if those medications might change how well the vaccines work, so they ask that people hold off, and don’t take those pain relievers, or antihistamines ahead of your appointment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XnxsaZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;After &lt;/em&gt;your appointment is a bit of a different story. While the CDC still recommends talking to your doctor before you decide to take medicine, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html"&gt;it also says&lt;/a&gt; that you can take over the counter medications “to relieve post-vaccination side effects if you have no other medical reasons that prevent you from taking these medications normally.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YD6gfo"&gt;If you are sore after your shot, the CDC recommends putting a cool washcloth over the site and moving your arm around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOWjyn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are some vaccines more likely to cause side effects than others? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Seqdv"&gt;Looks like it. A&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371665/covid-vaccine-side-effects-moderna-pfizer"&gt; study published this week found&lt;/a&gt; that people who got Moderna’s vaccine were more likely to say they experienced side effects than people who got the Pfizer/BioNTech shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vWB3z"&gt;Both vaccines are still considered to be safe and effective. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Agriculture Workers In California Receive COVID-19 Vaccination" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bkhaqy_Jupi_A-TSCGqfWzWkTwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22434470/1310980701.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;People wait in a medical observation area after getting their shot. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bwHK9q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the rare, scary side effects? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RvL1IS"&gt;There have been some instances of people having a severe allergic reaction to their shots — severe enough that they need to take epinephrine or go to a hospital. That’s one reason why people are asked to hang around for medical observation for about 15 minutes after they get their vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGYnTS"&gt;Other people might have what is still considered an ‘immediate’ allergic reaction (hives, wheezing, swelling) within four hours of their shot. In those rare cases, or if you are&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/specific-groups/allergies.html"&gt; allergic to something in the shots&lt;/a&gt;, doctors may advise you to get a different vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGTiTk"&gt;Outside the US, some researchers have noticed that in very rare instances, some people who get AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine develop serious blood clots. This &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/health/vaccine-blood-clots-astra-zeneca.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;may be because of an unusual antibody reaction&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s still not certain what’s causing the clots, or who is at highest risk, though it &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/rapid-response-recommended-use-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-younger-adults.html"&gt;does appear to be safer in older people&lt;/a&gt;. This particular vaccine is not authorized for use in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjBW7q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When should I worry about side effects? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNDFbJ"&gt;The CDC recommends that you talk to a doctor if your side effects don’t go away after a few days, or they start worrying you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nipVMO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I don’t have side effects, does that mean that it’s not working? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cKpjT"&gt;While it is true that side effects are a sign that your body is building up its COVID-19 defenses, if you don’t have them, that doesn’t mean that the vaccine isn’t working. &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/if-you-dont-have-covid-vaccine-side-effects-are-you-still-protected/"&gt;You’re still protected&lt;/a&gt;, you just happen to be one of the lucky people whose immune system isn’t being a total jerk to you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYMHzc"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qaOuuy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antivirus will be taking a break next week, April 17th. We’ll be back on April 24th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s well worth the read. (Monica Chin/&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLvRdd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/health/coronavirus-hygiene-cleaning-surfaces.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has the Era of Overzealous Cleaning Finally Come to an End?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;This week the CDC updated its cleaning guidelines, emphasizing that the chance of catching the virus from a surface is just 1 in 10,000. That’s a big change from earlier in the pandemic, when we were all washing everything that came into our homes. Cleaning is still important — especially around someone with an active infection, but many experts now think the bigger risk of transmission is through the air. (Emily Anthes/&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;

If it works, it could make a big difference in the push for global vaccination. (Carl Zimmer/&lt;em&gt;The New York Times)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Check, Please is the feel-good queer hockey / baking comic you didn’t know you needed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8nF4nb69qccm7c1LsXZn3b0cTak=/0x5:1300x872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106059/CheckPlease_Banner_1300x875_b13a84c2_318e_4200_b50a_eb042de304ed_1300x.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ngozi Ukazu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f6wu9V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comics have never been bigger: with Marvel TV shows, DC movies, and indie adaptations growing by the day, comic books have never been more prominent in pop culture. This biweekly Verge column recommends comic series new and old, whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2KOhu"&gt;Comics can be pretty depressing these days. Existential drama, dark storylines, and epic battles for the fate of the galaxy are all regular occurrences. But on the other side of the spectrum is &lt;em&gt;Check, Please&lt;/em&gt;, a heartwarming hockey comic that’s the feel-good equivalent of a slice of warm apple pie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWTpnz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check, Please&lt;/em&gt; is a webcomic / graphic novel by Ngozi Ukazu. It’s set across the four years of college for Eric “Bitty” Bittle, a gay NCAA hockey player at the fictional Samwell University. He is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; a baking vlogger who loves to make pies and basically anything else. The comic’s name is a pun — “check,” like the hockey move that Bittle is terrified of as a former figure skater and “check, please” like what a customer might say at a diner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIbApm"&gt;The comic spans Bittle’s time on the Samwell Men’s Hockey team, and it has something for everyone. Sports action? Check. An honest and cute queer romance? Check. Drama? Check. Baked goods? Double check. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L0sJ5RrpUk7Ra6hBesWB3gZDR0U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22433325/CheckPlease_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ngozi Ukazu&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yxBDLd"&gt;Rounding out the cast is Jack, the captain of the team and son of a former NHL legend with his own struggles, along with the rest of the team: a group of the nicest, most diverse, fun-loving college bros that you’ll wish you could have partied with in real life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGONmh"&gt;The comic bounces from lighthearted to serious from chapter to chapter. One might deal with Bittle coming out to friends or family, another a triumphant hockey game, and a third with the team just hanging out at a diner. Ukazu gives everything its fair attention. A raucous party is treated as important as a visit from Bittle’s parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIlo5W"&gt;Adding to everything is the incredible artwork: Ukazu’s art is perfect for the tone, with friendly characters and warm colors that help further build out the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asI1Oq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s it by? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check, Please&lt;/em&gt; is written and illustrated by Ngozi Ukazu. Ukazu also ran an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/omgcheckplease?lang=en"&gt;in-universe Twitter account for Bittle&lt;/a&gt; during the run of the comic for an added dimension to the story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vayofh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I read it? &lt;/strong&gt;You can read &lt;em&gt;Check, Please&lt;/em&gt; for free in its webcomic form through &lt;a href="https://www.checkpleasecomic.com/comic/01-01-01"&gt;Ukazu’s website&lt;/a&gt; or pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Check-Please-Hockey-Ngozi-Ukazu/dp/1250177960?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two-volume&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Check-Please-Book-Sticks-Scones/dp/1250179505?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;graphic novel&lt;/a&gt; (which features updated art and some additional content) if you prefer your comics in print. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic antitrust case versus Apple in Australia gets three-month stay </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CGTM665yR__G3wga7bj27k3Pf-Y=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106057/apple_fortnite_1984_parody.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qF227E"&gt;An Australian judge has ruled that Epic’s lawsuit against Apple in Australia will be temporarily suspended as the two sides prepare for a trial in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2021/04/epic-vs-apple-australia-court-case-temporarily-suspended/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo Australia&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Apple had &lt;a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2021/03/apple-tried-to-kill-epics-australian-fortnite-lawsuit-this-week/"&gt;asked for a permanent stay&lt;/a&gt; of the case in Australia, arguing that the US and Australia cases were very similar, and that the matter should be settled in the original jurisdiction of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umZUrn"&gt;The two companies are fighting over Epic’s battle royale game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite, &lt;/em&gt;and the fees Apple charges&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; In August, Epic set up its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;own in-game payments system,&lt;/a&gt; effectively circumventing Apple’s App Store payments and avoiding the 30 percent surcharge Apple collects on App Store purchases. Apple then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from its iOS App Store&lt;/a&gt; for violating its rules. Epic fired back with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;antitrust lawsuit seeking to establish Apple’s App Store as a monopoly&lt;/a&gt; and tried to rally &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fans with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367924/watch-epic-nineteen-eighty-fortnite-short-apple-app-store-ban"&gt;protest video&lt;/a&gt; mocking Apple’s iconic “1984” ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6PyAm"&gt;In November, Epic filed a &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-games-files-legal-proceedings-against-google-in-australia"&gt;similar legal claim&lt;/a&gt; against Apple in Australia, saying the iPhone maker’s conduct was “unconscionable, and breaches the Australian Consumer Law as well as various sections of the Competition and Consumer Act [of] 2010.” Epic has also filed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323100/epic-google-australia-legal-claim-fortnite-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;similar claims against Google&lt;/a&gt; and its mobile app store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLQHTl"&gt;Australian Judge Nye Perram ordered Friday that the case in that country be temporarily stayed for three months. He also said the proceedings will continue to be suspended in Australia if Epic continues to pursue its case in the US, but could bring the case back to Australian courts depending on the outcome in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="clF5lN"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;Apple and Epic filed proposed findings of fact documents&lt;/a&gt; for the US court case, which is set to open in California on May 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvDPV4"&gt;Neither Epic nor Apple immediately replied to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech officially discontinues its Harmony remotes</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SAW6qz"&gt;Logitech said Friday it is discontinuing its line of Harmony universal remotes, ending years of speculation that the devices were on their way out. Models that are currently in stock at retailers will be available while supplies last, and the company says it will continue to provide support and service for the Harmony remote “as long as customers are using it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAfPQZ"&gt;“While Harmony remotes are and continue to be available through various retailers, moving forward Logitech will no longer manufacture Harmony remotes,” according to a&lt;a href="https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/1500000658341"&gt; blog post on Logitech’s support page&lt;/a&gt;. “We expect no impact to our customers by this announcement. We plan to support our Harmony community and new Harmony customers, which includes access to our software and apps to set up and manage your remotes. We also plan to continue to update the platform and add devices to our Harmony database. Customer and warranty support will continue to be offered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2rmnj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ir.logitech.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2004/Logitech-Acquires-Intrigue-Technologies-Maker-of-Acclaimed-Harmony-Remote-Controls/default.aspx"&gt;Logitech acquired Intrigue Technologies&lt;/a&gt;, the original maker of the Harmony remote, back in 2004. Harmony universal remotes were popular among consumers seeking one remote to rule them all— cable box, gaming console, and streaming devices. Some newer models were even able to be used with smart home devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgEOKl"&gt;Logitech’s business has boomed during the coronavirus pandemic as people worked and schooled at home; in January, &lt;a href="https://s1.q4cdn.com/104539020/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Logitech-F3Q21-Prepared-Remarks.pdf"&gt;the company reported its third-quarter sales&lt;/a&gt; were up 85 percent year over year to $1.67 billion, enough that it could splurge on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22260033/logitech-pandemic-super-bowl-ad"&gt;its first-ever Super Bowl commercial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUE2hb"&gt;But with the rise of streaming services over the past few years, universal remotes are no longer as crucial as they once were. Logitech CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20905042/logitech-ceo-harmony-universal-remote-streaming-smart-tv-voice-assistant-bracken-darrell"&gt;Bracken Darrell told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 that Harmony was a small business for the company; he said the remote business was only about 6 percent of the size of Logitech’s massive keyboard business, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxLzNr"&gt;“I think over time, you’ll have fewer and fewer people who feel like they really need that universal remote,” Darrell said at the time. He added that the company appreciated hardcore Harmony users who love the device: “it’s so rare to have users that love something as much as a lot of our Harmony users do. We’ll always take care of them because we really believe that that’s part of the responsibility of the brand,” Darrell told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “So we do love Harmony for that reason. How long it will be out there, I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3KbA6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bx-group-1122947-nbXkQWD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0fFfz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NOBcxt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
