    <title>Leica phone announced by SoftBank in Japan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FOBU2_fK_41ENIQWpT0H1W67TMs=/0x0:660x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465217/leitz.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zzd58N"&gt;SoftBank has announced a Leica-branded phone for the Japanese market. Leica has lent its name to phone camera systems before, but this Leitz Phone 1 is the first time the Leica brand and iconic red dot has taken precedence on a smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYoJyG"&gt;The camera system is of course going to be paramount for a device like this, and the hardware here is certainly unusual. There’s a single 20-megapixel 1-inch sensor — the biggest in any phone — with a 19mm-equivalent f/1.9 ultrawide lens, meaning other focal lengths need to use digital zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SB59G"&gt;If that sounds familiar, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439883/sharp-aquos-r6-japan-biggest-phone-camera-sensor-1-inch"&gt;Sharp announced the exact same thing a month ago&lt;/a&gt;. The Aquos R6 has the same Leica-branded camera system — though the Leitz Phone 1 makes it look a lot bigger — and other specs like its 120Hz Pro IGZO OLED screen are also a match. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jCzqb7S-ARMaHwm6Nw-C6Wl1s8E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664394/leitz2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Bundled accessories for the Leitz Phone 1.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wrYfpg"&gt;On the other hand, the Aquos R6 doesn’t come with a lens cap and matching case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vqucke"&gt;SoftBank is also selling the Aquos R6 alongside the Leitz Phone 1, and isn’t attempting to hide the similarities behind the two phones. Instead, it’s positioning the R6 as a model for someone who just wants the Leica camera, and the Leitz Phone 1 for those who value Leica’s hardware design. And besides, what could be more in keeping with Leica tradition than tweaking existing products with a red dot? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LO6MRq"&gt;Preorders for the Leitz Phone 1 start tomorrow in Japan. It’ll cost 187,920 yen, or about $1,700.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China successfully launches three astronauts to new space station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5NdPkSgYBMVwdhuyKBsPF7wB8dU=/166x0:1711x1030/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69464656/Screen_Shot_2021_06_16_at_9.24.58_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;CGTN&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pJ1wPR"&gt;A Long March rocket blasted off from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center today, carrying three astronauts to China’s new space station. The launch marks China’s &lt;a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2021/06/09/long-march-2f-rocket-rolls-out-to-launch-pad-for-chinas-next-human-spaceflight/"&gt;first crewed mission&lt;/a&gt; in five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0BHsq"&gt;The launch of the Shenzhou-12 spacecraft took place at 9:22AM local time on Thursday morning. The &lt;a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-06/16/c_1310010243.htm"&gt;three astronauts&lt;/a&gt;, Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming, and Tang Hongbo, will be the first three people to board China’s space station, Tianhe. They will stay on Tianhe for three months, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57504052"&gt;bringing the space station online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7cszn"&gt;The core module of Tianhe, which contains the &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/16/china-to-send-the-first-astronauts-to-its-self-developed-space-station.html"&gt;crew’s living quarters&lt;/a&gt;, was launched in &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/china-launches-core-module-tianhe-space-station"&gt;April 2021&lt;/a&gt;. This first crewed mission is part of &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/china-launching-shenzhou-12-astronauts-to-space-station"&gt;eleven planned missions&lt;/a&gt; during the space station’s construction phase — two more modules and several more cargo and crewed missions need to be completed before the space station is finished in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sg0IsG"&gt;China’s last crewed mission took place in 2016, sending astronauts to visit the country’s previous space station, Tiangong-2. That station &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701831/china-tiangong-2-deorbited-experimental-space-station"&gt;deorbited in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, China has continued to push forward with an ambitious space program. It sent a sample return mission to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178582/china-change-5-lunar-sample-return-mission"&gt;Moon and back again&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, and landed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436072/china-tianwen-1-mars-landing-zhurong-rover"&gt;a rover on Mars earlier this year.&lt;/a&gt; Long-term, the country is building partnerships with Russia, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536625/china-russia-nasa-joint-astronaut-moon-landing"&gt;in the next decade&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Is Facebook cornering the VR market?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m2Sg49cdnxvctpaiOy-Ts5mhjFI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69464578/akrales_200904_4160_0135.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="am38oB"&gt;Imagine that, over the past year, Facebook had managed to acquire the battle royale game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, the kid-focused game creation engine Roblox, and the best-selling game of 2020, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfxZU5"&gt;For many reasons, such a spree of acquisitions would never happen. One of the biggest is that antitrust scrutiny has made it increasingly difficult for Facebook to acquire anything that resembles a social network. It was more than a year ago that the company bought the moribund GIF search engine Giphy, which had few prospects for success as a standalone company; the United Kingdom’s competition watchdog &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/facebooks-acquisition-of-giphy-raises-concerns-for-uks-cma.html"&gt;has so far blocked the deal from closing&lt;/a&gt;, warning the acquisition would somehow harm Facebook’s competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MRrlsB"&gt;And yet if you look at the virtual reality landscape, Facebook has made a series of acquisitions that are roughly analogous to the fictional shopping spree I describe above, if on a much smaller scale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FRKr6T"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/population-one-facebook-bigbox-acquire/"&gt;Facebook bought BigBox VR&lt;/a&gt;, maker of the battle royale game &lt;em&gt;Population: One&lt;/em&gt;. The shooter has a structure and a “season”-based business model similar to that of Epic Games’ &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wHsmNl"&gt;The week before, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/facebook-buys-studio-behind-roblox-like-crayta-gaming-platform/"&gt;Facebook bought Unit 2 Games, maker of the Crayta platform&lt;/a&gt;. Crayta lets users make and share games in a fashion that mirrors &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, the fast-growing game platform that went public earlier this year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VwKv5n"&gt;In 2019 Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/26/facebook-buys-beat-saber-vr-game-maker-beat-games.html#:~:text=Facebook%20acquires%20the%20maker%20of%20popular%20'Beat%20Saber'%20VR%20game&amp;amp;text=Facebook%20on%20Tuesday%20announced%20its,of%20Prague%2C%20the%20company%20said."&gt;bought Beat Games, maker of the hit game &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt; was the most popular VR game on the Oculus platform by far when Facebook bought it, and it remains a bestseller today with more than 4 million copies sold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="HZ617i"&gt;The company’s other VR studio acquisitions include &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/facebook-buys-sanzaru-games/"&gt;Sanzaru Games&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/facebook-buys-ready-at-dawn-lone-echo/"&gt; Ready at Dawn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9dsuwe"&gt;Alex Heath, a reporter at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; who has closely covered the rise of AR and VR technologies, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexeheath/status/1403454403072253954"&gt;observed on Twitter recently&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook’s acquisitions in the space resembled its most famous bets on nascent technology from years ago: the purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp, which helped the company cement its position as the dominant player in social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nG1htf"&gt;“Facebook is going to probably have a near-monopoly in VR software before it even matters,” Heath tweeted. “Facebook will have literally reinvented itself for a new paradigm shift in computing by the time regulation gets around to addressing it in its current state.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Beat Saber" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zhWw9lRNkpwTrWCz3CIj1b7BPXM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13621124/30814989187_f608551022_k.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beat Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beat Saber.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6Hsjjz"&gt;Whether or not you think Congress should intervene to regulate tech acquisitions, it’s undeniable that the process moves slowly. Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014; a congressional antitrust inquiry didn’t begin until five years later; and a bill that would require heightened scrutiny of tech platform acquisitions was not introduced into Congress until… &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-other-tech-giants-could-be-forced-to-shed-assets-under-house-bill-11623423248"&gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt;. (OK, fine, the insurrectionist Sen. Josh Hawley introduced a bill to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/hawley-antitrust-bill-trust-busting-for-the-twenty-first-century-act/"&gt;ban all platform acquisitions, period&lt;/a&gt;, in April, but his bills are better thought of as Fox News op-eds than as serious efforts to regulate the industry.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjZn2F"&gt;I think the Federal Trade Commission should be more skeptical of tech giants acquiring their direct competitors, but I’m not sure a bill that defaults to banning acquisitions is the best approach. Acquisitions are part of the lifeblood of Silicon Valley, and the money that they return to investors gets re-invested in the next generation of entrepreneurs and technologies. You can encourage competition in lots of ways without banning M&amp;amp;A. And in any case, it’s hard to imagine a bill like this one garnering much support from Republicans, Hawley’s bill notwithstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5eAJWo"&gt;At the same time, let’s say you believe Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp set back the consumer internet for a few years — until TikTok emerged, anyway. Wouldn’t you want to apply as much scrutiny to Facebook’s current shopping spree as you’re applying to moves it made as long as nine years ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLEWIx"&gt;The answer to that question likely depends on how large you think the market for virtual reality headsets and its attendant software ecosystem will someday become. Currently the market is small — Facebook’s Oculus platform had &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/zuckerberg-quest-2-mainstream-vr-headset-facebook-q4-2020-earnings/"&gt;sold fewer than 10 million units as of January&lt;/a&gt;. The PlayStation 4, by contrast, has sold over 115 million units during its lifetime; Apple sold almost &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dwightsilverman/2021/02/22/apple-back-on-top-iphone-is-the-bestselling-smartphone-globally-in-q4-2020/?sh=5c6351854ca7"&gt;80 million iPhones&lt;/a&gt; in the last quarter of 2020 alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3IQtx"&gt;If you think VR will grow to roughly the size of a major console gaming platform, maybe you’re not concerned how many studios Facebook is buying. Console manufacturers buy game studios all the time — &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/21/welcoming-bethesda-to-the-xbox-family/"&gt;Microsoft’s acquisition of ZeniMax Media&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Bethesda Software and its many popular franchises, was last year’s mega-deal in the space — and no one seems to have too many concerns that any one console is developing a monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zTldis"&gt;If, on the other hand, you think Oculus could grow to a size more closely resembling a major desktop computer manufacturer, like Dell, perhaps you would eye its acquisitions with more scrutiny. To lay my cards on the table: I think it eventually will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NHFTwu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;VR might be Facebook’s fastest-growing business&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4HLrtz"&gt;Facebook still hasn’t released sales figures for the Quest 2 headset, and I’m told Playstation VR has sold more units overall. But we know that Quest 2 &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/zuckerberg-quest-2-mainstream-vr-headset-facebook-q4-2020-earnings/"&gt;drove a 156 percent year-over-year increase&lt;/a&gt; in Facebook’s non-advertising revenue in the last quarter of 2020. Even on a relatively small revenue base, that might make VR Facebook’s fastest-growing business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpS9zT"&gt;Everywhere you look, you find signs of Facebook’s growing confidence in its VR platform. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has given &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/features/mark-zuckerberg-on-facebook-vr-future-new-sensors-on-quest-pro-fitness-and-a-metaverse-for-work/"&gt;frequent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/16/21439741/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-connect-oculus-ar-vr-glasses-quest-apple-watch"&gt; interviews&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mark-zuckerberg-on-mind-reading-apple-and-the-race-to-mainstream-vr"&gt;subject&lt;/a&gt; over the past 12 months, among other things positioning AR and VR as an enterprise software platform as well as a place to play games. The company has hired more than 10,000 people to work in its Facebook Reality Labs hardware division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEtJ3v"&gt;In short, there’s more evidence that VR will be huge amid Facebook’s run of acquisitions today than there was evidence that Instagram was going to be huge when Facebook bought it in 2012, before the app had even 50 million users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6Brh5"&gt;None of that is to say that I think VR will overtake smartphones as the world’s biggest computing platform. And it’s also clear that Facebook has real competition as it tries to build out the mixed-reality future. Snap is also building impressive hardware and software in that space, focused on its Spectacles glasses and growing developer ecosystem around them. Apple, which is working on a headset of its own, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/apples-secretive-arvr-footprints-point-something-big-venkateshwaran/?articleId=6713113191871848448"&gt;has made at least four acquisitions&lt;/a&gt; of mixed-reality companies in recent years itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUoSME"&gt;It may also be that Epic Games makes &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; of VR, and Roblox makes its platform the Roblox of VR, and Facebook’s efforts in that space wither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPJpCa"&gt;Facebook told me its reasons for acquiring so many game studios are straightforward: it wants to accelerate the growth of a still-nascent industry by ensuring top-flight gaming experiences are widely available. It’s a very small player in the gaming industry, the company said, but hopes its acquisitions will be good for both developers and users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAYYAA"&gt;“That’s all true — but it doesn’t doesn’t mean it isn’t going to be an issue in six or eight years,” Heath told me over the phone Wednesday. From Heath’s perspective, the more consequential aspect of Facebook’s acquisitions is that it will tie up a significant amount of VR talent at one company for at least four years while their options from the acquisition vest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9LFgbZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the people that are good either already work at Facebook or they’re buying them”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PTGnhn"&gt;“There are not that many companies doing this,” Heath said of the VR industry, “And the people that are good either already work at Facebook or they’re buying them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBDP4B"&gt;None of this will much matter if the VR industry fails to live up to its most recent round of hype. And failing to live up to the hype is perhaps the signature feature of the VR industry for its entire lifespan so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22ReUu"&gt;But if VR becomes a part of our daily workflow as well our daily entertainment, and Facebook becomes the market leader in that space, we may be in for another global conversation about how a tech giant successfully used its market power to take over an adjacent industry. If that’s to be the case, it strikes me that the time to have that conversation is now — while the foundation is still being laid, one minor-seeming acquisition at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0ndWz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xuZx0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon pulls an Apple by reducing its app store cut for some smaller developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fc0uhGQjOijIrjNmqlpuvI_6owk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69464448/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cfgWL0"&gt;Amazon has decided it would really like to attract more developers to its Android and Fire OS app store, so it’s following in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;the footsteps of Apple&lt;/a&gt; (and Google) by announcing &lt;a href="https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/appstore/post/93e89be7-1611-4764-8f97-f4eef0a7c0e0/coming-soon-amazon-appstore-small-business-accelerator-program"&gt;a new “Amazon Appstore Small Business Accelerator Program”&lt;/a&gt; that takes less money out of developer’s pockets (&lt;a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-appstore-will-reduce-developer-revenue-cut-from-30-to-20-and-give-10-in-free-aws-credit/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;AFTVNews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UE3Jmj"&gt;But where Apple and Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;reduce their cut of a developer’s first $1 million in revenue from 30 percent down to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s formula has a slight tweak: it’ll take a higher 20 percent of revenue, but give developers an additional 10 percent in “AWS promotional credits.” The idea is that if your app is using Amazon’s popular AWS cloud services anyhow, it’ll be equivalent to you keeping 90 percent of the money. And if you happen to be using a &lt;em&gt;competitor’s&lt;/em&gt; cloud services, maybe Amazon will tempt you to become an AWS customer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VpDrj"&gt;Like Apple’s program, though, &lt;em&gt;it is a program —&lt;/em&gt; something you have to apply for, can get booted out of, and you automatically get kicked out and have to apply again the following year if your revenue ever exceeds $1 million. By contrast, Google is simply giving developers an extra 15 percent of their first $1 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rLYmYW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s biggest App Store critics are not impressed with its new fee cut for small developers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573109/epic-tim-sweeney-apple-app-store-fee-cut-reduction-criticize"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sxkyJw"&gt;Also, revenue isn’t everything: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525904/fanhouse-apple-tax-app-store-creator-fees"&gt;as Fanhouse argued when it railed against Apple last week&lt;/a&gt;, an app that’s designed to profit &lt;em&gt;creators&lt;/em&gt;, not its developer, might make far more than $1 million in revenue and not be able to afford 30 percent of the money that changes hands there. Fanhouse says it pays creators 90 percent of their earnings, and accused Apple of demanding 30 percent of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3A3dz"&gt;Apple is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;fighting a huge lawsuit against Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; that touches on whether its 30 percent cut is fair; part of Apple’s argument is that 30 percent has long been the norm. But critics say companies like Apple are taking far more for their services than a payment processor should. Moves like these from Apple, Google, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;and Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; suggest that there’s meaningful pressure across the industry to reconsider the 30 percent cut, if only to steer the conversation away from alternatives that might more drastically impact profits.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella now doubles as the company’s chairman</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FmMMBd"&gt;On February 4th, 2014, Microsoft found its new CEO in the cloud — Azure boss &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/4/5169852/satya-nadella-microsoft-ceo"&gt;Satya Nadella took the top job&lt;/a&gt;, Steve Ballmer retired, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/4/5377226/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-chairman-named-tech-advisor"&gt;Bill Gates stepped down as chairman&lt;/a&gt;. Now, after growing Microsoft to become &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18109784/microsoft-apple-market-cap-2018-valuable-company"&gt;one of the most valuable companies in the world&lt;/a&gt; yet again, Nadella &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/microsoft-board-of-directors-announces-role-changes-and-quarterly-dividend-301314220.html"&gt;has now been unanimously elected chairman&lt;/a&gt; of the Microsoft board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iq02Bs"&gt;It’s the first time in two decades that Microsoft’s chairman will also be its CEO, after Bill Gates originally stepped down as CEO in 2000 (Gates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179214/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-board-philanthropy"&gt;left the Microsoft board entirely&lt;/a&gt; in 2020), and it’s a testament to how much Nadella is now trusted to lead the company forward. When Gates stepped down as chairman in 2014, the board elected independent chairman John Thompson, who’d previously been CEO and chairman of Symantec and who’ll remain an independent director on the Microsoft board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8O2TUh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17324920/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-interview-windows-10-build-2018"&gt;We spoke to Nadella in 2018&lt;/a&gt; about how he was changing Microsoft, and how Windows wasn’t the future of the company, but rather cloud services. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/7/8568473/windows-10-last-version-of-windows"&gt;Windows 10 was imagined as a ongoing service, too&lt;/a&gt;, but PC sales &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065100/pc-market-shipments-idc-gartner-growth-2019-laptops-desktops-windows-7-10"&gt;turned around in 2020&lt;/a&gt; after Microsoft ended support for Windows 7, and started to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;see big growth in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. It sure seems like the company now believes in distinct versions again: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"&gt;Windows 11 is coming soon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on 4K TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rmtJvuBPnkpZu39fUo0GC39vOAg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151213/jbareham_170613_1754_0016_main_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;TCL 6-series Roku TV | Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vtXpJr"&gt;There are a lot of 4K TVs available to choose from, complete with a wide variety of prices and performance. And, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;Prime Day 2021&lt;/a&gt; in our midst, now might be the best time of the year (or, at least this summer) to get an amazing TV deal. Even if your budget is less than $500, you can get a good 4K TV in a bigger size than you might expect. Whether you want a secondary TV for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built for a cinema-like experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals across four common categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zUfn7z"&gt;Best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sFCZyo"&gt;Best budget 4K TVs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3C0Il4"&gt;Best OLED TVs &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jVQclk"&gt;Best 4K TVs for the PS5 and Xbox Series X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="d2lRkA"&gt;We will provide regular updates to this post so be sure to check back periodically for the most up-to-date info on the best deals available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="K5eooA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Prime Day deals","url":"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/22533316/prime-day-early-deals-tech-headphones-tvs-echo-dot-show-luna"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mszLRr"&gt;A 55-inch TV is a popular size for good reasons. It is not too big, nor is it too small, making it a safe size if you’re looking to upgrade the TV in a living room or bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3LwO3"&gt;Sony’s 55-inch X80J 4K TV has Google TV software built-in, so you won’t need to purchase any additional streaming boxes, like an Apple TV or Chromecast. The LED panel supports HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Vision HDR, and it has four HDMI ports (one of which is HDMI ARC). It’s a relatively low-frills affair, but it seems like a good deal at Best Buy, where you can get it for $700 with a My Best Buy account (normally $750).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gEtknI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10610217"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JbaBai"&gt;The TCL 6-Series R635 model is a good option if you are looking to balance price and performance. Like the Vizio above, the R635 has a QLED panel, but it goes a step above with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363318/tcl-2020-5-6-series-4k-tvs-qled-mini-led-backlighting-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x"&gt;Mini-LED backlighting&lt;/a&gt;, which brings better brightness and contrast. The 55-inch model is available for $810 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FTCL-55-6-Series-4K-UHD-Dolby-Vision-HDR-QLED-Roku-Smart-TV-55R635%2F796005169&amp;amp;subid1=BestTVDealsDeals04122021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, but no other retailers are currently offering competitive deals. You can also get it in 65- or 75-inch sizes if you want something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y8BpYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327662"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MPfLVC"&gt;Samsung’s Crystal TU-7000 series line of TVs offers many features, such as multiple screen mirroring. Currently, the TU-7000 is available in a wide variety of sizes, ranging from 43 all the way to 75 inches. Right now, the 55-inch model is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743619562269761088#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$450 at Best B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Crystal-TU-8000-Built/dp/B084JH43DJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;uy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9SocSo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444776"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zWYgij"&gt;You don’t have to spend a fortune for a 4K TV; spending $500 or less can still net you a TV with good image quality and features. Insignia’s 55-inch 4K HDR Fire TV Edition model is the perfect case in point, one that supports HDR10, HDMI ARC, and HDMI eArc, among other notable features. For a limited time, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $350&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jIOPJT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10605845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cW4VPC"&gt;Another Fire TV Edition TV deal happening now for Prime members is on Toshiba’s 50-inch Smart Fire TV Edition 4K LED, which normally retails for $380. As the name might imply, it allows you to stream content from services such as Disney Plus and Netflix, and includes the option to watch live TV. You currently can get a 50-inch model &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Toshiba-50LF621U21-50-inch-Vision/dp/B086VR2KY8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $310 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;; otherwise, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737687233984981481#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $350 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; or a step up to the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737687411898346509#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model for $50 more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x443tm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="74eOSC"&gt;TCL also has competitively priced televisions, and its 4-series lineup is one of the more affordable options on the market. The S435 model features a built-in Roku interface, dual-band Wi-Fi, HDR10, and support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri voice assistants. You can get the 43-inch model for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08DHDS4T3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$290 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HtnMEi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9740197"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vbJRlM"&gt;OLED televisions offer the best image quality in a mainstream TV. LG’s BX line supports HDMI 2.1, meaning this TV is perfect for people looking to take advantage of the PS5 or Xbox Series X. You can get it in either the 55- or 65-inch configuration and save up to $200, depending on the size. The popular &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED55BXPUA-Alexa-Built-Ultra/dp/B0829RXYSN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model is currently $1,297 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and basically the same price at other major retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OMVgrF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JvNG4d"&gt;Vizio’s 55-inch OLED is a Best Buy exclusive, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739879816744555003#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get it for $1,200&lt;/a&gt;. At this price, it’s one of the more affordable options if you’re looking for a 55-inch TV. Vizio doesn’t have the same kind of experience in the OLED playing field as LG, but it’s a great deal if you want a high-end viewing experience and HDMI 2.1 ports to display high frame rates from your PS5 or Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvRhzP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MB8PX4"&gt;Despite the high price tag, LG’s Gallery Series GX OLED is a good TV for those looking for a more cinematic experience. It includes support for Google Assistant and Alexa, and for those who want to use their TV for gaming, it features Nvidia G-Sync and HDMI 2.1 support, meaning it can take full advantage of the RTX 30-series cards or Sony’s and Microsoft’s next-gen gaming consoles. Right now, you can get the 55-inch for as low as &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLG-GX-55-inch-Class-with-Gallery-Design-4K-Smart-OLED-TV-w-AI-ThinQ-54-6-Diag-OLED55GXPUA%2F152371849%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_33DRwsUfoxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkESb%253AWnWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_1943169%26clickid%3D33DRwsUfoxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkESb%253AWnWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=BestTVDeals04142021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,597 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. There are also 65- and 70-inch models available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lpiA85"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10445785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xr7I2E"&gt;Sony’s PS5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X can play 4K games with HDR at up to 120 frames per second. So, naturally, if you don’t have a TV that takes full advantage of your console, it might be time to upgrade to one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. For the best experience, you’ll want a TV that supports HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Nkhmv"&gt;Deals on those picks are scarce right now, however, there’s one happening on LG’s CX series of TVs, which include support for Nvidia’s G-Sync and AMD’s FreeSync adaptive sync technologies, as well as a low 1ms response time. The big difference between the CX and the cheaper BX model mentioned above is the CX line can have slightly better brightness, which is better for HDR content. It comes in three sizes: 55, 65, and 77 inches. Right now, you can grab a 65-inch for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0817H41YN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as low as $1,897 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1555067-REG%2Flg_oled65cxpua_cxpua_65_class_hdr.html%23donotlink&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, or for $1,950 &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/lg-65%22-class---cx-series---4k-uhd-oled-tv---%24100-allstate-protection-plan-bundle-included.product.100657326.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt;. The latter deal requires a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://costcomembershipoffer.com/Purchase/Purchase/cj?qid=e6583bbeb3f911eb830f05100a1c0e10" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco membership&lt;/a&gt;, but it also nets you an Allstate Protection Plan — a three-year warranty for your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F5GsVe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9534696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Workhorse starts federal court fight over lost USPS contract</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6Kwes6X1tJrTPbdDGSnA8oAXz8=/0x427:2560x2134/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69463950/NGDVsideView_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: USPS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="34ukEI"&gt;EV startup Workhorse has filed an official protest after losing the bid to make the United States Postal Service’s next-generation mail vehicle in February, a contract that could ultimately be worth some $6 billion. The USPS instead gave that contract to defense contractor Oshkosh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtTrTQ"&gt;The Ohio-based company filed a bid protest in the US Court of Federal Claims on Wednesday. The complaint is currently sealed, though a judge could ultimately rule to make some parts of it public, as Workhorse also filed a redacted version of the complaint that could be made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vi07wJ"&gt;The bid protest kicks off a high-profile court fight over the contract for the next-generation mail truck, and could have an impact on how and when those vehicles switch over to electric power — something President Biden has said he wants across the federal fleet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92yMFj"&gt;“While we do not comment on active litigation, the United States Postal Service is looking forward to the start of vehicle production for our Next Generation Delivery Vehicle (NGDV),” Kim Frum, senior public relations representative for the USPS said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Preproduction design, tooling, and facility preparation activities are proceeding on schedule with the first NGDVs estimated to appear on carrier routes in 2023.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7svFeJ"&gt;“While bid protests are a normal part of the government contracting process, we do not comment on such proceedings,” Alexandra C. Hittle, Oshkosh Defense’s director of global marketing and communications, said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We are proud that the USPS selected Oshkosh Defense to fulfill the needs of the NGDV program and we look forward to getting these highly capable vehicles into the hands of mail carriers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilMKzY"&gt;Workhorse was one of three companies that submitted final bids to the USPS last year, and was the only one proposing to build an entirely electric mail fleet. The Postal Service and Oshkosh &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297823/usps-postal-service-mail-truck-electric-oshkosh-workhorse"&gt;revealed the new vehicle in February&lt;/a&gt;, and said that it is designed to run on both gas and electric drivetrains. The defense contractor has said the gas vehicles will be “fuel-efficient [and] low-emission” but has not qualified those claims. Oshkosh agreed to build between 50,000 to 165,000 of the trucks over 10 years, but the USPS says it needs billions more in funding from Congress in order to tip the balance of the fleet more towards electric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kA99l"&gt;In requesting that the complaint be sealed, Workhorse &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940.5.0.pdf"&gt;told the court&lt;/a&gt; that the document “contains confidential and proprietary source selection and proposal information” about its bid, and that future filings will or are likely to contain similar information about competitors’ bids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wlclLT"&gt;But of the options that were on Workhorse’s table, this one may prove the most effective at helping the company’s legal team understand why the USPS went with Oshkosh. “They will get to see everything, the whole file, how [the bids were] evaluated, the award memo,” a person familiar with the Postal Service’s contracting process told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;earlier this year. That process will likely take place under a protective order, though, so Workhorse’s lawyers may ultimately only be able to tell the company whether or not they have a good chance at winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANIrLe"&gt;Oshkosh has said it is still finalizing the design of the new vehicle, and that they won’t hit the road until 2023. The USPS agreed to invest $482 million up front to help ready the new vehicle. Oshkosh had worked with Ford during the bidding process, but the automaker has repeatedly declined to comment on whether it was involved in the defense contractor’s final pitch, which looks much different from spy shots of earlier prototypes based off the Transit van.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwazYi"&gt;The USPS set out to replace the current mail truck in 2015 with a plan to put the new vehicles on the road by 2018. It originally selected six companies (or teams of companies) to work up prototypes. But the bid process dragged on for years. A &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.com/2020/08/31/inspector-generals-report-details-new-mail-truck-program-problems/"&gt;2020 report&lt;/a&gt; from the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) detailed why: a lot of the prototypes were awful and broke down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3uBW6V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How the USPS mail trucks could still go fully electric","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22423179/usps-mail-trucks-electric-oshkosh"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ZgxkoO"&gt;Replacing the current mail trucks has only become more of a pressing issue, though. Built by defense contractor Grumman, many of the so-called Long Life Vehicles have blown past their life expectancies. That has left them either breaking down, which is costing the USPS a fortune, or in some cases catching on fire. Even the Long Life Vehicles that are able to stay on the road lack modern amenities like advanced safety features and even air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Mlr4d"&gt;Beyond the OIG report, there has been little insight into the USPS’s decision to go with Oshkosh. The bid process was incredibly opaque, to the point that Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) called it a “black box” in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjImk8"&gt;Workhorse itself has said very little since it lost the bid in February, but the USPS apparently still took issue with some of the company’s communications. In the request to seal the complaint filed Wednesday, Workhorse says the USPS believes the company breached its NDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epR5CE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hA0CRH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to find the best deals during Prime Day 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WUBuNWJBVBc2Tx1giH_XhGHijgk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67609533/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EkLaRj"&gt;Outside of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/cyber-monday"&gt;Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt;, Prime Day has become one of the biggest shopping events of the year. It’s a two-day stretch wherein Amazon Prime members will likely find some of the best prices yet on popular tech products like video games, gaming peripherals, laptops, 4K TVs, phones, PC accessories, and more. The COVID-19 pandemic pushed Prime Day 2020 from July to October, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;Prime Day 2021&lt;/a&gt; is back on a somewhat normal schedule, happening on Monday, June 21st, and Tuesday, June 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teS08W"&gt;If you’re shopping for Prime Day deals on Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21493780/amazon-prime-sign-up-day-deals-sale-price-free"&gt;you’ll need to sign up for Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt;, however, not all of the best Prime Day 2021 deals will live on Amazon. Many other retailers, including Walmart and Target, will also be running competing deals that we’ll tell you all about in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535681/amazon-prime-day-tech-news-deals-date-time-2021"&gt;our deals coverage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zfAZ5B"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Prime Day deals","url":"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/22533316/prime-day-early-deals-tech-headphones-tvs-echo-dot-show-luna"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pnndf2"&gt;You can count on us to publish only the best deals, but if you want to be among the first people to know about price drops on products you’re already interested in, you’ll want to get set up with a price-tracking site. We’ve included a few of our favorite examples below, pointing out how each can help you track deals in slightly different ways, with their own special features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlTdWR"&gt;All of them are free to use, and once you’ve added products that you’re interested in, you can rest easy knowing that you don’t need to take any action until it comes time to make a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t0LPoCM3D3T2dKA3LW70zOG7yBQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21943223/camel.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dhsh5E"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/"&gt;CamelCamelCamel&lt;/a&gt; is the best tracker for Amazon products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PWZiHK"&gt;CamelCamelCamel tracks the price of every product sold on Amazon and can send you alerts when they reach the price that’s right for you. Once a product reaches the desired price you’ve set, or lower, you’ll get an email about it. CamelCamelCamel &lt;em&gt;only &lt;/em&gt;works for products on Amazon, however, so you’ll need to use a different one below if you want to track price movement on Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Ipb7m"&gt;To track prices and get alerts via email, you’ll need to create a free account. Also, I suggest installing the &lt;a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/camelizer"&gt;site’s browser extension&lt;/a&gt;, called The Camelizer, which lets you see pricing trends on a product-by-product basis and allows you to set your desired price without navigating away from Amazon. It’s fantastic and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzRYbg"&gt;As soon as one of the products falls below the amount set on your price alert, you’ll instantly get an email. And if you already have a wishlist saved on Amazon, &lt;a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/wishlists/edit"&gt;you can import it&lt;/a&gt; into CamelCamelCamel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gvM1NZk6vUmj2H818mP3eqTQUxQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19348920/honey.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vxj695"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.joinhoney.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21502865%2Famazon-prime-day-best-deals-how-to-find" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Honey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dqWddk"&gt;Like CamelCamelCamel, the Honey browser extension can track the prices of items that you’re interested in, and it will alert you when it finds a deal. However, unlike the price-tracking site above, Honey will also scour each site you visit for offer codes that can be applied to your checkout total to save you even more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9wtzY"&gt;Honey works with Amazon and many other retailers, and you can add items to your “Droplist,” which is basically just a wishlist. On Best Buy, for example, the option to add an item to your list pops up on the product’s image, and you can select the price watch duration as well as the percentage off you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7eGFtm6xPqsgiWutu9lchE7EJzI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19348921/slickdeals.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ARTuv7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/deal-alerts/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pByL6H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals &lt;/em&gt;aggregates some of the best deals around the internet, as discovered by its team and community of users. The site also allows you to create deal alerts based on keywords, but they work a little differently on &lt;em&gt;Slickdeals &lt;/em&gt;than they do with the above sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvOBPA"&gt;You can type in a product name, like “Nintendo Switch” or a retailer’s name, and once it’s added to your list, you’ll be notified of a deal alert if it meets your criteria. You can set it to alert you to literally any deal relating to your keyword, or you can filter out deals so that you’ll be notified if, for example, the deal is popular enough to make it to &lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;’ front page or if it earned a high rating from the community. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOsUhFjytA9Q9b4Ha8yBF0F6XU4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19348917/pcpartpicker.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tjeV6O"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/"&gt;PC Part Picker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="m5XXbL"&gt;As you might have guessed by the name, PC Part Picker helps you pick PC components that are compatible with each other, making the already daunting task of piecing together a DIY PC setup a little easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmbwDP"&gt;That by itself makes it a crucial tool, but it’s also an excellent price tracker, showing you a detailed graph that illustrates the current and prior movement in price for a particular component. It lets you build the PC of your dreams, and it can &lt;a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/products/pricedrop/"&gt;alert you via email to price drops&lt;/a&gt; from big retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Newegg, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and more. That way, you can, say, choose to wait to buy everything until that processor or graphics card comes down to a lower price you know it has hit before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4wY7hy"&gt;Look outside of Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sqLCaU"&gt;Prime Day is an event that shows off Amazon’s huge retail presence, so naturally, other retail chains take notice. Because of this, you can sometimes find better deals at Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and Newegg, all of which have announced they’ll be offering a slew of deals during Prime Day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMUGIk"&gt;If Amazon’s sale doesn’t have everything you want or if you just want to make sure you’re getting the best deal, shop around a bit. Once again, you’ll be able to find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals"&gt;all of our deals coverage in and outside of Amazon here&lt;/a&gt;, including our roundup of the best anti-Prime Day deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QdCPHz"&gt;Trust the experts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="clOoYt"&gt;We’re a discerning bunch here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, so don’t fret if you’re going into Prime Day 2021 without any prep. We’ll be corralling the best deals on tech and keeping our coverage up to date with new Lightning sale items while eliminating old ones to avoid any disappointment. So mark Monday and Tuesday, June 21st and 22nd, on your calendar, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21493780/amazon-prime-sign-up-day-deals-sale-price-free"&gt;sign up for Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;bookmark our coverage&lt;/a&gt;, and maybe start putting aside a little spending cash.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cqjWjM"&gt;Amazon Prime Day, the retail giant’s two-day blitz of deals and promotions, officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;lands on June 21st&lt;/a&gt;. The annual shopping event is taking a place a few weeks earlier than it has in the past, yet despite still being a week away, Amazon has already kick-started the event with a slew of deals for Amazon Prime subscribers, discounting everything from the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Charcoal/dp/B07HZLHPKP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;last-gen Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; to the latest pair of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085WTYQ4X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt;. More deals are likely to go live in the days leading up to the main event, too, with retailers such as Walmart and Best Buy joining the shopping fray with deals of their own, many of which will rival Amazon’s offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfQOiJ"&gt;Below, we’ve rounded up the best early Prime Day deals. In most instances, all you need to do is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21493780/amazon-prime-sign-up-day-deals-sale-price-free"&gt;sign up for Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt; to take advantage of the deals, however, a few promotions come with some additional caveats that we’ll note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PzRclz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to sign up for Amazon Prime","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21493780/amazon-prime-sign-up-day-deals-sale-price-free"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Omrvrp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085WTYQ4X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds (second-gen) — $40 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="D7ZuXF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;second-gen Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; were appealing when they launched two months ago — and that was before they received a $40 discount. They also improve upon their predecessors in almost every way, offering up enjoyable sound, better comfort, and effective noise cancellation that helps you to drown out the world around you. They can’t compete with the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’re looking for an affordable pair of true wireless earbuds, or a way to bring Alexa with you on the go, the Echo Buds are it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPdJR0"&gt;Right now, you can snag the standard, second-gen &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085WTY1HQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Buds with a wired charging case&lt;/a&gt; in either black or white for $80. Amazon is also offering $40 off the version with the wireless charging case, bringing the price down to $100 for a limited time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jFw2gO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z1LChb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PMT4T11/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Halo — $30 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gXr8Hu"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;Amazon Halo&lt;/a&gt; is no Fitbit, but if you don’t mind a little invasiveness and can get around the fact it doesn’t have a dedicated screen, it’s a convenient way to track your sleep habits, chart your physical activity, and access a host of workout programs. While the woven, band-like device can track basic fitness metrics like your steps and heart rate, it can also measure your body fat percentage and the tone of your voice, a tool which will supposedly measure your emotional state throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yTy0WF"&gt;The Amazon Halo is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Halo-Fitness-And-Health-Band/dp/B07QKPCQKW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available&lt;/a&gt; in several sizes and color configurations for $70, the lowest price we’ve seen the band since its debut in August 2020. The fitness tracker also comes with a six-month membership, after which you’ll be required to pay $3.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vU2DAg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10269519"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="GGuXCh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":" The Verge’s Father’s Day Gift Guide 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22410178/fathers-day-best-gift-ideas-tech-gadgets-tools"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="lpBzPI"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Charcoal/dp/B07HZLHPKP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 (first-gen) — $35 off&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="V6vA7l"&gt;The recently updated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review"&gt;second-gen Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best smart displays you can get for the bedroom, however, it’s also not nearly as affordable as its last-gen counterpart. Thankfully, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; offers much of the same functionality in the same compact package. Like the newer model, it features a vibrant touchscreen and a host of voice-activated features, and while its 1-megapixel camera leaves a lot to be desired, it does come with a physical shutter if you’re someone who prefers privacy assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiR31X"&gt;Normally $80, the Echo Show is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Charcoal/dp/B07HZLHPKP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;priced at $45&lt;/a&gt; for Prime members, matching the lowest price we’ve seen yet on Amazon’s capable smart display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FFqJae"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CpLNme"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ftu/plans/prepaid_3month/"&gt;Amazon Kids Plus — $29 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xJpt6E"&gt;Amazon Kids Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436457/amazon-kids-rebranding-freetime"&gt;formerly FreeTime Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;, isn’t so much service for you as it is for your child. As the name implies, the subscription-based service grants your child access to a host of kid-friendly content on select devices, allowing them to discover a trove of educational apps, books, movies, and games. Much of the content is exclusive to the service, however, it also spans a multitude of age groups, meaning there’s likely age-appropriate content for your kid, regardless if you have a toddler or preteen. Like most kid-centric services, you can also limit screen time, filter content, and restrict web access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xI4rFY"&gt;In the lead-up to Prime Day, Amazon is offering Prime members a three-month subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ftu/plans/prepaid_3month/"&gt;Amazon Kids Plus for a $1&lt;/a&gt;, amounting to $29 in savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cgwgP5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10610382"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Vl6LGO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Dot (fourth-gen) — $50 off a pair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7fd6rg"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s latest entry-level smart speaker, is yet another refinement of what has become the most popular model in the Echo lineup. Despite its price and size, the Alex-equipped speaker still manages to tout impressive sound and a commendable set of mics, which allow you to play music, control your smart home gadgets, and carry out the full range of commands you might find on other, more capable Echo devices. It’s the entry-level smart speaker to get, even if the new design isn’t as convenient for mounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrCp0b"&gt;Now through Prime Day, the fourth-gen Echo Dot is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Dot-Blue/dp/B084J4MZK8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy one, get one free&lt;/a&gt; with offer code &lt;strong&gt;PDDOT2PK &lt;/strong&gt;(discount applies at checkout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KiqUna"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="Sw9BNE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to find the best deals during Prime Day 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21502865/amazon-prime-day-best-deals-how-to-find"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="BMm3YQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/music/unlimited"&gt;Amazon Music Unlimited — free four-month trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JpmtUX"&gt;If you haven’t tried Amazon Music Unlimited before, Amazon is offering Prime members a four-month free trial to the popular Spotify and Apple Music alternative. Its feature set is akin to most of its competitors, however, it also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440058/amazon-music-hd-price-cut-apple-lossless-audio"&gt;offers lossless audio&lt;/a&gt; at no extra cost, a perk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;Apple recently rolled&lt;/a&gt; out to Apple Music subscribers. With Amazon Music Unlimited, you’ll gain access to ad-free listening, podcasts, and a robust catalog of more than 70 million songs, not to mention the service’s deep integration with Amazon devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEAkAT"&gt;Just be sure to cancel your subscription before the trial ends if you no longer want to continue subscribing after the four-month window. Otherwise, you’ll automatically be charged an $8 monthly subscription fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="96zkrl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10607756"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LMENHd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo (fourth-gen) — $30 off a pair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2NBjU1"&gt;The Amazon Echo remains the namesake of the current Echo lineup. Although it shares much of its functionality with the aforementioned Echo Dot, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;fourth-gen Echo&lt;/a&gt; produces bigger, bolder sound and features a built-in smart home hub, meaning you can connect it with lightbulbs, door sensors, and a host of other popular Zigbee devices sans a secondary hub. It even has a temperature sensor, just in case you want to turn on your air conditioner or fan via Alexa routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4YrIb"&gt;Like the fourth-gen Echo Dot, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounting a pair&lt;/a&gt; of Echos ahead of Prime Day, knocking $30 off the price of two with offer code &lt;strong&gt;ECHOPRIME &lt;/strong&gt;(discount applies at checkout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="407A0B"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AqGaWV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P989QTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Luna Controller — $20 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9qTMwM"&gt;With Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532868/amazon-game-streaming-luna-access-no-invite-prime-day-members"&gt;opening up Luna access&lt;/a&gt; to all Prime subscribers on June 21st and 22nd, now might be your best opportunity to check out Amazon’s answer to Google Stadia and Microsoft's xCloud. Using a dedicated app or browser, the cloud gaming platform is available on pretty much any device you can throw at it — including Windows, Mac, FireTV, iOS, iPadOS, and select Android devices — and offers a way to stream titles like &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus &lt;/em&gt;without a dedicated console or gaming machine. Basic subscriptions run $5.99 a month, though, you can also pay $14.99 a month for the Ubisoft Plus beta channel, which grants you access to a range of Ubisoft titles, including &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b0KHof"&gt;We found the service to be hit or miss in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525339/amazon-luna-hands-on-cloud-gaming-streaming-early-access-price-games"&gt;initial review&lt;/a&gt;, but Amazon is currently offering a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P989QTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Luna Controller for $49&lt;/a&gt; as part of its early Prime Day deals, making the lack of titles far more palatable. You can also purchase a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B095ZMSY1N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bundle with a Fire TV Stick for $74&lt;/a&gt; or with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08KT9XY9Z/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;phone clip for $82&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to attach your phone directly to the Luna Controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8vEOXK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10606997"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pOhmCy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Insignia 55-inch 4K Fire TV Edition — $150 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BZzTsE"&gt;Insignia’s 55-inch 4K Fire TV Edition television certainly doesn’t offer the kind of picture afforded by today’s best OLEDs, but it’s hard to find a Fire TV Edition model that supports HDR10, a feature that allows for better brightness, color accuracy, and contrast. Insignia’s 4K TV also supports HDMI ARC and HDMI eARC, meaning you can utilize a single cable to send audio from a compatible soundbar or receiver to your TV, and features Amazon’s Fire TV software, allowing you to access Prime Video, Netflix, and a slew of popular streaming services without a standalone streaming device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZi8EO"&gt;As of this week, Insignia’s 4K Fire TV Edition model is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $350&lt;/a&gt;, a $150 discount and the lowest price we’ve seen yet on the 55-inch model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pj5QuH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10605845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gLz8Bs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/membership/premiumplus/prime?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Audible Premium Plus — $32 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MuUbyq"&gt;If you’re an audiobook fan, it’s hard to ignore Amazon’s audiobook service, Audible. Its catalog spans more than 200,000 ad-free titles, and it's peppered with exclusives and originals, some of which come in the form of podcasts and guided wellness programs. A monthly subscription to Audible Premium Plus provides you with one credit a month, which can be redeemed for any premium audiobook in Amazon’s catalog, regardless of the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mG7MNG"&gt;Audible Premium Plus subscriptions typically run $15 a month, however, now through Prime Day, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/membership/premiumplus/prime?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscribe for $7 a month&lt;/a&gt; for the first four months, after which the subscription rate will automatically revert to the standard rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue1uCc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10607843"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S4zlh4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 16th, 5:45PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt; Added Amazon Kids Plus to the roundup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Wwc6RJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Enw9zU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
