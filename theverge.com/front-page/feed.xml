    <title>The sound of neurons firing</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bRuvJEA4ZWvOUDog2xV2Jijz34w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69523490/CONTAINER_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aXIAdc"&gt;Looking through a microscope, doctoral candidate Simón(e) Sun takes a tiny glass pipette and gently attaches it to a neuron in a petri dish. She’s taking recordings of synaptic activity, the electrochemical signals neurons use to communicate with each other. The data Sun gathers will be used to understand microprocesses in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onvraj"&gt;It will also be turned into music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irlddi"&gt;Bridging science and art, Sun wrote a computer program that takes her data and &lt;a href="https://www.simonesun.com/music"&gt;converts it into song&lt;/a&gt;. And the ethereal MIDI sounds aren’t just nice to listen to — they can actually teach us a lot about how the brain works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkiZ3b"&gt;Sun is studying something called “&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5984303/"&gt;homeostatic plasticity&lt;/a&gt;,” which is how neurons regulate their activity. Her research has broad implications for the field of neuroscience. It might eventually help researchers better understand neuropsychiatric conditions like autism or help build better brain-computer interfaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhurn4"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;Science&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;video team joined Sun in the Tsien Lab at NYU Langone Health’s Neuroscience Institute to record some neurons and create an original song. Check out our latest video to see what we learned and experience the sounds of synapses. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Virgin Orbit launch its first commercial mission</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-AEROSPACE-VIRGIN-ORBIT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZQt0RbVPrzMMsL-YDCSbrUWCtRk=/0x0:4916x3277/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69523441/1230643749.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WZZHEp"&gt;Virgin Orbit is gearing up for its debut commercial mission from Southern California, five months after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22221212/virgin-orbit-rocket-test-launch-satellites-nasa-branson"&gt;first reached orbit during a January test flight&lt;/a&gt;. Seven satellites from three different countries are loaded onto a rocket that will blast off in midair from Virgin Orbit’s modified Boeing 747 less than an hour after the plane departs the Mojave Air and Space Port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFYdK3"&gt;Take off of the carrier aircraft, the modified Boeing plane named Cosmic Girl, is expected for 9:50AM ET. About an hour later, a 70-foot-long two-stage rocket called LauncherOne will ignite its single engine and take off from under the plane’s left wing over the Pacific ocean, zooming out of Earth’s atmosphere. The Netherlands’ first military satellite, three tiny satellites from a Defense Department test program, and the first two of 14 imaging satellites for SatRevolution’s constellation will soar toward orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rf9viz"&gt;This is the first mission Virgin Orbit decided to livestream publicly. You can watch the video stream &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgL5pMDktxA&amp;amp;ab_channel=VirginOrbit"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube. The company also plans to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VirginOrbit"&gt;tweet out updates&lt;/a&gt; during the mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7jEpP"&gt;Virgin Orbit calls the mission “Tubular Bells: Part One,” marking its third flight since May 2020 and the debut of its commercial satellite service. That first flight attempt &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/25/21265057/virgin-orbit-launcherone-rocket-test-launch-747-airplane-cosmic-girl"&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt; to reach orbit when an interrupted fuel line caused the rocket to shut down shortly after detaching from Cosmic Girl. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22221212/virgin-orbit-rocket-test-launch-satellites-nasa-branson"&gt;next attempt in January&lt;/a&gt;, carrying satellite payloads for the first time, was a success and capped Virgin Orbit’s test program. Wednesday’s Tubular Bells mission will be followed by at least one more mission this year, CEO Dan Hart told reporters on a Tuesday call (without providing a specific date for that mission). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AwZG2Z"&gt;The missions will precede a much busier launch schedule in 2022. “Now it’s a matter of just continuing to ramp up and moving rockets through integration,” Hart said, expecting six launches in 2022. He added Virgin Orbit signed “quite a few” launch deals after its January test flight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DAZN will stream UEFA Women’s Champions League free on YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Barcelona v Paris Saint-Germain - UEFA Women’s Champions League Semi Final: Leg Two" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hHx7j7BSA4c2Xh6Fbl-9Uuh5dbg=/0x0:4590x3060/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69523411/1232664409.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Urbanandsport/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nvyUiI"&gt;Sports streaming service DAZN announced today that it has acquired exclusive rights to stream the UEFA Women’s Champions League. As part of the deal, an overwhelming majority of the matches it streams over the next four seasons will be available for free on its YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oByNYZ"&gt;DAZN — best known in the US as a hub for boxing events — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21162594/dazn-international-expansion-200-countries-canelo-nfl-nhl"&gt;expanded to over 200 countries&lt;/a&gt; in December. It’s backed by billionaire Len Blavatnik who aspires to make DAZN the “Netflix of sport.” Former Disney exec Kevin Mayer &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/kevin-mayer-on-leaving-disney-and-tiktok-joining-dazn-pay-tv-decline.html"&gt;joined DAZN as chairman in March&lt;/a&gt; to help make that happen, after Mayer abruptly quit TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403698/tiktok-ceo-kevin-mayer-resigns-trump-administration-ban-microsoft-disney"&gt;due to Trump’s meddling&lt;/a&gt;. While at Disney, Mayer led the development of the wildly successful Disney Plus service and was widely believed to be Bob Iger’s successor, only to be overlooked when Iger stepped down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DKnAf5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first two seasons for free&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jW6BFl"&gt;In the deal announced Wednesday, DAZN says that it secured global streaming rights as well as broadcaster responsibilities through 2025. As part of its partnership with YouTube, DAZN said it will livestream the first two seasons for free on the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3MFxm"&gt;The agreement makes 61 matches viewable in real time on the DAZN YouTube channel. During the 2023-2025 season, 19 of the 61 matches will be streamable on Google’s video service, while all 61 will be available through DAZN itself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SpRR0a"&gt;“DAZN is thrilled to be the new global broadcaster for UEFA Women’s Champions League and cannot wait to work with YouTube and Google to bring fans closer to the game and shine a brighter light on its stars than ever before,” DAZN Group co-CEO James Rushton said in a statement. “Overnight, this will make the best women’s football easier to watch around the world than ever before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEAONO"&gt;The deal for exclusive global streaming rights does exclude several key markets, including the Middle East and North Africa as well as China. After a free trial period, the service normally costs $20 per month or $100 per year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s WH-1000XM3 are a great deal at $190</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sony WH-1000XM3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_QFRjkI3-Qwy846tlcGJf-_DEjc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69523337/jbareham_180823_2895_0075.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vdkYWH"&gt;There’s a fantastic discount happening on the previous generation Sony WH-1000XM3 wireless, noise-canceling headphones at Best Buy. Originally $350 (but usually around $250 or so these days), &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743780474724360893#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get them for $190 new&lt;/a&gt;. While these lack some niceties found in the newer XM4 model (concurrent Bluetooth connections, auto play / pause when you remove them or put them on), the package is overall similar in terms of nailing the fundamentals. These have great battery life, USB-C charging, among the best noise cancellation effect around, and sound quality that’s tough to beat at this price. In addition, these come with a zip-up case that makes them easy to stow. I bought these in 2018 and am still patting myself on the back for that decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="dLWHsU"&gt;Nintendo’s limited-edition Game &amp;amp; Watch handheld is $10 off at B&amp;amp;H Photo, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594162-REG%2Fnintendo_hxasraaaa_game_watch_super.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F30%2F22557070%2Fsony-wh1000xm3-headphones-nintendo-game-watch-jbl-charge-4-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing $40 instead of $50&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth picking up if you want easy access to classic games like the original &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Super Mario Bros. 2&lt;/em&gt;, and a Mario-themed version of &lt;em&gt;Ball&lt;/em&gt;. The handheld itself is more technologically impressive than original Game &amp;amp; Watch consoles, with a color LCD screen and USB-C charging.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tIxHDb"&gt;If you love both retro Neogeo games and modern fighting games, Neogeo’s Arcade Stick Pro seems like it was made just for you. Normally $150 on Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fneogeo-arcade-stick-pro-controller-pack%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_3_7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get it on Woot for $120&lt;/a&gt;. You can connect it to a TV via HDMI to play 20 built-in games, or simply use the device as a gamepad for any game that supports that kind of input. It works while connected to a Nintendo Switch, and it includes a USB adapter to work on PlayStation consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xxy7hB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10630903"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="dGdhbL"&gt;
&lt;p id="c1tJOY"&gt;Summer is here, and if you’re in need of a Bluetooth speaker that sports long battery life and a waterproof design for the beach or a poolside party, check out JBL’s Charge 4. It can last up to 20 hours on a charge (and can charge a device with its USB-C port), and it has IPX7 water and dust resistance. Originally $180, you can get the red-colored speaker for $110 at B&amp;amp;H Photo.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to block and report text spam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4L-IfKtQ76K7Il4nXctrhDAQtl4=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69520154/texting_lumia.0.1437583471.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xS9Cl4"&gt;Spam texts can be incredibly irritating — you get a notification and stop what you’re doing to check your phone, only to find somebody is trying to sell you something you don’t want. How can you prevent it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cz3VXk"&gt;Unfortunately, there are no absolutes in preventing text spam. But there are some ways you can at least minimize the number of spam texts that get through. Here are some strategies to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kZBYfb"&gt;Do not answer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6jYMm1"&gt;Top of the list is — as you probably already know — never reply to a spam text, and never &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; click on a link within a spam text. If you’re not sure whether a text is spam or legitimate, hold off on replying until you’ve done a bit of research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6qez8i"&gt;Use the spam filter on your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rIeftn"&gt;Android phones and iPhones have spam-filtering features that you can enable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NuvT8Q"&gt;If you have an Android phone:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aZycxQ"&gt;Open the Messages app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Aitn1H"&gt;Click on the three dots in the upper-right corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AcwIN3"&gt;Select “Settings” &amp;gt; “Spam protection”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Qw3pYw"&gt;Make sure “Enable spam protection” is toggled on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="LIp4DO"&gt;If you want to see what numbers you’ve marked as spam, you can go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Spam &amp;amp; blocked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To set up spam blocking, go to “Settings” &amp;amp;gt; “Spam protection.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FXwdP2ahVxd3OAOhvklYwpyG92s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688826/Screenshot_20210629_115526.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Spam protection.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle on “Enable spam protection.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N95yPCbJSuhETaseeQ-cGaSctgw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688921/Screenshot_20210629_115223.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle on “Enable spam protection.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Bhbi4Z"&gt;If you have an iPhone:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lVIqKL"&gt;Apple’s spam blocking is a little more basic than Android’s: it blocks phone numbers that you &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099"&gt;don’t have saved in your contacts list&lt;/a&gt; and haven’t been in contact with before, which could be an issue (say, if you’re expecting a call from a car service). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mT9Wfz"&gt;Open the Settings app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cON9RE"&gt;Scroll down to and select “Messages” &amp;gt; “Unknown &amp;amp; Spam”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9DWUaL"&gt;Toggle on “Filter Unknown Senders”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Scroll down to “Unknown &amp;amp;amp; Spam.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQ5MN3_pe8P_1cEcmcKEuXpe4ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688833/IMG_DE165A8C72D3_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scroll down to “Unknown &amp;amp; Spam.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle on “Filter Unknown Senders.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/54lBOdOA3HP0fjky5doQXJanBug=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688834/ios_spam_filter.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle on “Filter Unknown Senders.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OAOftX"&gt;Block specific texts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CPlAZi"&gt;When you get a spam text, you can block that individual number from contacting you again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CHYvJs"&gt;If you have an Android phone: &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="y9iZCr"&gt;When you tap on a message that Android tags as suspicious, the OS will often give you the opportunity to report it as spam (or verify that it’s not spam). But if you get a spam text that wasn’t flagged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YMRXxv"&gt;Tap the three dots in the upper-right corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gj3lEy"&gt;Select “Details” &amp;gt; “Block &amp;amp; report spam”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wNHf6y"&gt;You can just block that number if you want, or you can check “Report spam” to send the number to Google and possibly your carrier as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JC7myw"&gt;Note that this process can differ depending on which Android phone you’re using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9x3Rtt"&gt;Open the spam text and select the user icon on top of the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BjzvjY"&gt;Tap on the “info” icon and then on the “info” button&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H2JCJ1"&gt;If you want to report an iMessage that you received as spam, then look for the “Report Junk” link under the message, tap it, tap “Delete,” and then “Report Junk.” Note that this doesn’t automatically block that phone number; you’ll have to do that separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AEFlot"&gt;Forward the text to 7726&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F8kP0O"&gt;If you’re using one of the major carriers (Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, or T-Mobile), you can report a spam text by forwarding it to 7726. (Note that this spells “SPAM” on your phone keyboard.) This may also work with other carriers; to find out if it’s possible, check with your carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hHZUy1"&gt;This isn’t just a US thing, by the way. Ofcom, which regulates the UK’s communications services, &lt;a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/problems/tackling-nuisance-calls-and-messages/spam-texts"&gt;also accepts reports of spam texts&lt;/a&gt; forwarded to 7726.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rxUjrU"&gt;Block spam using your carrier’s services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4EbKlM"&gt;Most major carriers these days offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327304/spam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android"&gt;spam-blocking services for phone calls&lt;/a&gt;, and these can carry over to texts. Carrier sites will offer details about free and for-pay security services offered by &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/security/security-apps/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fplans-features%2Fblock-unwanted-calls&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22555521%2Fspam-text-block-security-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/call-filter/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;; if you use a different carrier, check its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AbbBTq"&gt;Use a third-party spam-blocking service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cz49nD"&gt;If you’re really frustrated and the above strategies aren’t working for you, you can try using a third-party anti-spam service. These are not free. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.robokiller.com/"&gt;RoboKiller&lt;/a&gt; costs $4.99 a month or $39.99 a year after a seven-day trial, while &lt;a href="https://nomorobo.com/"&gt;Nomorobo&lt;/a&gt; costs $1.99 per month per device after a 14-day trial. If you do decide you need a third-party service, you can use the trial to see if it works for you before committing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s Mini LED TVs to release in the US starting in July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kqTZTekFcsJkJVlsFbhVgsF5iRM=/0x108:1863x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69522668/LG_8K_QNED_Mini_LED_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s Mini LED use an array of thousands of tiny LEDs as a backlight.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="98Wumc"&gt;LG’s new range of Mini LED TVs, which it’s branding “QNED,” are releasing worldwide starting next month, the &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/06/now-rolling-out-worldwide-lg-qned-mini-led-tv-sets-new-standard-for-lcd-picture-quality/"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The lineup consists of three sets, the 8K QNED99 and QNED95, and the 4K QNED90, ranging in size from 65- to 86-inches. LG says the TVs will launch first in North America, with additional regions following “in the weeks ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyb1U3"&gt;Mini LED is a relatively new kind of display technology which uses an array of thousands of tiny LEDs as a screen’s backlight. Because there are so many (up to 30,000 in the case of the 86-inch QNED99), they can create a sharper contrast between light and dark areas of an image. LG says the technology, which has previously been used on some TVs from TCL as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;Apple’s latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, allows for “10 times better contrast ratio” than normal LCD TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DvSRJb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not to be confused with MicroLED&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FFUqy9"&gt;LG is marketing Mini LED as a “giant leap forward in LCD TV picture quality,” but it’s not quite at the level of an OLED TV, where its the individual pixels themselves that are illuminating to create an image (with Mini LED, the LEDs are still shining through an LCD layer). Mini LED should not be confused with Samsung’s outrageously expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18168793/samsungs-75-inch-microled-4k-tv-pitcure-quality-ces-2019"&gt;MicroLED&lt;/a&gt; technology, which also uses an array of tiny LEDs but without the need for an LCD layer at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpaZpo"&gt;We’ve reached out to LG to clarify pricing for its full lineup of QNED TVs (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fqned-mini-led-tv&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F30%2F22556962%2Flg-mini-led-qned-tvs-release-date-usa-july" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s US site&lt;/a&gt; still lists them as “coming soon”) but based on a previous report &lt;a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1612506923"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;FlatPanelsHD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; they’re unlikely to come cheap. The 8K QNED99 will reportedly start at $5,000 for the 75-inch model, rising to $8,000 for the 86-inch version, while the 4K QNED90 will reportedly cost up to $4,000 for the 86-inch model. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple isn’t backing down from its hybrid work model, according to internal note</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jc9msMcOm5mdjtNGvste1f9dXpM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521850/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UfXTiO"&gt;Apple isn’t backing down from its hybrid work model that will require most employees to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Fully remote positions will be extremely limited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fST2ny"&gt;“We believe that in-person collaboration is essential to our culture and our future,” said Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of retail and people, in a video recording viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If we take a moment to reflect on our unbelievable product launches this past year, the products and the launch execution were built upon the base of years of work that we did when we were all together in-person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiBoeB"&gt;The news comes nearly a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook sent out an email&lt;/a&gt; telling employees the company was rolling out a new work model that would require them to return to in-office work on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays starting in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLC88B"&gt;In the wake of that announcement, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;Apple employees wrote a letter&lt;/a&gt; saying some employees had been forced to quit because of the policy, and asking Cook to change his stance. They asked that all teams be given the option to work remotely, noting “without the inclusivity that flexibility brings, many of us feel we have to choose between either a combination of our families, our well-being, and being empowered to do our best work, or being a part of Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agQ9e0"&gt;Now, Apple is essentially denying that request, saying any remote work decisions will be made “on a case-by-case basis with any new remote positions requiring executive approval.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iiEsmz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom acquires an AI company building real-time translation</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KwQpF0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-to-acquire-kites-gmbh/"&gt;Zoom has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s acquiring a company known as Kites (short for Karlsruhe Information Technology Solutions), which has worked on creating real-time translation and transcription software. Zoom says the acquisition is a move to help it make communicating with people who speak different languages easier, and that it’s looking to add translation capabilities to its video conferencing app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCEVrd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kites.ai/"&gt;According to its site&lt;/a&gt;, Kites began at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and its technology was originally developed to &lt;a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2020-10-ai-outperforms-humans-speech-recognition.html"&gt;act as in-classroom translation&lt;/a&gt; for students who needed help understanding the English or German their professors were lecturing in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1LvAY"&gt;Zoom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300740/zoom-live-transcription-closed-captions-accessibility-free-accounts"&gt;already has real-time transcriptions&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s limited to people who are talking in English. &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207279736-Closed-captioning-and-live-transcription"&gt;On a support page&lt;/a&gt;, Zoom also makes it clear that its current live transcription feature may not meet certain accuracy requirements. The company says it’s considering opening a research center in Germany, where the Kites team will be staying.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku launches its new originals with a Demi Lovato talk show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hVveFmLJbF_BmIAo2D6MtrT-EPY=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521611/image002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Demi Lovato Show will debut July 30th.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HZ7nt2"&gt;The first of a dozen-plus Roku Originals to premiere on the Roku Channel will kick off July 30th with &lt;em&gt;The Demi Lovato Show&lt;/em&gt;, a series that had originally been slated for a debut on Quibi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqCtrC"&gt;The show will now launch as Roku’s first “original” to land on the Roku Channel, the platform’s free and ad-supported streaming offering. While originally intended for Quibi, the show will be brand new to audiences when it arrives on the Roku Channel this week. Each episode will be 10 minutes long, feature a celebrity guest, and will cover topics as wide-ranging as UFOs, activism, mental health, gender identity, and police reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3Bmr3"&gt;In a statement, Lovato said that they have “never been one to shy away from speaking candidly about things.” The show had previously been announced as &lt;em&gt;Pillow Talk with Demi Lovato&lt;/em&gt; on Quibi, though it never aired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkXKmg"&gt;Roku swiped much of Quibi’s library after the service finally folded and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/roku-wisely-rebrands-its-soon-to-debut-quibi-content-as-1846733852"&gt;announced in April&lt;/a&gt; that it would rebrand the haul as Roku Originals. The company further said at the time that some 75 titles would stream on the Roku Channel as free and ad-supported content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t98EJA"&gt;A spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that while some of these earlier released shows technically &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/06/roku-originals-quibi-streaming-one-billion-1234777771/"&gt;made their way&lt;/a&gt; to the Roku Channel in May, others have not been previously released, including this one. That makes &lt;em&gt;The Demi Lovato Show&lt;/em&gt; the first Roku Original debuting on The Roku Channel to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpSAq4"&gt;It’s almost as if Quibi never truly left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSOmb1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this article used pronouns other than Lovato’s preferred “they/them.” We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp’s Spanish language content moderators push for equal pay in internal letter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YKBqYiWvTj3CCD1y2yehE18-pks=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521541/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Skp3S8"&gt;WhatsApp’s Spanish language content moderators and customer service representatives are pushing the company for equal pay, according to an internal letter obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. They say they’ve been excluded from a $2 per hour premium paid to other bilingual contractors. The workers are employed by Accenture, a third-party contracting firm, in Austin, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzDFhj"&gt;“For several years now, Accenture, Facebook, and Whatsapp have denied equal treatment and pay to Spanish language Contingent Workers,” employees say in the letter. “It is an insult for companies like Facebook and Accenture to publicly champion diversity, but yet fail to deliver this to its own workers.” Accenture classifies much of its workforce as contingent, meaning employees are hired as contractors for a specific period of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypL2YK"&gt;Workers are demanding that Spanish language contractors receive the $2 premium, as well as backpay for the money they missed out on since they were hired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sOKoUv"&gt;One worker says they were told they’d need to learn Arabic or Portuguese in order to receive the premium. “I’m already bilingual,” the employee says they responded, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Still, the policy didn’t change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFxCgS"&gt;The letter was sent to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, WhatsApp CEO Will Cathcart, and Accenture CEO Julie Sweet. It was posted today on Workplace, Facebook’s internal communications platform. It currently has 89 signatures from Facebook, WhatsApp, and Accenture employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zv6SWe"&gt;The letter came after workers pushed for years to have equal pay, according to the internal letter. “Managers and HR reps for Accenture in Austin, Texas have not only ignored the complaints of discrimination for several years now, but they also actively engaged in ensuring this gross injustice go unacknowledged and unaddressed,” the note says. “We say this blatant act of racism and discrimination towards its own essential workers needs to end now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KA4V1z"&gt;Facebook content moderators at Accenture’s Austin office &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497789/facebook-content-moderators-accenture-return-office-coronavirus"&gt;were asked to come back to the office during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. Many said they feared for their safety and felt the company hadn’t adequately addressed their concerns. These employees are often among the lowest paid Facebook workers, and make roughly $18.50 an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFSCiv"&gt;Accenture’s Spanish speaking customer service reps say they make as little as $16.50 an hour. “Accenture is the Walmart of the tech industry,” an employee tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Most of us have to have two jobs to survive. We get paid $16.50 an hour. That’s not a livable wage in Austin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSsf8P"&gt;Facebook and Accenture did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
