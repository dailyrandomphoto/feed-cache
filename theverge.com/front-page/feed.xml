    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J3GL6Y"&gt;If you want to save up to $100 on Sonos products, now is the time. Starting Sunday, September 12th, Sonos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667044/sonos-speaker-price-increases-announce-september-12"&gt;will be increasing&lt;/a&gt; its prices from $10 to $100, depending on the product, meaning today is the last day you will be able to pick up one of the company’s many smart speakers at their current price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNboTu"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfywbqrMnbJ#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Arc&lt;/a&gt; will jump the highest in price, going from $799 to $899. You can also expect to pay $50 more for the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfywdzRyiRp#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Five&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfyweNMGe96#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Sub&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfywg0TufHi#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Amp&lt;/a&gt;. The Five will go for $549 instead of $499, while the $699 Sonos Sub will sell for $749 and the $649 Sonos Amp will retail at $699. Sonos will also increase the prices of the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfyv7HQialG#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfywic78Zmx#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;One SL&lt;/a&gt; by $20, and the company will tack on an additional $10 to the portable &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfywjGCiJEC#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Roam&lt;/a&gt;, offering it for $179 instead of $169.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rlk9wJ"&gt;The table below breaks down the forthcoming price hikes in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="825u4a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10745576"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="dcaaJs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10523576"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="MSHA39"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10672350"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ki6K4s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10634629"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zfpJq6"&gt;If you want a laptop that’s similar in quality to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;, HP’s new Pavilion Aero 13 is a solid option, even when it’s not on sale. Today, however, with HP’s extended Labor Day promotion going on, it’s a must-buy. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDailyDealsRoundUp091021&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-pavilion-aero-13z-be000-laptop-pc-2r1x0av-1%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP is selling the Pavilion Aero 13&lt;/a&gt; with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800U, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $703 with promo code &lt;strong&gt;HP21LDS5&lt;/strong&gt;, nearly $50 off the configuration’s typical list price. Note that you’ll need to customize the laptop to have the specs above before you add it to cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwenYO"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22632318/hp-pavilion-aero-13-2021-amd-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; — which was based on a similar configuration — we dubbed the high-quality budget laptop “the first premium Pavilion,” namely because it comes with features typically found in more premium Windows devices, such as 10-hour battery life. In fact, its 16:10 screen is brighter than the one found on the more expensive Spectre model. It’s also incredibly lightweight, and comes with a powerful eight-core processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X3aO9c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730332"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vt3ev2"&gt;Right now at Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VW98ZKG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can save $150&lt;/a&gt; on our pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users, the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless. Comfortable and stylish, we found the headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound. They provide 17 hours of playback time per charge, too, as well as convenient features like ambient passthrough and a customizable EQ. Given these perks, they’re an excellent choice for those who don’t want to fork out twice as much for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Silver/dp/B08PZD76NP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s luxe AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;, our top pick for best noise-canceling headphones when it comes to sound quality. Normally $400, Amazon’s current discount brings them down to $250, an all-time low. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dKr7FP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G9AiKJ"&gt;Whether you’re working in the office or at home, a good monitor can make a world of difference. Thankfully, Samsung’s M7 Smart Monitor is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-43-Inch-Class-Monitor-LS43AM702UNXZA/dp/B096MY3BN8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale for a limited time&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon for $530 instead of $600, its best price to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzsIm1"&gt;Described as a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/15/21562738/samsung-smart-monitor-m5-m7-tizen-smart-tv-airplay-2-usb-c-release-date-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TV for your PC&lt;/a&gt;,” the M7 Smart Monitor can stream HDR10 content via your Wi-Fi network from apps such as Netflix and Hulu, without needing external devices. The 43-inch monitor also features a healthy range of ports and support for AirPlay 2, as well as a voice-enabled remote control that works with Google Assistant and Alexa; you can even mount the display to your wall or a monitor arm via Vesa mounts, if desired. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="nNhAFb"&gt;Now that Amazon has introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662985/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-announced-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/a&gt;, retailers are starting to slash the price of older streaming devices to some of this year’s best prices. Right now, for instance, you can pick up the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079QHML21/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfybDjfQNAO#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $35 instead of $50, the lowest price we’ve seen on the capable streamer outside of Amazon Prime Day. The older, 4K-ready device comes with an Alexa voice remote, as well as support for Dolby Vision, HDR10, and Dolby Atmos. It doesn’t, however, feature Wi-Fi 6 support like the newer Max model. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorcycle vibrations can degrade iPhone camera performance, Apple says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fcXBzDn9Z-qcK5MgoivX8atXJq4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69844108/akrales_201018_4238_0293.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple says its iPhone cameras may be damaged by motorcycle vibrations | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hTpRpF"&gt;A new post on &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212803"&gt;Apple’s Support forum&lt;/a&gt; says exposing iPhones to high-amplitude vibrations, “specifically those generated by high-power motorcycle engines” could degrade the devices’ camera system. The company recommends against mounting an iPhone on a motorcycle, as the vibrations may be transmitted via the bike’s handlebars and chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sRwLO"&gt;Here’s the technical explanation from Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QRkuKC"&gt;If you accidentally move a camera when you take a picture, the resulting image can be blurry. To prevent this, some iPhone models have optical image stabilization (OIS).1 OIS lets you take sharp photos even if you accidentally move the camera. With OIS, a gyroscope senses that the camera moved. To reduce image motion, and the resulting blur, the lens moves according to the angle of the gyroscope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Blnfge"&gt;Additionally, some iPhone models have closed-loop autofocus (AF).2 Closed-loop AF resists the effects of gravity and vibration to preserve sharp focus in stills, videos, and panoramas. With closed-loop AF, on-board magnetic sensors measure gravity and vibration effects and determine the lens position so that the compensating motion can be set accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLszE5"&gt;The OIS and closed-loop AF systems in iPhone are designed for durability. However, as is the case with many consumer electronics that include systems like OIS, long-term direct exposure to high-amplitude vibrations within certain frequency ranges may degrade the performance of these systems and lead to reduced image quality for photos and videos. It is recommended to avoid exposing your iPhone to extended high-amplitude vibrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="CP5Qud"&gt;The iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and all iPhones since the iPhone 7 have both optical image stabilization and closed-loop autofocus (as noted by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/iphone-camera-vibration-damage-motorcyles/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the first outlet to spot the Apple support post). Both features are also vulnerable to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208747"&gt;magnetic interference from some iPhone accessories&lt;/a&gt;, Apple warned earlier this year, but removing the accessories should take care of that issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uftGp"&gt;Additionally in the new post, Apple says if you’re planning to mount your iPhone to a scooter or a moped, it recommends using a vibration-dampening mount to lessen the risk to the phone and its camera system. And avoiding prolonged regular use of an iPhone mounted to a vehicle that produces lower-amplitude vibrations is also a good idea. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Epic both lost today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r152KsnxYCdWHHQJuuXmgDp2L4U=/169x0:1789x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69842855/apple_fortnite_1984_parody.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Apple stands to lose billions; Epic failed to #FreeFortnite&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1FqWtG"&gt;It was May 11th, the seventh day of the Epic v. Apple trial, that Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;hit upon a compromise&lt;/a&gt; neither company had asked for. She asked Epic’s economist, David Evans, if it would be sufficient to kill Apple’s anti-steering rules — the ones Apple uses to keep developers from &lt;em&gt;even telling you&lt;/em&gt; that there’s a perfectly good external website where you can purchase your subscription instead of inside the app itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLxfFU"&gt;On May 24th, the final day of the trial, Judge Rogers hinted she was still leaning toward that exact sort of compromise, one that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-25/epic-apple-judge-signals-her-ruling-won-t-make-either-side-happy?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;might not please either side&lt;/a&gt;, one that might involve Apple’s anti-steering rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SA3Xn7"&gt;That’s what happened today. Both sides lost. But Epic arguably lost more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Epxqqc"&gt;In a win for developers — but not Epic — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;Rogers ruled for a permanent nationwide injunction&lt;/a&gt; blocking Apple &lt;em&gt;not only&lt;/em&gt; from keeping iPhone users in the dark about alternate ways they can pay, but potentially allowing developers to actually stick their own purchase mechanisms into their own apps. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"&gt;It heavily depends on how the courts define a “button,”&lt;/a&gt; so stay tuned for a lot of friction and experimentation around that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FW3CDv"&gt;It’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a win for Epic for two reasons: First, because the judge explicitly decided that Epic’s injection of its own direct payment scheme into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on iOS — a move designed to provoke this entire lawsuit — was not okay. Epic breached its contract with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JXm2BZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic didn’t free Fortnite even a little bit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qrW493"&gt;Second, because even if Epic &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; want to now insert, say, a PayPal button into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, it can’t: Apple terminated Epic’s developer account when the company breached its contract, and Judge Rogers confirmed that Apple is completely within its rights to keep Epic off the App Store for good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kE366n"&gt;“Apple has the contractual right to terminate its DPLA with any or all of Epic Games’ wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games’ control at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion,” ruled Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20O647"&gt;Epic also directly lost some $3.6 million, which it has to pay Apple. That’s because Epic made roughly $12.2 million in revenue with the direct payment mechanism it injected into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; against Apple’s rules, and Rogers decided that Apple deserves its 30 percent cut of that money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TknsXL"&gt;Indirectly, you could argue that Epic also lost &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22412899/epic-apple-trial-rules-investment-app-payment"&gt;its considerable investment&lt;/a&gt; in making this lawsuit a success — not only legal fees, which it won’t recoup, but potentially hundreds of millions of dollars from people who would have been playing &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on iOS if not for its removal from the App Store. In its first two years, the game made $614 million on iOS alone, according to Epic’s records — $52.7 million of that in Q4 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8cfay"&gt;After &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;was removed from the App Store, it’s possible people who’d already installed the game kept on making purchases, but it’s unlikely they did it at scale: &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;players on Apple hardware lost cross-play, access to new events and new things to buy in August 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402547/fortnite-epic-games-apple-ios-macos-two-different-games"&gt;when the game effectively split in two&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjvWco"&gt;And all Epic has to show for that money is… well, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1436444335751393283"&gt;the biggest change in App Store history&lt;/a&gt;, as Mark Gurman points out. (Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"&gt;our just-published history of the App Store’s major policy changes&lt;/a&gt;, so you can see for yourself.) It’s just that, as of right now, Epic can’t take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuTgGp"&gt;But those millions or even hundreds of millions pale in comparison to the billions Apple stands to lose if that App Store change is thoroughly adopted and legally enforced. Apple makes roughly $19 billion a year from apps, $6.3 billion of that in the US where the ruling has legal weight, and it wouldn’t take more than the loss of a few whales for Apple to notice a dent in that revenue, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business"&gt;my colleague Chaim Gartenberg argues&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BDD4YN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Epic v. Apple ruling could put a serious dent in Apple’s $19 billion App Store business","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business"},{"title":"The Apple App Store: a brief history of major policy changes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"},{"title":"The future of the App Store depends on the difference between a ‘button’ and an ‘external link’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"},{"title":"Sweetheart deals and plastic knives: all the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VSQAKp"&gt;Epic isn’t even bothering to spin today’s ruling as a win, and I think that makes some sense: publicly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368065/epic-fortnite-players-apple-block-updates-next-season-warning"&gt;its goal was to #FreeFortnite&lt;/a&gt;, and it completely failed at that. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on iOS is still under Apple’s lock and key. So instead of changing its tune, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667208/epic-games-appeal-apple-judge-rogers-ruling-court"&gt;Epic will simply appeal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gD6W0e"&gt;Apple, however, is calling the decision a “resounding victory.” That also makes sense seeing how it downgraded Epic’s original request for the courts to call Apple an illegal monopoly under the Sherman Antitrust Act all the way to a single injunction under the California Unfair Competition Law. The courts aren’t forcing Apple to allow alternative app stores, or sideloading, or to change its 30 percent fee in any way at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFaZWh"&gt;But a true victory wouldn’t have left Apple watching billions of dollars in revenue potentially slip out the door, or losing any control at all (or, for that matter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;seeing Apple’s true nature as a cutthroat business entity&lt;/a&gt; exposed to the world). Apple prefers to make far smaller concessions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;like when it volunteered to Japanese regulators&lt;/a&gt; that it could allow a specific category of “reader” apps to bypass its store for payments — even though Apple has the first and last word about whether an app qualifies to be a “reader” app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Wx3M9h"&gt;I think Jason Schreier &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1436372920285204481"&gt;has it exactly right&lt;/a&gt;: with millions and billions of dollars out the door respectively, both companies lost this fight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WUb6bX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So Epic lost on just about every count &amp;amp; will have to pay millions, while Apple now has to let apps use external payment processors, potentially costing them billions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Big win for everyone who was rooting for both companies to lose &lt;a href="https://t.co/7V2o9PoSRz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7V2o9PoSRz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1436372920285204481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Go read this report about the horrifying leaks coming from school ransomware attacks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e98R_VvCHnpnWsUMDPG3od1mgAE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69842752/acastro__171016_1777_0001_v6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrator by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jqq9tB"&gt;Ransomware has been a hot-button topic in 2021 due to its impact on critical &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632378/pandemic-ransomware-health-risks"&gt;hospitals&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616882/gigabyte-technologies-ransomware-attack-data-leak-112-gb-ransomexx"&gt;computer manufacturers&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hackers-are-leaking-childrens-data-s-little-parents-can-rcna1926"&gt;a recent report from &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;may be one of the more heartbreaking accounts of the effects hackers can have: it details how data leaks from attacks on schools can put student’s most sensitive information out onto the internet, available to anyone who knows how to find it and is willing to pay. It’s a story that’s well worth a read for all the details it goes into and edge cases it explores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEGjoh"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;NBC&lt;/em&gt;’s report, one school district had an Excel sheet called “Basic student information” posted to the dark web after it refused to pay a ransom, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kevincollier/status/1436306731961921536?s=20"&gt;according to the FBI’s instructions&lt;/a&gt;. The article’s author, Kevin Collier, breaks down the shocking information it contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AbZAWW"&gt;It lists students by name and includes entries for their date of birth, race, Social Security number and gender, as well as whether they’re an immigrant, homeless, marked as economically disadvantaged and if they’ve been flagged as potentially dyslexic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eZSNjS"&gt;The school knew about the attack and informed parents about it — making it potentially one of the better scenarios. Insurance covered identity theft protection for staff, but it’s unclear whether that benefit extends to students even after getting lawyers involved. In other cases, when &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; asked some schools about their leaks, they seemed “unaware of the problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FOC8zm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Credit and identity theft is one of the obvious problems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="feImav"&gt;It’s hard even to comprehend how it could affect a student’s social life if their grades, medical info, or free or reduced-price lunch benefit status leaked online. What’s easier to understand is the impact of having their SSNs, birthdays, and names sold to unscrupulous people: &lt;em&gt;NBC&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of a student whose info was used in attempts to get a credit card and car loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qxht0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22421193/credit-reporting-infrastructure-errors-experian-equifax-transunion"&gt;I know firsthand&lt;/a&gt; the hell that can come from having your credit wrecked before you even get out of high school, and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. The report cites Eva Velasquez from the Identity Theft Resource Center, who tells parents to freeze their kid’s credit to keep them safe from identity theft. Parents already have enough concerns — dealing with kids who are learning remotely or figuring out how to get kids physically to school, all the while worrying that they could catch COVID while they’re there. It’s hard to accept that parents should also become the data security and privacy experts that school systems are missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RsVTnI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Protecting kids’ data could be easier said than done&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T8XZVg"&gt;As an expert at a non-profit for protecting school’s IT systems told &lt;em&gt;NBC&lt;/em&gt;, “it is a solemn responsibility that schools have to care for kids, so they collect a lot of data with that.” Clearly, many schools (the report mentions that 1,200 schools’ info had been published by ransomware attackers this year) aren’t up to the task of keeping that data safe — though doing so is easier said than done, especially while working with budgets that don’t allow for the level of corporate security attackers are bypassing daily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjyfJz"&gt;It’s incredibly sad to imagine students having to simultaneously worry about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22170292/gizmodo-schools-fbi-grade-phone-hacking-surveillance-tech"&gt;their school using FBI-grade tech to steal personal data&lt;/a&gt; and hackers stealing information for their school and selling it to criminals. While it may be hard to think about, it's even more difficult to push for change if we don’t know what’s happening, which makes &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hackers-are-leaking-childrens-data-s-little-parents-can-rcna1926"&gt;reports like &lt;em&gt;NBC&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt; so essential and worth the read.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google faces whistleblower complaint that it underpaid temp workers by as much as $100 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4KgUhiS5QIjFHBCOC_qCgVEgCco=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69842346/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dyk8p4"&gt;In 2019 a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; report called&lt;/a&gt; Google’s then-121,000-strong assortment of temporary employees “a shadow work force that now outnumbers the company’s full-time employees.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blkoj1"&gt;Now, a whistleblower has filed a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stating that gaps in pay between temporary workers and full-time employees doing similar work had widened over the last few years, stretching far enough that the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/10/google-underpaid-workers-illegal-pay-disparity-documents"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; it broke local laws in the UK, Europe, and Asia. Even worse, documents viewed by the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/technology/google-temporary-workers-labor-laws-pay.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reveal that last December, Google managers discovered the problem and instead of addressing it immediately, they held off on taking action and only applied correct rates for the year’s new hires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="t6loox"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Hybrid work is coming to big tech. Its contractors might not be so lucky ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22545717/big-tech-hybrid-work-remote-contractors-google-apple-amazon-facebook-microsoft"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="83K5il"&gt;The whistleblower is being represented by lawyers from &lt;a href="https://whistlebloweraid.org/"&gt;Whistleblower Aid&lt;/a&gt; and has approached the issue by claiming that Google misled investors in the US by not reporting the legal and financial liabilities it could face abroad. Google did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, however in a statement reported by the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, Google chief compliance officer Spyro Karetsos said “It’s clear that this process has not been handled consistent with the high standards to which we hold ourselves as a company...We’re going to figure out what went wrong here, why it happened, and we’re going to make it right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLwGPA"&gt;While the US doesn’t require companies to pay temporary workers the same rates as full-time employees, the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; reports that more than 30 countries do have pay parity laws. The problem apparently arose because Google mapped out the rates of comparable full-time roles in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) in 2012 and 2013, and the Asia/Pacific region in 2017 — but didn’t update those rates afterward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwXZGr"&gt;That meant staffing agencies filling the temporary roles were using outdated data that didn’t match rising wages for full-time employees until compliance managers noticed the issue. The complaint says Google kept paying the outdated rates while managers went back and forth over what to do, and it claims the amount of back pay owed in more than 16 countries over the last nine years adds up to more than $100 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYec42"&gt;There’s no word available on whether the SEC is investigating, but if Google faces an inquiry or is fined, then this problem could become even more expensive. Even at those numbers, it shouldn’t slow down Google or its parent company Alphabet, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596592/google-q2-2021-record-revenue-profit-youtube-ad-cloud-search"&gt;notched $18.5 billion in profit during Q2 of this year alone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge says Apple may be ‘stretching the truth’ on Mac malware concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1WT78OBjVXFiPS-ksPeOd2a7T5Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69842145/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rxJEyX"&gt;During the &lt;em&gt;Apple v. Epic&lt;/em&gt; trial, Apple software leader Craig Federighi argued that tight control over the App Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444471/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-trial-craig-federighi-ios-security"&gt;was necessary for securing the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. But Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers didn’t buy it, writing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;in her ruling&lt;/a&gt; Friday that he may have been “stretching the truth for the sake of the argument.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BLF0Y"&gt;Federighi cast heavy doubts about whether Apple would be able to secure iPhones without its App Review system acting as a gateway, by saying that the macOS security &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444353/mac-malware-not-acceptable-craig-federighi-apple-epic"&gt;was basically in a bad place&lt;/a&gt;. Judge Rodgers doesn’t think Federighi has the proof to back it up (you can read her quotes below in context on page 114): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JlACaa"&gt;While Mr. Federighi’s Mac malware opinions may appear plausible, they appear to have emerged for the first time at trial which suggests he is stretching the truth for the sake of the argument. During deposition, he testified that he did not have any data on the relative rates of malware on notarized Mac apps compared to iOS apps. At trial, he acknowledged that Apple only has malware data collection tools for Mac, not for iOS, which raises the question of how he knows the relative rates. Prior to this lawsuit, Apple has consistently represented Mac as secure and safe from malware. Thus, the Court affords Mr. Federighi’s testimony on this topic little weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="uLbYm3"&gt;Woof. Basically, Judge Rodgers says that Federighi was trying to make the Mac look bad so iOS could shine, without much evidence. After discussing notarization and App Review a bit more, she concludes that Apple could implement a system similar to the Mac’s without giving up much of the security iOS already enjoys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="GXEznr"&gt;Ultimately, the Court finds persuasive that app review can be relatively independent of app distribution. As Mr. Federighi confirmed at trial, once an app has been reviewed, Apple can send it back to the developer to be distributed directly or in another store. Thus, even though unrestricted app distribution likely decreases security, alternative models are readily achievable to attain the same ends even if not currently employed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TtDFd2"&gt;It’s worth keeping in mind that Judge Rogers didn’t end up forcing Apple to allow alternative app stores or side-loading, and that this opinion is only contending one of Apple’s points. But it’s sharp criticism of Apple’s more prominent defenses of its locked-down approach to iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFbYaW"&gt;Epic argued at trial that Apple could achieve security and privacy on iOS without controlling the exclusive way to distribute apps. It suggested that Apple could use a system similar to the Mac — by scanning apps before they run, and checking to see if it’s the same code that Apple has notarized. While the Mac notarization process doesn’t currently include all of the checks that happen in App Review, in theory it could if Apple wanted it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIscoZ"&gt;Federighi strongly disagreed that this would be sufficient. He argued that iPhones have more sensitive data than Macs do, that the iPhone’s popularity makes it a bigger target than Macs, and that Mac users have basically just learned to be more careful when installing apps. He also argued separately that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444353/mac-malware-not-acceptable-craig-federighi-apple-epic"&gt;isn’t happy with where security is on macOS&lt;/a&gt;, and said that adopting the same security model would be a “very bad situation for [Apple’s] customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2ReD5r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Craig Federighi explains why the Mac’s security wasn’t good enough for the iPhone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444471/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-trial-craig-federighi-ios-security"},{"title":"Apple must allow other forms of in-app purchases, rules judge in Epic v. Apple","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="YNN05K"&gt;Judge Rodgers argues against Apple’s stance that third-party app installations or app stores would seriously harm iOS’s security. The Mac’s Notarization system currently doesn’t keep away the kinds of problems that App Review does (or, at least, is supposed to), but there’s no reason why it couldn’t. Even if Apple doesn’t want to implement it onto iOS, perhaps it could consider taking her suggestions to heart if its unhappy with the state of macOS security.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is testing new ‘Favorites’ to bring order to your chaotic feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZKNcTBubP5QtM-Fi0UGPO_qALP4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69842022/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yFl5h3"&gt;You’re on Instagram looking for your best friend’s daily dog update, but you have to scroll endlessly through a sea of posts you care little about, and probably forget what you’re looking for in the first place. After a few extra annoyed scrolls, you close the app in frustration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOJ2Yd"&gt;It seems Instagram is well aware of your plight, because it is quietly testing out a solution for your messy feed called “Favorites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ph25cH"&gt;According to Alessandro Paluzzi, a mobile developer who first &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1435919581277609989?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;posted about the new feature on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Favorites lets you categorize your most important Instagram accounts (friends and creators) as your priorities, so that their posts will land “higher” in your feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dhrAp6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Instagram?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Instagram&lt;/a&gt; is working on "Favorites"  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ℹ️ Posts from your favorites are shown higher in feed. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NfBd8v4IHR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NfBd8v4IHR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1435919581277609989?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZMmGi"&gt;If this feature sounds familiar, it’s because Instagram was testing a different &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/23/15856858/instagram-favorites-private-sharing-friends-list"&gt;Favorites feature back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, which you let you limit the exact audience for each post. For example, you could share your wedding photo with just your designated favorites, rather than with your entire following. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="74JCiE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new feature gives you more control over who you see first in your feed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yc6osZ"&gt;The 2021 iteration of Favorites, however, is about giving you more control over your feed — by telling Instagram which accounts are most important to you. After all, you may follow a bunch of different brands and creators on your account, but you don’t necessarily prioritize their content on the same level as your closest friends and families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkjEUC"&gt;Currently, Instagram ranks the order of your feed by the most recent and shared posts from the people you follow, plus other “signals” like how likely you’ll engage with a post, according to the company’s June 2021 &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/shedding-more-light-on-how-instagram-works"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about its algorithm. While you may “like” many posts you see, those may not be the content you’re actually looking for, but might be sending Instagram all the wrong signals on what you actually want to see in your feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="treq2k"&gt;It’s not clear whether this Favorites feature will become an official feature at all or if it will change before it’s rolled out more broadly. In the meantime, you just might see this feature in your account menu, just below &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18117718/instagram-close-friends-stories-favorites"&gt;“Close Friends”&lt;/a&gt; — a feature that lets you control who you share your Stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VeQr8E"&gt;We’ve reached out to Instagram for more information on this new feature and will update this article should the company respond.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stephen King’s new short story is a Humble Bundle exclusive</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hqcf4w"&gt;Author Stephen King and Humble Bundle &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fbooks%2Fhumble-charity-red-screen-stephen-king-books&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F10%2F22667291%2Fstephen-king-short-story-red-screen-humble-bundle-aclu" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are teaming up to release an exclusive short story&lt;/a&gt; called “Red Screen.” All pay-what-you-want proceeds (starting at a $5 minimum) from “Red Screen” will benefit the American Civil Liberties Union while the story is available, from September 10th through September 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLopcX"&gt;Besides being notable as one of the newest entries in King’s prolific body of work, “Red Screen” is also the first Humble Bundle Exclusive. Based on what little has been shared of the plot, it certainly sounds...interesting. The description follows (emphasis mine): “The never before published story follows a cop who interrogates a &lt;strong&gt;deranged plumber&lt;/strong&gt; who just murdered his wife, only to discover something far more insidious.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1G3F5z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s likely not about the video game plumber&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6NLMGp"&gt;I’m guessing King is not referencing Mario (of the brothers Mario) here — though his work &lt;a href="https://mario.fandom.com/wiki/Phantamanta"&gt;has been rumored to have inspired the games&lt;/a&gt; — so this could involve actual plumbing adjacent murder. Somehow both more and less frightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yh6YZp"&gt;As far as digital platforms are concerned, King has a bit of a history of tinkering with different release strategies. The novella &lt;em&gt;Ur&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/10/stephen-king-kindle-ur"&gt;was exclusive to Amazon’s second-generation Kindle&lt;/a&gt; at launch. King’s relationship with Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/25/5937247/nearly-900-authors-sign-letter-against-amazon-in-hachette-dispute"&gt;would eventually sour&lt;/a&gt; due to the company’s aggressive tactics with publisher Hachette. King has also chosen to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/2/3058147/stephen-king-eschewing-ebooks-joyland"&gt;skip ebook releases entirely&lt;/a&gt; in the past. At least with this Humble Bundle experiment, throwing some literary spaghetti at the wall is benefiting a good cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNerse"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Analogue Pocket preorders won’t arrive until December 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Analogue Pocket" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X-5SaI9RIppnGRKFMnjzW33Bjk4=/165x0:1853x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69841996/4_Analogue_Pocket_All.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j47Cz8"&gt;The Analogue Pocket has experienced a few delays already due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it’s suffering another, &lt;a href="https://support.analogue.co/hc/en-us/articles/4408932900365"&gt;the company shared on its site&lt;/a&gt;. Preorders for the retro handheld that can play Game Boy cartridges and other formats like Game Gear, Neo Geo Pocket Color, and more via adapters will ship “at the latest in December.” The $199 console was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22361017/analogue-pocket-handheld-delayed-electronic-component-shortage"&gt;previously slated to launch in October&lt;/a&gt;, following a delay that pushed it from its original 2020 launch window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cdjbEf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Analogue Pocket is a gorgeous, modern handheld for playing your old Game Boy games ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/16/20906665/analogue-pocket-game-boy-handheld-release-date-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5D5ljy"&gt;Analogue says that “due to new Covid restrictions with our assembly partners, their capacity to deliver within our agreed timeframe has been affected.” Though understandably frustrating for people who like to stay entertained during tough times, you can’t pin blame just on Analogue since chip shortages spurred by the pandemic have impacted nearly every company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEFtih"&gt;Analogue shared that, after the holiday season, it expects to have the Pocket and all of its accessories restocked and ready for immediate shipping. So, hopefully this is the final delay for the handheld.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now jump in the queue to buy a PS5 (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WtanDXtYDjK77eba7kUnpKWcxaY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69841848/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sony themselves is often one of the most reliable sources to get a PS5, with a little luck. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a6g9tj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 10th, 5:01PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Sony appears to have sold out of PS5 consoles for the day. We’ll make sure to let you know when the next opportunity comes up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqsXOf"&gt;The PlayStation 5 is still difficult to get, but as restocks come and go one of the most reliable sources is Sony itself. Sony’s direct online store has opened a queue for ordering the &lt;a href="https://direct-queue.playstation.com/?c=sonyied&amp;amp;e=e1i2kfmr0b"&gt;disc-based PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; console and &lt;a href="https://direct-queue.playstation.com/?c=sonyied&amp;amp;e=e1i2kfmr0b"&gt;PlayStation 5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8vJrz"&gt;Once you’re on the landing page, you do not have to refresh the page, just try to wait patiently. When the countdown finishes, make sure you have your PlayStation Network account info ready to log in and complete the purchase if you are allocated a spot to buy one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CY11vy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"},{"title":"Sony’s new PS5 model is lighter and doesn’t need a screwdriver","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637524/sony-new-ps5-model-revision-lighter-screwdriver-stand-base-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="V6dYCP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="QkH3rm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TaHC5V"&gt;While you wait...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="l9oQBw"&gt;There are also a variety of accessories to consider when you’re buying a new console, as well as all kinds of new titles to jump into. Here are some starters to ponder over and keep your mind at ease while you wait in the queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CiHWLl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499071"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="93O1Sm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420564"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="lu7e24"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10687661"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="3nQnfd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
