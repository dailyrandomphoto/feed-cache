    <title>Arrival and Uber are working on an electric ride-hailing car</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UPK4omPz0C7LIB6y9GSMi4xw0qI=/188x0:2213x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69230776/Arrival_Uber_Car_Shot_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Arrival&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xXbnsF"&gt;UK-based EV startup Arrival is working with Uber to develop an electric car that will be “purpose-built” for ride-hailing. Arrival plans to put the car into production in late 2023 and says it will not be exclusive to Uber. Instead, the startup says the goal is to create an affordable vehicle that would appeal to the millions of ride-hailing drivers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCxZMA"&gt;It’s another vote of confidence in Arrival, which just became &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/british-ev-firm-arrival-arvl-goes-public-via-spac-today.html"&gt;a publicly traded company in March&lt;/a&gt; after merging with a special purpose acquisition company, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;SPAC&lt;/a&gt;. Founded in 2015, Arrival is also developing electric delivery vans (with UPS as a customer) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293615/arrival-uk-electric-bus-ev-photos"&gt;buses&lt;/a&gt;. It also has backing from Hyundai and Kia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzhAA6"&gt;Arrival and Uber released a handful of renderings of the new car’s interior and said a final design will be revealed by the end of the year. Between now and then, the companies plan to get some drivers involved in the design process, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MALV8l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10481187"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uz9ihL"&gt;What’s being teased in the images that were released is not some radical rethink of what a car should be like on the inside — in fact, in comparison to the concept cars we see every year at auto shows around the world, it’s quite familiar. There’s a large horizontal screen mounted to the dashboard, similar to what’s in Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y (and the forthcoming Model S and Model X refresh), and the steering wheel is also quite similar to what’s found in a Tesla, with just two scroll wheels and no driver display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeC70q"&gt;But there are a few subtle differences that Arrival says could enhance the ride-hailing experience for both drivers and passengers. The driver’s seat is ergonomically designed to ease the physical strain of sitting in a car for hours on end. The front passenger seat folds up to create more leg room. There’s a bench-style seat in the rear, which makes it easier to get in and out of the vehicle. And there are small, lighted cubbies and handrails on the inside of each door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="l30tns"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The key will be affordability&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Byyu5l"&gt;The goal is to make “hundreds of small improvements, changes, and tweaks to the design that perhaps haven’t been applied before,” according to Tom Elvidge, Arrival’s senior vice president of mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sr1wxX"&gt;Electric vehicles can make a lot of sense in a ride-hailing setting. They tend to have fewer moving parts than internal combustion cars, and therefore require less maintenance and upkeep. They’re also inherently compliant with the zero-emission zones that have been adopted in cities across Europe, as well as broader internal combustion bans that are on the horizon. But electric vehicles are, currently, more expensive than the cheapest internal combustion or hybrid cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5krzdH"&gt;The goal is to design an affordable vehicle from the outset, Elvidge says, though Arrival believes it can broadly reduce the cost of manufacturing electric vehicles by using so-called “microfactories,” or highly automated, small-footprint facilities where it plans to build its vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szBhS6"&gt;Arrival has yet to prove that strategy can work. Like many of its SPAC peers, it is still in the developmental phase and has yet to actually sell any production vehicles. Uber has quietly poked at a number of electric vehicle startups over the last few years but never struck any deals, though it has recently cleaved a number of money-losing divisions, like the one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;focused on autonomous vehicles&lt;/a&gt; and the one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22086597/uber-sells-flying-taxi-elevate-joby-aviation"&gt;dedicated to flying taxis&lt;/a&gt;. The partnership with Arrival, then, may be a sign that it’s ready to try to execute on its promise to make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427196/uber-promise-100-percent-electric-vehicle-ev-2030"&gt;100 percent of its rides&lt;/a&gt; happen in electric vehicles in the US, Canada, and Europe by 2030 — a goal Uber said it would reach by partnering with a variety of companies across the transportation industry.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Impossible Foods clears legal battle over the ingredient that makes its meat ‘bleed’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Impossible Burger" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HrsneG7wySnBz4ztpZihjghQ8QE=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69230584/1297646110.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Close-up shot of the Impossible Foods Company’s product Impossible Burger in Walnut Creek, California, January 11, 2021. | Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Moa3Q"&gt;A San Francisco federal appeals court upheld a decision by the Food and Drug Administration to allow Impossible Foods to use “heme,” the additive the company says makes its products “&lt;a href="https://impossiblefoods.com/heme"&gt;taste like meat&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecvfbT"&gt;Had Impossible Foods lost this legal battle, it could have dealt a heavy blow to the company. Genetically engineered heme is what sets its products apart from other competitors like Beyond Meat that don’t use the ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s3JJ01"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Heme is what sets its products apart from other competitors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NW1uYm"&gt;The FDA used a weaker legal standard than it should have to approve the use of heme, the nonprofit Center for Food Safety argued in a lawsuit it filed last year. It said the FDA made its decision based on safety standards for food additives rather than on standards for color additives, which stipulate that there needs to be “convincing evidence” that the color additive causes no harm. Heme is a red ingredient that makes Impossible Foods’ products appear to “bleed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGLXuC"&gt;The appeals court ruling said that the FDA had “substantial evidence” to deem heme in Impossible Foods safe to eat, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-03/impossible-foods-wins-ruling-to-continue-use-of-key-additive?sref=DWzi38c2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported today. It also allowed the FDA to rely on research commissioned by Impossible Foods in its decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpdRz3"&gt;Impossible Foods shared its own data with a food safety panel of experts from several universities for review and then conducted &lt;a href="https://impossiblefoods.com/blog/the-agonizing-dilemma-of-animal-testing"&gt;rat feeding studies&lt;/a&gt; to address questions from the FDA. “We have no questions at this time regarding Impossible Foods’ conclusion that soy leghemoglobin preparation is [generally recognized as safe] under its intended conditions of use to optimize flavor in ground beef analogue products intended to be cooked,” the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/116243/download"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64Ek6z"&gt;The Center for Food Safety, on the other hand, said there needs to be more analysis. “FDA should have required additional independent testing to make sure that this new substance does not cause allergic reactions or other health problems in people,” Jaydee Hanson, policy director for the Center for Food Safety, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/press-releases/5961/center-for-food-safety-filed-lawsuit-against-fda-challenging-decision-to-approve-genetically-engineered-soy-protein-found-in-the-impossible-burger"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkoPsn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gYq21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVzpPS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Thursday Night Football deal will start early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Seattle Seahawks v San Francisco 49ers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tNyNQLJxAIy7TIhh1vriNZaibK0=/0x0:3790x2527/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69230358/1295550077.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A9LOTc"&gt;Amazon made history as the first all-digital streamer to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339636/nfl-streaming-deals-amazon-peacock-paramount-tubi-espn-plus"&gt;acquire exclusive rights to the NFL’s &lt;em&gt;Thursday Night Football&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and now &lt;a href="https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/AMAZON-PRIME-VIDEO-TO-BECOME-THE-EXCLUSIVE-HOME-OF-THURSDAY-NIGHT-FOOTBALL-BEGINNING-WITH-THE-2022-SEASON.aspx"&gt;the NFL has announced&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon will be streaming games sooner than expected — starting with the 2022 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rHeRC"&gt;The NFL’s previous announcement set the start of Amazon’s exclusivity in 2023. Now Amazon gets its exclusive rights even sooner and for even longer thanks to a new 11-year contract matching the NFL’s other partners, including CBS, NBC (and Peacock), and Fox. That means 2021 will mark the final season with Fox broadcasting &lt;em&gt;Thursday Night Football&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="smS9ZN"&gt;One important note: Amazon’s exclusivity doesn’t extend to local markets. You should still be able to watch &lt;em&gt;Thursday Night Football&lt;/em&gt; on an over-the-air broadcast if your team is playing, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/03/amazons-thursday-night-football-package-will-begin-in-2022-instead-of-2023.html"&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0MvgBQ"&gt;Amazon’s history hosting &lt;em&gt;Thursday Night Football&lt;/em&gt; actually &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nfl.com%2Fnews%2Fnfl-amazon-prime-announce-tnf-streaming-deal-0ap3000000797854&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F3%2F22417957%2Famazon-nfl-thursday-night-football-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;began in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, when it handled the digital streaming of games while NBC and CBS handled the OTA broadcasts. Later OTA broadcasts were handled by Fox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egeBKA"&gt;The online retail giant also gained &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241195/amazon-nfl-games-thursday-saturday-streaming-twitch-prime-video"&gt;exclusive access to some Saturday games in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Before that, Amazon was reportedly considering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104821/amazon-fox-sports-network-disney-bid-twitch-nfl"&gt;buying multiple Fox sports channels&lt;/a&gt; outright as a way to aggressively get into sports. Amazon’s current offerings aren’t anything to sneeze at, but it’s not hard to imagine a future where Amazon streams an even bigger NFL event, like say, the Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMorbe"&gt;Now if you want to watch a &lt;em&gt;Thursday Night Football&lt;/em&gt; game and it doesn’t involve the team in your broadcast region, then watching via Amazon is the only way to go. While that may be annoying for those who don’t have a Prime account, it will probably still be better than dropping $50 for NFL Game Pass, which is subject to brutal blackout periods that can often make it feel like a waste of a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite made more than $9 billion in revenue in its first two years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/omGWhEnKWsunn90E3dhwmh02eTY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69228857/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FSHy4T"&gt;After a meteoric rise to popularity in 2018, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; generated more than $5 billion in its first year for Epic Games, new financial documents reveal. The document, made public as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Epic’s court battle with Apple&lt;/a&gt; over the latter’s App Store practices, shows that the game brought in more than $9 billion total for Epic in 2018 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjcOKW"&gt;The document doesn’t break down how much Epic specifically profited from &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, but the company reported more than $5.5 billion in profit from the two-year period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3adjc"&gt;In the document, the company predicted that it would have almost $3.6 billion in revenue for 2020. Epic doesn’t usually publicly provide financial statements, but CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eringriffith/status/1389295991602380803"&gt;Tim Sweeney’s recent testimony&lt;/a&gt; indicates that it actually made much more: $5.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="046Ls5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sweeney says Epic employs 3200 people, has offices around the world and (this might be new info?) made $5.1bn in gross revenue in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;— erin griffith (@eringriffith) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eringriffith/status/1389295991602380803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KJmiaI"&gt;The revenue from &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; far outshone any other businesses that Epic ran at the time — “other games” (such as &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525842/epic-games-psyonix-acquisition-rocket-league-fortnite-unreal-deal"&gt;acquired by Epic in 2019&lt;/a&gt;) made $108 million in revenue in 2018 and 2019, and Epic’s engine brought in $221 million over the same span. Epic’s Game Store, launched at the end of 2018, brought in a total of $235 million between 2018 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TSa8TA"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FjOkXo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 3rd, 5:12PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added Epic’s actual 2020 revenue provided by Tim Sweeney’s testimony.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s once again time to update your iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch as soon as possible</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KaNOSNGw-Fr6G6BSHVThms2YyUc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69230068/acastro_170731_1777_0004_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IcVriv"&gt;I know there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;a ton of other Apple news happening today&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’re reading it on a Mac, iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch (okay, that last one may be a stretch), you should probably pause and update that device — today’s update fixes a security issue that &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212336"&gt;Apple says&lt;/a&gt; may have been actively exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPKvyv"&gt;The updates contained in &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212336"&gt;iOS / iPadOS 14.5.1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212335"&gt;macOS 11.3.1&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212339"&gt;watchOS 7.4.1&lt;/a&gt; are meant to fix arbitrary code execution exploits present in WebKit, Apple’s framework that renders most of the web content you see on your device (unless you’re using, say, Chrome or Firefox on Mac). In normal language, the updates patch a hole that let malicious websites run unchecked code on your device, so it’s not the type of update you want to put off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8xbf2"&gt;If you have an older device, such as an iPhone 5 or 6, iPad Air or Mini 2 and 3, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212341"&gt;Apple also released iOS 12.5.3&lt;/a&gt;, which addresses WebKit flaws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIiN7j"&gt;If this story sounds a little familiar, it’s because there have been two recent updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251149/iphone-update-14-4-fixes-exploited-security-vulnerabilities"&gt;iOS 14.4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352676/iphone-ios-update-fixes-xss-exploit-security-issue"&gt;14.4.2&lt;/a&gt;, that closed similar security holes. Even if you don’t think you should update because you use an alternative web browser on your Mac, or don’t browse the web on your Apple Watch (for obvious reasons), it’s still worth updating any devices you may have — WebKit can be used in unexpected places, and it’s never good to have security holes open on your devices, especially ones that may have been exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="wWfAMA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/1389316412259270657"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/melindagates/status/1389316399428866049"&gt;Melinda Gates&lt;/a&gt; have announced that they’ll be ending their marriage after 27 years together, explaining in a joint statement that they “no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Icvnt"&gt;Bill Gates is best known as the founder of Microsoft, who leveraged his fortune at the helm of that company working together with Melinda Gates to form the &lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/"&gt;Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation&lt;/a&gt; in 2000. The Gates Foundation has since grown to become one of — if not the largest — charitable foundations in the world, with an endowment of almost $50 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKWy6O"&gt;Bill had previously stepped away from his &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/2000/01/13/mu7.html#18b884f65d83"&gt;positions at Microsoft as CEO&lt;/a&gt; (in 2000), &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-gates/bill-gates-bids-a-teary-farewell-to-microsoft-idUSN2630130120080628"&gt;a full-time employee&lt;/a&gt; (in 2008), and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179214/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-board-philanthropy"&gt;member of the company’s board&lt;/a&gt; in order, he claims, to better focus on philanthropy. Melinda had previously worked as a product marketing manager at Microsoft and oversaw a number of software launches before leaving in 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLJcV5"&gt;It’s not clear what impact the Gates’ separation will have on the Gates Foundation. According to the released statement, the Gates still both share a belief in the Gates Foundation’s mission and “will continue our work together at the foundation” despite their separation. While both Bill and Melinda — along with fellow multibillionaire Warren Buffett — serve as trustees for the Gates Foundation, the foundation is led by CEO Mark Suzman.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are Apple’s and Epic’s full slideshows arguing why they should win at trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ncr4l-L-A4U6IklCTAA7TgKXwGc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69229294/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UVIIeO"&gt;Both Apple and Epic have released their opening presentations on why they feel they should win this week’s trial, which is set to determine &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;the future of the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. In the documents, which you can look through below, each company lays out its case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXsOf4"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;lawsuit started&lt;/a&gt; when Apple removed Epic Games’ &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;from the App Store after Epic bypassed Apple’s system for in-app purchases. But it’s turned into a much deeper examination of Apple’s walled-garden approach to technology, and whether some of the walls the company puts up might violate antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01XMHx"&gt;We took &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;a deeper look at the companies’ legal strategies&lt;/a&gt; in advance of the trial, but you can see the same arguments play out in these presentations. Epic uses metaphors of brick walls and gas stations to argue that Apple’s control over what can and cannot be installed on the iPhone is unfair, and that allowing other methods of installing apps wouldn’t harm iOS’s security. Apple pushes back saying that Epic getting the openness that it wants would harm not just the App Store but other stores from Sony and Nintendo. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM’s installing software on Chevy Bolts to help prevent battery fires</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ID00ZCTtcKAdybNYry8oWZCsmwc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69229083/akrales_170405_1582_0223.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LnhAUs"&gt;General Motors has finally revealed its &lt;a href="https://my.chevrolet.com/how-to-support/safety/boltevrecall"&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt; to fix the issue at the center of last year’s Chevy Bolt &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;recall&lt;/a&gt;, which the automaker issued in response to a handful of battery pack fires. Affected customers have to bring their Bolts to a dealer so the battery packs can be inspected, and GM says some of the modules that make up the pack may be replaced if any “anomalies” are found. But dealers will also install “advanced onboard diagnostic software” on all of the affected vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoghDO"&gt;That software, GM says, will be able to “detect potential issues related to changes in battery module performance before problems can develop.” The company says the software will be standard on all new Bolts moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zT5daw"&gt;Following last year’s recall, GM released a software update to dealers that limited the affected Bolts’ full battery capacity to just 90 percent in an effort to prevent fires. The company says dealers have been instructed to remove that limit when customers bring their Bolts in to get the new fix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0X0Wy"&gt;While there were only around five reports of fires, the problem with the Bolt’s battery pack was concerning because it uses the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;cells from LG Chem&lt;/a&gt; that are at the center of a similar problem with Hyundai’s Kona EV. Hyundai recalled the Kona EV earlier this year in South Korea and in the US after more than a dozen reports of fires, and it has since outright &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396480/hyundai-discontinue-kona-ev-korea-battery-fire-recall"&gt;canceled the electric SUV in its home market&lt;/a&gt; following a drop-off in sales. Hyundai’s recall involved a more dramatic fix, though, as the automaker is replacing entire battery packs for affected customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTJ9ZQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best smartphone you can buy for under $500</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cZYqwTfbX2vk4FqDWTzaFfIYSDU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67732462/vpavic_200805_4131_0086_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a big screen, or a great camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="TNIRIb"&gt;If you’re shopping for a new phone on a budget, we’ve got good news: there are more great, affordable phones on the market than ever. Companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung are spreading the wealth of features enjoyed by their flagships down to less expensive options. Other brands like OnePlus are finding ways to challenge more established manufacturers with budget devices that make smart sacrifices to keep costs down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWFA5k"&gt;The bad news is this makes the job of picking the best budget phone that much harder. Bear in mind that it’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything at this price point; instead, prioritize the features that matter most to you. You’ll have an easier time deciding, and you’ll end up with a great phone that you should be able to use for years to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JHLP0"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt; Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it’s just over a year old, we think it’s still the best bet for most people.  While it does a competent job at everything, its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gY4Mp"&gt;If you’re looking for the best cheap Android phone, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt; is your best bet right now. It comes with an excellent 6.5-inch screen with 120Hz fast refresh rate, still a rarity at this price point. Even better, Samsung says it will offer four years of security updates, including three years of major OS upgrades. The A52 5G isn’t the cheapest — it’s priced right at $500 — but that healthy support policy means you’ll get many years out of your investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQUJ3j"&gt;What most people are looking for in a sub-$500 smartphone are the same things people want in a more expensive model: long battery life, good screen, good camera, and decent performance. It’s difficult to get high straight A’s in every single one of those categories, but if you’re able to decide where you’ll tolerate the occasional B grade, you’ll find a phone you’ll love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="2Gej3D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462499"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="GatTSx"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="xLIfAi"&gt;The best smartphone for under $500 in 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBU6PLPRcKtVVTdfTrprm4mAigQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19916232/vpavic_042019_3980_0024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best smartphone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bkDOPH"&gt;The phone that strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people is the Apple iPhone SE 2020. Even though it’s over a year old now, it should still give you an excellent return on your investment. We recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZnehD"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today and also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market. High refresh-rate screens with smoother animations and scrolling have been trickling down into the budget class recently, and you definitely won’t find one here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOgwn4"&gt;It’s a familiar design and not one that screams “modern.” But in exchange, you get a lot of value. The 2020 SE is part of the iPhone 11 generation, so its A13 Bionic processor is a year behind the latest and greatest. (That would be the A14 chipset in the iPhone 12 lineup.) However, it’s still one of the fastest processors you can get on any phone, but &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; one in this price bracket. Normally, speed isn’t something we prioritize on phones at this price point, but it’s nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9LjWN"&gt;Why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in opposition to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means, in a few years, the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and still be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5TvHua"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tETMb0"&gt;Battery life is good but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, which is still uncommon at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape as the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8, there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAfzxG"&gt;The iPhone SE has just one camera on the back and just one selfie camera on the front, 12 megapixels and 7 megapixels, respectively. Neither is great by 2021 standards, but both are significantly better than what Apple shipped in older iPhones. It’s also fairly good by the standards of sub-$500 phones, though the Google Pixel 4A continues to win this category by a knockout. You will get a lot of camera features on the iPhone SE, including portrait and HDR, but unfortunately, there is no night mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nB1ZXR"&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people. If you think of it on a cost-per-year metric, it ends up being significantly less expensive than the competition because it’s likely to last four or five years if you take care of it. Just as importantly, it’s a great phone on its own merits. You get access to the vast array of iOS apps, Apple’s strong support network, and a huge ecosystem of accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ykrqeX"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7jGjKdcssyDUAL1Vc67gH-WoCNo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465667/ajohnson_20210419_4541_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G offers a 120Hz fast refresh-rate screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qyhaRs"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MeddEq"&gt;The best budget Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7CPw9a"&gt;On the Android side, the Galaxy A52 5G is a great option, albeit at the very top of the price range considered in this guide. It includes some features that aren’t too common in a budget phone, like its fast-refresh rate screen, an IP67 water resistance rating, and for now at least, monthly security updates for fast access to bug fixes and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s379P4"&gt;The A52 5G’s 6.5-inch screen is an OLED panel that’s bright with good contrast that’s generally nice to look at. But its best feature is a subtle one: a 120Hz refresh rate that gives a much smoother appearance to animations and content as you swipe and scroll through menus and social feeds. We’ll likely see this feature make its way into more budget phones soon, but for now the A52 5G is one of only a few to offer better than the standard 60Hz screen in its class, and it makes the experience of using the phone that much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grIaTf"&gt;The phone overall performs well for its class with a Snapdragon 750G processor and 6GB of RAM. You may notice the occasional hesitation or stutter with heavy tasks, but otherwise everyday scrolling, app switching, and navigating is handled easily. And even with a power-hungry display, the Galaxy A52 5G’s 4,500mAh battery should get you through at least a day of moderate to heavy use before needing another charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RSNCy0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;if you want to make an investment in a phone that you can keep using years from now, the A52 5G is your best bet right now on Android&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwHMHO"&gt;One of the A52 5G’s not-so-bright-spots is Samsung’s current take on Android, which puts a lot of pre-downloaded apps on your phone that you probably don’t want, and it even includes the occasional ad in places like the native weather app. For a cleaner or more grown-up Android skin, look to the Pixel or OnePlus. The Galaxy A52 5G’s camera is another consideration: it’s capable, but it tends toward an oversaturated look. If you prefer a more natural look to your photos, then the Pixel 4A is the winner here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFmNNo"&gt;There’s also 5G, which we still don’t think is a feature you should run out and buy a new phone for, but it is nice to have the support here — particularly if you plan to hold on to your phone for a few years. This device doesn’t support super-fast mmWave 5G, but it’s hard to come by so that’s not a huge loss. Importantly, it supports more widely available sub-6GHz bands and should be able to take advantage of improving 5G networks in the US over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOCh8W"&gt;You can buy a much less expensive device to get you through the next couple of years, and that’s just fine. But if you do want to make more of an investment in a phone that you can keep using three or four years from now, the A52 5G is your best bet right now on Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uGMHIJ_EFkQE2rMcf3ISzHc3EYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21691927/vpavic_4113_20200721_0041.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mjpWjB"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ndqid1"&gt;An affordable Android phone with the best camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nCclP5"&gt;If you want to spend a little less money, or just want the best camera, then the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt; Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice&lt;/a&gt;. Its screen is on the small side, and it doesn’t have the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android and is first in line for updates from Google. The 4A came out in August last year, but it’s still guaranteed to get software updates until at least August 2023. It comes in either black or baby blue with 128GB of storage for $349. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Huw9Ph"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera. It’s based on generation-old technology at this point, but it’s still the best in this class and it can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,000 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software. (The sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special.) That means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XiTOqY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g65TGg"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrF1h5"&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff you probably don’t want. More importantly, it means that Google can supply the software updates directly instead of waiting for another manufacturer or carrier to approve it, putting you first in line for Android updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XggNCE"&gt;Unfortunately, in a little over a year’s time, it’s quite likely that the Pixel 4A will be slowing down. Android phones generally don’t last quite as long as iPhones do because Android tends to bog down on older hardware more quickly. The Pixel 4A’s processor is fast enough today to not be a bother, but over time, it’s possible that it won’t age well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7VV1d"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for well under $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Nord has very good specs for its price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bFMC0d"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;OnePlus Nord&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PWBCf6"&gt;The best all-around Android phone outside the US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VceItk"&gt;Technically, saying the OnePlus Nord costs less than $500 doesn’t make much sense because it’s not available in the US, and the company doesn’t plan to sell it in the States. But if you live in a market where it’s available, the OnePlus Nord is the kind of phone that aims for a solid B grade in every category instead of trying to ace one or two. For £379 / €399, it’s a safe Android bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCe0u5"&gt;The OnePlus Nord has a couple of features that are normally reserved for much more expensive phones: support for sub-6 5G networks and a high refresh rate 90Hz display. If you live in an area where 5G is built out, you may notice faster download speeds. But it’s the display that’ll have a bigger impact on your day-to-day experience. It makes everything feel smoother and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdWibC"&gt;You will miss out on wireless charging and a headphone jack with the Nord, but they’re really the only big things that are lacking. Battery life is strong, the 6.44-inch screen is big and beautiful, and the software is less annoying than some competitors (though not as clean as Google’s). The £379 / €399 model comes with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, both plenty good for this price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5llXq"&gt;As for cameras, there are a bunch of them — maybe even too many. There’s a standard, an ultrawide, and a macro camera on the back as well as a couple of selfie cameras on the front. As is the norm with most smartphone cameras these days, they will get you decent photos in decent light but fall down a bit in the dark. You’ll mostly want to use the main camera, as the ultrawide has a noticeable drop in quality, and the macro is only good for, well, macro or close-up shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijydf9"&gt;All too often, phones at this price point have some critical compromise you’re forced to make in order to get the feature you really want. With the OnePlus Nord, there’s no big flaw you’ll have to work around. Again, though, it’s not available in the US. You can import it, but it’s not recommended as it won’t work correctly on US LTE networks.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N10 5G is priced well under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2pPPrl"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0wGhHB"&gt;If you want an inexpensive 5G phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zVN77Q"&gt;At $299, the N10 5G is well below the threshold for this category. Given its price, you might expect to see some significant sacrifices compared to a $400 or $500 phone, and OnePlus has made a few. But they’re smart sacrifices that add up to a device that’s really quite good for the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vb4uVX"&gt;You won’t find a fantastic screen here, although its large 6.46-inch LCD does come with a faster-than-average 90Hz refresh rate. Worth noting is the device’s somewhat “tall” 20:9 aspect ratio, which is a little unusual at first glance but makes the phone slightly narrower and easier to use with one hand. Its processor is capable enough, though it sometimes shows its limits. It also ships with Android 10, which OnePlus says it will update to 11, and is only offering two years of security updates in addition to that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXW2WO"&gt;On the camera side, the N10 offers a 64-megapixel main camera that’s surprisingly good in daylight and even moderately low light. There’s an 8-megapixel ultrawide, too, along with macro and monochrome cameras that aren’t really worth talking about. It’s not Pixel 4A-level good, but if you don’t push it too hard, the N10’s main camera takes good photos in the right light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y00B08"&gt;If you can afford to spend a little more, you probably should. A device with better support in the long run will save you some money later. But if budget is a major consideration, the N10 5G is about as good as it gets at this price. It offers the future-proofiness of sub-6GHz 5G support, a thoroughly decent camera, good battery life, a capable processor, and a fairly clean implementation of Android. It’s not a standout in any one way, but as a total package, it’s very hard to argue with its capabilities at this price.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2021 Moto G Power offers days-long battery performance but makes a lot of sacrifices for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qq9tmB"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Motorola Moto G Power (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tXDuyi"&gt;The budget phone with maximum battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NSb4tw"&gt;The Moto G Power does exactly what it says it will: provide days and days of power on a single charge, thanks to its larger-than-average 5,000mAh battery. This is a slightly different version of last year’s phone with the same name, and it starts at a lower $200 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7tVXv"&gt;The lower price tag does come with trade-offs. It includes just 32GB of built-in storage, so adding a microSD card for some extra space is a must. There’s also a slightly slower processor on board, and while it’s capable enough for all of your daily needs, it’s a little laggy jumping between apps and opening the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8syWIE"&gt;As for the camera: it’s just okay. Motorola did away with the ultrawide in this year’s models, so you’ll just be working with the 48-megapixel standard wide and 2-megapixel macro cameras in addition to an 8-megapixel selfie cam. Photos in bright outdoor light look good with plenty of detail, though colors can be a little washed out. The camera struggles with high-contrast scenes and low light, but all things considered, it’s fine for a $200 phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bJEGA"&gt;If top-notch battery performance is an extremely important feature in your smartphone, then the Moto G Power should be on your shortlist. It’s capable, and you really will get multiple days of battery life on a charge. But if you’re fine getting by on a battery that’s just average, then we think you’ll be happier with a more well-rounded device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cyQK5V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10348305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="jpOqcd"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Play covers all of the basics for well under $200.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zLkqZB"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22408041/motorola-moto-g-play-2021-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;Motorola Moto G Play (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0rkwQp"&gt;The best phone under $200&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y8w9H"&gt;There are plenty of options for those shopping on a tighter budget, but the Motorola Moto G Play is the one that stands out to us. It covers the basics well with a big 5,000mAh battery and a Snapdragon 460 processor that does a good enough job handling daily tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwHIya"&gt;The G Play has a generously sized 6.5-inch screen. It’s a lower-resolution panel at 720p and is difficult to see outside in direct light, but it’s more or less just fine. Camera specs are likewise basic: there’s just one rear-facing 13-megapixel camera that performs well in bright light but isn’t well suited for low-light photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTXRvU"&gt;You’ll also want to strongly consider a microSD card purchase with this phone. It only includes 32GB of built-in storage, a lot of which is already occupied by system files. Motorola has only promised security updates for two years, but realistically, the G Play isn’t built to last much longer than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhtEOa"&gt;It has its shortcomings — the G Play’s performance doesn’t keep up with many phones that are just $50-100 more expensive, for example — but it’s hard to argue with what it does offer for its price: good, basic performance without any major flaws. If there’s flexibility in your budget to spend a little more, you’ll get some meaningful upgrades, like a better camera or a longer-lasting device. But for its price, the G Play does just what it needs to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony really hated PS4 crossplay, confidential documents reveal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zlgVD69yQlTis7SOYe1aGOYT87w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69228859/acastro_210113_1777_gamingstock_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kpe60f"&gt;It’s no secret that Sony held back PS4 cross-platform play for years, but new confidential documents and emails reveal just how much Sony was against letting people play the same games with their friends on other platforms. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/15/15807138/sony-playstation-cross-network-play-xbox-block-response"&gt;Sony initially blocked cross-platform play&lt;/a&gt; for both &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;despite Nintendo and Microsoft both enabling players to play across Xbox and Switch. The issue really blew up when Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453628/fortnite-nintendo-switch-cross-play-sony-ps4-microsoft-xbox-one-e3-2018"&gt;blocked &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; crossplay&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17454606/fortnite-nintendo-switch-ps4-block-accounts-cross-play-e3-2018"&gt;players were angry&lt;/a&gt;. It now appears that Sony may have been holding out to offset potential revenue losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjckbI"&gt;In the months leading up to Sony’s decision to block &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; crossplay in 2018, Epic Games had pleaded with Sony to enable crossplay, emails in the &lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case reveal. “I can’t think of a scenario where Epic doesn’t get what we want - that possibility went out the door when &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;became the biggest game on PlayStation,” said Joe Kreiner, Epic’s vice president of business development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qprmn5prBS_xwWV8At8v3qtNb58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22488819/5wy3mv8.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic Games’ plea to Sony to enable crossplay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4EXLqp"&gt;Kreiner proposed, “We announce crossplay in conjunction with Sony. Epic goes out of its way to make Sony look like heroes.” Epic even offered to brand its E3 presence with PlayStation or add unique characters, exclusive to PS Plus subscribers, to sweeten the deal. “Let’s make this a huge win for us all. Epic’s not changing it’s mind on the issue, so let’s just agree on it now,” said Kreiner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyMLTV"&gt;Sony didn’t agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9XZbf"&gt;Gio Corsi, Sony’s senior director of developer relations at the time, dismissed the idea of crossplay, noting that “cross-platform play is not a slam dunk no matter the size of the title” — a clear reference to Epic’s flex about &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s dominance on PlayStation. “As you know, many companies are exploring this idea and not a single one can explain how cross-console play improves the PlayStation business,” said Corsi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPnGc7"&gt;But as of August 2019, it appears that Sony may have found a worthy argument: a way to potentially siphon off money from its competitors in exchange for access to PlayStation players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cxql7"&gt;The email correspondence doesn’t reveal where the issue ultimately ended up, but a document entitled “cross-platform policy, requirements, and process” from August 2019 (after Sony’s change) reveals how Sony may now approach crossplay: a cross-platform revenue share, forcing publishers to pay Sony a royalty whenever PlayStation players contribute more than a certain percentage to the bottom line of a cross-platform game, to “offset the reduction in revenue” from Sony enabling crossplay.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8BlzpRSOHjYsB0HrWI-1k9AW0sw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22488805/PZp6sni.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s cross-platform revenue share stipulations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8X1qEY"&gt;Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney confirmed in testimony today that Sony is the only platform holder that requires this compensation for crossplay. “In certain circumstances Epic will have to pay additional revenue to Sony,” said Sweeney. “If somebody were primarily playing on PlayStation, but paying on iPhone then this might trigger compensation.” Sweeney also revealed that Epic had to agree to pay these additional fees to Sony in order to enable crossplay in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAeqsy"&gt;Sony also stipulates in the policy that publishers can’t transfer virtual currency to or from PlayStation, and that there must be a setting to disable all cross-platform interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5k0wn"&gt;There may have been other good reasons for Sony to stop blocking crossplay as well: three months after the Epic Games emails, Sony was facing a backlash when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453628/fortnite-nintendo-switch-cross-play-sony-ps4-microsoft-xbox-one-e3-2018"&gt;blocked &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;crossplay&lt;/a&gt; and eventually backed down in late 2018, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/26/17905146/sony-fortnite-ps4-cross-play-support"&gt;new policy change to enable crossplay&lt;/a&gt; in certain games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQRGDV"&gt;These emails and documents offer just a small glimpse into Sony’s efforts to initially block crossplay, before Epic Games’ success with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;seems to have forced the company to ultimately concede.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qg425O"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, May 3rd 6:15PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with comments from Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney confirming Sony’s crossplay compensation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
