    <title>Facebook’s satellite internet team joins Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B66aFc"&gt;Amazon has acquired a team of employees from Facebook focused on delivering internet connectivity from low Earth orbit satellites, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-acquires-facebooks-satellite-internet-group?utm_source=ti_app"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon paid Facebook an undisclosed sum as part of the acquisition, which saw more than a dozen Los Angeles-based employees switch companies in April to work on Project Kuiper. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the news to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhYhzG"&gt;The move brings an end to Facebook’s efforts to deliver internet connectivity to remote areas via its own satellites. When it confirmed the initiative &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/21/17598418/facebook-athena-internet-satellite-project-fcc"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt; the company said that it believed the technology would make it possible “to bring broadband connectivity to rural regions where internet connectivity is lacking or non-existent.” Facebook had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/mark-zuckerberg-future-of-facebook/aquila-drone-internet"&gt;previously attempted to use internet drones&lt;/a&gt; to achieve similar ends, before shutting down that project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/26/17507826/facebook-aquila-internet-drone-project-shut-down"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6Iwi6y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon has around 500 employees working on Project Kuiper&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RIwHHn"&gt;Meanwhile, Amazon’s ambitions to provide internet via satellite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295310/amazon-project-kuiper-satellite-internet-low-earth-orbit-facebook-spacex-starlink"&gt;emerged in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The company has said it expects to invest $10 billion to launch 3,236 satellites into low-earth orbit by 2029 with a similar aim of providing internet to “unserved and underserved communities around the world.” The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348768/fcc-amazon-kuiper-satellite-constellation-approval"&gt;gained FCC approval&lt;/a&gt; to operate the network last year, and will launch half its satellites by 2026. &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reports that Amazon is building a lab in Redmond, WA, and that it currently has around 500 employees working on its satellite internet project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XVY3i"&gt;Late last year, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178235/amazon-project-kuiper-user-terminal-antenna-internet-satellite-constellation"&gt;revealed the design of the antennas&lt;/a&gt; its customers will eventually use to receive internet from its satellite internet service. However, the company is yet to launch any of its satellites into space. Back in April Amazon confirmed it had signed an agreement with rocket operator United Launch Alliance (ULA) for nine launches, but it did not provide a timeline for when these launches would occur, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/19/amazon-signs-ula-rockets-to-launch-bezos-kuiper-internet-satellites.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; reported at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOoKQQ"&gt;Amazon is one of a handful of tech companies attempting to use satellites to offer internet connectivity in parts of the world where it would be prohibitively expensive to install fixed infrastructure. SpaceX is perhaps the most well known, and eventually plans to launch nearly 12,000 satellites into orbit. It’s already offering the Starlink service as a beta to a limited number of users, although performance from the roughly 1,3000 satellites already in orbit has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;inconsistent so far&lt;/a&gt;. OneWeb is another company making investments in the area, but ran into financial difficulties last year when it was forced to file for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/28/21189404/oneweb-chapter-11-bankruptcy-space"&gt;bankruptcy protection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Loki finale confirms second season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lqciE4UxYrom66WSL81_YDmWy24=/234x0:1038x536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69579615/loki_season2.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DqGONY"&gt;Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;TV show is getting a second season, according to a scene appended to the sixth and final episode of its first season. The confirmation, first &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/streaming/global/loki-season-2-marvel-1235019442/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; comes mid-way through the episode’s credits at the 42 minute and 48 second mark, when a stamp appears on screen which simply reads “Loki will return in season 2.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4qpQx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; is the third Marvel show to have premiered on Disney Plus, and the first to have had a second season officially confirmed. &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;star Elizabeth Olsen has confirmed that the show, which premiered in January this year, &lt;a href="https://ew.com/tv/elizabeth-olsen-says-wandavision-definitely-not-getting-a-season-2/"&gt;isn’t due to receive a second season&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile it’s currently unclear whether &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier &lt;/em&gt;will return for a second season, especially given the show leads neatly into the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22400190/captain-america-4-falcon-winter-solider-creator-malcolm-spellman-report"&gt;upcoming fourth Captain America movie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sjdTD"&gt;It’s currently unclear when the second season of &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;will release, but &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;notes that the last episode of its first season leads into the upcoming Marvel film &lt;em&gt;Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;, which is due to release March 2022. &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; season 2 joins a host of other Marvel shows announced for Disney Plus including &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;She Hulk &lt;/em&gt;and an untitled series focused around Wakanda from the &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Democrats have a new plan to legalize marijuana federally</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hoVZTa_NOGcIYINlsCljA1Yjmmk=/0x0:5079x3386/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69579598/1041897598.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by: BSIP/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1kAAwV"&gt;On Wednesday, Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Ron Wyden (D-OR) released a discussion draft of legislation that proposes sweeping reform to marijuana policy in the US. The Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act would decriminalize marijuana federally, expunge federal non-violent cannabis convictions (and encourage states to do the same), and create “new grant programs to fund nonprofits that provide services to those adversely impacted by the War on Drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNAmjv"&gt;In the introduction to the 30-page draft legislation, the senators note that adult use of cannabis is already legal in 18 states, Washington D.C., the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam. Medicinal marijuana is even more widespread, legal in 37 states, Puerto Rico, D.C., Guam, and the US Virgin Islands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EbtUo7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;”a dynamic shift in public opinion and support”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a5RZmN"&gt;“These changes represent a dynamic shift in public opinion and support across the political spectrum,” the statement notes. “State-compliant cannabis businesses will finally be treated like other businesses and allowed access to essential financial services, like bank accounts and loans. Medical research will no longer be stifled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfChwJ"&gt;Despite recent state actions, marijuana remains illegal at the federal level and subject to prosecution by federal agencies even in states where cannabis use is permitted. In practice, those prosecutions have been limited, but the risk of federal action has meant that marijuana businesses have limited options when it came to banking and many non-recreational uses of the plant have been stifled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlYpJD"&gt;The ambiguous legal status of marijuana in the US has also heightened racial inequalities in the justice system. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/criminal-law-reform/a-tale-of-two-countries-racially-targeted-arrests-in-the-era-of-marijuana-reform/"&gt;2020 analysis by the American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt;, Black Americans were more than three times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession as white Americans. An &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/dc-marijuana-arrest-legal/2020/09/15/65c20348-d01b-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.html"&gt;analysis by the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year found that between 2015 and 2019, Black people accounted for 89 percent of the 3,631 marijuana arrests in Washington DC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjpAox"&gt;The proposed legislation addresses this directly with a number of restorative measures directed towards communities who suffered disproportionately from marijuana prohibitions. The proposal would expunge federal non-violent marijuana convictions and allow individuals currently serving time to petition for resentencing. The legislation would also create an ongoing fund directing revenue generated from federal cannabis taxes to “reinvest in the communities most impacted by the failed War on Drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWirat"&gt;In addition, the proposed legislation would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="36Wo1M"&gt;establish a minimum age of 21 for cannabis retail sales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qXIOAD"&gt;conduct an evaluation of the societal impact of legalization by states with adult use of cannabis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="b0GM6h"&gt;introduce three grant programs to create opportunity for those harmed by the War on Drugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="T0Yize"&gt;expunge non-violent federal marijuana arrests and conviction, and encourage states to do the same. Those serving time in federal prison for non-violent marijuana crimes would be able to petition a court for resentencing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6ASNKR"&gt;provide funding to eligible states and localities for loan programs for small cannabis businesses owned by “socially and economically disadvantaged individuals”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cqT9an"&gt;impose an excise tax on cannabis products similar to those on alcohol and tobacco&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="gZaTmw"&gt;The legislation would also transfer jurisdiction over cannabis regulation from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) and Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). The FDA would have authority over manufacture and marketing of cannabis products, and the TTB would have regulatory authority over taxation of cannabis. And revenue generated by federal taxes would support restorative justice and public health and safety research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIDRFJ"&gt;The bill stops short of mandating legal status for cannabis across the United States. Under the proposed rule, state and local governments and Indian tribes would still be able to adopt and enforce rules and regulations over cannabis more stringent than the FDA requirements. The legislation would create a Cannabis Products Regulatory Advisory Committee, which the FDA would “convene and consult with before promulgating regulations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pw10Mm"&gt;The bill has not been formally introduced to Congress, and a final legislative draft is not expected until later this year. As described in the summary, the existing proposal is simply a discussion draft, “meant to spur a robust discussion among stakeholders” as the three sponsoring Senators finalize their proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ueyOZ"&gt;Still, the effort arrives at a moment of unique momentum for marijuana reform in the US. Voters approved new cannabis laws in four states in the November 2020 elections, and Democrats in the House &lt;a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2020/12/04/house-poised-to-vote-to-decriminalize-marijuana/"&gt;passed the MORE act in December&lt;/a&gt; which would have decriminalized cannabis and expunged criminal records of those convicted of marijuana-related crimes. President Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22243311/democrats-biden-marijuana-policy-reschedule-drug"&gt;said during his campaign&lt;/a&gt; that he would seek to “reschedule cannabis as a Schedule II drug so researchers can study its positive and negative impacts,” although Biden’s Justice Department has been slow to take action on the pledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdsgFD"&gt;Concerned stakeholders are encouraged to submit comments to the Senate Finance Committee by September, using the email address &lt;a href="mailto:Cannabis_Reform@finance.senate.gov"&gt;Cannabis_Reform@finance.senate.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Retail stores are packed with unchecked facial recognition, civil rights organizations say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_NeFN0pdTvkvxwKZXa2ms2ANlg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69579594/acastro_210512_1777_deepfake_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FQXGSy"&gt;More than 35 organizations are demanding top US retailers cease using facial recognition to identify shoppers and employees in their stores, which companies have used to deter theft and identify shoplifters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7yrN9"&gt;The campaign is aptly named Ban Facial Recognition in Stores, and has &lt;a href="https://www.banfacialrecognition.com/stores/"&gt;identified stores&lt;/a&gt; that have committed to not using facial recognition, like Walmart, Home Depot, and Target. It is now pressuring companies currently using the technology, or those who might use it in the future. Some companies that are currently using the technology, according to the website, include Apple, Lowe’s, Albertsons, Macy’s, and Ace Hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pse3ix"&gt;Companies that might use it in the future include McDonalds, Walgreens, and 7-Eleven. A &lt;a href="https://www.banfacialrecognition.com/stores/"&gt;full list&lt;/a&gt; can be found on the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrNHbh"&gt;Privacy non-profit Fight for the Future organized the campaign last month as part of its larger Ban Facial Recognition project, and but has now garnered support from civil rights organizations like Mijente, Public Citizen, and Data for Black Lives, as well as others like the Consumer Federation of America and the Tor Project. Notably, facial recognition company &lt;a href="https://www.kairos.com/"&gt;Kairos&lt;/a&gt;, which touts itself as an ethical vendor of the tech, has also signed onto the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOJjZ7"&gt; Tawana Petty, the national organizing director at Data for Black Lives, explains in the campaign’s press release that Detroit has implemented Project Green Light, which places surveillance cameras with facial recognition in more than 700 businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9tUhA"&gt;“These cameras using facial recognition are monitored at real-time crime centers, police precincts, and on officers’ mobile devices 24/7,” she said. “It’s difficult to explain the psychological toll it takes on a community, knowing that your every move is being monitored by a racially biased algorithm with the power to yank your freedom away from you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHzNuQ"&gt;Retailers have used invasive technologies like products that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/14/opinion/bluetooth-wireless-tracking-privacy.html"&gt;ping your phone’s Bluetooth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.retaildive.com/spons/wi-fi-tracking-a-data-gold-mine-or-privacy-nightmare/572937/"&gt;then catalog its unique MAC address&lt;/a&gt;, but AI-powered upgrades to video surveillance systems have allowed features like facial recognition to be more accessible than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jBLam"&gt;For instance, Rite-Aid quietly installed facial recognition cameras in hundreds of US stores, mostly in non-white and lower-income neighborhoods, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-riteaid-software/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in July 2020. The cameras scanned shoppers’ faces to try and find people in the store who were previously suspected of criminal activity and then sent alerts to security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="STcx17"&gt;Walmart also reportedly used Clearview AI’s facial recognition more than 300 times, according to &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-fbi-ice-global-law-enforcement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and had &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2015/11/09/wal-mart-facial-recognition/"&gt;previously used&lt;/a&gt; the technology to try and catch shoplifters. Now, it seems to be taking a different approach by using AI to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48718198"&gt;find un-scanned goods&lt;/a&gt; in self-checkout kiosks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUfNoO"&gt;Since these stores are private property, companies are not bound by &lt;a href="https://www.banfacialrecognition.com/map/"&gt;state or local regulations&lt;/a&gt; banning government use of facial recognition which have been the most popular form of regulation. Only Portland, Oregon has &lt;a href="https://www.portland.gov/smart-city-pdx/news/2020/9/9/city-council-approves-ordinances-banning-use-face-recognition"&gt;included private businesses&lt;/a&gt; in a facial recognition ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTiJr9"&gt;Fight for the Future also points out that the coronavirus pandemic has expanded the use of facial recognition-adjacent surveillance in stores, which includes software for customer counting and social distancing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 rumors grow more certain ahead of September launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R_cuz9RQo2n8jjTrZyn1mDknaQU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69579580/akrales_201018_4238_0531.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year’s iPhone 12 Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mUXROz"&gt;Apple’s flagship 2021 iPhones will come in the same sizes as last year’s models, but with a smaller display notch, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/apple-seeks-up-to-20-increase-in-new-iphone-production-for-2021?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This mirrors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21553255/apple-iphone-13-camera-2021-ming-chi-kuo-analyst-prediction"&gt;predictions&lt;/a&gt; from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, this year’s phones will be an iterative upgrade over the iPhone 12 series, and will include incremental improvements to their processors, cameras, and displays when they’re announced in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5vKKZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports that “at least one” of the four new devices will include an LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) display. It’s a technology Apple has previously used with its smartwatches to dynamically adjust their screen refresh rates to conserve battery. That lines up with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;previous prediction from Ming-Chi Kuo&lt;/a&gt;, who said that both Pro iPhones coming this year would include LTPO displays and 120Hz refresh rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4zSF0O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Smaller notches, same screen sizes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bApJhD"&gt;The report also casts doubt on the possibility of seeing an iPhone with an in-display fingerprint sensor this year. Although &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says Apple has tested the technology, it says it’s unlikely to appear in 2021. Way back in 2019, Kuo predicted that Apple’s 2021 iPhone models could be its first to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754520/iphone-in-display-fingerprint-sensor-touch-id-2021-iphones-face-id-biometric-security-rumors"&gt;feature in-display fingerprint sensors&lt;/a&gt;. The phones are also unlikely to include a fingerprint scanner in their power buttons, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307716/apple-lightning-portless-iphone-usb-c-magsafe-charging-kuo-rumor"&gt;Kuo said in March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGI02Y"&gt;Camera upgrades will reportedly include an improved optical zoom for video recording, according to the latest Bloomberg report. Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21553255/apple-iphone-13-camera-2021-ming-chi-kuo-analyst-prediction"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; the ultrawide cameras on both Pro models could also receive a boost this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9WNpe"&gt;One area &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report doesn’t touch on is charging. There have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/5/20997166/apple-iphone-no-ports-2021-oled-rumors-2020-se-kuo-research"&gt;been rumors&lt;/a&gt; that Apple might release an iPhone without any ports in 2021, and rely on MagSafe rather than a typical Lightning port for power. But recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307716/apple-lightning-portless-iphone-usb-c-magsafe-charging-kuo-rumor"&gt;Kuo said&lt;/a&gt; Apple doesn’t think the MagSafe ecosystem is mature enough to act as the sole way of charging the iPhone, suggesting that the Lightning port is here to stay for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlidQu"&gt;Apple is reportedly gearing up for a big iPhone sales cycle. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says it’s ordered up to 90 million units for the initial launch period that extends to the end of 2021, up from a typical order of 75 million seen in recent years. The company appears to be banking on increased demand brought on by more people upgrading to 5G devices, but it may also be set to benefit from sanctions placed on rival Huawei, which was recently forced to delay the launch of its latest flagship. Production of the new iPhones is unlikely to be hit by the global chip shortage because Apple’s size makes it one of chip manufacturer TSMC’s biggest and most important customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdIJ8l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 12 reverse wireless charging can power up Apple’s new MagSafe battery pack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MagSafe Battery Pack" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzSMUwyaiCDk3V0izuImjIEnxnY=/0x0:1340x893/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69578556/iphone_magsafe_packa.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;MagSafe Battery Pack | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WggYsJ"&gt;Apple surprised us Tuesday by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575678/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-iphone-12-pro-mini-max"&gt;simply putting its latest iPhone accessory on sale&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJWY3AM%2FA%2Fmagsafe-battery-pack&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F13%2F22576245%2Fiphone-12-reverse-wireless-charging-magsafe-battery-pack" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99 MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt; isn’t the first power cell we’ve seen that uses Apple’s new magnetic system to connect with the iPhone 12 family (Anker&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297307/anker-magsafe-compatible-battery-pack-apple-iphone"&gt; offers a 5,000mAh pack&lt;/a&gt; with slower 5W charging for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Wireless-Portable-Anker-PowerCore/dp/B08TW7BRTJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$45.99&lt;/a&gt;), but it is the first one from Apple and can charge at up to 15W while it’s plugged in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUqB6d"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/13/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-reverse-charging/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/13/iphone-12-magsafe-battery-pack-tidbits/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; point out a &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212174"&gt;support document&lt;/a&gt; that helps answer a few questions we immediately had about the device, including confirmation that this will unlock &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21537855/iphone-12-mini-pro-max-reverse-wireless-charging-fcc-filings-hidden"&gt;the iPhone 12’s “secret” reverse charging feature&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiPhone%2B12%2Band%2B12%2BPro%2BTeardown%2F137669%3Fvgo_ee%3D3bheJeT%2FPRsWKKl8dfWh0vlMy%2BOWWuyaZunZiCXh6gI%3D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F13%2F22576245%2Fiphone-12-reverse-wireless-charging-magsafe-battery-pack" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; didn’t spot any &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21532190/iphone-12-pro-ifixit-teardown-video"&gt;additional hardware&lt;/a&gt; to add wireless charging, FCC filings revealed the company’s plan to let you charge accessories while the iPhone 12 is plugged in and charging, complete with diagrams that now look very familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pmUNepKz-9I_dELMTRPWlEQhJ_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716068/image__4_.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KUpxMe"&gt;As Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212174"&gt;support page&lt;/a&gt; explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="XPnozF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charge your MagSafe Battery Pack and your iPhone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASsSk1"&gt;If both your iPhone and MagSafe Battery Pack need to be charged, you can charge them at the same time. Attach your MagSafe Battery Pack to your iPhone and then plug the MagSafe Battery Pack into a power adapter. Using a 20W or higher power adapter, the MagSafe Battery Pack can charge your iPhone with up to 15W of charging power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8qV6R"&gt;You can also charge both if you attach your MagSafe Battery Pack to your iPhone, then plug your iPhone into a power source. You might want to charge this way if you need to connect your iPhone to another device while charging, like if you’re using wired CarPlay or transferring photos to a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhXYqN"&gt;If you charge your iPhone and MagSafe Battery Pack at the same time, your iPhone might charge to 80% or higher before your MagSafe Battery Pack begins charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oy1UqO"&gt;Notably, reverse charging only works (so far) with this accessory, after an upcoming software update and only while the iPhone 12 is plugged in. Google’s Pixel 5 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/11/3/21548318/google-pixel-5-wireless-charging-pad-qi-automatic-battery-share"&gt;can operate as a Qi pad while plugged in&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18245446/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-android-phone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Samsung devices&lt;/a&gt; have been charging anything you slap against them for a couple of years, but now Apple users can enjoy a similar feature. Will this newfound ability also charge your AirPods, Apple Watch, or anything else in the future? Apple isn’t saying (yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wji9Nr"&gt;Also, in case you missed it, one image of the battery pack revealed its capacity specs: 1460mAh, 7.62V, 11.13Wh. We’ll need to do some testing to figure out exactly how much charging it can add in real life, but it’s worth remembering that in this case, watt-hours of charging is the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/watts-in-a-name-why-were-using-watt-hours-to-compare-batteries/"&gt;more important figure to focus on&lt;/a&gt;, as seen with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/16/18185283/apple-iphone-battery-case-size"&gt;Apple’s old non-magnetic battery cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Space startup Momentus charged by SEC with misleading investors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-STOCKS-POLITICS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SAEdlPopFtGUPep2f1LdXC_9hcY=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69578469/1230842615.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hQFpDb"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-124"&gt;charged&lt;/a&gt; embattled space infrastructure startup Momentus Space and its founder, Mikhail Kokorich, with allegedly misleading investors about its propulsion technology and downplaying regulators’ national security concerns associated with Kokorich, who is Russian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RITKLp"&gt;The SEC also charged the company, Stable Road Acquisition Corp, that was going to acquire Momentus as part of a deal to take the startup public (and sidestep the IPO process). Stable Road Acquisition Corp is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;a SPAC&lt;/a&gt;, a company that exists only to buy another company; the CEO of Stable Road, Brian Kabot, and its sponsor SRC-NI have also been charged by the SEC. Everyone except Kokorich has settled the charges with the SEC and paid a fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ufpuRn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This case illustrates risks inherent to SPAC transactions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SssIcY"&gt;Momentus, founded in 2017, aims to provide a “last-mile” transportation service for satellites already in orbit using a unique water-based propulsion system to drag satellites into other orbits. According to the SEC, Momentus wrongly told investors it had “successfully tested” its technology in space; in reality, the company had tested its tech in space once, and failed. Stable Road never reviewed the results of this test, according to the SEC, even though it claimed it had done “extensive due diligence.” Additionally, during that process, it didn’t get the documents needed to assess whether Kokorich was a national security risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nR4jTC"&gt;“This case illustrates risks inherent to SPAC transactions, as those who stand to earn significant profits from a SPAC merger may conduct inadequate due diligence and mislead investors,” SEC chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v5Ytr4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Momentus paid $7 million to settle, Stable Road paid $1 million&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ehs3py"&gt;Momentus paid $7 million to settle; Stable Road paid $1 million, and Kabot paid $40,000. If its proposed SPAC merger closes — expected in August, months later than its initial target for early 2021 — the SEC will mandate “tailored investor protection undertakings, and the SPAC sponsor’s forfeiture of founder’s shares,” the SEC statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTRHle"&gt;US authorities have been concerned that Momentus’ technology could end up in the hands of foreign adversaries, which triggered a lengthy investigation and delayed its plan to go public, because Kokrich is Russian. Kokorich &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1962211/momentus-ceo-mikhail-kokorich-resigns-before-spac-debut/"&gt;resigned&lt;/a&gt; as CEO in January to sever the national security concerns from Momentus. The company’s projected value was cut in half, from $1.1 billion to just $566.6 million, according to &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001781162/000121390021034741/fs42021a3_stableroadacq.htm"&gt;a revised amended registration statement&lt;/a&gt; Stable Road filed with the SEC last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ItxYn"&gt;Stable Road’s &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001781162/000121390021034741/fs42021a3_stableroadacq.htm"&gt;June filing&lt;/a&gt;, in which it slashed Momentus’ value, noted the company’s technology was still nascent, and that “the technology underlying its anticipated service offerings (including its water plasma propulsion technology) is still in the process of being developed and has not been fully tested or validated in space.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is capping Meet’s formerly unlimited group video calls to an hour for free accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/66C9_sYdpJ3fjTaNDILcpt3z5cQ=/63x0:1938x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69578363/Google_Meet_1.max_2000x2000.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cn0avv"&gt;Google has brought an end to its effectively “unlimited” group video calls in Meet for free Gmail accounts, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/7317473?hl=en#zippy=%2Cparticipant-limits%2Cmeeting-length-limits"&gt;according to support pages&lt;/a&gt; spotted by &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/12/google-meet-group-limit/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Now users with free accounts logging on to Meet will have group calls capped at an hour rather than the previous 24-hour meeting duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HoFSlY"&gt;Google’s unlimited group meeting offer was helpful because so many traditionally in-person functions moved online due to COVID-19. Not having to worry about a call cutting out or creating new meeting links meant you could leave your video call on during long family get-togethers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jPw8I0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One-on-one calls are still unlimited&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S7vUYF"&gt;Meet was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21240509/google-meet-video-conferencing-free-gmail"&gt;opened up to non-enterprise users in April&lt;/a&gt; last year to better compete with Zoom, and at the time Google promised to keep unlimited meetings in place &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/26/21457293/google-meet-limit-meeting-free-plans-september-zoom"&gt;until September 30th, 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The company later extended that window into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494189/google-meet-limit-calls-minutes-march-2021"&gt;March of 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and then again &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359774/google-meet-unlimited-calls-free-users-june-30-60-minute-limit"&gt;until the end of June&lt;/a&gt;. Google still allows one-on-one calls to last as long as you need, but heading into the second pandemic summer, longer group calls will now cost extra — like a currently $7.99 per month subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575523/google-workspace-tier-us-brazil-canada-japan-mexico"&gt;Google’s Workspace Individual tier&lt;/a&gt; ($9.99 a month after January 2022).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfnjZW"&gt;Like Google, Zoom’s one-on-one calls are unlimited and free, but group calls have been handled differently. Zoom has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22176502/zoom-lifting-40-minute-meeting-limit-holidays-free-hanukkah-christmas-eve-new-years-kwanzaa"&gt;periodically expanded beyond its 40 minute meeting limit&lt;/a&gt; during specific holidays like Christmas, Hanukkah, and New Year’s Eve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHieWB"&gt;Meet, Zoom, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439924/microsoft-teams-personal-version-launch-available-download"&gt;Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt; all started out as business communications products that were adopted by non-business users in the early days of the pandemic. Now that some of the freebies are going away, it’ll be interesting to see which services people stick with.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz’s new Roadster has a flippy touchscreen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOwsfNijIe-diDHbrCQkkvFdGxo=/65x0:575x340/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69578271/mercedes_screen.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JvvaH4"&gt;Large touchscreens are commonplace in new cars these days, and the bigger these rectangular screens get, the fewer things you can do with the hardware to really differentiate from the competition. Perhaps that’s why, in the new 2022 AMG SL Roadster, Mercedes-Benz is taking the screen out of the dashboard, anchoring it to the center console, and letting it electronically flip up and down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHKUzn"&gt;That’s right, Mercedes-Benz’s newest car has a flippy screen. The company said it designed the 11.9-inch portrait touchscreen this way in order to help fight glare — the AMG SL Roadster is a convertible, after all — but it’s also clearly a flashy parlor trick that seems to say, “Hey, we did something different from Tesla.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wB9RXf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10650931"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="alx7Ni"&gt;The new AMG SL Roadster also has a digital instrument cluster that’s a bit different from the rest. The 12.3-inch screen behind the steering wheel is tucked away in a “visor” that Mercedes-Benz says is “aviation-inspired.” Basically it’s a screen embedded even &lt;em&gt;deeper&lt;/em&gt; into the dashboard than normal which — of course — helps fight glare. (Something tells me there was a common theme in the most recent customer feedback sessions...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahGmJ0"&gt;The move to bigger screens in cars has put a big emphasis on software, which is why automakers from Polestar to Ford are turning to tech giants like Google for help. But similar to the current state of the smartphone market, the hardware has really converged. That’s paved the way for funky new ideas to stand out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mga9u9"&gt;Much like, say, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price"&gt;Samsung’s folding phones&lt;/a&gt;, this articulating screen feels more like an idea thrown at a wall than something that will actually become desirable (I’m personally dying to know how well it stands up to being poked and prodded — it presumably won’t wobble, but you never know). But it’s an interesting risk for Mercedes-Benz to take nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook groups can now designate Group Experts</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TA3JHY"&gt;Facebook is introducing a new feature called “Group Experts” today, which will allow admins to designate which members are highly knowledgeable about the group’s topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9SqGE"&gt;Beyond the bragging rights, Group Experts will have a badge next to their name emblazoned with the proof of their elevated status. This badge will show up on posts, comments, and in the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/community/whats-new/introducing-qa-engage-community/"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QBIBFin5oH25zU2wawwz6npDFew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716164/fb_expertspiac.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TfyqeD"&gt;Group Experts will be selected by group administrators, and experts will only be given this extraordinary power once they have accepted the nomination. Admins can revoke the expert status, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOf2zm"&gt;Facebook is testing ways to make it easier for admins to find these experts, by prompting specific users, currently in the gaming and fitness spaces, to add which games or activities they’re knowledgeable about. Group admins can search these topics to find their new Group Experts. This tactic works as a growth driver for groups as well, since the new experts will be able to invite followers who have recently interacted with their main page to join the group too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HH1adTSVlq4NXYjPw5ZwSYtggTo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22715780/CD21_430_NRP_New_Tools_to_Support_Experts_Badge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YJyeGM"&gt;However, if a group nominates an untrustworthy expert or if that group is willfully engaged in posting misinformation, it will exclusively be up to the admins to remove them from their expert status. For instance, groups that push anti-vax agendas would likely not nominate conventional doctors or public health officials as experts. So while the “expert” tag designates the trust of admins, it doesn’t objectively qualify someone as a real expert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ph35DN"&gt;When asked about additional moderation tools to ensure Group Experts provide accurate information, a Facebook spokesperson listed the established ways the company deals with misinformation on the platform, like &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking/how-it-works"&gt;third-party fact checkers&lt;/a&gt; and reducing distribution for content flagged as misleading. They added that members can always report content to group admins.&lt;/p&gt;
