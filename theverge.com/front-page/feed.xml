    <title>YouTube Kids’ new monetization policy could defund consumeristic videos</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P85I9Q"&gt;YouTube is making it harder for kids’ videos that it deems “low quality” to qualify for monetization (via &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-low-quality-demonetization-kids-video-194733880.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The platform outlined its updated policies &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/our-responsibility-approach-protecting-kids-and-families-youtube/"&gt;in a post on the YouTube Blog&lt;/a&gt;, noting that channels with “made for kids” content will need to abide by &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392#kids-quality&amp;amp;zippy=%2Cquality-principles-for-kids-and-family-content"&gt;a stricter set of guidelines&lt;/a&gt; if they want to stay in the YouTube Partnership Program (YPP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rqd41d"&gt;Its policies are meant to discourage kids’ content creators from pushing out videos that it describes as “heavily commercial or promotional” or if it encourages “negative behavior or attitudes.” If a channel violates these guidelines, YouTube may suspend them from YPP. Meanwhile, any individual videos that break the rules will lose advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KHMgv1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If a channel is found to have a strong focus on low-quality ‘made for kids’ content, it may be suspended from the YouTube Partner Program”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HMtb7N"&gt;YouTube’s new guidelines could impact a number of channels, including one of the biggest kids’ channels on YouTube: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChGJGhZ9SOOHvBB0Y4DOO_w"&gt;Ryan’s World&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14031288/ryan-toys-review-biggest-youngest-youtube-star-millions"&gt;Ryan Kaji is a 10-year-old YouTuber&lt;/a&gt; whose videos garner millions of views. At this time of writing, his channel currently has 30.8 million subscribers. Kaji’s massive popularity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575169/youtube-ryan-world-amazon-show-animated-nickelodeon-ott-streaming"&gt;has landed him a show on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22152447/ryans-world-roblox-level-youtube-ryan-kaji"&gt;a virtual world on Roblox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5LcWm"&gt;A large number of Kaji’s videos revolve around unboxing toys, as well as showing off toys that Kaji has helped create. It’s definitely what one would describe as “consumeristic” — which is what YouTube says it’s trying to cut down on. YouTube says that it has “reached out to potentially impacted creators” to help them prepare before the policies go into effect in November. If Ryan’s World wants to remain one of the most popular YouTube channels for kids, it may need to make major adjustments to the kind of content it puts out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gFsuai"&gt;The most recent major change to kid-focused content took place in early 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21051465/youtube-coppa-children-content-gaming-toys-monetization-ads"&gt;when YouTube banned targeted advertising, comments, and some community features&lt;/a&gt; for kids’ videos. Just this February, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298179/youtube-supervised-experiences-content-levels-children-parents"&gt;YouTube rolled out “supervised experiences”&lt;/a&gt; to help parents gain more control of what their older children watch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Supernatural, the VR workout app, adds boxing for more variety</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gckBdmcxmj74pIb1iFLy8kaAaas=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70046830/Boxing_MR.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;You will punch your way to a much higher heart rate. | Supernatural&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bCt7cJ"&gt;Supernatural, the &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;-like VR app for the Oculus Quest and Quest 2 that gets you to work up a sweat by beating targets with virtual bats, has added another way to wreck a target: your fists. Boxing is the latest workout introduced on Supernatural and like the original bat-oriented “Flow” workout, it works up a sweat while being fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJeiqr"&gt;Supernatural Flow is sort of like &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt; crossed with high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Each workout can last from seven minutes to an hour, and there’s an enthusiastic coach shouting encouragements in your ear and guiding you through the session as you dance, lunge, squat, and murder targets with your VR bats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uD2SUm"&gt;The problem with Supernatural, at least for me, is that you can plateau. The workout, like HIIT, is hard on the knees and it's easy to get stuck doing workouts that get the heart rate up but don’t actually build your cardio health or muscle. I started cycling and lifting weights to push myself more and give my knees a rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UZnf3c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Is VR the next frontier in fitness?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22379859/vr-virtual-reality-fitness-work-out-supernatural-chris-milk-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Fqc5R4"&gt;Crucially, neither of those things were happening in the Supernatural app. Since Supernatural launched in April 2020, it’s added two additional workouts — Guided Meditation and Recover (stretching) — but they felt less like a reason to strap on the headset and dive in than the original Flow workout. Boxing, which launches today, is the third new workout and the first intended to get the heart pumping like the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hix5T5"&gt;VR boxing to get buff isn’t new. &lt;em&gt;Thrill of the Fight&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Knockout League&lt;/em&gt; on Oculus Quest both have enthusiastic fans who use them for cardio. But like &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber,&lt;/em&gt; those are games being used for working out. Boxing in Supernatural is very much a workout first. Black and white targets fly at your face and you’re meant to hit black targets with your left hand and white ones with your right. The targets look different depending on if you’re supposed to jab, uppercut, or toss a hook at them. Glowing bars twirl toward your face to force you to tilt left or right or do a full bob and weave to avoid them. The coach has you stretch for about thirty seconds to a minute both before and after the core workout. They also tell you when to change up your feet position to ensure you’re working out your left and right sides equally, and they tell you when to get ready to block a blow with both hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w5Urgi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mLBQWsX5bk4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aZgWx5"&gt;The workouts available before launch were limited to just 13 minutes max. After that first one, I told my co-workers it had given me a good sweat but hadn’t done much else due to how short the workout was. Then I woke up the next morning and my arms and shoulders called me an idiot. Heart rate-wise, the average beats per minute in the boxing workout were about 10bpm higher than in the regular Supernatural workout — and my knees didn’t get as angry with me. I could definitely see using this regularly as a warm-up before weight training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fkge4s"&gt;But I don’t know if this would be a good supplement for people who regularly box to keep fit. When I did a slower-paced low-intensity workout, I had no problem keeping great boxing form, but faster-paced workouts absolutely wrecked it. I went from feeling like I knew how to throw a punch to flailing like I was in a fight with my brother when I was 10. I didn’t miss a lot of targets, but I’m also positive my punches would have landed on a heavy bag like the gentle flutter of a butterfly wing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKIsJh"&gt;Thankfully, I have no interest in going to a boxing gym — heck, I don’t really want to go to a regular gym either. And Supernatural, despite its inability to stop bad boxing habits, gives me the feeling of a gym without all the smells and potential for COVID-19 exposure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVovFN"&gt;Boxing is available on Supernatural starting today. Supernatural is available for a free, month-long trial. After that, you’ll either need to pay $18.99 a month or $179 a year to get access to new workouts, which are available daily.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>General Motors wants to help build 40,000 electric vehicle chargers in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qnIWmSwfK2BEUd_A9SAFyYk3ZzQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70046707/ahawkins_20210503_4551_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eciGy2"&gt;General Motors will work with its network of dealers to help spur the installation of 40,000 electric vehicle chargers in the US, the company announced today. It will also begin selling its own “Ultium” branded Level 2 chargers for home or business uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQSoSt"&gt;GM said that it hopes the new project will spur the creation of EV charging stations in urban and rural underserved areas. The automaker will give each of its dealers “up to 10 Ultium Level 2 destination charging stations” to install throughout their communities, but the automaker does not plan on paying for all 40,000 chargers. Rather, it will work with its dealers and community leaders to find the appropriate financing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oAzBs"&gt;Unlike Tesla or Volkswagen, GM does not own its own EV charging network. Owners of GM’s electric vehicles must instead rely on a patchwork of third-party chargers, each with their own software and membership requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qfi44Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The automaker will give each of its dealers up to 10 EV chargers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lGV8ii"&gt;The dealer-community project, which kicks off in 2022, is part of GM’s $750 million commitment to EV charging infrastructure, which it announced during its recent Investor’s Day event. While it’s not the same kind of financial commitment as Tesla or Volkswagen —both of which have spent billions of dollars to create a nationwide network of public EV chargers — it does signal that GM is thinking holistically about EV ownership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeDl7x"&gt;“When you think about the hill that we have to climb for customers to access charging in all communities, not just the ones that have been early adopters, we need a lot,” said Alex Keros, lead architect of EV infrastructure at GM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="viljQc"&gt;There are approximately 41,000 public charging stations in the United States, with more than 100,000 outlets. But finding one that actually works or isn’t locked inside a gated parking garage can be a bit of a scavenger hunt. The charging experience in the US is almost &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419150/ev-charging-us-joe-biden-infrastructure-plan"&gt;comically fragmented&lt;/a&gt;, especially for non-Tesla owners. While Tesla’s Supercharger network has been praised for its seamless user experience and fast charging ability, the opposite appears to be true for pretty much everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CB0Lqk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"EV charging in the US is broken — can Joe Biden fix it?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22419150/ev-charging-us-joe-biden-infrastructure-plan"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wCA9hE"&gt;Level 2 chargers use a 240-volt connection and can add between 12 and 37 miles of range per hour, &lt;a href="https://www.chargepoint.com/resources/how-choose-home-ev-charger/"&gt;according to ChargePoint&lt;/a&gt;. Installation of a Level 2 charger can cost upwards of several thousand dollars, including labor. Keros said the company will help GM dealers and local partners find the right financing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R60HaR"&gt;“In the dealer communities, we envision that it would be a collaboration, mostly between the dealer and the community partners that we would be working with,” he said. “But we also we recognize there’s a lot of variables. So we will work with the dealers and the community members to make sure, for example, if there’s grants or other types of things, that we’re trying to be as helpful as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcfrZr"&gt;GM isn’t planning on installing any DC Fast Chargers, which charge an EV’s battery much faster than a Level 2 charger but also wears the battery down faster too. The automaker has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349614/general-motors-evgo-fast-charging-network-investment"&gt;a partnership with charging company EVgo&lt;/a&gt; to make its DCFC stations available to GM customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKXt78"&gt;President Joe Biden recently introduced a $2 trillion infrastructure plan, &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure/"&gt;$174 billion of which is earmarked for electric cars&lt;/a&gt;. As part of that plan, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;Biden wants to build 500,000 new EV chargers by 2030&lt;/a&gt; — 11 times the current number of stations. That number is likely to be reduced as the legislation is being negotiated in Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ktuAeqjbd4I3BEA4zY9TPS5w3dg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22955223/Ultium_Standard_Wall_Mounted_Charger_Wlogo1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="okhMm4"&gt;GM recently announced a new EV charging brand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407789/gm-ev-charging-general-motors-ultium-charge-360"&gt;Ultium Charge 360&lt;/a&gt;, which will integrate GM’s own vehicle apps and software with a variety of third-party charging services, such as Blink, ChargePoint, EVgo, Flo, Greenlots, and SemaConnect. The company will also sell its own Ultium Charge 360-branded Level 2 chargers for home or business, Keros said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouqKnz"&gt;GM will have three different chargers with two distinct power outputs: an 11.5kWh/48-amp smart charger, as well as a premium version with a customizable touchscreen and an embedded camera; and a 19.2kWh/48-amp premium charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sg6Ece"&gt;Each charging unit comes with WiFi and Bluetooth, as well as dynamic load balancing to handle multiple vehicles at once. GM is working with Ctek, a Swedish EV charging company, on the production of the Level 2 chargers. GM did not release pricing information for its Ultium chargers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube gets serious about podcasting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-FFPKhg2jDb_7RWmEJjeom2mmGw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70046638/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9jJYx8"&gt;Hello, hello, and welcome back to the workweek. I hope everyone had a lovely weekend, and shout out to those of you who attended On The Verge. It was so nice to see people IRL and actually meet face to face. I hope we can do it again soon! Anyway, today’s a busy one with a couple scoops and analyses. Off we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bInPpi"&gt;
&lt;p id="wF2z4W"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCOOP: Amazon is building a top-secret live audio app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d80Snq"&gt;Earlier today, I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22508626"&gt;published a story&lt;/a&gt; about Amazon’s work on a live audio app, codenamed Project Mic. The app takes bits from Anchor and bits from Clubhouse — users can host DJ sets, like they would a radio show, and intersperse songs with talk. The idea is to reinvent radio. (I feel like I should have put a trigger warning on that sentence for some of you — sorry!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQUZ4G"&gt;The other highlights from my piece: the app will simultaneously stream content to Twitch, Amazon Music, and Alexa-equipped devices. Amazon is looking to bring A-list talent on board to help launch the app, along with regular people to keep the programming constant, and the app will be interactive, particularly through Alexa. The app will also be optimized for the car, whatever that means. Amazon didn’t comment on my story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVnylN"&gt;I’m mostly thinking about this in relation to the flurry of tech companies now creating and distributing radio station-like content — Apple Music, Sonos, Spotify, and, soon, Amazon. Apple and Spotify, in particular, are thinking about how their platforms can dominate the car either through car maker partnerships or hardware, and so is Amazon, which will be critical if they want to eventually usurp radio. I own a 2009 Honda Fit with an aux cable, and personally, the ease of turning on the radio is something I’d struggle to give up. I currently can listen through Spotify or any of these other apps, but instead, pressing the power button and clicking through my presets is my default. That’s hard behavior to change! We’ll see if Amazon or anyone else can pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pHya3W"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCOOP: YouTube finally has someone leading podcasting efforts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dg64rY"&gt;Another one exclusively for you &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt; readers: Google has hired someone to lead its podcasting efforts. A company spokesperson confirms to me that Kai Chuk has been hired to “manage the large volume of existing podcasts and relationships across the YouTube platform.” I’ve heard Chuk’s title is Podcast Lead, but Google did not respond to my request for confirmation on that. Per Chuk’s LinkedIn, he’s been at YouTube for nearly 10 years, focusing mostly on media partnerships, so I can see why the podcasting role was a fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzwXlk"&gt;We here at &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt; have been following YouTube’s move into podcasting, or at least it’s angling to take on a stronger role in the industry.&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-05/youtube-looks-to-hire-its-first-executive-focused-on-podcasts?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; the YouTube team was looking to hire a podcast executive, which it seems is Chuk’s role, while the YouTube Music app in Canada is going to support background music listening for free users. The pieces are lining up, and we’ll presumably be hearing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZX4aDR"&gt;The thing I don’t fully understand about YouTube’s possible podcast plans is what exactly will be changed or managed — podcasters already upload and host videos on Google’s servers, and Google monetizes those videos for them based on user data. Yes, YouTube could also start hosting audio and doing different ad things there, but I once again have to ask whether podcasters want to either fully migrate hosting providers or start using many at the same time just to take advantage of the platforms. (YouTube also &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/youtube-music-audio-ads/"&gt;already sells&lt;/a&gt; audio advertising for when listeners are playing videos in the background.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pg03AO"&gt;As for the listeners themselves, in 2020, Google &lt;a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/video/music-industry-changes/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; 15 percent of people listening to music on the platform did so with it on in the background, so I wonder how greatly that percentage might increase when YouTube starts allowing background listening for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPhjSh"&gt;Speaking of ads, we’ve got some deals to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hucIzC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rG6t0Q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SiriusXM will be the exclusive ad seller for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crime Junkie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and Audiochuck&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tO8TYZ"&gt;This is just breaking now: SiriusXM is partnering with Audiochuck, Ashley Flowers’ podcast company and maker of &lt;em&gt;Crime Junkie&lt;/em&gt;, as its exclusive global ad seller. Along with that, Audiochuck and Sirius will coordinate on developing new programming. The press release notes that all programming will continue to be widely available and not exclusive to any Sirius-owned property. (UTA brokered the deal, representing Flowers and Audiochuck.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntQutX"&gt;“With three audio platforms as marketing vehicles that can reach the largest and most diverse audiences possible, [Audiochuck] can serve their most loyal fans and create new ones,” says Scott Greenstein, president and chief content officer at SiriusXM, in the release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKOvuL"&gt;I’m flagging that quote because he notes marketing as an apparent selling point for Flowers’ decision to partner — Sirius owns its satellite radio business, of course, as well as Stitcher and Pandora, where Audiochuck shows will presumably get some love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOu6wR"&gt;Audiochuck &lt;a href="https://adlarge.com/post/press-adlarge-extends-partnership-with-top-podcast-crime-junkie-and-audiochuck-network"&gt;previously partnered&lt;/a&gt; with Cabana and the team at AdLarge Media, which, notably, doesn’t own a podcast player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHgL14"&gt;On to the next one...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3KlzX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acast and BBC re-up their monetization deal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWTKcS"&gt;Acast and the BBC &lt;a href="https://investors.acast.com/press-releases/acast-and-bbc-renew-international-podcast-deal"&gt;are renewing&lt;/a&gt; a deal that gives Acast the exclusive rights to sell ads for BBC shows outside the UK. So the BBC has the UK covered, but everywhere else is fair game for Acast for the next three years. This seems convenient enough — the BBC doesn’t have to worry about staffing up and trying to sell ads for the global market but still benefits from its massive catalog and name recognition. The fight for ad dollars keeps on marching on...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cn5EbW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Kroger grocery store data is helping launch a programmatic ad marketplace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jAuEJG"&gt;This is arguably not podcast- or audio-related, at least not yet, but I had to share because, geez, grocery stores vacuuming up all the data to launch an ad network makes me sad! Last week, Kroger &lt;a href="https://go.krogerprecisionmarketing.com/privatemarketplace?utm_source=8451.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=pressrelease&amp;amp;utm_term=privatemarketplace&amp;amp;utm_content=pmplaunch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=privatemarketplace"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its plan to launch a private programmatic ad marketplace where brands can buy ads and target them to consumers based on their purchasing habits. Kroger collects this info through its loyalty program and says it captures data on 96 percent of sales. Right now, it seems this marketplace is specifically for display advertising, but how long until a tech company tries buying up or using this type of data for podcast advertising? (Ehem, Amazon and Whole Foods.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHNAJs"&gt;Okay, I’ll end this one on a small note...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SoTU5x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clubhouse launches pinned links, hints at monetization features &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlB3VM"&gt;I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/1451971798476673028?s=20"&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; Paul Davison, Clubhouse’s CEO and co-founder, and Maya Watson, Clubhouse’s head of global marketing, over the weekend at the On The Verge event, and they announced a new feature on stage: pinned links. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LbPNsa"&gt;Davison is billing this as a way for creators to monetize — they can now link out to their podcast, book landing page, Patreon, and so on — but it doesn’t yet help Clubhouse generate cash. Davison told me this is why the company raised private money, so they don’t have to worry about it. He also said we’d likely hear more about ways in which the platform itself will monetize, like through subscriptions and ticketed events, in the coming months. Now, for what it’s worth, Twitter already allows people to pin tweets to Spaces, and also, for what it’s worth, OnlyFans links aren’t allowed on Clubhouse. Will this feature move the needle for Clubhouse? I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="MruayH"&gt;
&lt;p id="Dbw1AK"&gt;Okay, we’re in and out today, and I’ll leave you to catch up on the motherload of Facebook Papers content you have yet to read. As always, my DMs and email are open and accepting messages, as is Signal, if you ask nicely. Catch ya Thursday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cETik7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to guarantee the iPhone 13 Pro’s macro mode is on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tL1aGtV29riaCTMbo4h3mOG4H-c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70046601/vpavic_210916_untitled_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A0o0mE"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; have great cameras, some of the best you can buy in a phone. They’ve also got an exclusive new feature Apple never offered before: a macro mode that lets you take extreme close-ups — just two centimeters away! — of intricate things you can barely see with the naked eye. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864666/pro_IMG_022307.jpg"&gt;Your pet’s incredibly fine fur&lt;/a&gt;, the veins of leaves, and the sub-pixels in your computer monitor’s screen are all now within reach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2YHZH"&gt;But Apple doesn’t give you a macro mode &lt;em&gt;button &lt;/em&gt;per se — it’s automatic. When you bring the phone within 10 cm of an object, it automatically switches to the ultrawide lens, which some users found jarring enough that Apple now lets you turn off auto-macro-switching in iOS 15.1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUPRWh"&gt;But if you do that, and then manually switch to the ultrawide lens, you won’t get as close by default. Here’s a full-res example:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F3khy20uVZbOqn02gdw5R1DcbTo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22955490/IMG_E0358.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone 13 Mini screen, shot with the iPhone 13 Pro’s macro mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e8Zy9PyIdAXCsdMEKkYqVXLW7j4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22955489/IMG_E0355.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without the macro mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xNdp4F"&gt;So how do you actually use macro mode?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dNDgsl"&gt;How to use the iPhone 13 Pro’s macro mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3Di0jk"&gt;Again, it’s automatic. You don’t need to look for a button, you just need to get close. Open the camera app and get very, very close to the thing you want to photograph — so close that it gets blurry. Then slowly back away until it looks crisp. If you want to be extra sure, pull back just far enough that the autofocus (yellow square) kicks in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSdbFI"&gt;Hold incredibly still at that distance (two hands are good, braced is better, tripod is probably best!) and snap the shot. If you’re shooting handheld, you may want to take a few more so you can pick the clearest one — at that distance, any amount of motion might result in blur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3656IC"&gt;That’s it! Unless you’ve turned off the phone’s auto-macro mode, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8YXzwa"&gt;How to turn off (and on) the iPhone 13 Pro’s automatic lens swap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2teQaBjs122XDXPidrRti-jFqH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22955484/iphone_13_pro_auto_macro.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n2Q8Ei"&gt;Hate how your iPhone 13 Pro or Pro Max automatically switches away from the (very good) normal lens when you get too close? You can now toggle it on and off as of iOS 15.1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="STiEF6"&gt;Open the &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; app, go to &lt;strong&gt;Camera&lt;/strong&gt;, then scroll all the way to the bottom&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to find &lt;strong&gt;Auto Macro&lt;/strong&gt;. Toggle that off to disable the swap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cmKM4V"&gt;How to manually take macro photos with iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kTRtFP"&gt;Hopefully, Apple will add a manual button soon, the same way you can manually jump to the ultrawide camera by tapping “0.5” or the zoom lens by tapping “3” (unless it’s too dark). Meanwhile, you can still take macro photos with Auto Macro toggled off — they just won’t necessarily be as close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHRKRJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switch to your ultrawide lens&lt;/strong&gt; and follow the same instructions as earlier: get close, back away, hold still. Autofocus will still kick in, just not quite as close as it does with the automatic macro mode.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oP70efVkA506BbQYFwjAAkAa3WU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22955496/IMG_0371.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Again, here’s the ultrawide lens without auto-macro...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-eKwk2s5hxaenXRLGKQD376bRGo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22955497/IMG_0374.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...and here’s how close you get with auto-macro on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x8YPuG"&gt;But you can also trick the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max into giving you nearly as good a result if you just zoom in yourself. Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its auto-macro mode is effectively cropping out 3 megapixels’ worth of the 12-megapixel image, which is then upsampled to 12-megapixels once again, with a little bit of additional processing on top. So if you want to emulate that same jump from a 13mm-equivalent field of view to a 26mm-equivalent field of view, &lt;strong&gt;just hold down on the 0.5x button and drag the zoom wheel to about 0.9x magnification. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0hTIg"&gt;Here are three photos of a bamboo coaster I picked up in Maui with wood-burned letters, shot the closest I possibly could. The first is an auto-macro shot, the second a 0.5x shot that I cropped to roughly 0.9x on my Windows PC, and the third shot at 0.9x magnification on the iPhone itself. They’re almost the same, right? I think the auto-macro looks the sharpest with Apple’s processing on top, but none of them are great and all of them are fine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VeLErtC7kME4Ks5k-PKkOME0I-w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22955973/IMG_0399.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Auto-macro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wj8O61S-m1qD5ykE4TZdg-edWsY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22955974/IMG_0400_crop.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manually cropped on a PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4gKeJnGFHqMmYm7-SAaXnbKow-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22955975/IMG_0402.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shot at 0.9x crop on the iPhone 13 Pro itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="trQIjX"&gt;So now you know. If you take any particularly epic macro shots with a phone, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258"&gt;hit me up on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe brings a simplified Photoshop to the web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/seCPNjktkykmDBmzi9VD63tEO5g=/40x0:1240x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70046433/Photoshop_on_the_web_Edititing.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The beta of Photoshop on the web. | Image: Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dQ8l60"&gt;Adobe is bringing Photoshop and Illustrator to the web, letting you make changes to documents hosted in the cloud without having to download them and open up the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tNNVw6"&gt;It’s a fascinating step forward for these two programs, but it’s also a very small one for now: these are not fully featured versions of Photoshop and Illustrator — or anywhere close to it. You can navigate layers, leave annotations and comments, and make basic edits using tools like the eraser, spot healing brush, and selection lasso. But you’ll still have to open the app for any substantial changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6QXLb"&gt;“We’re not bringing all the features on day one, but we really want to unlock all those basic edits that are just best done now in the browser with whoever you’re working with,” Scott Belsky, Adobe’s chief product officer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22504483"&gt;said on our podcast &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Belsky describes the web version of Photoshop as offering a “light level of editing” that works with “real PSD” files.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A simplified Illustrator interface with tools on the left, an image in the center, and an expanded properties pane on the right. The app is inside a web browser." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eYCVRR4YrGPao7l1IgDTNJi023A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948110/Illustrator_on_the_web_Hero_Image.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Adobe&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adobe Illustrator on the web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ksiYtn"&gt;The features play into one of the big themes of &lt;a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/10/26/photoshop-ships-major-updates-across-desktop-ipad-apps-extends-light-editing-collaboration-features-web-beta.html"&gt;Adobe’s announcements&lt;/a&gt; today: making it easier for people to collaborate across its Creative Cloud services. The goal with Photoshop and Illustrator on the web is to make it easier for people you’re sharing files with for review — a client, an editor, a friend — to work with you on adjustments. Previously, they’d be able to make annotations and comments on the document. But now, if they’re given permission, they’ll also be able to jump in and make some basic changes, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvkjfr"&gt;Adobe is also adding a panel to desktop Photoshop to review comments that people have left. And it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22502564"&gt;adding a new hub on its website&lt;/a&gt; to let teams organize assets and create collaborative mood boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6o7qz"&gt;You’ll have to be a Creative Cloud subscriber to use Photoshop on the web, which will be available as a beta starting today. Illustrator for web is launching as an invite-only beta, &lt;a href="https://pages.adobe.com/creativecloud/en/collaboration/private-beta"&gt;accepting signups starting today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gC2DKU"&gt;A handful of other new features are coming to Photoshop, too. The app’s object selection tool is getting even more powerful, showing exactly what it can automatically highlight as you hover over objects within your scene. There are also new neural filters: a landscape mixer lets you remix your scene with a different setting or season; and new color transfer and harmonization filters let you apply the look of one image or layer to another. Adobe also says it’s improved last year’s Depth Blur filter (basically Photoshop’s version of portrait modes) to create a “more natural blurred background.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fI5G31"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LaAfoT"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP3851352140" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Adobe is adding a collaborative mood board to Creative Cloud</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A web interface with a series of images neatly placed on a gray background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lLLaWsTjiMlfP4i04C5Yn4Zsopc=/82x0:1918x1224/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70046437/media_159b13f6215d3c6ddfb408b50f83ebdc6f78da7a0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Creative Cloud Canvas is Adobe’s answer to services like Miro. | Image: Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cazlab"&gt;Adobe is trying to make Creative Cloud’s website into more of a hub for collaborating across teams. So today, it’s &lt;a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/10/26/creative-cloud-canvas-spaces-ps-ai-in-browser.html"&gt;announcing a few new tools&lt;/a&gt; headed to the platform: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22502166"&gt;basic web-based versions of Photoshop and Illustrator&lt;/a&gt;, a new feature called Canvas that lets you make mood boards, and a feature called Spaces that lets teams arrange and synchronize assets for projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slgOV9"&gt;Canvas is similar to a bunch of tools that designers already use — there’s Miro, PureRef, you could even do something like this in Figma if you wanted to — but it comes with the perk of being integrated with Adobe’s ecosystem. You can pull Cloud documents onto a canvas, and they’ll link back to the original file, letting you open them up to make changes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A web interface with navigation on the left and assets displayed in the main pane. It resembles Google Drive." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xtlo8iaBpxZyHj5XvP14cfSU0nI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945371/media_1f2c99845fc9ac79d5b20a654eb667f70bce06ab9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Adobe&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Creative Cloud Spaces lets users organize shared assets.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EwxHk7"&gt;It also ties into Spaces, which is Adobe’s new interface for organizing files across teams. Creative Cloud’s website already serves as sort of a bare-bones take on Google Drive but for all your cloud PSDs and whatnot. Now, Adobe’s adding a way to group your stuff by teams and by projects, synchronized for everyone involved. Spaces can include Canvas files, asset libraries, and cloud files. For teams that are primarily using Adobe apps, it’s now even easier to never leave them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzDuWZ"&gt;Canvas and Spaces won’t be available right away. Adobe plans to roll them out to everyone next year, but for now, they’re available in a limited beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqS6jh"&gt;The updates play into two of Adobe’s broader goals: making it easier to collaborate and owning the entire software chain so that no one ever has to leave Adobe’s apps. Adobe recently completed its acquisition of Frame.io, a popular web-based video collaboration tool; while it doesn’t have news to share about that service yet, you can imagine that playing a big role in this mission, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ByL5P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2oGkaK"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP3851352140" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The new ring will jump from three to seven temperature sensors and add a pulse oxygen sensor, Oura CEO Harpreet Rai told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7hI49"&gt;A new, green LED light will monitor heart rate throughout the day. Starting at the end of 2021, users will also be able to record their heart rate during exercise and see information about heart rate recovery after a workout is done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXafAU"&gt;The upgrades underscore the company’s focus on health, Rai says, particularly the period prediction feature. The new ring will use shifts in temperature and user feedback to predict when a user might get their period up to 30 days in advance. Body temperature changes through the menstrual cycle, rising just before ovulation and falling as mensuration begins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eczwwS"&gt;Rai says period prediction is only the beginning of the company’s interest in menstruation and fertility. “It’s an underinvested area in wearables,” he says. &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.19.21262306v1.full.pdf"&gt;A study conducted&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with researchers at the University of California San Diego showed that the Oura ring can use temperature changes to identify pregnancy around nine days before an at-home pregnancy test, though pregnancy prediction is not part of the device at this point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaE9T5"&gt;There’s already some precedent for the ring to be used in predicting periods. The FDA had already given the digital birth control company Natural Cycles clearance to use the Oura Ring to collect temperature data. Natural Cycles has an algorithm that integrates daily temperature readings and cycle tracking to tell users which days they’re most likely to get pregnant. Initially, users had to take their temperature using a thermometer, but the FDA signed off on the app’s integration with the Oura ring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568421/natural-cycles-birth-control-app-oura-ring-fda"&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9UpPQ"&gt;Oura did not have an active partnership with Natural Cycles, Rai says — Natural Cycles used Oura’s API to access data from the rings. Rai declined to comment on whether Oura was made aware of Natural Cycle’s work with the ring or whether the companies have spoken since the FDA’s clearance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGf7BC"&gt;He did say, though, that the integration is a good proof of concept for the device. “It does honestly validate our technology and even the finger as being a really interesting place for some of these features,” Rai says. “That’s good for us and good for the ecosystem.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCIMRa"&gt;With the new ring, Oura joins devices like the Apple Watch and Withings ScanWatch in offering blood oxygen monitoring. That feature will launch for Oura users in 2022. Oxygen monitoring is appealing to athletes, Rai says, and also has medical implications going forward — like with sleep apnea. “It doesn’t necessarily mean that we have to predict, diagnose, and treat on day one, but over time, does this mean potentially we can start saying, ‘Hey, something’s off, you may want to go see a doctor?’” he says. “I think there’s a way to do that.” It may take a similar form to the company’s approach to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535204/apple-watch-fitbit-oura-wearables-illness-prediction"&gt;illness prediction&lt;/a&gt;, which treats changes in temperature or other metrics that are changing in the body as “warning lights” rather than diagnostics, Rai says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfrgH8"&gt;Oura is also moving to a membership model for its app, priced at $5.99 a month. Users who upgrade from an older ring to the new model will get a discount on the hardware and a free lifetime membership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVuwb8"&gt;The Generation 3 ring will start shipping November 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X4EktZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Photoshop will get a ‘prepare as NFT’ option soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lI_DP1QqJ0ifsh-FK-vds9R42lM=/0x13:1440x973/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70046430/media_1dd91c848c1e0ed127468c10d0bd0646b4c3455d3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Content Credentials panel in Photoshop.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d2ifBe"&gt;Adobe is launching a system built into Photoshop that can, among other things, help prove that the person selling an NFT is the person who made it. It’s called Content Credentials, and NFT sellers will be able to link the Adobe ID with their crypto wallet, allowing compatible NFT marketplaces to show a sort of verified certificate proving the art’s source is authentic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayDfm6"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22504483"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; interview with Adobe’s chief product officer&lt;/a&gt; Scott Belsky, this functionality will be built into Photoshop with a “prepare as NFT” option, launching in preview by the end of this month. Belsky says attribution data created by the Content Credentials will live on an IPFS system. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs"&gt;a decentralized way to host files&lt;/a&gt; where a network of people are responsible for keeping data safe and available, rather than a single company (somewhat similar to how torrent systems work). Adobe says that NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, Rarible, KnownOrigin, and SuperRare will be able to integrate with Content Credentials to show Adobe’s attribution information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="pYejpz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KOZiwL"&gt;Art theft has been a Big Deal in the NFT world. There have been many examples of people minting art &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/3/15/22332357/nft-art-jason-rohrer-castle-doctrine-selling-friend-art"&gt;they didn’t create&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22334527/nft-scams-artists-opensea-rarible-marble-cards-fraud-art"&gt;don’t have the rights to&lt;/a&gt; on the blockchain. The reason is that anyone can mint an NFT, even if they don’t own the copyright to the content, and there’s not really anything the blockchain can do to stop that. Worse, the minting is enshrined on the blockchain, making the NFT’s creation seem authentic if you’re unaware of the original work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8nO84j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This system doesn’t make it harder to mint an NFT of media you don’t own the rights to, but it could make that NFT less attractive to the market&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="my1hwn"&gt;In other words, I could right-click on an existing image of an NFT and mint it again myself, potentially fooling unaware buyers. While Adobe’s system won’t prevent art theft, it does offer a way to prove that the NFT you’re selling isn’t stolen — past that, it’s up to buyers to decide how much value they place on that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Vir0ZT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How many layers of copyright infringement are in Emily Ratajkowski’s new NFT?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22399790/emily-ratajkowski-nft-christies-copyright-nightmare-richard-prince"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ngP5Z8"&gt;Even Banksy, who gets a mention in &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;, has been caught up by NFT scammers. One NFT collector (ironically named Pranksy) paid $300K for an NFT attributed to the famous street artist, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650594/banksy-nft-scam-pranksy-ethereum-returned-duplicates-art"&gt;which was almost definitely fake&lt;/a&gt;. He ended up getting the money back, but there wouldn’t have been as much of a fuss if Banksy had digitally signed the NFT. As Adobe’s Belsky points out, Banksy probably wouldn’t want to link his name and Adobe ID to a crypto wallet, but the system is meant to be open-source — it’s possible the anonymous artist could figure out some way to provide Content Credentials verified by &lt;a href="https://pestcontroloffice.com/faq.asp"&gt;the company in charge of authenticating his work&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCEczH"&gt;NFTs aren’t the only thing that will benefit from Adobe’s Content Credentials, which are a result of its &lt;a href="https://contentauthenticity.org"&gt;Content Authenticity Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. The company is launching the system as a beta, and users can use it to show what edits were made to a file in Photoshop, tag their stock images on Adobe’s system, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor 50 launches globally for €529, complete with Google apps and services</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RHLf93jMTEA7AHh8OLhKGZ84Wsw=/1x0:5515x3676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70046449/HONOR_50_All_compressed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honor 50.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Honor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gteckz"&gt;The Honor 50 is releasing globally with prices starting at €529, the former Huawei sub-brand announced today. The smartphone was originally announced for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536512/honor-50-series-pro-release-date-news-features-google-mobile-services-apps-play-store"&gt;Chinese market in June&lt;/a&gt;, but today sees the company confirm its global pricing and its early November release date. For €529 (about $615), you get 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and there’s also a €599 (about $695) model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Honor says the phone will be available in over 40 countries, but there are no immediate plans to release the phone in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rRGlIZ"&gt;The big news with the Honor 50 is that it’s the company’s first device to ship with Google’s apps and services since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;splitting from former parent company Huawei&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension"&gt;Google pulled Huawei’s Android license&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order"&gt;due to US sanctions&lt;/a&gt;, meaning its phones have lacked essential Android apps and services like the Google Play Store, severely limiting its appeal outside of China. The return of Google means that the Honor 50 could once again be competitive with other Android handsets in the West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7GDlwK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Honor 50 is joined by the more affordable Honor 50 Lite&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cLLlbl"&gt;The Honor 50 is otherwise pretty much the same device announced for China in June. It’s powered by a Snapdragon 778G processor and has a 4,300mAh battery that can be fast charged at 66W. It’s got a 6.57-inch curved 120Hz 1080p OLED display, and around back there are four cameras: a 108-megapixel main sensor, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgTt21"&gt;As well as the Honor 50, Honor is also announcing a global launch for the more affordable Honor 50 Lite today, which starts at €299 (about $350) for the 6GB RAM model. Honor says the Honor 50 and Honor 50 Lite will be available in European markets such as the UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, in addition to other markets like Egypt, the UAE, and South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCdoIq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
