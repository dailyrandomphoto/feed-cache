    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Natasha Romanoff finally gets her standalone film&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Jg4UgS"&gt;By the standards of the current Marvel Cinematic Universe, &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; feels a little dated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JHa66"&gt;We’re now at a time when superhero exploits are filled with powerful cosmic gods, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315094/wandavision-finale-marvel-mcu-scarlet-witch-doctor-strange-captain"&gt;bizarre sitcom worlds&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523186/loki-review-episode-1-2-disney-plus"&gt;space lizards that control the flow of time&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to that, a globe-trotting story about secret agents doesn’t sound too exciting. There isn’t a single alien or witch. So though &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;technically kicks off the fourth phase of the MCU — which also includes the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451091/eternals-marvel-trailer-chloe-zhao"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391726/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings-marvel-trailer-simu-liu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — it plays out more like an earlier, more straightforward Marvel movie. Really, it almost doesn’t feel like a superhero film at all. Think of it more like the MCU’s take on &lt;em&gt;James Bond&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLMTsO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; starts out rather peacefully, with a stereotypical nuclear family in a small suburban town. It looks idyllic — but it’s also fake. The family is part of a front for Russian super soldier Alexei Shostakov, aka the Red Guardian (David Harbour) and Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz), a spy who doubles as a scientist. Very quickly their covers are blown and the family is forced to escape, and along with their “daughters” — Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) — they make a daring escape to Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIJ2Jf"&gt;The story then fast forwards 21 years. (Chronologically, it takes place right after &lt;em&gt;Captain America: Civil War&lt;/em&gt;.) Romanoff is on the run, hunted by the head of a mysterious organization known as the Red Room, which also happens to be the group behind the Black Widow program. Eventually, she partners with her estranged sister, now also a trained Black Widow herself, to take them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1K5PJqARxDPWWD7lV1dQu13uDYc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688541/fbr1480_trlcomp_v030_fa2d9b2f.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zAo0o2"&gt;The movie has a lot of the hallmarks of a classic spy movie. There’s a shady evil group (the Red Room utilizes mind control for nefarious means, including keeping the Black Widow agents in line), jet-setting jaunts to a handful of countries across the globe (that includes the likes of Cuba, Morocco, and Norway), a technological MacGuffin that everyone is after (a secret serum that negates the effects of mind control), and lots of daring escapes where virtually everything explodes (in the first hour alone there are two scenes that involve near-death escapes via plane or helicopter). Romanoff even has a sketchy friend who can get her whatever she needs, whether it’s a trailer to hide out in or a helicopter to fly to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4D0Gcj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It works surprisingly well as a standalone story&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zkHkk6"&gt;As an action movie it’s solid, with lots of fun set pieces to gawk at and a particularly menacing villain in Taskmaster, who stalks Romanoff like a &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; monster crossed with Winter Soldier. It also works surprisingly well as a standalone story. While there are a handful of references to other movies, and fans will likely enjoy delving deeper into Romanoff’s backstory, you can mostly ignore all that if you want, and you’re still left with an entertaining spy thriller. (The most Marvel-y thing about &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; is its post-credits scene.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXEj4d"&gt;If that’s all &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; was, it would be a fine, if forgettable, romp. What makes it work is the surprising amount of humor and how it elevates the rest of the story. Romanoff is as dour as ever, but here it feels deliberate; the movie does a great job of humanizing a character that’s far too often been relegated to a supporting role. And her more serious tone is balanced out nicely by comic relief from Harbour and Pugh, who see her as family rather than an Avenger. Harbour absolutely hams it up as a walking definition of toxic masculinity, a former superhero past his prime who is slowly realizing he may not have been all that heroic to begin with. You really get a sense of his character as he sits in a Russian jail, easily beating a lineup of inmates at arm wrestling, all while getting a tattoo and making bold, if impossible claims, about his long-term beef with Captain America. He has so much fun, even struggling to squeeze into an old costume from his glory days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HVx581UHpfbx2O5nbuhhl5VWM3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688547/9b242b6fdd726ace32e612d5a40e6028_4096x2727_1c974df6.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rKuhhZ"&gt;Pugh, meanwhile, deals with a life full of hardship — as we learn in the movie, only one in 20 Black Widow agents actually survive the training — with full-on sarcasm. She’s constantly making quips to lighten the mood, is irreverent in her glee for death, and takes a lot of joy from making fun of the most serious Avenger. You never knew the Black Widow needed a little sister mocking every instance in an &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; film where she does something meant to be sexy, aloof, and cool, until Pugh is doing contortions on the floor of a gas station asking why Natasha always poses like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LDy28"&gt;The highlight of the movie is the strange, uncomfortable, and yet familiar dynamic that arises when the four get back together two decades after pretending to be a family. They settle into their old rhythms despite the years, and violence, that separate them. When the sisters rescue the Red Guardian from a secluded, maximum security Russian prison, he can’t help but lean into his fatherly instincts in his own unique way, gleefully boasting about their murderous careers. It’s the same misfit energy that binds the &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; movies. Maybe it feels like a family because they’re the only ones who can stand each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="NH8gG4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; still doesn’t reach the heights of the best Marvel has to offer. But at the very least it manages to carve out its own space in the ever-crowded MCU. Instead of pushing things forward, it offers up blockbuster action that’s almost comforting in its familiarity: laughs, explosions, and characters you can’t help but root for, no matter how bad they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FvfwfB"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Black Widow &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;premieres in theaters and on&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1096468/9358?subId1=VergeBlackWidowJamesBond062921&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fmovies%2Fblack-widow%2F3VfTap90rwZC" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; Disney Plus Premier Access &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;on July 9th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 will leave millions of PCs behind, and Microsoft is struggling to explain why</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yNR-iwBpHWK38HBtpcsSF3jVDhU=/0x0:1650x1100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518916/windows11main.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s big security push is complicated&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="MrzMpS"&gt;Microsoft has had six years to prepare for the launch of Windows 11, but the company is still struggling to explain its new hardware requirements. Windows 11 will officially support Intel 8th Gen Coffee Lake or Zen 2 CPUs and up, leaving behind millions of PCs that were sold during the launch of Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MezbI3"&gt;It’s an unusual surprise if you purchased a new PC for Windows 10, or perhaps you have a perfectly capable machine that’s even older. Windows 11 will require Intel 8th Gen Coffee Lake or Zen 2 CPUs and up, TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) support, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XtDmWK"&gt;Microsoft doesn’t typically enforce such specific processor requirements with Windows — with both Windows 8 and Windows 10 only requiring a 1GHz processor, 1GB of RAM (2GB for 64-bit), and 16GB of storage (20GB for 64-bit). Power users of Windows, and IT admins alike, have built up an expectation of being able to upgrade to the latest OS, regardless of what hardware they’re running. It looks like that’s about to end with Windows 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E_t7NGbjuCOdRvxnw7cIZLKIJ4I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20012545/wjoel_200601_1777_windows10_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft doesn’t typically enforce strict CPU requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2eYhPQ"&gt;After much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22549725/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-tpm-hardware-requirements"&gt;confusion last week&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft attempted to explain its hardware requirements again yesterday, and it sounds like the main driver behind these changes is security. Coupled with Microsoft’s hardware requirements is a push to enable a more modern BIOS (UEFI) that supports features like Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="op55XP"&gt;When you combine TPM with some of the virtualization technologies that Microsoft uses in Windows, there’s an understandable security benefit that we’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;discussed in detail previously&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft claims that a combination of Windows Hello, Device Encryption, virtualization-based security, hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI), and Secure Boot “has been shown to reduce malware by 60 percent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFnUJO"&gt;You obviously need modern hardware to enable all these protections, and Microsoft has been building toward this moment for years. TPM support has been a requirement for OEMs to gain Windows certification since around the release of Windows 10, but Microsoft hasn’t forced businesses or consumers to enable it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qnjH8"&gt;Microsoft’s decision to force Windows 11 users into TPM, Secure Boot, and more comes at a pivotal moment for Windows. It’s Microsoft’s operating system that’s always caught up in ransomware and malware attacks, and things are only going to get worse if the level of Windows hardware security doesn’t go up a notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 4" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYCIhumt3PrlURb79MhujdGogyY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4182758/microsoft-surface-pro-4-9312.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 won’t be supported for Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cC9xCo"&gt;That delicate balance of security and the typical openness of Windows is something that Microsoft will struggle with over the next decade, as it wrestles with modernizing Windows and the understandable backlash. While Microsoft is waiving its new hardware requirements during the preview phase of Windows 11, we still don’t know exactly what devices will be supported when it launches later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxoDyd"&gt;Microsoft tried to offer some more clarity around this yesterday, but it wasn’t the level of detail we were hoping for. “As we release to Windows Insiders and partner with our OEMs, we will test to identify devices running on Intel 7th generation and AMD Zen 1 that may meet our principles,” says a blog post from the Windows team. That could be good news for the Surface Studio 2, a $3,499 device that Microsoft still sells with a 7th Gen chip that’s not on the Windows 11 list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="db3AIv"&gt;This same blog post also revealed that 7th Gen is probably as far back as Microsoft is willing to concede. “We also know that devices running on Intel 6th generation and AMD pre-Zen will not” meet Microsoft’s minimum system requirements, said the blog post before it was edited to remove this line. It’s not clear why Intel’s 6th Gen chips are definitely off the list, but part of this decision could be related to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16850516/intel-meltdown-spectre-bug-patch-cpu-security-flaw-news"&gt;Spectre and Meltdown&lt;/a&gt; — two major computer processor security bugs that affected nearly every device made for 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhNGk8"&gt;“Microsoft’s CPU selections for Windows 11 don’t appear much at all to do with performance but look like security mitigations for side-channel attacks,” says Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. “It also helps chipmakers focus driver work on the future, not the past.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgmY0R"&gt;Side-channel attacks like Spectre and Meltdown were revealed just before Intel implemented hardware mitigations to protect against some speculative execution attacks in some 8th Gen chips in 2018. Not all of Intel’s 8th Gen chips include these hardware mitigations, though, but Microsoft has set a specific cutoff of 8th Gen and beyond. Microsoft hasn’t fully explained that decision, and the company is now telling people to wait and see if it’s able to include more older machines during its testing. Either way, there’s going to be a CPU cutoff that will affect millions of PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/anc9X2_QuWv2aD1x530kfUdQHrQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10082341/acastro_180109_1777_0001_v1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spectre and Meltdown could be related to Windows 11’s CPU changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lkecod"&gt;Critics of Microsoft’s approach note that this move will generate unnecessary e-waste as consumers move to upgrade PCs that are more than capable of running Windows 11. The complexities of TPM and UEFI are also being debated by IT admins, particularly if devices aren’t set up to use these technologies yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xr0bjd"&gt;Security expert Kevin Beaumont, who spent nearly a year working at Microsoft during the pandemic, has criticized the company over its Windows 11 hardware requirements. “In the middle of a pandemic when orgs are hurting, with a global chip shortage, Microsoft [is] trying to get people to replace things for security reasons that are questionable,” said Beaumont on Twitter. “Buy a Surface? No. Make a better OS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lwVx0P"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In the middle of a pandemic when orgs are hurting, with a global chip shortage, MS are trying to get people to replace things for security reasons that are questionable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buy a Surface? No. Make a better OS.&lt;/p&gt;— Kevin Beaumont (@GossiTheDog) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1409606411248623617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T95eym"&gt;Microsoft’s hardware changes also arrive just weeks after Apple announced macOS Monterey, with support for Mac Pros sold in late 2013 and beyond, and Mac Minis sold from late 2014 onward. Apple obviously doesn’t have to support a massive range of hardware configurations like Microsoft does, but the latest version of macOS will still run on systems that are eight years old. Microsoft’s changes mean that some PCs that are only three years old will be excluded from the Windows 11 upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAM9d0"&gt;There will be some exceptions to Microsoft’s new rules, though. “Windows 11 does not apply the hardware-compliance check for virtualized instances either during setup or upgrade,” notes a Microsoft document (&lt;a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/8/8/788bf5ab-0751-4928-a22c-dffdc23c27f2/Minimum%20Hardware%20Requirements%20for%20Windows%2011.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) on minimum hardware requirements for Windows 11. That means if you run Windows 11 as a virtual machine, you can ignore the CPU and security requirements. That flies in the face of Microsoft’s big security push here, but the reality is that most consumers and commercial customers won’t be running Windows 11 in a VM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u71sMS"&gt;Microsoft still has a few months left to test Windows 11, and feedback from the preview will inform “any adjustments [Microsoft] should make to our minimum system requirements in the future.” The software maker has also removed its PC Health Check app that led to a lot of confusion around Windows 11 upgrades. “We acknowledge that it was not fully prepared to share the level of detail or accuracy you expected from us on why a Windows 10 PC doesn’t meet upgrade requirements,” says the Windows team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxjmvm"&gt;That gives Microsoft some breathing room between now and launch, and enough time for testers to play with Windows 11 free from these new restrictions. But if you’re testing Windows 11 right now on an older CPU that’s not on the official list, the chances are you’ll need to reinstall Windows 10 at the end of the preview period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="67mnxt"&gt;Microsoft is allowing testers to access Windows 11 on a wide range of hardware during the preview, but it’s planning to apply these new restrictions at launch. I would be surprised if there is a major change to these hardware requirements later this year, other than Microsoft stepping down to some 7th Gen chips. So enjoy testing Windows 11 while you still can.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Car companies will have to report automated vehicle crashes under new rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qSNBOvg77lP8GUyz7C9HZXmoH6U=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518914/EzRSmWwVUAQVVNj.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Matt Doughtery / KPRC2 Houston&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7T3aW5"&gt;Car companies will be required to report crashes involving advanced driver assistance systems under &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2021-06/Standing_General_Order_2021_01-digital-06292021.pdf"&gt;new rules proposed&lt;/a&gt; by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvXs1B"&gt;The general order will apply to manufacturers of vehicles equipped with Level 2 driver assist systems through fully autonomous Level 5 systems, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ taxonomy for autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bk0h6T"&gt;At Level 2, the vehicle can control both steering and acceleration and deceleration, but it falls short of self-driving because a human sits in the driver’s seat and can take control of the car at any time. Level 5 refers to a fully autonomous vehicle that can travel anywhere, under any conditions. Notably, there are not Level 5 vehicles in existence today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8BPh1p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“gathering data will help instill public confidence”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RBPYvx"&gt;“NHTSA’s core mission is safety. By mandating crash reporting, the agency will have access to critical data that will help quickly identify safety issues that could emerge in these automated systems,” said Steven Cliff, NHTSA’s acting administrator, in a statement. “In fact, gathering data will help instill public confidence that the federal government is closely overseeing the safety of automated vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKFT9w"&gt;The decision is a stark departure from recent administrations, which have generally taken a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21292014/dot-nhtsa-self-driving-car-test-data-voluntary"&gt;hands-off approach&lt;/a&gt; to the nascent autonomous vehicle industry. Companies are typically inclined to share as little as possible in the interest of keeping costs low, protecting proprietary information, and controlling their narratives by preventing the release of embarrassing information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQvoBt"&gt;And for a while, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/5/17080824/dot-autonomous-vehicle-listening-session-washington"&gt;the federal government tended to agree&lt;/a&gt;, believing that requiring any data disclosure would be too onerous for the AV industry and possibly stymie research that hypothetically could lead to a reduction in fatal vehicle crashes. This laissez-faire attitude started during the Obama administration and continued under Donald Trump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDPqgO"&gt;But the Biden administration is taking a different tactic. The Department of Transportation, under Secretary Pete Buttigieg, appears to be less allergic to the idea of automakers and tech companies being required to do the bare minimum and gather data related to the operation of partially and fully autonomous vehicles on public roads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3vGo5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412233/pete-buttigieg-transportation-secretary-interview"&gt;In a recent interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Buttigieg called autonomous vehicles “a moving target” with huge safety implications for everyone on the road, adding, “We need to lean in further, using our existing authorities, but also updating them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bJFSsy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We need to lean in further, using our existing authorities”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hpiifR"&gt;Currently, when a vehicle equipped with a partially autonomous system crashes, the onus is on local authorities to investigate and release information to the public. Occasionally, NHTSA and the National Transportation Safety Board will send investigators to the crash site as well. But the car company may not disclose anything publicly on the crash, depending on the level of interest. There is currently no standardized way to gather information about crashes involving Level 2 systems and above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mthQsU"&gt;There are also no federal rules requiring AV companies to submit information about their testing activities to the government. Instead, a patchwork of state-by-state regulations governs what is and isn’t disclosed. California has the most stringent rules, requiring companies to obtain a license for different types of testing, disclose vehicle crashes, and list the number of miles driven and the frequency at which human safety drivers were forced to take control of their autonomous vehicles (also known as a “disengagement”). Unsurprisingly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21142685/california-dmv-self-driving-car-disengagement-report-data"&gt;AV companies tend to hate California’s requirements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxR0Jd"&gt;The automakers and tech companies are sure to weigh in eventually on this new rule, but NHTSA said the goal is to “identify potential safety issues and impacts resulting from the operation of advanced technologies on public roads and increase transparency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vEG61h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are also no federal rules requiring AV companies to submit information&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kRVvuG"&gt;Since Tesla introduced Autopilot in 2015, there have been at least &lt;a href="https://www.tesladeaths.com/"&gt;11 deaths in nine crashes&lt;/a&gt; in the US that involved the driver assistance system. Internationally, there have been at least another nine deaths in seven additional crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nplr8G"&gt;Some companies have proactively released data regarding crashes involving their automated vehicles. Last year, Waymo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21538999/waymo-self-driving-car-data-miles-crashes-phoenix-google"&gt;published 6.1 million miles of driving data&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 and 2020, including 18 crashes and 29 near-miss collisions. Other AV companies have expressed interest in doing the same but have yet to follow through. Tesla publishes a quarterly “safety report” about Autopilot but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17937504/tesla-autopilot-safety-consumer-report"&gt;omits key details&lt;/a&gt; that would help identify patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dr1VCJ"&gt;We don’t know yet whether this will be a harbinger of things to come, but it seems likely that the free ride enjoyed by automakers and tech companies with regard to autonomous vehicle testing and deployment could be coming to an end. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ZenFone 8 review: an Android iPhone mini</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The ZenFone 8 delivers flagship-level build quality and performance in a small package&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4C38dH"&gt;After a couple of generations making phones with flip-out cameras and increasingly large displays, Asus has taken the ZenFone 8 in a totally different direction: small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSrT9H"&gt;The flipping camera concept lives on in the also-new ZenFone 8 Flip, but it’s no longer a standard feature across this year’s ZenFone lineup. Instead, starting at $629 for 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, the ZenFone 8 lands in the upper-midrange class with a conventional rear camera bump and a much smaller 5.9-inch display. An 8GB RAM / 256GB storage configuration is also available for $699.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwwRdC"&gt;Rather than an attention-grabbing camera feature, the focus of this design has been to create a smaller phone that’s comfortable to use in one hand, which Asus has done without skimping on processing power or higher-end features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1hmwn"&gt;It’s an Android iPhone mini, and it’s fantastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u3cT9V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10494874"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Go0J86tAcMmzjPPXSpyPncCJlc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499353/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus designed the ZenFone 8 with one-handed operation in mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FW7hIJ"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 screen and design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IhH9SM"&gt;The ZenFone 8 may be small, but that hasn’t kept it from offering the latest flagship processor: a Snapdragon 888 chipset, coupled with 6, 8, or 16GB of RAM (my review unit has 16GB). I can’t find fault with this phone’s performance. It feels responsive, animations and interactions are smooth, and it keeps up with demanding use and rapid app switching. This is performance fitting of a flagship device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cElERS"&gt;The display is a 5.9-inch 1080p OLED panel with a fast 120Hz refresh rate that makes routine interactions with the phone — swiping, scrolling, animations — look much more smooth and polished than a standard 60Hz screen or even a 90Hz panel. By default, the phone will automatically switch between 120 / 90 / 60Hz depending on the application to save battery life, but you can manually select any of those three refresh rates if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EFkcZ"&gt;The display’s 20:9 aspect ratio was carefully considered by Asus. The company says it settled on this slightly narrower format so the phone would fit more easily into a pocket, and it does. I can’t get it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way into a back jeans pocket, but it mostly fits. More importantly, it fits well inside a jacket pocket and doesn’t feel like it’s going to flop out if I sit down on the floor to tie my shoes. The ZenFone 8 is rated IP68 for dust protection and some water submersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2grdcK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I can’t get it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way into a back jeans pocket, but it mostly fits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o69ULu"&gt;The front panel is protected by Gorilla Glass Victus and houses an in-display fingerprint sensor, while the back uses Gorilla Glass 3 with a frosted finish that’s on the matte side of the matte / glossy spectrum. The front panel is flat, but the rear features a slight curve on the long edges for an easier fit in the hand. At 169 grams (5.9 ounces), it’s heavy for its size, and it feels surprisingly dense when you first pick it up. The phone’s frame is aluminum, giving the whole package a high-end look and feel. There’s even a headphone jack on the top edge as a treat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8XM4b"&gt;The power button (an exciting shade of blue!) is well-positioned so my right thumb falls on it naturally with the phone in my hand. Same for the in-screen fingerprint sensor: the target appears to be positioned higher on the screen than usual, but that actually puts it within a comfortable reach of my thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3w8VC5"&gt;I’ll admit up front that I have a personal bias toward smaller phones, but the ZenFone 8 just feels great in my hand. I’ve spent a lot of time using big devices over the last six months, and I’ve gotten used to it. But the ZenFone 8 is the first device that feels like it was adapted to &lt;em&gt;me,&lt;/em&gt; not something I’ve had to adapt to using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0UuUZnwxRe3j921AYa4ifsE1k5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499355/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A smaller phone means a smaller battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kpaymP"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 battery and software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8mbHH8"&gt;The phone’s small size makes a smaller battery a necessity — 4,000mAh in this case, much smaller than the ZenFone 6 and 7’s 5,000mAh. I felt the difference in using this phone versus a battery-for-days budget or midrange phone, but I had no problem getting through a full day of moderate use. I even left Strava running for 20 hours by accident, and the battery still had some life in it the next morning. The ZenFone 8 supports 30W wired charging with the included power adapter, which takes an empty battery to 100 percent in a bit more than an hour. Wireless charging isn’t supported, which makes the ZenFone 8 a bit of an outlier in the flagship class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPNxId"&gt;Asus offers a ton of options to help stretch day-to-day battery life as well as the overall lifespan of your battery. There are no fewer than five battery modes to optimize phone performance or battery longevity on a daily basis, and different charging modes let you set a custom charging limit or stagger charging overnight so it reaches 100 percent around the time of your alarm for better battery health. You won’t find class-leading battery capacity here, but rest assured if you need to stretch the ZenFone 8’s battery, there are plenty of options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kj8abO"&gt;The ZenFone 8 ships with Android 11, and Asus says it will provide “at least” two major OS with security updates for the same timeframe. That’s on the low side of what we’d expect for a flagship phone, especially compared to Apple’s typical four- or five-year support schedule. An important note for US shoppers is that the ZenFone 8 will only work with AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile’s LTE and Sub-6GHz 5G networks; you can’t use this phone on Verizon, and there’s no support for the fast, but extremely limited, millimeter-wave 5G networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ctgUaWF69tS9vSVEdPG5w8MwvQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22507533/DSC00661_rear.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 offers standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8l2mPu"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MbIlch"&gt;There are just two cameras on the ZenFone 8’s rear camera bump, and they are both worth your time. Rather than cram in a depth sensor, macro, or some monochrome nonsense, Asus just went with a 64-megapixel main camera with OIS and a 12-megapixel ultrawide. They’re borrowed from last year’s model, minus a telephoto camera and the flipping mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5utE4G"&gt;As in the ZenFone 7 Pro, the 8’s main camera produces 16-megapixel images with vibrant color and plenty of detail in good light. Images can lean a little too far into unnatural-looking territory, and some high-contrast scenes look a little too HDR-y for my liking. But overall, this camera does fine: it handles moderately low-light conditions like a dim store interior well, and Night Mode does an okay job in very low light, provided you can hold the phone still for a few seconds and your subject isn’t moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bFBXWG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10494947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xx4klZ"&gt;A skin-smoothing beauty mode is on by default when you use portrait mode, and it is not good. Skin looks over-smoothed, unnaturally flat, and brightened, like your subject is wearing a couple of layers of stage makeup. Turning this off improves things significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBkFNw"&gt;The ultrawide camera also turns in good performance. Asus calls it a “flagship” grade sensor, and while that might have been true in 2018, it’s at least a step up from the smaller, cheaper sensors often found in ultrawide cameras. Likewise, the front-facing 12-megapixel camera does fine. Beauty mode is turned off by default when you switch to the selfie camera, and thank goodness for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maIBzp"&gt;There’s no telephoto camera here, just digital zoom. On the camera shooting screen, there’s an icon to jump to a 2x 16-megapixel “lossless” digital zoom to crop in quickly, which works okay, but it isn’t much reach, and it just makes the limitations of the small sensor and lens more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wAwwx"&gt;On the whole, the camera system is good but not great. The lack of true optical zoom or a telephoto camera is a disappointment, but you can’t have everything on such a small device, and I’d personally take an ultrawide before a telephoto any day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2yyJwz2m9mIkB8t4cUpzDgDLbuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499354/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 doesn’t sacrifice a flagship experience to achieve its small form factor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZDiMQY"&gt;The ZenFone 8 fills a void in the Android market for a full-specced, small-sized device. The Google Pixel 4A is around the same size, but it’s decidedly a budget device with a step-down processor, plastic chassis, and fewer niceties like an IP rating or a fast-refresh screen. Aside from battery life, which is manageable, you give up very little in the way of flagship features to get the ZenFone 8’s small form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzbIbh"&gt;You have to look to iOS for this phone’s most direct competition: the iPhone 12 mini, which it matches almost spec-for-spec from the IP rating down to the camera configuration. The 12 mini is actually a little smaller than the ZenFone 8, and when you factor in storage capacity, it’s the more expensive choice at $829 for 256GB. However, when you consider that the 12 mini will probably get a couple more years of OS and security support, it may be the better buy in the long run, if you’re flexible in your choice of operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jc0CEI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Flagship-level build quality and performance quite literally in the palm of your hand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rEL2JQ"&gt;I like the ZenFone 8 a lot, but I’m not sure it’ll find a big audience, at least in the US. Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;having trouble selling the iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;, and if there’s one thing Apple is good at, it’s selling phones to US customers. As much as I hate to entertain the idea, maybe we’ve gotten used to giant phones. I love how the ZenFone 8 feels in my hand and in my pocket, but I do notice how much smaller the screen and everything on it seems compared to the bigger phones I’ve used recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Etfrj"&gt;There are also a few important considerations, like the lack of compatibility with Verizon and the comparatively short support lifespan of the phone. If you need the absolute best in battery life the ZenFone 8 can’t offer that, and if you want a class-leading camera, you’ll need to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="OIO7v3"&gt;All that said, the ZenFone 8 will be the right fit for a specific type of person, and I can heartily recommend it to my fellow small phone fans. You’ll get flagship-level build quality and performance quite literally in the palm of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s $70 G335 is a colorful wired gaming headset</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logitech G335 headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TL_kj5UIyDbwhDgn41E1igH_zbw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518822/g335.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MLyvc3"&gt;Logitech announced its new G335 wired gaming headset &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fgaming-audio%2Fg335-gaming-headset.981-001023.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F29%2F22555522%2Flogitech-wired-g335-gaming-headset-features-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that’s available for preorder now at $69.99&lt;/a&gt;. It’s expected to ship in July. The G335 borrows several design elements from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21378026/logitech-g733-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-headset-accessories-g203-g305-g915-colors"&gt;$129.99 G733 wireless model released in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, including its expressive color options (as well as a new mint colorway), the comfortable bungee headband, breathable ear pads, a volume dial built into the right ear cup, and a flip-to-mute microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yUjz1"&gt;This more affordable model is compatible with the G733’s replaceable headband straps and mic covers sold through Logitech’s site, but it does away with most of that headset’s fancier features, like USB-C charging and the strip of RGB lighting on the front side of the ear cups. Logitech says this wired model has a slimmer design for “a smaller fit and increased comfort.” It weighs 240 grams, which is about 40 grams less than the wireless model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sCHjGL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ErvB8vEDoo0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="APWMqC"&gt;The G335 comes with a 3.5mm cable attached, which ensures support with many devices that have an audio jack, be it a PS5 or Xbox Series X console controller, a PC, tablet, a laptop, or something else. Logitech includes a PC splitter to accommodate computers that have separate microphone and audio inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQO9h7"&gt;It’s best not to expect too much from a $70 wired headset, but I loved the design and fit of the G733. And if the audio performance is anything like the pricier wireless model, the G335 could be easy to recommend at its price point. We’ll be testing this one out soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mario Golf: Super Rush isn’t weird enough</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RYIs7JsV6lwPcCOBcMZFZ127G8I=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518778/Mario_Golf_Super_Rush_Special_Shot_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pGSanC"&gt;At their best, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; sports titles move beyond the game they’re trying to mimic. You don’t have to care about cars or racing to enjoy &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;, just as you don’t need to know who Pep Guardiola is to have fun with &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Strikers&lt;/em&gt;. The sport is just a starting point. From there, Nintendo’s designers expand on it with all kinds of interesting and new ideas. &lt;em&gt;Mario Golf: Super Rush&lt;/em&gt;, which is out now on the Nintendo Switch, does &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;of this. There are familiar characters with superpowers, courses with strange obstacles, and a new mode that’s supposed to emphasize speed over all else. Ultimately, though, &lt;em&gt;Super Rush &lt;/em&gt;ends up feeling a little too much like, well, golf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYypz5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Rush&lt;/em&gt; at least gets the basics right. Swinging a club feels good, and that’s true whether you’re using a standard controller or &lt;em&gt;Wii Sports&lt;/em&gt;-style motion controls. It manages to walk the line Nintendo games so often do, where it’s easy to pick up but also offers a good amount of depth once you start learning how different clubs work and how to add spin to your shot. The act of playing golf works well enough, and it’s augmented by some very Mario features, like outlandish obstacles (you can use tornadoes to give your ball a boost into the air) and character-specific powers (there are special shots that freeze the ground on impact or generate an annoying lightning storm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONzyh1"&gt;That’s all fine if you just want to play a few rounds with friends. But many of the modes get in the way of the fun, and &lt;em&gt;Super Rush&lt;/em&gt; is particularly grueling if you’re looking to play solo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="32rr2O"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-5cViCVKOZQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lRzn2w"&gt;First, there’s the “speed rush,” the game’s titular innovation, a mode that’s geared more around speed than precision. The idea is that after you take your shot you run after the ball to take the next as quickly as possible. The faster you are, the better your score. In practice, though, running around on golf courses is tedious and actually slows things down; it takes me longer to run 160 yards than it would for the game to just zap me there. This might be forgiven if the act of running was enjoyable, but instead you’re saddled with a rapidly depleting stamina gauge and a limited range of actions (including a mostly useless jump) that turn the whole process into a chore. (To make matters worse, if you finish a hole quickly, you still have to sit and watch your opponents play, even in the single-player modes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDDiGR"&gt;There’s also an “adventure” mode, which plays out sort of like a simple golf RPG. You play as a Mii character going through the process of becoming a Mushroom Kingdom pro. You’ll travel to different courses, talk to characters, earn skill points to upgrade your Mii, and take on bosses. It’s a nice idea, but it never rises to the level of past games in the series, like &lt;em&gt;Mario Golf: Advance Tour&lt;/em&gt;, which leaned much heavier on the roleplaying elements and had a surprisingly entertaining narrative. Instead, it’s a largely flat story that had me skipping through the dialogue in order to get to the next tournament. (Which, usually, meant playing more speed golf.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NzhoxBppX3NdSb6_tybtJZRtUbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688594/Switch_MarioGolfSuperRush_ND_SCRN_05.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DDfhWm"&gt;The highlight of the package is “battle golf,” easily the fastest mode in the game. It’s a nine-hole course that takes place in a giant stadium where the goal is to sink three shots first, while navigating things like Thwomps and bombs. It’s basically the &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt; ethos but for golf, and it’s a lot of fun. Even better, matches are over very quickly, making it an almost ideal party experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEZ5jM"&gt;I couldn’t help but wish that more of the game had the same zany, Nintendo-like feel of battle golf. I wanted more oddball courses and modes, more chances to get into weird situations. Instead, the solid mechanics and colorful world are dragged down by a story mode with a bland story, and a sped-up version of golf that’s actually pretty slow. There’s still fun to be had, particularly with two people hitting balls on the same Switch. But while &lt;em&gt;Super Rush&lt;/em&gt; gets the golf part right, it’s lacking what makes &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; games special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yscprx"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mario Golf: Super Rush &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available now on the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boston Dynamics’ Spot robot challenges BTS to a boy band dance-off in latest video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RGYRKnVUYXlSwBIY63ntmFKKQ3Q=/68x0:790x481/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518477/bts.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vv7HX4"&gt;Hyundai has officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/12/29/22205055/boston-dynamics-robots-spot-atlas-handle-dancing-video"&gt;completed its acquisition of Boston Dynamics&lt;/a&gt;, the creator of the internet’s favorite dancing Spot and Atlas robots (which only occasionally look like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20881385/boston-dynamics-atlas-gymnastics-routine-somersaults-split-leap"&gt;dystopian nightmare machines&lt;/a&gt;). And to celebrate, the company is &lt;a href="http://blog.bostondynamics.com/all-together-now"&gt;collaborating with K-pop sensation BTS&lt;/a&gt; on a new video that shows seven Spot robots grooving to the band’s 2020 song “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7atZfX85nd4"&gt;IONIQ: I’m On It&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEXcyZ"&gt;And while Spot’s smooth dance moves might bring a frisson of worry to any K-pop fans thinking that K-pop boy-bands might be the next industry that Boston Dynamics is targeting for its robots to replace human workers in, right now it seems that BTS isn’t too worried about the competition. A &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJZeMgqQMjA"&gt;second video&lt;/a&gt; shows off the band celebrating the Hyundai acquisition alongside a Spot robot, and both boy band and bot come together for a brief dance-off. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lIAGGXtDx39fe8WAB-agJIDQsxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688468/qAVfNwtrU2.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aSyQMA"&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://blog.bostondynamics.com/all-together-now"&gt;behind-the-scenes blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company details how it pulled off the longer, coordinated dance routine, which involved incredibly precise programming (rather than using the robot’s built-in sensors or obstacle avoidance algorithms that Spot usually uses to get around and accomplish tasks). “Everything had to be worked out in advance and scripted precisely,” explains Eric Whitman, a Boston Dynamics roboticist. The company also worked again with Monica Thomas, the professional choreographer who the company worked with on its previous dancing robot videos, to plan out Spot’s dance moves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6DOo6"&gt;“An athletic performance like dance stresses the mechanical design of the robot, and it also stresses the algorithms in the software,” says Marc Raibert, founder and chairman of Boston Dynamics, in an explanation as to why the company keeps making these videos. Raibert also notes that the dance routines force the company to create new tools to program the robots, like the “Choreographer” software used here — software that’s since been publicly released and is already being used by other Boston Dynamics Spot owners for entertainment purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IBGCKL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJZeMgqQMjA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="5GXfag"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Boston Dynamics robots take over the dance floor in latest video","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/12/29/22205055/boston-dynamics-robots-spot-atlas-handle-dancing-video"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="l4Bs5F"&gt;That hits on the second reason for the videos, which Raibert doesn’t touch on: they’re incredibly popular online. The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn3KWM1kuAw"&gt;last dancing video has over 32 million videos&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube, and a collaboration with BTS, one of the most popular bands on the planet with an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; active fan base, is almost guaranteed to put up even better numbers. And given the fact that Boston Dynamics is actually trying to get companies to &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; Spot robots — to the tune of $74,500 each — it’s easy to see why it’d want to get the word out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDguz8"&gt;The dancing videos also help to show off the fun, playful side of the Spot robots, cementing them in the public mind as cute dancing machines, rather than the more controversial real-world uses in which the robots have been deployed. That includes things like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409559/nypd-robot-dog-digidog-boston-dynamics-contract-terminated"&gt;NYPD’s since-ended tests of Spot robots&lt;/a&gt;, or the recent use of Spot robots in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371590/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-military-exercises-french-army"&gt;simulated military exercises in France&lt;/a&gt; for reconnaissance work.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ pocket-sized Zenfone 8 arrives in the US for $629</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yEHHL5644LQCTKR9BdFKziKHhz8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518340/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ZenFone 8.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="putYtw"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;Zenfone 8&lt;/a&gt;, Asus’ well-specced and compact competitor to the iPhone 12 mini, has launched in the US. The company is currently selling two versions of the phone on &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/category/ZF8"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a model with 128GB of storage which will eventually sell for $629 once its early bird pricing of $599 expires on July 13th, while the other has 256GB of storage and costs $699. Both are equipped with 8GB of RAM and are compatible with AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile’s networks, but not Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jrkGR"&gt;We liked the Zenfone 8 when we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;reviewed it last month&lt;/a&gt;. Its 5.9-inch display makes it a relatively compact device in comparison to the rest of the Android market, and its 120Hz refresh rate and Snapdragon 888 processor mean it feels snappy and responsive to use. Its smaller size means its battery life is only okay, and its camera performance could be better, but those might be acceptable compromises if a compact phone is your priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="att6JM"&gt;Unfortunately, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22430948/asus-zenfone-8-flip-price-specs-availability"&gt;larger Zenfone 8 Flip&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with a flipping camera mechanism that turns its three rear cameras into selfie shooters, isn’t currently planned for a US release. In Europe, the 8 Flip costs €799, compared to €599 for the regular Zenfone 8.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s latest Alexa trick is helping kids read</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KMHMWfolFM35lOWdOYmmGaJF_qE=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518198/dseifert_201025_4263_0008.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Amazon Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MndFny"&gt;Amazon has announced a new feature for its Kids Plus service on Fire tablets and Echo smart speakers called Reading Sidekick. Designed to help kids improve their reading skills and ability, the Reading Sidekick allows kids to read either physical or digital books along with Alexa by taking turns at reading the books aloud with the digital assistant. The Reading Assistant is included in the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ftu/home"&gt;Kids Plus service&lt;/a&gt; that comes with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-Kids-tablet/dp/B08F5Z2MC2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kids edition Fire tablets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-5-2nd-Gen-Kids/dp/B08LMSC4WZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo speakers&lt;/a&gt; or as a $2.99 per month ($4.99 without Amazon Prime) or $69 per year ($99 without Prime) subscription plan and is available starting June 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLeKnM"&gt;The Reading Sidekick works with most Alexa-enabled devices, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21452312/amazon-echo-dot-led-redesign-sphere-features-alexa-price-release-date"&gt;Echo Dot Kids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/10/16631956/amazon-echo-plus-alexa-smart-home-review"&gt;Echo Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Amazon Kids mode is enabled on the smart speaker or smart display (through the Alexa smartphone app), a child can then say “Alexa, let’s read” to start the Reading Sidekick. They will then be prompted to choose a book, either physical or digital on a Fire tablet or in the Kids Plus app on other devices; opt to read a lot, a little, or take turns; and then begin reading the book. Amazon says that “over 700” books are available in the system now, with more releasing each week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4glTSZ"&gt;Once a book is started, Alexa will listen to the child’s reading and automatically assist with pronunciations or other challenges while reading the book. It will provide encouragement through phrases like “good job!” when a child finishes a book or gets through a particularly tricky section. In the “read a little” mode, it will take the lion’s share of the reading, expecting the child to follow along in the book and then read one page or paragraph every few pages. The “read a lot” mode is the opposite: the child will be expected to read four pages consecutively, with Alexa reading one after that. The “take turns” mode is simple alternation of reading a single page or paragraph between the child and Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wMolH"&gt;What the Sidekick doesn’t do is follow up with any sort of comprehension questions to see how much the child retained or understood from the book. There’s no test or quiz component; it’s best to think of this as edutainment than a replacement for a proper learning curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KzZDJTiTuyiKLM7RMbqw52BgKus=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687691/Reading_Sidekick_Echo_Show_Book_Cover.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Reading Sidekick works with both audio-only Echo devices and ones with screens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/39MnX7hBvaxN0-AEUFCBFDt0vRU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687687/Reading_Sidekick_Echo_Show_Book_List.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reading Sidekick suggestions on an Amazon Echo Show.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fIiJ2p"&gt;The Reading Sidekick works with both Alexa smart speakers and smart displays, but it won’t show the text of a book on a smart display’s screen, and instead uses that real estate for book recommendations. Alexa can also provide recommendations on a basic Echo speaker, so it’s not necessary to use the Reading Sidekick with a screen. Parents can view the books their kids have been reading on the Kids Plus web dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ji30Qf"&gt;Amazon says that it is also starting to roll out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/11/16460120/amazon-echo-multi-user-voice-new-feature"&gt;Alexa Voice Profiles&lt;/a&gt; for Kids this week. This will allow the Echo to recognize the voice of a specific child and then personalize the experience to them, which can be helpful when multiple children are sharing a single Echo device. If the child is speaking to an Echo that doesn’t have the Kids mode enabled and Alexa recognizes their voice, it will switch into Kids mode and provide age-appropriate answers, filter explicit music, limit calls and messages to approved contacts, and limit access to approved skills. Parents will be able to set up to four unique voice profiles for their kids in the Alexa app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="q91TTX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Show 5 (second gen) review: small screen, small updates","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FJXmsa"&gt;In an interview ahead of today’s announcement, Marissa Mierow, Amazon’s head of Alexa learning and education, said that the Reading Sidekick is “meant to build fluency and a love of reading” within children and that Amazon developed it because of how closely reading skills are related to success in academics and social life after school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WpDjN"&gt;The company says it took nearly a year to build this feature, adjusting Alexa’s patience, ability to detect when a child is sounding out a difficult word and understand kids’ pronunciations, and more. Mierow says the company put together an advisory council of teachers, science researchers, and curriculum experts to help guide the development of the service as it was being built. It’s releasing the feature now in a hope that it will help combat the “summer slide” in reading ability that happens when kids are out of school for six to eight weeks between grades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qf457v"&gt;Mierow says the “sweet spot” age range for the Reading Sidekick is six to nine, as the child needs to have some reading ability to follow along with Alexa, even in the most simple modes. Most of the books in the supported library are aimed at these beginning readers, though there are some more advanced books for older kids who want to use the service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DM3c6Hi0Hw43Ldk3yUKRFM01isg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687724/Screenshot_20210628_195627_copy.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Reading Sidekick section on Fire tablets for kids shows all of the supported books.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vXVCoq"&gt;I had an opportunity to try out the Reading Sidekick with my six-year-old ahead of today’s announcement. We were able to test reading physical and digital books with Alexa on both a standard Echo Dot with Kids mode enabled and the recently released Echo Show 5 Kids Edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhwzWU"&gt;Based on our experience, the ideal setup for Reading Sidekick is a Fire HD Kids tablet (or the Kids Plus app on an iPad or similar device) and an audio-only Echo speaker. Though the Reading Sidekick works with physical books, my child had a hard time keeping up with Alexa as it read, since turning the page requires swifter dexterity than just swiping the screen like they can do with a digital book on a tablet. Additionally, the tablet can access the entire library of books that are compatible with the service, whereas it might be hit-or-miss with the books you have at home. (Though Amazon will highlight physical books in its store that are compatible with the Reading Sidekick.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13iGlm"&gt;On the Echo Show, the Reading Sidekick app would frequently quit to the homescreen and start displaying a clock or the weather, even though Alexa was still listening to my kid reading. This was confusing for them, as they’d stop reading when they noticed that the screen changed. The recommendations on the screen are also duplicative of the recommendations on the tablet itself, rendering the screen mostly moot — the experience was just better with the speaker-only Echo. Naturally, it works best in a quiet room where Alexa can hear a child’s voice easiest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ewc0k"&gt;The Reading Sidekick crashed in the middle of reading a book on both devices — Alexa would just stop listening to the book and we’d have to start the whole process all over again. We were able to pick up where we left off, but it’s an annoying process and I’m not sure my kid would have been able to figure it out without me there helping them through it. Amazon says this isn’t something it saw during beta testing of the Reading Sidekick, but it’s possible that it’s related to the company expanding availability of the feature from the preview group I was in to the general population of Echo owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FJjWP9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Sidekick did help my child through difficult sections automatically and corrected pronunciations on a handful of words&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="93uuoa"&gt;When the Sidekick was working as expected, it did help my child through sections they were having trouble reading automatically and attempted to correct some of their odd pronunciations. It also rewarded them for finishing a book with a message of encouragement. But once we were done testing the feature, my kid just wanted to play with the apps and games on the Fire tablet and didn’t have much interest in reading more books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKTA2b"&gt;There are, of course, some immediate concerns with having your kid read with a robot. One is privacy, though if you already have an Echo speaker in your home, this isn’t really any different from that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nBok9"&gt;The larger concern might be that with the Reading Sidekick, Alexa is taking the traditional place of a parent or teacher in teaching reading. Many parents cherish the time spent teaching their children to read and see it as both a developmental and bonding activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbXLVt"&gt;Still, plenty of parents would love their kids to read more than they do and just don’t have the time to devote to it due to the many obligations of modern life. The ability to have their child practice their reading with Alexa to supplement any reading they might do together as a family might be appealing. Unlike a parent, Alexa won’t ever tire of reading the same book over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncql1N"&gt;Parents will have to reckon with their anxieties over privacy and an Amazon-powered robot teaching their child, but they’ll also have to deal with the decently hefty hardware requirements. This service requires at least one Amazon device and a subscription to the Kids Plus service. It really works best when you have both an Echo speaker and a Fire HD tablet (or another tablet with the Kids Plus app), doubling the number of devices you need to buy or already own to get the most out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXNhqu"&gt;The Reading Sidekick is an example of Amazon figuring out more ways to make Alexa and its artificial intelligence useful in our lives, while of course keeping things within the Amazon ecosystem as much as possible. It’s also unlikely to be the last educational tool given to Alexa: many kids already use the virtual assistant to help with simple mathematics and other trivia questions. It’s not a leap to think that’s where the Alexa learning and education team might be headed next.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram tests letting anyone share a link in stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kBa_TpHHPy8XKdh8rzDPXAtrkXw=/84x0:996x608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518247/199306424_1004326343706419_871286131944844992_n.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AIwu2A"&gt;Instagram has always limited who can post swipe-up links to their stories, but today, the company is starting a new test that could widen that ability. In this case, however, it isn’t a swipe up that people will be able to offer, but instead a linking sticker. These stickers will operate the same way a swipe-up link does, except with a tap instead of a swipe. People will also be able to respond to stories that include a sticker, which they can’t currently do with stories that have a swipe up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJLQVA"&gt;For now, the test is small, and Vishal Shah, Instagram’s head of product, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it’s mostly to learn how people might take advantage of links. They’ll be watching for the types of links people post while keeping a particular eye on misinformation and spam. Plus, stickers, he says, fit more into the current way people use the platform, so he says this test “brings links into the same kind of overall system, which from a simplicity of system perspective, also makes a lot of sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSAvDZ"&gt;He adds that link stickers are the eventual goal for Instagram, whether that be for everyone or just people who already have linking privileges. “That is the sort of future system we would like to get to,” he says. “And that’s what we hope to roll out, if we’re able to make this work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBw4E0"&gt;Links will be limited to stories for now, however. Shah says there’s “no plan” to bring them to the feed or any other part of the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHdAV6"&gt;This test seems mostly targeted at people who’ve found a voice and reach on the platform, but maybe not to the levels that Instagram requires to gain swipe-up privileges. (Users have to be verified or have at least 10,000 followers.) Activists, for example, have mastered the art of call-to-action posts but haven’t been able to direct people to website resources. This might make that possible. Again, it’s only a small test, so the platform won’t rapidly change overnight, but it might be the start of people web browsing from within the Instagram app more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
