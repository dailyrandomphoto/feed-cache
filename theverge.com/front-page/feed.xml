    <title>The remastered Grand Theft Auto trilogy is launching on November 11th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Grand Theft Auto Vice City" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k5XQwEajYjz-27s-XMYu-dIp9Kk=/0x11:640x438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70030392/screenC02.1419979024.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This photo isn’t representative of the improved graphics. Rockstar hasn’t yet shared assets from the remastered games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0DrCaj"&gt;Rockstar Games announced that the remastered &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, including &lt;em&gt;GTA III&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vice City&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;San Andreas&lt;/em&gt;, will launch on November 11th for $59.99 (£54.99). On that day, you’ll be able to play them on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and the newer Series X/S consoles, and PC via the Rockstar Games Launcher. In the first half of 2022, it’ll come to iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCY0YI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.rockstargames.com/en/game/buy-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition"&gt;A new site launched&lt;/a&gt; today (the 20th anniversary of &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/em&gt; arriving on the PS2) that sheds a little light on some of the upgrades coming to the collection. It states that each game has “brilliant new lighting and environmental upgrades, with high-resolution textures, increased draw distances, &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt;-style controls and targeting, and much more, bringing these beloved worlds to life with all new levels of detail.” Having similar controls to &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt; could do a lot to make these classic games feel more modern.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s unreleased Core i9-12900K processor goes on sale early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m005alGBgku-EY_bBAnUFTpL-bs=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70030065/intelcorei912900k.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel’s Core i9-12900K hasn’t even been officially announced yet.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Seby9123/" target="_blank"&gt;Seby9123&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RBfAtv"&gt;Intel hasn’t even officially announced its new Core i9-12900K processor, but it’s already been sold by a retailer. The unreleased CPU is expected to be the flagship for Intel’s new line of Alder Lake processors, offering a chance to reclaim the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21552336/amd-zen-3-ryzen-review-roundup-5950x-intel-comparison"&gt;performance crown from AMD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrWEGx"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/qcszo9/so_i_somehow_got_one_of_these/"&gt;Reddit poster&lt;/a&gt;, spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/91523-photos-intel-alder-lake-packaging-leak.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Techspot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, managed to purchase two Core i9-12900K processors in retail packaging from an unnamed retailer for $610 per CPU. A similar mix-up happened earlier this year, when retailers started selling Intel’s Rocket Lake CPUs nearly a month before their launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CH1GIN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This unreleased CPU is useless without a new motherboard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nfstp0"&gt;The Reddit poster has published a number of photos of the unreleased Core i9-12900K processor in its retail packaging, which matches leaks from &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-core-i9-12900k-and-core-i7-i5-alder-lake-series-packaging-has-been-leaked"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. The box includes a wafer ornament, but it doesn’t detail the processor frequency or even its core count. As Z690 motherboards aren’t yet available, the processor is useless without them, so the Reddit poster can’t post benchmarks or any information about the Core i9-12900K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0xDK6"&gt;We’re still waiting on Intel to officially detail its flagship processor, and the motherboards that will support it. A number of Asus Z690 motherboards &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-z690-rog-strix-motherboards-for-intel-alder-lake-cpus-leaked"&gt;leaked earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, but without specs or feature lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fu4ClJ"&gt;Intel is rumored to be launching its Alder Lake desktop CPUs, with the flagship Core i9-12900K, later this month. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22631059/intel-alder-lake-chip-hybrid-architecture-day-2021-desktop-laptop-preview-cores"&gt;Alder Lake will feature&lt;/a&gt; Intel’s latest hybrid architecture: a mix of both performance and efficiency x86 cores. Alder Lake will also include support for DDR5, PCIe Gen 5, Thunderbolt 4, and Wi-Fi 6E.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elgato’s app that turns iPhones into webcams gets AR Snap Lens support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4NlcnDrltm4N3iycmRoLeNvogIU=/0x0:2553x1702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70030034/msedge_AUo0F80iib.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Elgato&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I5TAav"&gt;EpocCam, the app from streaming brand Elgato that lets you repurpose your iPhone as a webcam for your PC or Mac, has been updated with native support for Snap Lenses augmented reality filters, &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/21/2318449/0/en/Elgato-Partners-with-Snap-to-Bring-Snap-Lenses-to-Mobile-Webcam-App-EpocCam.html"&gt;Elgato’s parent company Corsair has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The functionality comes thanks to a partnership with Snap, who already offers similar filters natively in the Snapchat app, as well as with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22276091/zoom-snap-camera-filter-how-to-youtube-cat"&gt;Snap Camera software&lt;/a&gt;. Now the functionality is included natively in the EpocCam app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nR9DQl"&gt;There are a total of 15 Snap Lenses for EpocCam, which include virtual backgrounds, virtual masks, and customizable filters. “Become your digital avatar, colorize your hair, interact with animated characters, and much more,” &lt;a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/epoccam"&gt;promises Elgato’s website&lt;/a&gt;, which also notes that the Snap Lenses work with the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/epoccam-webcam-for-mac-and-pc/id449133483"&gt;free version of EpocCam&lt;/a&gt; as well as its &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/epoccam-webcamera-for-computer/id435355256"&gt;$7.99 Pro version&lt;/a&gt;. The company says it plans to add more filters over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R4zi4H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Become your digital avatar, colorize your hair, interact with animated characters, and much more”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cMwBCn"&gt;Elgato advertises that EpocCam lets you use your iPhone as a webcam across a range of services including Zoom, Teams, and OBS Studio, which means these filters should be able to transform your appearance regardless of whether you’re streaming, or participating in an important work call. In theory, this could have previously been possible by using a combination of the EpocCam and Snap Camera apps, but now it’s all neatly integrated and officially supported in a single piece of software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MWvqeV"&gt;If you’d like to give the feature a try, EpocCam is available as a &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/epoccam-webcam-for-mac-and-pc/id449133483"&gt;free download on iOS&lt;/a&gt;, though its &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/epoccam-webcamera-for-computer/id435355256"&gt;$7.99 version&lt;/a&gt; includes extra features like being able to use your iPhone’s microphone, and also removes the software’s watermark from your feed. Unfortunately there’s no sign of an Android version.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PUBG: New State arrives on iOS and Android on November 11th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EPNtL00A7dQnLYcHRPZOGQPQgZA=/0x0:1894x1263/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70029953/msedge_dX2AbABxCv.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Krafton&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SOEq8q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State&lt;/em&gt;, the upcoming free-to-play mobile game, will release on iOS and Android on November 11th, its &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/krafton-to-globally-launch-pubg-new-state-on-nov-11-857106352.html"&gt;publisher Krafton announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The game is set in the year 2051, and will offer a futuristic take on the multiplayer-focused PUBG formula with new features like weapon customization and in-game drones. &lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt; will be available in over 200 countries and 17 languages at launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0nwwi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt; is a significant launch for the PUBG series, which popularized the battle royale genre after the launch of its first title in 2017. Although &lt;em&gt;New State &lt;/em&gt;isn’t its first mobile entry, following the launch of PUBG Mobile in 2018, it’s the first to have been made by the game’s original developer, PUBG Studios. Development of the original PUBG Mobile was handled primarily by Chinese tech giant Tencent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZgTyPn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Strong anti-cheat” measures have been promised&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aySGaS"&gt;PUBG Studios emphasizes that New State will come with “strong anti-cheat” measures at launch, and that the company will be actively monitoring the community to catch problems before they grow too widespread. The PUBG games have had big problems with cheaters in the past, with &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ywj3/inside-the-worlds-largest-video-game-cheating-empire"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that one cheat-making group allegedly made over $70 million selling cheats for PUBG Mobile. PUBG is far from the only game to have had these problems, however. Other companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724037/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-system-kernel-level-driver"&gt;Activision&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690670/epic-eac-anti-cheat-linux-valve-steam-deck-support-games"&gt;Valve &lt;/a&gt;have made news recently with their efforts to prevent cheating in their games and hardware, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBZJMh"&gt;Like previous PUBG games, &lt;em&gt;New State &lt;/em&gt;is centered around multiplayer matches. Up to 100 players enter a map, and one player or squad emerges victorious. There’ll be four maps available at launch in &lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt;, including franchise staple Erangel, and PUBG Studios is promising to regularly update it with new content over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjlDMD"&gt;Away from mobile, Krafton plans to release another PUBG-related game for PC and consoles by next year, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-18/coding-prodigy-behind-hit-game-pubg-eyes-ipo-worth-billions?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported in January&lt;/a&gt;. There are also plans for a new survival horror game set in the PUBG universe three centuries in the future, which will release in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwakPS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s95wND"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new M1 Max MacBook Pro is getting a virtual turbo button for High Power Mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/krArQY3jBfR0B6ySC0B94G31n3w=/147x0:1761x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70029214/lcimg_2d0f1c7f_4824_4e90_b501_7d917bcd4ae2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NUm69G"&gt;Apple wants you to think of its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733328/apple-macbook-pro-ports-professional-specs"&gt;M1 Max MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; as a beast of a machine — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tobL8U7dQo"&gt;it actually calls it a “beast” in the ad&lt;/a&gt; — but the upcoming macOS Monterey, which ships alongside the new Macs, will unleash its full potential. &lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;contributor Steve Moser discovered a new “High Power Mode” in the operating system’s recent beta release that can “optimize performance to better support resource intensive tasks,” and apparently, spin up the fan to compensate for that. Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; that the mode is legit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="828eeI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Found more information on the high power power mode in the macOS RC: “Your Mac will optimize performance to better support resource-intensive tasks. This may result in louder fan noise.” &lt;a href="https://t.co/4q3zlbyLnf"&gt;https://t.co/4q3zlbyLnf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/0mKVekGa0M"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0mKVekGa0M&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Moser (@SteveMoser) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1450272709787766793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cWiJkc"&gt;Remember when some powerful laptops came with a physical turbo button or slider? Sounds like Apple does! (Though you can certainly emulate this sort of thing by playing with power modes and fan curves on many Windows machines as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hRrP1S"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports the new feature is exclusive to the 16-inch MacBook Pro with M1 Max, even though it’s possible to configure a 14-inch MacBook Pro with that chip as well. It also apparently won’t work with the M1 Pro or original M1 models, so you’re looking at laptops with a starting price of $3,099 and up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AReM2A"&gt;It’ll be interesting to see whether this High Power Mode unlocks additional performance, or whether it’s actually required to see the kinds of results the company claimed on stage for prolonged periods of time. Apple’s had occasional issues with thermal throttling in the past, such as in 2018 when a Core i9 MacBook Pros wound up slower than the Core i7 version under sustained loads, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17605652/macbook-pro-thermal-throttling-apple-software-fix"&gt;though Apple said that particular issue was down to a bug&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/25/17611266/apple-macbook-pro-review-2018-core-i9-15-inch"&gt;fixed it with an update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b336qd"&gt;Apple’s paying a lot of attention to thermals these days. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559228/apple-new-macbook-air-pro-difference-arm-m1-fan-thermal-performance"&gt;The single biggest difference between the 2020 M1 MacBook Air and 2020 M1 MacBook Pro was a fan&lt;/a&gt;, and it was a meaningful difference, because the extra thermal headroom meant the Pro could sustain peak performance for longer. That’s why I’m not surprised this high power mode is exclusive to the 16-inch model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zJfnKk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple is ready to admit it was wrong about the future of laptops","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22734645/apple-macbook-pro-2021-ports-magsafe-touch-bar-usb-c-future"},{"title":"Apple finally listened to the pros","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733328/apple-macbook-pro-ports-professional-specs"},{"title":"Apple added a secret button to your iPhone, and you may not have even noticed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21540028/apple-iphone-ios-14-back-tap-hidden-secret-button-gesture"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="N1DAbm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 22nd, 12:19AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that MacRumors has confirmed with Apple that this mode is real.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iFixit took a peek underneath the Apple Watch Series 7’s larger display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Watch Series 7 teardown" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UQtiqu6CTaHpkru5HduODV1SUKA=/0x245:5843x4140/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70029041/Apple_Watch_S7_21_guide_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Watch Series 7 teardown | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/53688/three-former-apple-engineers-helped-us-tear-down-apple-watch-series-7" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dYGSz2"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;our review of the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;, Dieter Bohn called it the best smartwatch while noting the new model’s changes as “smaller iterations” year-over-year than we previously expected. Even those small improvements required some reengineering. To appreciate those efforts, the folks from&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F53688%2Fthree-former-apple-engineers-helped-us-tear-down-apple-watch-series-7&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F21%2F22738876%2Fapple-watch-series-7-teardown-ifixit-diagnostic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; iFixit teamed up with former Apple engineers to investigate the new parts&lt;/a&gt; and get some insight into how the changes came to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fJoxT4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2lD2llGLJzk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JmSg7r"&gt;Ex-Apple product designer Tobias is now with &lt;a href="https://instrumental.com/about?utm_medium=Network&amp;amp;utm_source=Partner%20Referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Content&amp;amp;utm_group=ifixit&amp;amp;utm_subgroup="&gt;Instrumental&lt;/a&gt;. He points out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lD2llGLJzk"&gt;in a video&lt;/a&gt; that by looking at the back of the display, we can see that for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;Series 7&lt;/a&gt;, Apple removed a ribbon cable, combining touch and display signals into one cable instead of two. That helped shrink the device’s bezels, but Tobias says in a video that he’s “fairly certain” the complexity of that change and how it rippled through the supply chain is the reason why this Watch was slightly delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYGtzD"&gt;A more surprising moment is when they found out that the Apple Watch Series 6 battery fits in, and works with, the newer model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDSNXT"&gt;Of course, another element of the teardown is what’s not inside the new Apple Watch — an old diagnostic port. Since the earliest versions, it had been hiding inside the watch’s wristband groove, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690061/apple-watch-series-7-wireless-dock-data-transfer-port-free"&gt;now Apple has replaced it with wireless technology&lt;/a&gt;. Is this a hint at an iPhone without ports? We can’t tell yet, but the teardown will show you how everything came together to make the device less susceptible to cracking, better at resisting dust and water, and just that tiny bit better than the Series 6.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is finally letting everyone create Spaces</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter’s blue bird silhouette logo on a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZSDllvvyyCq-i1Yd3T07YWkQc0M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70028642/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ziSlaK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187490/twitter-spaces-test-voice-chat-rooms"&gt;Twitter first launched Spaces in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; as an attempt to eclipse Clubhouse’s success with its own version of audio-centric chatrooms — but the ability to actually host a Space was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;limited to Twitter users with 600 followers or more&lt;/a&gt;. Now, almost one year later, Twitter is finally giving all of its users the ability to host a Space, which is a privilege that arguably should’ve been granted long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chGhyV"&gt;Twitter is a bit behind on its own schedule, considering it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323767/twitter-spaces-april-release-date-plan"&gt;promised that everyone would be able to start up a Space back in April&lt;/a&gt;. The Spaces team sent out a tweet to announce the change, noting that users on both Android and iOS will now be able to host Spaces. It also offers a GIF that briefly refreshes users on how to host a Space, in case you’ve forgotten after all these months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b3cTwz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;the time has arrived -- we’re now rolling out the ability for everyone on iOS and Android to host a Space&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;if this is your first time hosting, welcome! here’s a refresher on how &lt;a href="https://t.co/cLH8z0bocy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cLH8z0bocy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1451239134798942208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xaOCiW"&gt;Twitter has been getting ahead of itself over the entire year, releasing a slew of new features for Spaces, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611609/twitter-spaces-co-host-feature-moderate-manage-social-audio-rooms"&gt;the ability to add co-hosts&lt;/a&gt; and up to 10 speakers. It created a fund for Spaces creators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724450/twitter-spaces-accelerator-spark-clubhouse-creators"&gt;called the Spark Program&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644283/twitter-ticketed-spaces-live-audio-test"&gt;piloted Ticketed Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise known as audio rooms that require you to pay for entry. This is all without giving all users the most vital ability of all: the option to host their own rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1W134b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586845/clubhouse-open-beta-invite-access-android-ios"&gt;Clubhouse came out of an invite-only state in July&lt;/a&gt;, and mobile users have been able to play around with the app ever since. With Twitter only lifting restrictions on hosting privileges now, it might’ve missed an important window to get users interested in using the feature. As Spaces grows, will it hasten Clubhouse’s demise, or will it end up as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605888/please-post-twitter-fleets-last-day-final-moments"&gt;an abandoned feature like the Stories-like Fleets&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rare Apple VideoPad prototype scrapped by Steve Jobs set to be auctioned</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An open Apple VideoPad in front of a blank background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f_b6YXjP-hLqffBgOqs-LLAImHY=/0x63:960x703/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70028461/AppleVideoPad.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple VideoPad 2 | Photo: Bonhams&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dv50OY"&gt;The long-lost Apple VideoPad 2 prototype is &lt;a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26897/lot/55/"&gt;going up for auction in November&lt;/a&gt; as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26897/"&gt;History of Science and Technology auction&lt;/a&gt; by Bonhams, an international auction house, in Los Angeles. The VideoPad will be auctioned alongside other Apple prototypes and Steve Jobs memorabilia and is estimated to sell between $8,000 and $12,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2lwN2"&gt;Developed between 1993 and 1995 with VideoPad 1 and 3 (the only two examples shown to the public), this only surviving PDA prototype was Apple’s next attempt after the Newton Message Pad. Unlike the Newton Message Pad, the fold-up screen apparently included a built-in camera for video conferencing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNNu9o"&gt;Despite being designed to be ahead of its time, it was canceled along with Newton OS after Jobs’ return to the company in 1997. &lt;a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26897/lot/55/"&gt;According to Bonhams&lt;/a&gt;, that was after Jobs realized the technology was not yet at the level required for a positive user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J09er5"&gt;The device was produced from conceptual design sketches drawn by former CEO John Sculley. The design never made it to the public, but it was a super early vision for a tablet, and if you squint, you can see a line drawn between it and successful devices like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/27/21083369/apple-ipad-10-years-launch-steve-jobs-tablet-market"&gt;the iPhone and iPad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft fixes Windows 11 AMD CPU performance issues with new update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qTBFbgNKMLy32uOMd4YmxPQVl5U=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70028206/windows11darkmode.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EWvRsv"&gt;Microsoft is releasing a new Windows 11 update today that fixes some of the AMD CPU performance issues. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713310/windows-11-amd-ryzen-processors-performance-issues-software-update-october"&gt;AMD and Microsoft found two issues&lt;/a&gt; with Windows 11 on Ryzen processors at launch, with one causing L3 cache latency to triple and slowing performance by up to 15 percent in certain games. Microsoft is now &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/october-21-2021-kb5006746-os-build-22000-282-preview-03190705-0960-4ba4-9ee8-af40bef057d3"&gt;fixing this particular issue with Windows 11 Build 22000.282&lt;/a&gt;, available to all Windows 11 users today as an optional update in Windows Update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaefpY"&gt;While the last Windows 11 update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22723998/windows-11-update-amd-ryzen-cpu-performance-worse"&gt;made these issues worse&lt;/a&gt;, today’s patch should fix them for good on the L3 cache latency side. The second outstanding issue affects AMD’s preferred core technology, which shifts threads over to the fastest core on a processor. AMD says this second bug could impact performance on CPU-reliant tasks, and AMD has &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/pa-400"&gt;already released a new chipset driver to address it&lt;/a&gt;,  under version &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-ryzen-chipset-3-10-08-506"&gt;3.10.08.506&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QvkCEW"&gt;This new Windows 11 update also includes a large amount of fixes, including one to solve an issue that prevents the Start menu from opening after your OS upgrade, and fixes to input delays for certain Bluetooth mice and keyboards. You can find the full list of fixes that are part of this patch over at &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/10/15/releasing-windows-11-build-22000-282-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/"&gt;Microsof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/october-21-2021-kb5006746-os-build-22000-282-preview-03190705-0960-4ba4-9ee8-af40bef057d3"&gt;t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/10/15/releasing-windows-11-build-22000-282-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/"&gt;’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0fibV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 21st, 5:31PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about AMD updates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel CEO warns chip shortage won’t end until at least 2023, as laptop sales get hit by supply issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iwuRjwi3VhdtZQhfvsQzikeVuWs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70028314/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sJFTHu"&gt;The ongoing global chip shortage is going to be a problem for a lot longer, according to Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, who reiterated today ahead of the &lt;a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1505/intel-reports-third-quarter-2021-financial-results"&gt;company’s Q3 earnings&lt;/a&gt; that he expects the shortage to extend until at least 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n123dc"&gt;“We’re in the worst of it now; every quarter next year, we’ll get incrementally better, but they’re not going to have supply-demand balance until 2023,” &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/intel-intc-earnings-q3-2021.html"&gt;Gelsinger told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1hib1"&gt;Intel rival AMD seemed to have more optimistic expectations, with AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su commenting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697339/amd-crypto-mining-ceo-lisa-su-gpu-code-conference"&gt;at the 2021 Code Conference&lt;/a&gt; that while supply would be “likely tight” for the near future, “it’ll get better in 2022” as production capacity continues to ramp. “It gets better next year, not immediately, but it’ll gradually get better as more plants come up.” Nvidia, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022"&gt;shared a similar expectation of supply issues&lt;/a&gt; throughout 2022 for its GPUs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="342Qm8"&gt;Intel’s less-than-cheerful outlook comes as the company announced a 2-percent dip in revenue for the Client Computing Group that produces its desktop and laptop chips, led by a 5-percent drop in notebook sales that Intel attributed to “notebook ecosystem constraints” — meaning that laptop companies just don’t have enough parts to go around. It’s a pattern we’ve already seen in other reports, with analysts already highlighting component shortages as a key factor in recently slowed laptop sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hqvAOq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"US PC market declines due to supply issues just as Windows 11 launches","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722151/us-pc-market-decline-supply-issues-windows-11-launch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XTrHgW"&gt;Part of the problem isn’t always shortages in chips specifically, but rather with combinations of parts. “We call it match sets, where we may have the CPU, but you don’t have the LCD, or you don’t have the Wi-Fi. Data centers are particularly struggling with some of the power chips and some of the networking or ethernet chips,” Gelsinger explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCqwG7"&gt;Some of that dip was offset by growth in desktop PCs, where Intel saw revenue gains of 20 percent for the category, but those weren’t enough to compensate for the drop in notebook sales. PC sales had been on a downward track for roughly a decade, before the pandemic — and the shift for millions to remote work and school — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575037/pc-market-q2-growth-slowing-chip-shortage-covid-demand"&gt;caused sales to skyrocket again&lt;/a&gt;. But with people starting to return to offices and in-person education, that growth was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575037/pc-market-q2-growth-slowing-chip-shortage-covid-demand"&gt;already starting to slow down earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, an issue that’s been compounded by recent component shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wf4zp7"&gt;Despite the dip in laptop revenue, Intel still saw its total revenue rise by 5 percent year-over-year to $18.1 billion, thanks to big growths in its data center, internet-of-things, and Mobileye groups, although Intel missed its July guidance by $0.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
