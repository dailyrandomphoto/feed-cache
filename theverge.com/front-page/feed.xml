    <title>Verizon says problems with phone calls in Southern California are now fixed</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o4yCkB"&gt;Many Verizon customers in Southern California reported difficulties making calls on Tuesday afternoon, and the company confirmed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time that was a “network issue” affecting voice services in parts of the region. That issue was resolved overnight, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4u39G"&gt;During the outage, if you were having trouble making calls, the spokesperson recommended putting your device in airplane mode or restarting your phone, which they said should fix the issues. And in response to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VZWSupport/status/1387143438316064784"&gt;one person on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, Verizon’s support account recommended using Wi-Fi “if possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jrHKmG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We do apologize, Verizon is currently experiencing a wireless network issue in your area. Our technicians are aware of this issue and are working to resolve it quickly. It is best to use Wi-Fi if possible. Please also enable Data Roaming. *AOR&lt;/p&gt;— Verizon Wireless CS (@VZWSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VZWSupport/status/1387143438316064784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qx0gQT"&gt;On Tuesday, I found &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/carlisleshelley/status/1387139550410010627"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgeGoff20/status/1387140510335205377"&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; of people &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RickyJimenez/status/1387140515435466752"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tscarrithers/status/1387140551258951681"&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; making phone calls in Southern California, but it wasn’t clear exactly how far the outage extended or exactly which areas might have been affected. Downdetector’s &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/"&gt;map of user reports&lt;/a&gt; strongly indicated that the outage is affected Los Angeles, San Diego, and the surrounding areas. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="PSbVCq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 28th, 2:29PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added confirmation from Verizon that the outage was fixed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You’ll soon be able to teach Google Assistant how to pronounce names</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DnxwiJEmRj9DxUcb85nclwy_mmc=/0x0:2352x1568/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69200487/Screen_Shot_2021_04_28_at_11.01.22_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gXDpl6"&gt;Google Assistant is getting a better way to correct its name pronunciation, as well as improved contextual awareness when it comes to setting and changing timers with your voice. &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/assistant/loud-and-clear-ai-improving-assistant-conversations/"&gt;In the blog post announcing the changes&lt;/a&gt;, Google says they should be rolling out in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7nDBb"&gt;If Assistant has been pronouncing your name wrong, the new way to try to fix that is pretty simple: you can just say your name out loud, and Google will try to learn the pronunciation. The old way, which is still available for those who wanted it, required you to spell out the way you wanted your name pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ysRHol"&gt;If you’re looking to try it for yourself, you can go to the Google Assistant settings, then Basic Info, then Nickname. It is worth noting that you can’t completely divorce your text name from the pronunciation — telling it to call me “Jennifer” while having my nickname as Mitchell resulted in it saying “Mithl” (like &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/LNzFqI6LfNw?t=119"&gt;Mithril&lt;/a&gt;, without the ri).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uirJo"&gt;The blog post and video also show that this will work for other contacts, too — great if you have friends whose names the Assistant constantly mispronounces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rbWBvE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Hw6sywPYY0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KWT9vM"&gt;Google’s also adding more contextual awareness to timers, using its language understanding tech known as “BERT.” Practically, this should unlock all sorts of functionality: the ability to say things like “cancel my second timer,” and canceling named timers without having to use the exact name that you gave (the example Google uses in its video is canceling a timer called “boiled potatoes” by saying “cancel my boiling potato timer”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KckUuH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b9xXeXxxckc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eNyhQ2"&gt;It should also fix a problem I’ve often run into: When you create an alarm, and then tell the Assistant to add an hour to it, it’ll most likely just create an alarm for an hour in the future. With the new language processing, it should understand that you actually want your alarm to go off an hour later than it was originally set for. It should also handle flubs better, like if you were to say “set a timer for five, no wait, nine minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMcRMw"&gt;Google says that this sort of natural conversation should be coming to more areas of the Assistant soon. For now, it seems that most of the work is being done around timers, but who knows where it’ll come to next? Google Assistant has done a pretty good job of being conversational in web searches for a while now, but the BERT tech could make it even more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is finally fixing Windows 10 rearranging apps on multiple monitors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XeNHyi9Pmy-wc8G8XvauhLRkKU8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69200281/VRG_ILLO_4030_Windows_10_Guide_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vDGjU6"&gt;If you’re a Windows user and you use multiple monitors, you’ve probably experienced the headache of apps randomly rearranging when you resume from sleep. There have been a variety of ways to work around this over the years, but Microsoft is finally addressing it and fixing it in a future Windows 10 update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArTIVM"&gt;“The technical terminology we use to describe this problem is known as Rapid Hot Plug Detect (Rapid HPD),” &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/avoid-unexpected-app-rearrangement/"&gt;explains Michelle Xiong&lt;/a&gt;, a program manager on the graphics team at Microsoft. “This behavior impacts DisplayPort multi-monitor setups which results in unwanted desktop rearrangements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KE9Cpx"&gt;This problem is particularly troublesome if you’re using a laptop with a secondary screen or an additional monitor goes into deep sleep and Windows thinks it has been unplugged. Windows will then go ahead and move all of your apps onto another screen, and you have to drag them all back manually. It’s a giant headache if you experience the issue daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hhPt8Y"&gt;Microsoft has been working on preventing Rapid HPD from rearranging Windows apps, and a fix is coming in the big Windows 10 update that’s due later this year. Windows Insiders can currently get access to this with build 21287 or above, but it does mean running a beta version of the OS on a device. Microsoft is expected to ship this final update in October, but if you can’t wait then you can go ahead and try it right now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to stream President Joe Biden’s first joint address to Congress</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SUMMIT-CLIMATE-DIPLOMACY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T8lzSlfosZ9pD8MZvhyVPmhephA=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69200123/1232457998.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9xeT4j"&gt;President Biden will deliver his first joint address to Congress on Wednesday. There will be an unusually small crowd in the House chamber due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, but the event will be streamed on social media platforms for viewers across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdbH4N"&gt;Biden’s speech is expected to touch on a series of administration priorities, including the pandemic, immigration, and tax reform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRyqC2"&gt;Here’s how to watch the address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MNJuVw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW DO I WATCH THE ADDRESS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Nr2GMa"&gt;Biden’s address will be broadcast across major networks such as CNN, Fox, NBC, PBS, and C-SPAN. The White House will also be streaming the event on its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh87V3f0FaA"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh87V3f0FaA"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;, and on Twitter from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/whitehouse"&gt;@WhiteHouse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/potus"&gt;@POTUS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcFqmR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/whitehouse"&gt;The Twitter stream&lt;/a&gt; will be accompanied by live on-screen “commentary” from administration officials and cabinet members, according to Rob Flaherty, White House director of digital strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oKbZV4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHEN DOES THE ADDRESS START?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0u6DF"&gt;Biden’s first joint address at the US Capitol will begin at 9PM ET on Wednesday, April 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T7t3Bu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM THE STATE OF THE UNION?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VFnUGN"&gt;It’s traditional for a president’s first address to Congress to be called a “joint address” rather than the State of the Union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuaXQK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Over the past two decades, the idea of “googling something” has become a standard part of language, so dominant has Google’s search engine become in popular culture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2gamz"&gt;On an unrelated note, today — 526 days after its initial launch — Google has finally added a &lt;a href="https://community.stadia.com/t5/Stadia-Community-Blog/Search-Now-on-Stadia-More-Updates-Coming-Soon/ba-p/59259"&gt;search bar to the Stadia store&lt;/a&gt; to better allow customers to search through &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Stadia_games"&gt;the 172 games currently available&lt;/a&gt; on the service. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h3R0io"&gt;In addition to the new, revolutionary search bar (which Google says will be reaching all players this week), Stadia is also debuting a new way to sort players’ libraries to track purchased, free, and Stadia Pro games. The company also teased an upcoming activity feed that it plans to roll out in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google expands its Android-based earthquake detection system </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Android" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ukmXoKZ9hPuePxDgZt89sRczIo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199998/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0057.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google is turning Android phones into an earthquake detection system. | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zYWw01"&gt;Google is expanding its Android-based earthquake detection and alert system, filling in gaps in places where there are few seismometers and no early warning systems. Starting today, the program that launched in California last year will also&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;be available in Greece and New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ik8YvR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Filling in gaps in places where there are few seismometers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kTmWM4"&gt;This also marks a new step for Google; it’s the first time the company will handle everything from detecting the earthquake to warning individuals. Android devices will first sense waves generated by quakes. Google then analyzes data from the phones and sends out an early warning alert to users in the affected area. Users will get the alerts automatically unless they opt out of the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDIHgd"&gt;When Google started on this endeavor, it worked with the United States Geological Survey and the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services to send earthquake alerts to Android users in California. This feature is now available in Oregon and will expand to Washington in May. Last year, Google started gathering earthquake data from phones. It then used that data to provide information to users if they searched for “earthquake” or “earthquake near me” on their phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOd6oK"&gt;Google’s system works because each phone is already equipped with an accelerometer, which can detect movement. The accelerometer can also detect primary and secondary earthquake waves, almost acting as a “mini seismometer, joining millions of other Android phones out there to form the world’s largest earthquake detection network,” &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/earthquake-detection-and-alerts/"&gt;according to Google&lt;/a&gt;. Seismometers are devices that detect ground movement, like earthquakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wV0hmm"&gt;“It’d be great if there were just seismometer-based systems everywhere that could detect earthquakes,” Marc Stogaitis, principle Android software engineer at Google, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21362370/android-earthquake-detection-seismometer-epicenter-shakealert-google"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year. Because of costs and maintenance, he says, “that’s not really practical and it’s unlikely to have global coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fQZMo8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"ANDROID IS BECOMING A WORLDWIDE EARTHQUAKE DETECTION NETWORK ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21362370/android-earthquake-detection-seismometer-epicenter-shakealert-google"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hzhyzO"&gt;There are some limitations to Google’s system. People closest to the quake probably won’t get much advance warning since they’ll be the first ones to detect the quake. But their phones will help give a heads-up to others farther away, giving them crucial time to take shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8eU6U"&gt;Android is the &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272698/global-market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-since-2009/#:~:text=Android%20maintained%20its%20position%20as,of%20the%20global%20market%20share."&gt;leading OS system&lt;/a&gt; for smartphones, so this service has a lot of room to grow. Eventually, Google could develop an API based on its earthquake detection system that could have farther-reaching effects. Other systems could use the API to let people off an elevator or open firehouse doors before losing power, Dieter Bohn &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21362370/android-earthquake-detection-seismometer-epicenter-shakealert-google"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year. That’s still pretty far off but could make a huge difference in keeping people safe during future earthquakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2sFOb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XhuwF4"&gt;Epic Games is holding back &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;from being available on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393793/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-iphone-ipad-hands-on"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) service&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new deposition made public as part of the Epic case against Apple. The &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer views Microsoft’s xCloud service as competition to its PC offerings, and the company is deliberately not offering &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on xCloud as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNunvV"&gt;Joe Kreiner, Epic’s vice president of business development, was questioned over why &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;isn’t available on xCloud, and confirmed it was a deliberate choice. “We viewed Microsoft’s efforts with xCloud to be competitive with our PC offerings,” says Kreiner in the deposition. The court document makes it appear like Kreiner may go on to explain why, but the next part of the questioning has been redacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaUhWx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is a free-to-play game on Xbox, and the only way to currently access the game on an iPhone is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;through Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud gaming service&lt;/a&gt;. Epic Games partnered with Nvidia last year to launch &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on GeForce Now and has helped Nvidia offer a number of other games from its PC game store on the Nvidia cloud gaming service, where all of the revenue from the original game’s purchase or any in-app purchases goes back to Epic rather than Nvidia. As far as Epic is concerned, the game is simply running on a PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ic6VPi"&gt;That is likely a key reason why Epic has favored Nvidia over Microsoft to host &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;in the cloud. Microsoft doesn’t currently allow rival game stores on Xbox or xCloud in any form, and all transactions go through Microsoft there. In fact, Kreiner even admits that Epic Games hasn’t tried to negotiate with Microsoft over the requirement to have to use the Xbox maker’s store and commerce engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9177sp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;Epic’s entire case against Apple&lt;/a&gt; is centered on the App Store, and the company believes Apple should allow rival app stores on iOS devices or rival payment processing platforms. Epic is trying to fight Apple’s App Store policies, a 30 percent (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;15 percent for some&lt;/a&gt;) cut for subscriptions and in-app purchases, and the removal of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from the App Store. Kreiner’s questioning is part of this ongoing lawsuit, and it’s a huge case that’s already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406303/imessage-android-eddy-cue-emails-apple-epic-deposition"&gt;shining a light&lt;/a&gt; on the practices throughout the mobile and game industry that result in consumers being able to access games and apps across devices beyond just the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vaccines should be the new bobbleheads at every sporting event </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Philadelphia 76ers v Milwaukee Bucks" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NUkpD-kFcW-ZCMA_RB_vAe7z5eQ=/0x0:7680x5120/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199923/1232505309.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sKlbe0"&gt;I’m proud of the Milwaukee Bucks for winning their game against the Hornets &lt;a href="https://www.brewhoop.com/2021/4/27/22406656/rapid-recap-bucks-hornets-milwaukee-charlotte-final-score-april-27-2021"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m also really proud of them for setting up a mobile COVID-19 vaccination site for their next home game. On Sunday, any fan in attendance can get their first dose of the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine through a partnership with the Milwaukee Health Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgsIsO"&gt;Game attendance is capped at 3,266 people, and the arena’s general manager Dennis Williams &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/04/27/bucks-vaccinations-home-game-nets/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the organization hopes to vaccinate at least a few hundred people. Facility employees will be able to get a shot as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VuImO"&gt;“It was important to try to capture as many people as possible,” Williams said, “and what better way than a Bucks game that sees 600 to 800 employees on top of the 3,266 who will be here on Sunday as well?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="K8rTfD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Bucks and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKEhealth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@MKEhealth&lt;/a&gt; to Offer COVID-19 Vaccinations at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FiservForum?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FiservForum&lt;/a&gt; to Eligible Fans Attending Sunday's Game &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZxNhPRmQK5"&gt;https://t.co/ZxNhPRmQK5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Milwaukee Bucks (@Bucks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Bucks/status/1387081092482621443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DNVwHx"&gt;Setting aside the initial decision to allow fans in an indoor arena at all without requiring that they be vaccinated first (fun police alert: it is still unfortunately a pandemic! Sorry!) — this is great. The New Orleans Pelicans are &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nba.com%2Fpelicans%2Fnews%2Fochsner-health-host-covid-19-vaccination-events-upcoming-pelicans-games&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F28%2F22407753%2Fcovid-vaccine-milwaukee-bucks-arena-nba" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hosting vaccination events&lt;/a&gt; at games as well, so I’m also proud of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNHy9V"&gt;The pace of vaccinations in the Untied States is starting to slow down now that almost all of the people most eager to be vaccinated have gotten their shots. The next phase of the campaign &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22399889/vaccine-supply-demand-antivirus-newsletter-covid"&gt;is harder&lt;/a&gt;: reaching people who may want to be vaccinated but aren’t actively seeking it out. Getting that group vaccinated will take new tactics and will mean giving people as many easy opportunities to roll up their sleeves as possible. That includes opening up walk-in appointments at pharmacies, making vaccines available at doctors’ offices, and putting mobile clinics at places where people spend their time — including sporting events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTZQDI"&gt;I hope to be offered a vaccine over the next few months more often than I’m offered random advertisement fliers on the streets of New York. Make a shot the new giveaway at every sporting event — save the bobbleheads for next season. Or put a Band-Aid on the bobbleheads and hand them out, too, if that seems more fun. Just give people as many places and ways to get vaccinated as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telegram’s group video calls will finally launch in May</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ixIbVRqXLhoVbk-Qj50vBt2inbc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199888/acastro_180417_1777_telegram_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TCa1EK"&gt;Telegram CEO Pavel Durov &lt;a href="https://t.me/durov/160"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that the iOS version of Telegram will be updated to support group video calls in May (&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/telegram-add-group-video-calls-125053371.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company originally planned to add the video call feature to its messaging service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21234254/telegram-messaging-app-group-video-calling-security-usability"&gt;at some point in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but the feature never materialized. Telegram did at least make it into the new year with one video call addition: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/15/21370420/telegram-video-calls-os-android"&gt;end-to-end encrypted one-on-one video calls&lt;/a&gt; were added in August 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXaM55"&gt;Durov’s announcement of the new launch date was shared — naturally — in his personal Telegram channel. He writes that group video calls will have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="jxGndK"&gt;Screen sharing, encryption, noise-cancelling, desktop and tablet support — everything you can expect from a modern video conferencing tool, but with Telegram-level UI, speed and encryption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qGq5qq"&gt;Telegram already offers end-to-end encryption on its one-on-one video calling, but the company hasn’t explicitly confirmed the feature here. We’ve reached out to confirm that it plans to offer the same on group video calls when they launch in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fc4J8B"&gt;Telegram has grown significantly over the pandemic, taking advantage of the shift to working from home and the general desire to stay connected securely. The company announced it reached &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/400-million"&gt;400 million monthly active users&lt;/a&gt; in April 2020, up from &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/200-million"&gt;200 million in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Some of that has to do with its competitor, WhatsApp, fumbling how it communicated its new privacy policy to customers, which inspired some users to leave the Facebook-owned app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;for Telegram and Signal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tihane"&gt;Despite seeming a bit less nimble, WhatsApp actually beat Telegram to offering end-to-end encrypted group video calls. The company&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/30/17632650/whatsapp-group-video-calling-feature-now-live"&gt; added group video and voice calling&lt;/a&gt; in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces a cheaper entry-level Galaxy Book with no OLED</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cfxlt71RR0VuLgL1KjMbk_Dp56g=/1x0:3799x2532/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199782/Galaxy_Book_15inch_MysticBlue_WiFi_Top_Wide_Open_210417022709.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Book comes in silver or this sleek blue color&lt;/em&gt; | Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZXPBjX"&gt;Samsung announced two entry-level Galaxy Book laptops at its Unpacked event: the Galaxy Book and the Galaxy Book Flex2 Alpha. The former will start at around $800 (according to Samsung, that price is subject to change) and will launch in the second half of 2021, whereas the Flex2 Alpha starts at $849 and is available for preorder now, shipping in mid-May. These round out the fleet of premium models announced today, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405540/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-features-price-photos-video-release-date"&gt;the Galaxy Book Pro and Pro 360&lt;/a&gt; with OLED screens that start at $999, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407647/samsungs-galaxy-book-odyssey-nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-gpu"&gt;$1,399 Galaxy Book Odyssey gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt; that’s the first to sport Nvidia’s new RTX 3050 Ti graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r7iI7N"&gt;Starting with the Galaxy Book, it has a 15.6-inch 1080p TFT LCD display, and it supports up to two fast NVMe SSDs. It has two USB-C ports (one of which can recharge the laptop with the included 65W charger), two USB-A 3.2 ports, an HDMI port, a headphone jack, a microSD card slot, and an optional nano SIM tray for LTE. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The silver color of the Galaxy Book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CxVrla"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/mediaresources/galaxy_book/techspecs"&gt;Samsung’s mobile press site&lt;/a&gt; shows that the Intel Pentium Gold or Celeron processor may show up in some models globally, but the company hasn’t confirmed what will be in the starting configuration in the US. A Samsung spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the final price and specs will be announced closer to its launch in the second half of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2Nso2"&gt;According to the site linked above, if you need more power, you’ll be able to bump it up to 11th Gen Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, with the option of taking advantage of their Iris Xe integrated graphics, or you can opt for Nvidia’s GeForce MX450 discrete graphics. The Galaxy Book can be upgraded to 16GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUvkoS"&gt;Rounding out the specs, the Galaxy Book comes in silver or blue, and every configuration will have a 54Wh battery. Similar to the Galaxy Book Pro lineup, this one supports Dolby Atmos audio. Its webcam is a 720p HD sensor with a dual array mic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book Flex2 Alpha" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o6rMz98wvPgYWczG0sNnkak92O8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475568/Galaxy_Book_Flex2_Alpha_012_R_Perspective_Windows_Mystic_Black_RGB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Book Flex2 Alpha will launch in black, blue, or silver.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RGpWxM"&gt;If you want a 2-in-1 laptop with a better QLED screen that’s still not as expensive as the Galaxy Book Pro, Samsung also announced two sizes (13.3 and 15.6 inches) of the new Galaxy Book Flex2 Alpha. Each model has a 1080p QLED display, and either Intel’s 11th Gen i5 or i7 processors. &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/galaxy-book-flex/buy/?modelCode=NP730QDA-KA1US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The price for the 13-inch model starts at $849&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6YSBX"&gt;The starting configuration includes 8GB of RAM, but supports up to 16GB, and the storage tops out at 512GB. It has a standard selection of ports, including two USB-A 3.0 ports, a USB-C port, a headphone jack, a power plug, HDMI, and a microSD slot. Like the Galaxy Book, this model also has a 54Wh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
