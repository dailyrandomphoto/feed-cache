    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. But, if you want an Echo Dot now, you can buy it for $35 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fpreselect%3D80770243%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which is $5 more than its lowest price yet. There is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; to show the time, weather, and other information on sale for $45 (usually $60). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHsulr"&gt;Amazon is also selling some bundles, including a $45 one that features &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one Sengled Bluetooth bulb&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Amazon-Smart-Charcoal/dp/B08GTWC9ZB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot and Amazon Smart Plug bundle&lt;/a&gt; available for the same price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;We have seen this product go down to $40; right now it is on sale for $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is also selling a bundle for $60 which includes an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition plus an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3GbSWO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;Currently, the fourth generation Echo is on sale for $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733330369536034962#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770246%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, Amazon is selling a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KVFM2XM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Echo for two Philips Hue bulbs&lt;/a&gt; for $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiNGuc"&gt;If you are looking for a pair of Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $160&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $40 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XqDD6Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=c8b1ed4e46d21c7660ba5ae3006737b8&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D411Fi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oiVOWB"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is the one to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90 and we have seen it go down as low as $45. At the moment, the Echo Show 5 is on sale for $50 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the Echo Show 5 on Amazon, you can also receive a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZD7VZG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year subscription to Food Network Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; at no extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJmJw1"&gt;Amazon also has a few bundles available; you can get an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089Q2RJH9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and three months of Amazon Kids Plus&lt;/a&gt; for $51, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086P992GD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $60, and an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SW188FP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 plus an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $70. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVFAcO"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling a bundle with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730445461281046110#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wwkfpq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GGyBnu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the Show 8 go down as low as $65. The Echo Show 8 is currently on sale for $75 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy an Echo Show 8 on Amazon, you will also receive a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZF1T9X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year subscription to Food Network Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x04s5v"&gt;There are also a few bundles available for a few dollars more. For $85 you can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an Echo Show 8 and a 1080 Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt;; or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YdQbrX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QJ2PFl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation Echo Show 10. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It is also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;There are no active deals going on right now for the Echo Show 10, but if you just want the device itself, you can get it for its usual price of $250 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551%3Fpreselect%3D80770248%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kppkjv"&gt;There are, however, a few bundles going on that throw in an additional item alongside the Echo Show 10. At Amazon, can buy the Echo Show 10 and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FRR5V57?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $40 on a one-year subscription&lt;/a&gt; to Food Network Kitchen. Additionally, the e-commerce site is offering a promotion, where you can save $100 off the price of two Echo Show 10 devices when you enter code &lt;strong&gt;SHOW102PACK &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGQIus"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SQ2F8D2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329393970906605#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; also have a bundle, which includes an Echo Show 10 and a Blink Mini HD security camera for $255.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 8 that’s 5G-ready on Verizon and other carriers is nearly half off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5o4K1c5CNAQrdSPOZFznB0CtG1I=/4x0:2296x1528/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980831/vzw.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Verizon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kdyIku"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is offering the best price we’ve seen on the OnePlus 8 in the onyx black colorway. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1615543-REG%2Foneplus_5011101036_8_5g_uw_smartphone.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F3%2F17%2F22335683%2Foneplus-8-verizon-amazon-echo-dot-clock-ea-play-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Originally $800, it’s just $450&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220454/oneplus-8-pro-verizon-carrier-price-release-date"&gt;unlocked Verizon variant&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only version that supports UWB 5G and sub-6GHz 5G when connected to Verizon’s network. Alternatively, it works with AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile’s networks if you’re with either of those. This model originally sold for more than the base OnePlus 8 because of its Verizon 5G compatibility, but at this point, B&amp;amp;H’s deal knocks its price down below that of the base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWvJSD"&gt;This model has a 6.5-inch OLED screen that has a 90Hz refresh rate. It features Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 processor, with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. We’re close to OnePlus announcing its latest phone, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323979/oneplus-9-pro-leak-images-hasselblad-camera"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;, though we don’t know yet how much that will cost. It’s safe to assume, though, it’ll likely cost much more than this discounted phone today. And with these specs and its 5G compatibility, you might not miss out on much by opting for the OnePlus 8 instead of waiting on the new phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ep6jbZ"&gt;It’s been a while since Amazon ran discounts on its latest Echo hardware, but you can get some decent price cuts today. One of its most useful devices, the Echo Dot with a built-in digital clock, is $15 off its usual price. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085M66LH1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This makes it $45&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is a little backed up on orders, claiming to deliver in late March or early April, depending on your color preference, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735153130507205842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is also honoring the deal&lt;/a&gt; if you prefer to not wait as long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2468nN"&gt;Check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;my colleague Dan Seifert’s review of the new Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which he claims have better sound quality than the previous version.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zRjaCpdNZS-Z545s1XVCsD1Oetc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21920671/XGP_EAPlay_HERO.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="psXZw6"&gt;If you game on Xbox One or one of the new Series X or Series S consoles, there’s still a way to get four months’ worth of Game Pass Ultimate for cheaper than usual. First, you’ll need to get a one-year subscription to EA Play, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014Q5UNH4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which costs $30&lt;/a&gt;. When you redeem it on your console, Microsoft will automatically convert it to a four-month Game Pass Ultimate subscription (usually $60 total).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JJfFw"&gt;Many games available through EA Play are on Game Pass now, in addition to a fleet of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325044/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-bethesda-games-list"&gt;newly added Bethesda games&lt;/a&gt; since Microsoft recently acquired the game publisher and its many studios.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ anniversary</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OfydKphyuEnfrEBj3Y6ZnqVFCR0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980827/Switch_ACNH_SummerUpdate_screen_14_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Twelve months of turnips, K.K. Slider, and more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="RIRTH7"&gt;It took less than a year for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21179238/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch-features"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to become one of the Nintendo Switch’s defining games. Launching around the same time that millions of people were forced inside due to the pandemic, and with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188006/animal-crossing-new-horizons-design-interview-aya-kyogoku-hisashi-nogami"&gt;a new design philosophy meant to shake up the series&lt;/a&gt;, the game became a cultural phenomenon. It turned into a social space where millions — from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21238703/animal-crossing-new-horizons-streetwear-fashion-outfits-nintendo-switch"&gt;streetwear enthusiasts&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22321111/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-archive-one-year-anniversary"&gt;museums&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/4/23/21233424/elijah-wood-animal-crossing-turnip-prices-stalk-market"&gt;movie stars&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21257183/animal-talking-new-horizons-elijah-wood-danny-trejo-gary-whitta-late-night-show"&gt;talk show hosts&lt;/a&gt; — could relax in a calm, quiet virtual world. As the community continued to find new and inventive ways to play, Nintendo steadily updated &lt;em&gt;New Horizons &lt;/em&gt;with new features and content. It’s gone on to sell more than 30 million copies to date — and it doesn’t look like things will slow down anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My favorite artist of 2020 was Animal Crossing’s singing dog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="K.K. Slider" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UEGYTSKOVZBOXQvU31CR26jqXgI=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980719/kksliderlede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="62ZQSp"&gt;I never play &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21179238/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch-features"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on mute. I love hearing the grass crunching under my character’s shoes, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2020/3/22/21188355/animal-crossing-new-horizons-language-video"&gt;the cutesy language that all of the villagers speak&lt;/a&gt;, and, of course, the sound effects tied to all of the emotes, like the signature piano noise that plays right before you’re about to get messed up by a bunch of angry bees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHjULa"&gt;But what makes the game really worth listening to closely is the music — specifically K.K. Slider’s tunes. He’s the king of cool, a crooning pup star among a bunch of normies that inhabit your island. And for the kind of dreadful year that 2020 was shaping up to be when &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; released, hearing K.K. Slider’s work was a beam of positivity that took me and my apartment over completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8zDBt"&gt;If you’ve played &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; games before, then you may already know several of the songs. But despite seeing him guest DJ every night at Club LOL in &lt;em&gt;New Leaf&lt;/em&gt; for the 3DS — my first serious foray into the franchise — the music didn’t really resonate with me then. Maybe it was the small screen or the tiny speakers. But when I hear one of K.K. Slider’s tunes in &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; with my Switch docked, I want to get up and dance... or at least engage in some serious head-bobbing. And for much of last year, that deep catalog of tunes was all I was humming between sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjK2Bb"&gt;Most of &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;’ music is comprised of acoustic, playful pop and light jazz grooves, but K.K.’s music dives more deeply into capturing different moods and genres. “K.K. Ska,” for instance, is a pop tune that can apparently be repurposed for wholesome memes. It didn’t really hit me just &lt;em&gt;how good&lt;/em&gt; this song was until I heard it attached to this very cheerful video on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ncTsuD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OfkViWKucCU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aZHtxR"&gt;If that kind of music doesn’t strike your fancy, how about something like “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5Gx1skphZw"&gt;K.K. Cruisin’&lt;/a&gt;,” “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyI106n2AvI"&gt;K.K. Groove&lt;/a&gt;,” or “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khoe2zCjZpk"&gt;K.K. Metal&lt;/a&gt;”? The catalog of tunes runs the gamut of new and older popular genres, plus a few oddities to show off Nintendo’s music-writing chops even more. The art team clearly had fun designing the album covers, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhbU19"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH33m9jfwyg"&gt;K.K. Jazz&lt;/a&gt;” cops the signature styling of a Blue Note Records jazz album — label insignia, two-toned layout, and all. Given the way &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; took off after launch, it’s no surprise people &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/4/21/21228752/animal-crossing-new-horizons-acnh-kk-slider-redraw-challenge-music-album-covers-nintendo-switch"&gt;started drawing their own K.K. Slider-inspired album art for real music&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ky5BY-_CZMLEUtUELxT1Ti0qF48=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374931/kkslidercomparo.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo isn’t subtle about its inspirations for K.K. Slider’s album art.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aENV86"&gt;Most of the songs in &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; aren’t new, but my enjoyment this time around had a lot to do with Nintendo’s methodical rollout (or withholding, depending on how you look at it) of K.K. Slider. Instead of having him immediately available to jam out, he’s struck it big as a musician and doesn’t have time for you and your island until you’ve proven it’s a happening place. It’s the end goal for the narrative of &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, and it feels like a real achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oHx8De"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a crooning pup star among a bunch of normies”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ACJYlH"&gt;While you work toward that goal, you can buy different K.K. Slider songs through the Nook Stop PC located in the Resident Services building. It’s usually possible to get a new song every couple of days. And with enough time, you’ll have a sizable catalog of songs that can play from a stereo in your home or a boombox to set up outside for other villagers to listen (and sometimes hum along) to. The music even sounds different, depending on the kind of stereo you purchase. Some gadgets add crackles to make K.K.’s songs sound like they’re on vinyl, and buying the full DJ kit really adds a lot of bass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUn1OA"&gt;Nintendo could have easily let the player stream K.K. Slider tunes through the Nook Phone. Instead, it turned the game’s main musical act into something you had to work toward and pay dearly to fully experience. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="KK Slider" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OgPNX6Qq14K5LQ58prD4jwQH3Co=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22375177/kkslidergif.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6AUsiM"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; hub on &lt;a href="https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/K.K._Slider_song_list_(New_Horizons)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fandom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there are 95 original compositions in the game. It’s well worth asking K.K. Slider to play one of them during his weekly visits, as you’ll get both a live acoustic performance and a bootleg for later use in a stereo at your home within the game. If you don’t want to go through that, just load some songs on YouTube. And if you really want to fall down a rabbit hole, people have contributed an endless trove of DIY covers in K.K. Slider’s vocal styling on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLNEgM"&gt;Now that we’re at the anniversary of the launch of &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, there aren’t many stones (proverbial, or otherwise) that I’ve left unturned. But whenever I do boot up the game, I’m always pleased to hear the songs that helped make my experience of living through 2020 a bit more pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s midrange phones now feature fast refresh rate screens, stabilized cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/69CPj9-NiG1F8ABRAFuhYmI4OH4=/0x330:4000x2997/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980752/32_galaxya52_a72_white_black_210310001526.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A52 and A72 feature quad rear-camera arrays, though the A72 includes a telephoto rather than depth-sensing camera.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tJQJa4"&gt;At its second Unpacked event of the year, Samsung officially unveiled three of its next A-series phones: the Galaxy A52, A52 5G, and A72. While the company isn’t sharing US pricing or availability yet, it has confirmed European pricing: €349 for the A52 (about $415), €429 for the A52 5G (about $510), and €449 for the A72 ($534).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NylpKT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laK8jm"&gt;Key specs across the board include IP67 water and dust resistance, brighter screens with faster refresh rates, and a 64-megapixel main camera with optical image stabilization. All three models include a microSD card slot for expandable storage and will ship with a charging brick in the box — features that you won’t find in the S21-series flagships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="24r4ZA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The A52’s display will offer a 90Hz refresh rate, while the A52 5G will have a 120Hz screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N4Lex2"&gt;Each is built on an unspecified octa-core (dual 2.3GHz + hexa 1.8GHz) processor and will ship with Android 11 and Samsung’s One UI 3.0. Storage variants of 128GB and 256GB will be offered for all models, with RAM configurations that will vary by region. Like all recent Galaxy phones, these devices are guaranteed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;at least four years of security updates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DdPhNi"&gt;The Galaxy A52 and A52 5G will both feature a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED screens. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278488/samsung-galaxy-a52-a72-leak-90hz-refresh-rate-screen"&gt;As rumored&lt;/a&gt;, the A52’s display will offer a 90Hz refresh rate, while the A52 5G will have a 120Hz screen. Each will feature a rear “quad” camera array, though one of those four cameras is a 5-megapixel depth sensor. The main 64-megapixel f/1.8 camera is accompanied by a 12-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide 5-megapixel macro and 32-megapixel f/2.2 selfie cam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tM8wo9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10396022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TFaxC9"&gt;Samsung says the A52 models feature brighter screens — up to 800 nits as compared to last year’s 600 — and 4,500mAh batteries capable of two days’ use on a single charge. And naturally, the A52 5G includes 5G connectivity, though Samsung hasn’t confirmed yet which frequencies it will support in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQP3P2"&gt;The Galaxy A72 offers a slightly larger 6.7-inch Super AMOLED screen with a 90Hz refresh rate. It offers the same basic rear camera array but includes an 8-megapixel f/2.4 3x telephoto camera instead of the depth sensor. The A72 is an LTE-only model; a 5G version is likely to come but Samsung hasn’t confirmed this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oVmRRQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10396033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LhkerI"&gt;We should find out US pricing and availability for these devices — and potentially other A-series models — in the next few weeks. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21212085/samsung-galaxy-a01-a11-a21-a51-a71-5g-mid-range-android-price-release-date"&gt;Last year’s&lt;/a&gt; A51 and A51 5G were introduced at $400 and $500, respectively, with the 5G version of the A71 coming in at $600. If this year’s models are priced similarly, these devices will be well-positioned to tempt midrange shoppers with features like fast refresh rate screens, stabilized main cameras, and IP ratings, which aren’t common in this class.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Unagi is expanding its electric scooter subscription service to more cities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gPDPDgejD6la-_mUtdDWD8JbvkM=/0x0:2732x1821/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980503/Unagi_Marek_Dziekonski_optimized_online16_res.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Unagi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eq38P9"&gt;Unagi, maker of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/17/18080142/unagi-electric-scooter-kickstarter-price-specs"&gt;stylish electric scooters&lt;/a&gt;, is bringing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21352552/unagi-electric-scooter-subscription-price-cities"&gt;nascent subscription service&lt;/a&gt; to more cities. After testing out its $40-a-month service in small parts of New York City and Los Angeles, the Oakland, California-based company is expanding its service area in both cities, while also bringing it to seven new markets, including San Francisco, Austin, Seattle, Phoenix, Miami, and Nashville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mwr8XJ"&gt;Helping fuel its growth, the company also just closed its first round of fundraising for $10.5 million, led by the Ecosystem Integrity Fund with participation from Menlo Ventures, Broadway Angels, and Gaingels, among others. Flush with cash, Unagi plans on adding more cities in the months ahead and is eyeing a launch in Europe as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJq7I7"&gt;“We understood that there are a lot of people who have fear of commitment,” Unagi CEO David Hyman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s partially generational. There’s a large generation of consumers that prefer access over ownership.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B6mFnXNQKrP6Uurtqpf070Dt3Xo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22376918/_IMG_2106_cropped__1_.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Unagi&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m7e6SO"&gt;Unagi first launched its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Funagiscooters.com%2Fpages%2Funagi-all-access-scooter-subscription%2F%3Fshow_sub_signup%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F17%2F22334608%2Funagi-electric-scooter-subscription-expansion-cities-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;All-Access subscription service&lt;/a&gt; last August in a few neighborhoods in New York City and LA. Hyman said the demand was “incredible,” though he declined to share any specifics figures. With the added cities, Hyman said Unagi All-Access will be available to over 30 million people — roughly one-tenth of the population of the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j1UBfu"&gt;There will be some changes to the original subscription. The price is increasing from $39 to $49 a month. There’s still an initial $50 service fee, but Unagi is now requiring subscribers to commit to at least three months before canceling. Maintenance and insurance from scooter theft or damage are also included in the monthly fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PxgSY5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We understood that there are a lot of people who have fear of commitment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IuNjXw"&gt;Originally, Unagi promised to deliver the scooter to customers within 24 hours. With the expanded service area and new markets, that wait time is being increased to 72 hours for at least the first four weeks after launch. After that point, the scooters should arrive via FedEx in under 48 hours. Previously, the scooters were being hand-delivered by a courier; now, they will arrive in the mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0H3tWV"&gt;“It’s almost like a Netflix DVD mailer, but just much bigger,” Hyman said of the new packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FmbHN0"&gt;Those interested in subscribing to an Unagi scooter should check the company’s website to ensure they reside in the service area. Another change from the initial service is a range of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054731/unagi-electric-scooter-dual-motor-color-paint-job-customize"&gt;colorful options&lt;/a&gt;. Subscribers can choose between four different colors for their scooter: “cosmic blue,” “sea salt” (white), “matte black,” and “scarlet fire.” (Hyman is an avowed Deadhead.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wHyGL"&gt;Like most electric scooters, Unagi’s vehicles are made in China. But unlike the hordes of cheap scooters you can find on Amazon, these scooters have a definite premium feel. Unagi’s Model One scooter has two electric motors, giving it slightly more power than your average Lime or Bird scooter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tW59Fy"&gt;Despite the addition of another motor, the scooter is still comparatively lightweight, clocking in at only 26 pounds. The scooter has three drive modes: Beginner (9-11 mph), Advanced (13-15 mph), and Professional (15-19 mph). The lithium-ion battery allows for a range of up to 15.5 miles. And Unagi uses a blend of aluminum and carbon fiber for the frame, helping save on weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLk34g"&gt;Unagi will sanitize each scooter before sending it out to customers, but subscribers are not guaranteed to get a brand-new scooter. That’s what makes this business model work, Hyman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DvKAr"&gt;Unagi isn’t the first scooter company to dip its toes into the world of subscriptions. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523121/bird-electric-scooter-delivery-monthly-rental-sf-barcelona"&gt;Bird&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21025818/lime-limepass-weekly-subscription-electric-scooters-bicycles-rental-rideables-micromobility"&gt;Lime&lt;/a&gt; have been experimenting with subscriptions for their shared electric scooters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20747817/bird-electric-scooter-monthly-rental-san-francisco-bike-app-review"&gt;with mixed results&lt;/a&gt;. And electric bikes are jumping on the subscription bandwagon, too, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22279921/revel-ebike-subscription-nyc-price-specs"&gt;Revel in New York City&lt;/a&gt;, Dance in Berlin, and Swapfiets and VanMoof as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgFNGx"&gt;Hyman said the initial six months of All-Access has proven to him that scooter subscriptions can work on a wider level. Still, there will be other metrics to keep an eye on. “We’re convinced internally, but some things you can only prove with time. Right?” he said. “Like, how long does the scooter last? What are all the service costs to keep that scooter running over its lifetime? What does consumer retention and churn rates look like? It’s a longitudinal exercise that some things can only prove with time. But we feel like the data points we have are pretty conclusive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxBfFC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel puts Apple’s ‘I’m a Mac’ guy into new ads praising PCs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uLT12mJPm7oEwJ0bBp5O7qEk-1o=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980460/LDTTUmg.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kMO1fM"&gt;Intel has hired Apple’s former “I’m a Mac” actor Justin Long to create new ads praising PCs. Long starts each commercial with “Hello I’m a... Justin,” with the typical white background you’d find on Apple’s Mac vs. PC ads from the 2000s. Naturally, the ads focus on Mac vs. PC again, with Long mocking Apple’s Touch Bar, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/WfHplU5fatE"&gt;lack of M1 multiple monitor support&lt;/a&gt;, and the “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rvDDC6ktCUg"&gt;gray and grayer&lt;/a&gt;” color choices for a MacBook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0THmCs"&gt;One even &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9gtRRMd2_UI"&gt;goes all-in&lt;/a&gt; on Apple’s lack of touchscreens in Macs or 2-in-1 support by mocking the fact you have to buy a tablet, keyboard, stylus, and even a dongle to match what’s available on rival Intel-based laptops. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8HebkohrCns"&gt;Another ad&lt;/a&gt; also points out that “no one really games on a Mac.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PaSRqw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9gtRRMd2_UI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X5HdBA"&gt;The return of Justin Long in Mac vs. PC ads for Intel comes just months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558977/apple-pc-guy-classic-m1-performance-john-hodgman"&gt;Apple brought back actor John Hodgman&lt;/a&gt; to reprise his role as the PC guy from Apple’s “I’m a Mac, and I’m a PC” ad campaign. While Apple kept its reprisal limited to the company’s keynote to introduce Arm-based M1 MacBooks, Intel has gone a step further and revived this for full commercials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GidON"&gt;Intel is clearly ready to battle Apple’s first chips with marketing, but we’re still waiting for the company to respond with its own silicon advances. Intel has only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272041/intel-apple-macbook-m1-performance-benchmarks-processors"&gt;produced benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; so far. Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, has also already made it clear that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232554/intel-ceo-apple-lifestyle-company-cpus-comment"&gt;Intel has to beat Apple in the future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How a metal with a memory will shape our future on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ey5U69BFx4KV62u4wPNVr7Js-tg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980439/Textless_Thumb_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zIpUSh"&gt;A rover on the Moon has metal wheels that can flex around rocky obstacles, then reshape back to their original form. On Earth, surgeons install tiny mesh tubes that can dilate a heart patient’s blood vessels all on their own, without mechanical inputs or any wires to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yEjcK"&gt;These shape-shifting capabilities are all thanks to a bizarre kind of metal called nitinol, a so-called shape-metal alloy that can be trained to remember its own shape. The decades-old material has become increasingly common in a wide range of everyday applications. And in the next decade, the metal will face its most challenging application yet: a sample return mission on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfvKxU"&gt;Nitinol, made of nickel and titanium, works its magic through heat. To “train” a paper clip made of nitinol, for example, you heat it at 500 degrees Celsius in its desired shape, then splash it in cold water. Bend it out of shape, then return the same heat source, and the metal will eerily slink back into its original form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VEn9YC"&gt;The temperature that triggers nitinol’s transformation varies depending on the fine-tuned ratio of nickel to titanium. Engineers can tweak the metal to adapt to a wide array of conditions, making it a key tool in places where complex mechanics won’t fit, like the blood vessels surrounding a human heart or a hinge that positions a solar panel by responding to the sun’s heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djnD67"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with engineers at NASA’s Glenn Research Center to see how nitinol will play a role in a mission to retrieve humanity’s first cache of pristine Martian soil samples — the second leg of a Mars mission campaign led by NASA and the European Space Agency. Check out the video above to see how and to see nitinol in action. (We promise, it’s not CGI.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zack Snyder’s Justice League remains overshadowed by its social media campaign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4arTgYtG7ldfkzKXAuIpehJHK3w=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980353/snyder_jl.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KsZiPh"&gt;On March 18th, a four-hour version of director Zack Snyder’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/14/22278944/zack-snyder-justice-league-official-premiere-trailer-hbo-max"&gt;original vision for &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will hit &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=ZackSnyderJusticeLeague031721"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HGTuA"&gt;Early reviews are mostly littered with praise for the movie, calling it a win for fans of Snyder’s other superhero films (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/23/11294512/batman-vs-superman-dawn-of-justice-review-movie-spoilers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batman v Superman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/10/4412958/man-of-steel-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Man of Steel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Others acknowledge that, hey, at least it’s better than the original film released in 2017, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21263044/justice-league-snyder-cut-warnermedia-hbo-max-zack-ben-affleck-henry-cavill-gal-gaot-streaming"&gt;spliced together by Joss Whedon&lt;/a&gt; after Snyder had to step back from the project to cope with the sudden death of his daughter. Whether the movie lives up to people’s expectations or not, the very existence of it — the marketing behind it, what it represents to fandom as a whole — is a turning point for online fandom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcvok2"&gt;A quick reminder of what the last four years have consisted of from various corners of the internet: after &lt;em&gt;Justice League &lt;/em&gt;came out in 2017, Snyder fans immediately took up a petition asking Warner Bros. to &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/10/16873696/justice-league-zack-snyder-directors-cut-conspiracy-theory"&gt;release an alternate of the film&lt;/a&gt; — the true version they called the Snyder Cut. Over the years, calls for Warner Bros. to take action have grown, as has the fandom. Billboard signs in Times Square, bus ads in San Diego during Comic-Con, and small demonstrations outside Warner Bros.’ headquarters in Burbank all existed in an attempt to rally WarnerMedia executives into giving them the version of &lt;em&gt;Justice League &lt;/em&gt;they were promised through setups in &lt;em&gt;Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/2/15728630/wonder-woman-review-gal-gadot-dc-extended-universe-patty-jenkins"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qTB2D7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It took them a long time, the people who really wanted to be productive in this moment, to realize that they’re going to get judged by [negative] actions also.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fJujHJ"&gt;Like any massive faceless group centering their online personas on one particular &lt;em&gt;thing &lt;/em&gt;or person, the Snyder Cut fandom (or the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut collective, as they became known) was a mixture of positives and negatives. The positive aspects are inspiring. Together, the group has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars &lt;a href="https://screenrant.com/justice-league-snyder-cut-suicide-prevention-fundraiser/"&gt;for suicide prevention awareness&lt;/a&gt;, a cause close to Snyder’s heart after his daughter’s death. A fandom rooted in a specific director spawned some genuinely thoughtful social media campaigns. There’s no denying that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAC3Iu"&gt;It’s also impossible to ignore the negatives. Critics and reporters received &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/05/is-releasing-the-snyder-cut-a-victory-for-toxic-fandoms"&gt;countless death threats and vile slurs&lt;/a&gt; all because they expressed disinterest in a Snyder Cut or called Snyder’s other work bad. Warner Bros. and DC Comics executives like Geoff Johns and former Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara were &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spoki83/status/1175052064856203267"&gt;lambasted by Snyder fans&lt;/a&gt; to the point that Johns seemingly stopped using Twitter altogether. When new Warner Bros. CEO Ann Sarnoff joined the company, her Twitter mentions were full of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1143554460674875394?lang=en"&gt;people demanding the Snyder Cut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpsjKs"&gt;“It took them a long time, the people who really wanted to be productive in this moment, to realize that they’re going to get judged by [negative] actions also,” Sean O’Connell, a journalist and author of &lt;em&gt;Release the Snyder Cut&lt;/em&gt;, a book detailing the campaign over the last four years, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The Snyder movement doesn’t have a really strong hold on policing the people in their movement who continue promoting that negativity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yDqRj9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s in some ways fun to surf the wave of a cultural phenomenon. In other ways it’s terrifying and horrible.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IVzhPx"&gt;Even with critics, academics, and journalists calling out the toxic parts of the fandom, there were some members within the group who only seemed incentivized by ongoing acknowledgment and less-than-subtle encouragement from Snyder himself. The director recently &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/14/movies/zack-snyders-rough-and-tumble-ride-with-justice-league.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “it’s in some ways fun to surf the wave of a cultural phenomenon,” adding that “in other ways it’s terrifying and horrible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dkpNl"&gt;Snyder Cut fans are far from the only fan base with a toxic cloud hanging over parts of it. &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a25617513/toxic-star-wars-fans/"&gt;perfect example&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Last Jedi &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/rian-johnson-star-wars-fans-mistake/"&gt;director Rian Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, alongside actors &lt;a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/john-boyega-interview-2020"&gt;John Boyega&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/6/5/17429196/kelly-marie-tran-instagram-deleted-harassment-star-wars-rose-last-jedi"&gt;Kelly Marie Tran&lt;/a&gt;, received hordes of harassment from bitter &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; viewers. Boyega and Johnson publicly fought back against trolls, while Tran decided after some time to leave social media platforms like Instagram for her own mental health. At the time, Lucasfilm executives didn’t say anything publicly, nor did any of the official &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; social media accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5rr89"&gt;One of the biggest changes that has come about in an internet-first, social media-dominant world is that fans of massive properties feel closer to talent, executives, and companies than ever before. In turn, companies are trying to figure out how to navigate extremely loud voices on increasingly global platforms. Universal leaned into the &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbean/2020/02/05/justiceforhan-the-unshakable-allure-of-the-most-compelling-fast--furious-character/?sh=78757b363b2e"&gt;#JusticeForHan hashtag&lt;/a&gt; when marketing its upcoming &lt;em&gt;F9&lt;/em&gt;, a popular fan-driven movement. Sony reworked the overall tone for &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/welcome-to-the-multiverse-studios-lean-into-fan-demand"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Venom &lt;/em&gt;after the first trailer&lt;/a&gt; failed to garner hype from Marvel fans. And perhaps most notably, Paramount completely redesigned its &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/sonic-redesign-cost-paramount-five-million-1202190493/"&gt;CGI version of Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/a&gt; after the first trailer led to immediate negative reaction from fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RzARLQ"&gt;Parts of the Snyder Cut fandom have drawn direct comparisons to what happened with BioWare’s &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3 &lt;/em&gt;in 2012&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;After the game’s ending drew heavy criticism from fans, BioWare released an alternate ending to try to smooth over a vocal part of the fan base. The DLC was called &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Extended Cut, &lt;/em&gt;and it became an example of corporations giving in to social media pressures.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CQ4Ux0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t think that studios and corporations are going to make decisions going forward to placate fans on social media because that’s a risky gamble”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NQOjrg"&gt;“It’s such a slippery slope,” O’Connell says. “I don’t think that studios and corporations are going to make decisions going forward to placate fans on social media because that’s a risky gamble. At the same time, this entire DCEU experiment, to me, has been reactionary to the studio’s detriment. They started chasing the Marvel model instead of just believing in whatever Nolan had started and what Snyder tried to continue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYA4MA"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has arguably leaned into the Snyder fandom the most as it tries to garner more attention and subscribers for its new HBO Max streaming service. After years of Warner Bros. repeatedly not saying anything about rereleasing a version of the film in theaters, the announcement of Snyder’s &lt;em&gt;Justice League &lt;/em&gt;on HBO Max came with AT&amp;amp;T’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ATT/status/1357080058356092929"&gt;official Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; celebrating a prickly fandom. This hasn’t stopped other Snyder fans from already replying to other AT&amp;amp;T tweets with pleas to #RestoreTheSnyderUniverse, demanding the director be given another shot at creating his entire superhero world, something current DC Films head Walter Hamada has no intention of doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3nc0K"&gt;The Snyder Cut is, according to several reviews, much better than the original. It exists as a testament to having a director see their entire project through from beginning to end. But #ReleaseTheSnyderCut is not the same as Zack Snyder’s &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;, and there is a reason why WarnerMedia is releasing it as a four-hour film with effectively no oversight on HBO Max instead of rereleasing it in theaters (even with the pandemic) and spending $100 million on marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RuPfcP"&gt;It is, as Snyder told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, a “social experiment.” The problem with an experiment is that no one knows what that means two years, five years, or three decades from now. O’Connell doesn’t believe this would have happened if Warner Bros. waited another year or HBO Max hadn’t launched. It’s a moment to appease fans and drive subscribers to a platform that WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar consistently refers to as the future of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMP40G"&gt;“It’s the culmination of this entire experience: I fought and used the hashtag #ReleaseTheSnyderCut, and it’s in my world, in my computer, on my TV, in my house,” Snyder said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMX6xk"&gt;That’s Zack Snyder’s &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;. The #ReleaseTheSnyderCut fandom isn’t suddenly going to disappear, as my colleague &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22327290/snyder-cut-hbo-max-release"&gt;Joshua Rivera wrote at &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For both the positive campaigners who are happy to finally have Snyder’s version available to watch and the negative spouting trolls who can claim victory on social media and continue fighting with people, they got what they wanted. Their tactics worked. One of the largest corporations in the United States gave in to demands from anonymous people. That’s not something people forget, and it only incentivizes a very specific type of action further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3toK9X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT review: Nvidia wins this round</title>

  &lt;p&gt;Unless AMD actually sells them for $479, of course&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="N6AcfM"&gt;AMD and Nvidia are pretending they live in a fantasy world, one where you can buy a state-of-the-art graphics card for under $700. Heck, a fantasy world where you can buy a new AMD GPU &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; — though AMD has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310653/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-price-release-date-availability-gpu-graphics"&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; it would stock additional RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT graphics cards at its website for $579 and $649 respectively, I’ve seen no evidence the company has &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; replenished those supplies since those cards first debuted four months ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GOvtFb"&gt;Today, the company’s launching a GPU that might change that: the $479 Radeon RX 6700 XT. AMD tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it will have “significantly more GPUs available.” If that’s true — if this is the moment the clouds part, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299505/nvidia-earnings-q4-2021-quarterly-gpu-shortage-revenue"&gt;the GPU shortage&lt;/a&gt; recedes, and you can actually buy a RX 6700 XT for $479 for even a limited time — you absolutely should. It’s a solid performer at 1440p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VTUyF"&gt;But amusingly, in the fantasy world where we’re pretending a $400 GeForce RTX 3060 Ti and $500 RTX 3070 still exist, the RX 6700 XT actually feels outgunned. It’s not the clear-cut Nvidia competitor you might have hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2jd13M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10396725"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IRYcDy"&gt;The AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT comes with a simple pitch: a way to max out your 2560 x 1440 monitor with the latest games at maximum settings, all for $100 less than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;RX 6800 I reviewed late last year&lt;/a&gt;. If that sounds familiar, that’s because it’s the same playbook Nvidia used last fall, where its $400 RTX 3060 Ti undercut the $500 RTX 3070 by the same amount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jueU5v"&gt;So in our fantasy world where those prices held, this would be the lay of the land:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EagLx8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10396733"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RgzoPp"&gt;Given those prices, I’d expect a $480 AMD card to soundly thrash a $400 Nvidia card. (That’s what the $580 Radeon RX 6800 did to the $500 RTX 3070, after all.) I’d also expect it to be within spitting distance of the $500 Nvidia card if there were only a $20 bill between the two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZbm9p"&gt;But running AMD’s card through my 15-game gauntlet on my own 1440p monitor, AMD’s new card sometimes lost to Nvidia’s 3060 Ti — sometimes by a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; — and it can even lose to Nvidia’s vanilla $329 RTX 3060 in tests where I had ray tracing turned on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zg5RUF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10396748"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SaobMd"&gt;As you’ll see in the chart above, AMD does notch some wins, and in many cases lives up to its promise of maxed settings at 1440p. &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; looks glorious on my G-Sync / FreeSync monitor at an average 105 frames per second with all the eye candy turned up, and the difference between 120 frames and 114 frames in &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; at max settings (probably) isn’t worth quibbling about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLW6Iu"&gt;With a beefier processor, you should be able to get 60+ frames per second in a maxed-out &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; experience, too — I’m still testing with my old Core i7-7700K, which is more than good enough for most of the games on this list (&lt;em&gt;SotR&lt;/em&gt; shows I’m 100 percent GPU-bound), but a few titles like &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; are still &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-cpu-scaling-benchmarks"&gt;notoriously CPU limited&lt;/a&gt; and more cores could help. As another example, my colleague Tom Warren saw identical framerates to me in &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt; pairing the 6700 XT with a far newer Intel chip, but slightly higher in &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AltwJ3XkfCRXElV9GHBI0SURoFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374455/twarren_210315_4475_00013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is that a 3060 Ti or 3070 on the left? Both can beat the RX 6700 XT in some games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="in6KWJ"&gt;But look at &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt;. Look at &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;. Look at &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;.  How is AMD underperforming or merely tying these lower tier cards? Things aren’t any rosier at 4K resolution, in case you’re wondering: while I still recommend Nvidia’s 3070 for entry-level 4K, the 6700 XT just doesn’t have the same oomph. In games like &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt;, I had to drop the settings to a comparatively dull “low,” where the 3070 managed to play those games at 4K and medium-spec without trouble. And of course, AMD doesn’t yet have a DLSS competitor if you’re a fan of AI-upscaled resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvfSnC"&gt;It’s not like AMD is winning in any other particular way, either. While I’m actually fond of the company’s new two-slot design (clearly inspired by&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=1969%2Bcharger%2Brt%2Brear&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjVxqzNv4ztAhXJsJ4KHbkpCaQQ_AUoAXoECBQQAw&amp;amp;biw=1200&amp;amp;bih=1777"&gt; a certain late 1960s muscle car&lt;/a&gt;) and I don’t hugely mind going from three to two axial fans, the RX 6700 XT is just as chunky and nearly as power-hungry as the RX 6800 (230W vs. 250W) without as much to show for it. AMD still recommends a 650W power supply, a pricey proposition for those of us with tall PC cases, and you’ll need both 6 and 8-pin PCIe connectors, while Nvidia’s comparable cards make do with a single 8-pin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8kiOBLQ3flrIWMtImp0I69blrdI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374449/twarren_210315_4475_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vcrrcpbz4HalOrdEwvo9-QUdIWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374450/twarren_210315_4475_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gQpmQfk4LLNpRa_e4m36AivCga0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374448/twarren_210315_4475_0004_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lRnQeCNMwvvuK3vPKuycTSzSQaI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374451/twarren_210315_4475_0008.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6Chll8"&gt;I also saw the 6700 XT hit 89 degrees Celsius on one occasion. While I don’t have enough evidence to say that’s a problem, I’ve yet to see Nvidia’s 3070 cross 82 degrees C even with my case fans unplugged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VIk7M"&gt;But as I alluded to in my intro, very little of this will matter if you can actually find this card for $479. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WHlnePW2WpajvPbofLSfv8nP4U0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374453/twarren_210315_4475_00011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All modern AMD and Nvidia cards have plenty of display support, with one HDMI 2.1 and three DisplayPorts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ciJ1Ut"&gt;In December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;I reported&lt;/a&gt; that the true street price of a $399 Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti was actually $675, and that the street price of an $499 RTX 3070 was actually $819. Those were the average prices people actually paid on eBay that month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oiYcE"&gt;If you think that sounds unbelievable, hear this: the street price of the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3070 are now approaching $1,200 &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt;. People are paying triple for what should have been Nvidia’s bang-for-the-buck graphics card now, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;the launch of a “$329” RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt; didn’t slow that &lt;em&gt;at all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T08V99"&gt;To me, this indicates two things: First, AMD probably isn’t going to be able to make anywhere near enough RX 6700 XTs to hit anywhere near that $479 price for the vast majority of buyers, even if it produces “significantly” more cards. I wouldn’t expect today to play out any differently than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301391/nvidia-rtx-3060-launch-supply-demand-newegg-shuffle"&gt;any previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/10/29/21539965/nvidia-rtx-3070-preorders-sold-out-micro-center-best-buy-newegg"&gt;GPU launch&lt;/a&gt; since the pandemic began. It’s a well-established pattern now. Second, none of these fantasyland prices will necessarily keep the RX 6700 XT from being a hit if the supply is there. As you can see from the similar street prices for the 3060 Ti and 3070, the market has a way of balancing prices out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xwIPm1"&gt;If you miraculously see this card for its list price, buy it, because you won’t get anything better for anywhere near that price in the near future. But it feels inferior to every Nvidia GPU that can compare — and I wouldn’t trade my 3060 Ti for one. &lt;/p&gt;
