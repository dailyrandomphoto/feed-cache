    <title>Sony is giving away Ratchet and Clank to PS4 and PS5 owners</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ratchet and Clank" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4CQWqQh39n391ryshzPBFeNskSI=/0x19:1564x1062/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68861472/ratchetclank.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MC4cUm"&gt;Sony is encouraging PS4 and PS5 owners to stay at home during the pandemic by &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/02/23/play-at-home-returns-four-months-of-offers-for-playstation-games-and-entertainment-begin-march-1/#sf243317060"&gt;bringing back its “Play At Home” initiative&lt;/a&gt;, allowing PlayStation owners to redeem free games starting in March and concluding in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lON8AJ"&gt;Starting March 1st at 8PM PT / 11PM ET until March 31st at 8PM PT / 11PM ET, both PS4 and PS5 owners will have the chance to redeem 2016’s &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank&lt;/em&gt; at no cost; PS5 owners previously had access to a free version of the game via the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AzlVUB"&gt;Sony originally announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220964/sony-ps4-uncharted-the-nathan-drake-collection-free-home"&gt;Play At Home initiative last year&lt;/a&gt;, when the company offered PS4 owners free digital copies of &lt;em&gt;Journey&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection&lt;/em&gt;. Unlike the free PlayStation Plus games that are available each month, you do not need an active PlayStation Plus subscription to redeem or access these titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecg2aG"&gt;Additionally, Sony is also offering extended access for new users subscribed to the anime streaming services &lt;a href="https://funimation.8u86.net/c/482924/955859/4688?subId1=VergePlayStationFreeGames2021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.funimation.com%2Fsubscribe%2F"&gt;Funimation&lt;/a&gt; or Wakanim. The promotion for this is only available to people who sign up and download the respective app available in their country. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PlayStation boss says PS5 supply will start to pick up in the second half of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rdxgecx8f-3eHY1PZW89FGBxv5A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68861470/vpavic_4278_20201030_0120.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="threads_view_CQ1J4TN8G-1614089772.007600-1614090283.010700"&gt;Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; (alongside the Xbox Series X and S) has been nearly impossible to buy since its launch back in November. Those shortages will likely continue for a bit longer, according to Jim Ryan, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment. But stock should pick up in the second half of the year, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZ0egt"&gt;The news comes from a series of interviews with Ryan from &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/02/23/ps5-vr/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f7c089dc-515e-4387-82fd-ea0a49998650"&gt;the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;where the PlayStation boss reflected on the past several months since the PS5’s launch and the road ahead for the next-generation console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dX3OiT"&gt;“Demand was greater than we anticipated,” Ryan said, explaining the ongoing stock issues for the console. “That, along with the complexities of the supply chain issues, resulted in a slightly lower supply than we initially anticipated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kjGTVS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Demand was greater than we anticipated.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K2kkR0"&gt;Things will eventually improve, although it may take some time. “It will get better every month throughout 2021,” Ryan &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f7c089dc-515e-4387-82fd-ea0a49998650"&gt;commented to the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “The pace of the improvement in the supply chain will gather throughout the course of the year, so by the time we get to the second half of [2021], you’re going to be seeing really decent numbers indeed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6VSEz"&gt;That said, Ryan wouldn’t promise that there would be enough stock for everyone who wants a console to get one this holiday season. The high demand for PS5s, coupled with the ongoing global semiconductor shortage and the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic is forcing most console sales through bot-infested online portals, means Sony is still facing serious constraints in how many people will actually be able to buy a PS5. “There are very few magic wands that can be waved,” notes Ryan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Drm0Y"&gt;Still, Sony is already seeing encouraging numbers in the breakdown of customers who have been able to buy a PS5. According to Ryan, 1 in 4 PS5 owners didn’t own a PlayStation 4 console, and half of all PS5 owners are new to PSN. (Sony’s online account system that the company has used since the PlayStation 3.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="seVOvW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X will be in short supply until at least June, Microsoft admits","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260564/microsoft-xbox-series-x-stock-june-supply-constraints"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EShm56"&gt;Sony isn’t the only one hoping that next-generation console supplies will pick up in the second half of the year either. Mike Spencer, Microsoft’s head of investor relations, recently revealed that the new Xbox consoles will likely see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260564/microsoft-xbox-series-x-stock-june-supply-constraints"&gt;supply constraints through at least June&lt;/a&gt; in an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/business/ps5-xbox-console-shortage.html"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rode’s new compact wireless audio kit records two microphones with one receiver </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/asT3P2MDlIIY5l-_VuHXumrNM5Q=/75x0:918x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68861458/RODE_WIRELESS_GO_II_instiu_3_couple_iphone_vloggerkit_jan_2021_1000x562.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;RODE&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R9uIca"&gt;Rode has released a sequel to its Wireless Go mobile microphone system, &lt;a href="https://rode.com/microphones/wireless/wirelessgoii"&gt;the Wireless Go II&lt;/a&gt;, which is meant to offer an easy way for video creators to record audio from two people at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1awqCn"&gt;Like its predecessor, the Go II is a compact wireless microphone pack designed for the creator who wants a lighter gear bag in the field (or is on a budget), while still being able to use a dedicated off-camera audio system. With this next generation, the Go II now offers dual channel recording for two sources, an extended wireless range for a more stable transmission, and on-board recording capabilities as a failsafe alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gn9OU"&gt;For dual channel recording, Rode includes two separate clip-on transmitters in the box — both with an on-board omnidirectional condenser microphone or a 3.5mm TRS input for plugging in a separate lavalier microphone — which transmits to a single receiver. That receiver can record both microphone packs in stereo and output the audio via USB-C to a phone or computer, or via 3.5mm analog TRS to a separate recorder or camera input. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IJJNnGc0snckOKpSmjF-71q7KBo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22321971/rode_wireless_go_II_hero_image_jan_2021_2000_1334_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Rode&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rode Wireless Go II: two transmitters, one receiver.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PhXgsJ"&gt;Since an external lavalier is not included, the built-in microphones on the top of the transmitter are what most users will be relying on. In most practices this is hard to cover up on camera, unless you don’t mind an almost two-inch black square or a one-inch thick clip with a fuzzy windshield on the talent’s lapel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqALb4"&gt;The Wireless Go II’s on-board recording system can save up to 24 hours of audio internally without the need of an SD card (though the batteries will only last up to seven hours), while keeping the multitrack recording separate for post-production. The new model offers an extended wireless range of up to 200m (656 feet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YafB2"&gt;With these added features, Rode’s Wireless Go II should help to ease the stress of audio issues that plague the average sound operator — making sure microphones are picking up multiple sources, avoiding any RF interference from uncontrollable environments, and having a backup for any audio data lost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAkMKI"&gt;Rode’s Wireless Go II &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1622642-REG%2Frode_wigoii_wireless_go_ii_compact.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F23%2F22296439%2Frode-wireless-go-ii-announced-receiver-microphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is now available for $299&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDyWQx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gran Turismo 7 release date pushed back to 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WV4BWbQC24xJpOH1nlTGr5wyfEM=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68861448/maxresdefault.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0GLvu1"&gt;The next entry in Polyphony Digital’s long-running &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/em&gt; franchise has been delayed to 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/playstation-vr-jim-ryan-interview-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GQ &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. In a statement, Sony said &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt; has been impacted by “COVID-related production challenges,” which means its planned 2021 release date has been shifted to 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0l5mj"&gt;“With the ongoing pandemic, it’s a dynamic and changing situation and some critical aspects of game production have been slowed over the past several months,” the statement reads. “We’ll share more specifics on &lt;em&gt;GT7&lt;/em&gt;’s release date when available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AN1D1j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’ll share more specifics on GT7’s release date when available”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fxSLLh"&gt;News of the game’s delay came on the same day that Sony announced a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296998/sony-ps5-next-gen-vr-headset-virtual-reality-features"&gt;next-gen virtual reality headset for the PS5&lt;/a&gt;. Although it’s yet to reveal an official name for the new device, or even a release date, Sony says the new headset will feature an improved field of view, a higher resolution, and will work with a new VR controller that’ll inherit some features from the PS5’s DualSense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXH700"&gt;Sony announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21275346/gran-turismo-7-ps5-sony-playstation-5-polyphony-digital"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt; for the PS5 last year&lt;/a&gt;, and later in the year announced plans to release the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556505/sony-ps5-horizon-forbidden-west-release-date-ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-2021"&gt;in the first half of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the first numbered game in the series since &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 6&lt;/em&gt; was released in 2013 for the PS3, although Sony released &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo Sport&lt;/em&gt; for the PS4 in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Make your own speedy USB-C drive for cheap with this $100 SanDisk 1TB NVMe SSD</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/04G6u4dUW9m9cH5qahTWNhA_78M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68861422/akrales_190510_3393_0096.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vn4yTE"&gt;There’s a wide variety of deals happening in the tech space, including TVs, computer components, and more. Starting with a gadget that’ll give you some fast transfer speeds, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733115867493280374" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SanDisk’s Ultra 1TB NVMe SSD is $100&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy. That’s a great price for this kind of capacity, given it’s much faster than your standard SATA SSD. SanDisk covers this model with a five-year warranty. In terms of how you can use it, make sure your PC’s motherboard has an open M.2 2280 slot, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/13/18518127/portable-ssd-external-thunderbolt-3-usb-c-samsung-x5-t5-specs-test-how-to"&gt;get crafty and buy an M.2 enclosure&lt;/a&gt; to turn it into a fast, compact external drive like the one shown above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQ1ry7"&gt;Someday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551165/sony-ps5-playstation-5-no-m2-ssd-expansion-launch"&gt;Sony will enable the PS5’s M.2 slot&lt;/a&gt; for an SSD of this size and shape, but until it does I wouldn’t recommend buying one expressly for that reason. Just to note: some folks on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/hww8re/ssd_sandisk_ultra_1tb_internal_pci_express_30_x4/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; say this model isn’t particularly great compared to more expensive options because it apparently lacks DRAM cache, but it should still get the job done for most people. Perhaps not for you, though, if you’re looking for the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IZkmNA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10357138"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AZRZPW"&gt;Best Buy has marked down Hisense’s 75-inch 4K HDR TV to a staggeringly low price, as it’s done before. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733116916848559515" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $600&lt;/a&gt;, and considering the size alone it’s a good deal. This model also features Android TV, so you don’t need to hook up any external streaming devices to start watching TV or a movie. This TV is a good value, though it’s a little bare-bones in the spec department, with an LED panel that has a 60Hz refresh rate with no local dimming. Review site &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/hisense/h6510g"&gt;Rtings.com&lt;/a&gt; says it has a very good contrast ratio, so it’s ideal for movies, but it has narrow viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3fWRuU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10265690"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GSTZDV"&gt;Woot is selling refurbished, unlocked &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/VergeMakeOwnUSBCDrive022321/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-iphone-xr-64gb-fully-unlocked-3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone XR phones with 64GB of storage for $330&lt;/a&gt;. The black and red colors are available. These are said to be in “Grade A” condition, which Woot classifies as “having minimal cosmetic damage, which is not noticeable when the device is held at arm’s length.” For context around the price, the newer iPhone SE with a faster processor is $399, so the iPhone XR is a little outdated in that regard, though it does have the advantage of screen real estate over the SE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IJWBuc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10357206"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Social networks are finally competitive again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TguMysnXGZVEE4aozQKvTcNghlc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68861287/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="woILZx"&gt;Lately, the consumer internet — that set of products devoted to building and monetizing large networks of people — has started to feel rather buzzy. A space that had been largely emptied out over the past five years is once again humming with life. The products are compelling enough, and growing fast enough, that Facebook and others have begun trying to reverse-engineer and copy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohUdVS"&gt;It still doesn’t seem quite real to me, and yet everywhere I look the signs are there: social networks are competitive again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2tXbE"&gt;Today, let’s tour this weird new landscape and talk about what it means — and doesn’t mean — for the tech giants and the governments trying to rein them in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gSqyn3"&gt;I. &lt;strong&gt;How competition ended&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5fsoC"&gt;If I had to put a date on when competition ended among social networks in the United States, I’d choose August 2nd, 2016. That’s when Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12348354/instagram-stories-announced-snapchat-kevin-systrom-interview"&gt;introduced its copy of Snapchat stories&lt;/a&gt;, blunting the momentum of an upstart challenger and sending a chill through the startup ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2w8Ts"&gt;I don’t think copying features is necessarily anti-competitive — in fact, as I’ll argue below, it’s a sign that the ecosystem is working as intended — but the effect of Facebook’s copying here was dramatic. Snap fell into a long funk, and would-be entrepreneurs and investors got the message: Facebook will seek to acquire or copy any upstart social product, dramatically limiting its odds of breakout success. Investment shrunk accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvqjbT"&gt;The previous year, after the success of Twitter’s Periscope app, Facebook had cloned its live video features, and enthusiasm for both products seemed to broadly peter out. When live group video experienced momentary success under Houseparty, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/5/15916850/facebook-houseparty-clone-bonfire-group-video-chat"&gt;Facebook cloned that too&lt;/a&gt;, and Houseparty later sold to Epic Games for an undisclosed sum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4bUtg"&gt;It was in this stagnant environment that many people, myself included, came to believe that it had been a mistake to let Facebook acquire Instagram and WhatsApp. The former became the breakout social network of a younger generation, and the latter cemented Facebook’s global dominance in communication. A world in which both had remained independent would have been much more competitive, even if neither had grown to the scale that they did under Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aun7C3"&gt;This is the basic thesis of &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization"&gt;the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust lawsuit against the company&lt;/a&gt;, which it filed in December. The government argues that Facebook “is illegally maintaining its personal social networking monopoly through a years-long course of anticompetitive conduct,” and if successful, it could force Facebook to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp. It’s a tricky case; &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/facebook-sued-by-ftc-and-states-the-ftcs-case-antitrust-and-politics/"&gt;as Ben Thompson explains here&lt;/a&gt;, the government’s attempt to define the market in which Facebook competes so as to prove it has a monopoly is rather tortured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xs3JKG"&gt;You can think the FTC’s case against Facebook is weak and also believe that the period from 2016 to 2021 saw remarkably little innovation among American social networks, at least in terms of the basic user behaviors that they inspire. The market for social products became incredibly concentrated; Facebook and Google built a duopoly in digital advertising; and their vast size and unpredictable effects helped to trigger a global backlash against American tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TeAzrl"&gt;If, like me, you think this is all a problem, you could argue for one of two basic approaches to fixing it. The first is government intervention, in the form of an antitrust lawsuit or new regulations from Congress, that would regulate the ability of tech giants to acquire smaller companies or put up new barriers to entering the market or competing on fair terms. The second is to do basically nothing, trusting that the entropic nature of the universe and the inexorable march of time would eventually restore competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jN63zy"&gt;If the second choice sounds ridiculous, it is not without precedent. In the late 1990s, Microsoft’s dominance over the PC market led the government to pursue an antitrust case over the company’s move to bundle its Internet Explorer browser with the Windows operating system. The fear was that such bundling would grant Microsoft total power over the consumer PC market forever. In reality, of course, mobile phones were out there just waiting to be perfected, and then Apple came along and did just that, and now no one really worries too much about Microsoft’s power over the PC market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkylUm"&gt;I do wish the US government had intervened around 2016 to explore new regulations for tech giants’ mergers and acquisitions. In its absence, we could only bet on entropy — and whichever contrarian capitalists still felt like they could challenge Facebook in the market despite its many advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMutNp"&gt;The thing is, though, that a bunch of contrarian capitalists did. And lately they have been having a lot of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MIQxGM"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How competition began&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kEuWJK"&gt;Facebook’s biggest competitor in 2021 is, of course, TikTok, which has been siphoning usage from Facebook’s family of apps since it launched in the United States in 2018 (after merging with Musical.ly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8tUwe"&gt;TikTok began by making it dramatically easier for people to make compelling videos, parceled out fame and fortune with a central feed that is incredibly compelling even if you don’t know or follow a single person, and eventually created an entire universe of audio memes, visual effects, and community in-jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uqz68W"&gt;Eugene Wei, our best &lt;a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/9/18/seeing-like-an-algorithm"&gt;writer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat"&gt;thinker&lt;/a&gt; on TikTok, published the third part of his essay series about the app Sunday night. Among the many salient points Wei makes is that the sheer number of forces that have gone into TikTok’s success have made it difficult for Facebook (or &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/building-youtube-shorts/"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;) to clone. &lt;a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2021/2/15/american-idle"&gt;He writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VoXrak"&gt;People will litigate Instagram copying Snapchat’s Stories feature until the end of time, but the fact is that format wasn’t ever going to be some defensible moat. Ephemerality is a clever new dimension on which to vary social media, but it’s easily copiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OED80Q"&gt;This is why TikTok’s network effects of creativity matter. To clone TikTok, you can’t just copy any single feature. It’s all of that, and not just the features, but how users deploy them and how the resultant videos interact with each other on the FYP feed. It’s replicating all the feedback loops that are built into TikTok’s ecosystem, all of which are interconnected. Maybe you can copy some of the atoms, but the magic lives at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wZJ7SN"&gt;The success of TikTok is a source of real anxiety inside Facebook, where employees ask CEO Mark Zuckerberg a question about it during nearly every all-hands Q&amp;amp;A session. The company has deployed a competitor, called Reels, inside of Instagram, and perhaps it will find a way to succeed. But the larger point is that, whatever the odds, Facebook now has to compete against TiKTok or risk losing the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ikJ1g"&gt;You’ve probably already considered that, though. (Unless you’re the FTC, which conspicuously avoided any mention of TikTok in its entire complaint about Facebook’s alleged monopoly position.) But when it comes to mobile short-form video, Facebook and YouTube face a real challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sS3k7"&gt;So where else does Facebook suddenly find itself forced to compete?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLSYhu"&gt;For starters, there’s audio. While still available only by invitation, Clubhouse &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90606693/basically-everyone-is-on-clubhouse-now"&gt;recently hit an estimated 10 million downloads&lt;/a&gt;. Celebrities including Tiffany Haddish, Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, and Zuckerberg himself have made appearances on the app, granting it a cultural cachet rare in a social startup that is still less than a year old. Clubhouse raised money last month at a valuation of $1 billion — more than Facebook ultimately paid for Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKH8vI"&gt;Because it’s an audio app, Clubhouse doesn’t pose quite the existential threat that TikTok does: you can still theoretically browse Instagram or message businesses on WhatsApp while listening to a Clubhouse chat. But Facebook has been sufficiently intrigued by Clubhouse’s rapid rise that it is now working out how to clone the app, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/facebook-building-product-clubhouse.html"&gt;according to a report this month in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Elsewhere, Twitter already has a Clubhouse clone, &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces"&gt;called Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, in beta. It’s not clear that Clubhouse poses a threat to either company, exactly. But both are still taking it as a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10vZ21"&gt;What else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQmIJR"&gt;After years of making its most prominent investments in technically challenging media involving video, augmented reality, and virtual reality, Facebook is reportedly taking a second look at text. The rise of Substack over the past year has begun to mint a growing number of millionaire, text-based creators, while also pulling millions of people away from their social feeds into the relative calm of the email inbox. (I have a personal stake in this one, of course; I started a newsletter in large part because my social feeds had come to feel like a lousy place to get my news.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xuavDA"&gt;What’s interesting here is that Facebook now seems open to this possibility, too. Last month, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; also reported that Facebook is developing newsletter tools for reporters and writers. (I’ve confirmed this with my own sources.) As with Clubhouse, newsletters hardly pose an existential threat to Facebook. But they do bleed time and attention away from the company’s apps — and in a world where news may not be even available on Facebook in some countries, it may be wise for it to have a hedge. (And Twitter clearly thinks so, too: &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-twitter-a-better-home-for-writers.html"&gt;it acquired Substack competitor Revue last month&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hM2mow"&gt;That leaves Facebook competing with legitimately fast-growing, well-funded competitors across several categories. And while it’s in a much earlier stage, I think the company may soon have an interesting competitor in photography as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJbf9u"&gt;Dispo is an invite-only social photo app with a twist: you can’t see any photos you take with the app until 24 hours after you take them. (The app sends you a push notification to open them every day at 9AM local time: among other things, a nice hack to boost daily usage.) Founded by David Dobrik, one of the world’s most popular YouTubers, Dispo has been around as &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dispo-live-in-the-moment/id1491684197"&gt;a basic utility&lt;/a&gt; for a year. But last month a beta version launched on iOS with social features including shared photo “rolls,” and it quickly hit the 10,000-person cap on Apple’s TestFlight software. It &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2021/02/17/david-dobriks-invite-only-photo-app-dispo-generates-some-unexpected-buzz/?sh=11e64f8d7ed9"&gt;raised $4 million&lt;/a&gt; in seed funding in October, and assuming the buzz continues into a public launch, I wouldn’t be surprised if Dispo took off in a major way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPgkBX"&gt;Audio, video, photos, and text: to some extent, Facebook has never had to stop competing across these dimensions in the company’s history. But I can’t remember the last time it was fighting so many interesting battles &lt;em&gt;at the same time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="G3bjYN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III. What it means&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZtPR4h"&gt;Here’s what I’m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; saying when I argue that social networks are competitive again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="udO6v5"&gt;That Facebook has not acted in various anti-competitive ways throughout its history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VJN0tY"&gt;That Facebook should no longer be subject to antitrust scrutiny, or that the US government (and, separately, a coalition of US attorneys general) should abandon their lawsuits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vQcg7F"&gt;That, given all this new competition, Facebook should be allowed to purchase rival social networks in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rxnYL6"&gt;That Facebook won’t remain the world’s largest social network for a long time to come, or that its business will suffer in the short term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0uVOle"&gt;In fact, I think there’s a good case to be made that antitrust pressure from the US government in particular is what has allowed competition to return to social networks in the first place. Had Clubhouse or Substack emerged in 2013 or 2014, it’s not hard to imagine Facebook racing to acquire them and knock them off the chessboard. But in 2021, when Facebook &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/media-social-media-6b03fa94c15779e770af099572f256cd"&gt;faces a formal antitrust review in the United Kingdom over its acquisition of a failing GIF search engine&lt;/a&gt;, the company can only sit back and try to copy what others are doing better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gbdtj2"&gt;If that’s the case, it suggests that the half-assed response to Facebook’s growing dominance over the past half-decade nonetheless got us, however belatedly, to a better place. Antitrust pressure made it extremely difficult for the company to make acquisitions, opening a window just big enough for new entrants to climb through. It remains to be seen how big any new challengers to Facebook, YouTube, or Twitter can grow. But for the first time in a long time, I’m optimistic about their chances.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon’s spinoffs are the series at its most adventurous</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QO9DM88C0-ZK5ESATviHhyrZ8GA=/189x0:842x435/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68861286/Screen_Shot_2018_11_12_at_12.05.01_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detective Pikachu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mxmor3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; is a phenomenon, one that’s lasted a steady 25 years built on a foundation of approachable roleplaying games. On the DS, Nintendo’s bestselling piece of hardware, three of the top 10 bestselling titles are mainline &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; games. It’s a franchise that perpetually serves as a system seller despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that it evolves at a glacial pace. But that’s only true of the core &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; experience. While those RPGs have been infamously resistant to change, the many, many &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; spinoffs are a different story. In fact, many of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;’s biggest success stories, from the blockbuster film &lt;em&gt;Detective Pikachu&lt;/em&gt; to the staggering success of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, were a result of this experimental attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Fc93F"&gt;Without these offshoots, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; wouldn’t be what it is today — and they’re still helping push the series into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsPYNC"&gt;It didn’t take long for Nintendo to start testing the waters. Just a few years after the breakout success of &lt;em&gt;Red&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Blue&lt;/em&gt; on the Game Boy in 1996, the company released &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Stadium&lt;/em&gt; on the Nintendo 64. It retained the same core idea of cute monsters battling against each other, but simplified the action while adding 3D graphics, a big step up from the monochrome 8-bit visuals of the originals. It was a change but still pretty familiar territory for fans, whether they came from the Game Boy games or the animated series.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ue5M1zUH3WWx_pu19yERJVloFoA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22322521/Switch_NewPokemonSnap_screen_01.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;New &lt;/em&gt;Pokémon Snap&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EAODu5"&gt;Soon, though, the spinoffs would explore new territory. One of the most beloved &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; games is &lt;em&gt;Snap&lt;/em&gt;, essentially a wildlife photography simulator, where players go on a safari to capture images of their favorite monsters. It tapped into something the main games didn’t, with a less competitive kind of experience that was welcoming to new players. Subsequent spinoffs went in a similar direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nF0vk2"&gt;Games like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Pinball&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Puzzle Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Hey You, Pikachu!&lt;/em&gt; all took the familiar world and characters but transported them into completely new genres (and in the case of the latter, adding then-rare voice controls). Much like the still-running &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; animated series, these games created new entry points for potential fans, easing them into the fictional universe. It’s a strategy that’s now commonplace, used by everyone from Disney to Riot Games. But in the late ‘90s, it was a novel approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rYcWft"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Pokémon is a huge hit because it’s cooperative","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22289300/pokemon-25-anniversary-red-blue-gameboy-nintendo-co-op"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uJisnd"&gt;This strategy continued over the ensuing decades. There were fighting games (&lt;em&gt;Pokkén Tournament&lt;/em&gt;), narrative adventure games (&lt;em&gt;Detective Pikachu&lt;/em&gt;), strategy games (&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Conquest&lt;/em&gt;), and puzzle crossovers (&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Picross&lt;/em&gt;), to name a few. At times, these games could seem almost bizarre — try playing a &lt;em&gt;Tekken&lt;/em&gt;-style fighter with Pikachu dressed up in a wrestling costume, or one where the electric rat can’t stop drinking coffee — but they pushed the boundaries of what a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game could be. (&lt;em&gt;Detective Pikachu&lt;/em&gt; would go on to spawn &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20696847/detective-pikachu-warcraft-highest-grossing-video-game-movie-record"&gt;the top-grossing video game movie of all time&lt;/a&gt;.) They also allowed the series to hit lots of different platforms. Initially, that was limited to Nintendo consoles and handhelds, but as soon as the franchise debuted on mobile, it changed dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxT2ah"&gt;Things started out rather inauspiciously, with the debut of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Shuffle&lt;/em&gt; in 2015, essentially a Pikachu-themed &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; clone. But it helped lay the groundwork for the franchise on smartphones. And just one year later, things would explode. Niantic Labs, then a relatively small studio known for a sci-fi location-based game called &lt;em&gt;Ingress&lt;/em&gt;, launched a take on &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; that was perhaps the most successful marriage of game type and fictional universe. It allowed players to go out in the real world to find and capture pocket monsters on their phone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/792xZtGG5vo2XbtYvH5t4Y4J2z0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22322525/Switch_PokkenTournamentDX_ND0111_scrn09.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Pokkén Tournament DX&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="j5Yykh"&gt;We all know what happened next: &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; became &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15888210/pokemon-go-one-year-anniversary-timeline"&gt;a global phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;, setting app store records and becoming the rare game that could make millions of players leave the house and exercise, all for the chance of catching virtual creatures. It would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17562444/pokemon-go-ar-games-walking-dead-jurassic-world"&gt;years before any true competitors launched&lt;/a&gt;, and none have been anywhere near as successful. Today, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21060877/pokemon-go-record-revenue-2019-niantic-labs-ar-growth"&gt;is still one of the biggest mobile games in the world&lt;/a&gt;. In many ways it reinvigorated the franchise, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/18/12542206/nintendo-pokemon-go-3ds-sales"&gt;boosting the sales of older titles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16466536/pokemon-ultra-sun-moon-interview-nintendo"&gt;influencing the design of subsequent ones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHLHM5"&gt;Since then, releases have become arguably even more surprising, with everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294105/pokemon-cafe-mix-puzzle-game-nintendo-switch-mobile-trailer-release-date"&gt;a café management game&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294072/pokemon-smile-brushing-teeth-ar-augmented-reality-adventure"&gt;a mobile app to help players brush their teeth&lt;/a&gt;. And soon the franchise will aim for new territory yet again with &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;, a competitive multiplayer game that looks like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, except with Charmander and Squirtle. It gives &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21302958/pokemon-unite-esports-competitive-gaming-league-of-legends"&gt;an opportunity to tap into the burgeoning world of competitive gaming&lt;/a&gt; and, once again, potentially reach a whole new audience that has never touched a mainline &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; RPG before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZxWre"&gt;And after that? Well, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; will attempt to breach the one space games have yet to venture: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18643467/pokemon-home-sleep-announce-release-date"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony announces next-gen VR headset for the PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K_MKofVva_exo_szDEDI00EpAYc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68861162/vpavic_4278_20201030_0247.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wGeEdu"&gt;Sony is working on a next-generation VR headset for the PS5. The headset won’t launch this year, but Sony is announcing early plans to make it available on the PS5 at some point in the future. Sony’s new VR headset will include an improved field of view, resolution, and even a single cord to make it easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anTtC3"&gt;“We’re taking what we’ve learned since launching PS VR on PS4 to develop a next-gen VR system that enhances everything from resolution and field of view to tracking and input,” &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/02/23/introducing-the-next-generation-of-vr-on-playstation/#sf243317607"&gt;says Hideaki Nishino&lt;/a&gt;, Sony’s head of PlayStation platform and planning. “It will connect to PS5 with a single cord to simplify setup and improve ease-of-use, while enabling a high-fidelity visual experience.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3UyL1Q"&gt;Sony is also working on a new VR controller, which will use some of the features found in the DualSense PS5 controller. The VR controller will also focus on improving ergonomics. “There’s still a lot of development underway for our new VR system, so it won’t be launching in 2021,” says Nishino. “But we wanted to provide this early update to our fans, as the development community has started to work on creating new worlds for you to explore in virtual reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4vJaK"&gt;Sony will start issuing development kits for its next-gen VR headset soon, but the company isn’t detailing the full specs or release dates just yet. This new hardware is clearly designed to improve some of the limitations of the original PlayStation VR headset. “Given this was our first foray into virtual reality, it gives us a chance to apply lessons learned,” says PlayStation boss Jim Ryan in an &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/02/23/ps5-vr/"&gt;interview with the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “One of the very vivid illustrations of that is that we will be moving to a very easy single-cord setup.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0CGNN"&gt;Sony’s original PlayStation VR headset debuted more than four years ago, and you need a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538861/sony-psvr-camera-adapter-ps5-compatible-request-form-online"&gt;special camera adapter&lt;/a&gt; to use it on the PS5. Sony has remained committed to the accessory, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540786/sony-playstation-jim-ryan-psvr-headset-timeline-ps5"&gt;admitted that VR still has a long way to go&lt;/a&gt;. With a next-generation headset now in the works, we’ll soon find out what games Sony has planned to improve the future of VR.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This 26-year-old CEO is helping esports grow up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3p3XnVmPt_xHlHwhhgNHeQOCNss=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68861040/VRG_ILLO_4421_Decoder_NicoleLaPointeJameson.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Evil Geniuses CEO Nicole LaPointe Jameson on reinventing the industry&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="HGRJkX"&gt;For a long time, people have predicted that playing video games competitively would become a big business, rivaling traditional sports leagues like the NBA or NFL. But it’s been a long process, with challenges and setbacks along the way. There’s an audience — lots of people tune in to watch teams play games like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; — but the business models and ecosystem around the industry haven’t had a ton of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMdH5J"&gt;For this week’s episode of &lt;em&gt;Decoder,&lt;/em&gt; I spoke with Nicole LaPointe Jameson, CEO of esports company Evil Geniuses, to figure out how an esports team makes money, where the industry is headed, and where she sees growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cdNP08"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/6RiNeMEoYdcAHcEaNxtEfk" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5SDzB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This excerpt has been lightly edited for clarity. A full transcript of this conversation will be available on February 24th, 2021. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wngXIk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the current business of Evil Geniuses in esports, and what do you think that business should look like? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OyaZB0"&gt;So bear with me if you’re an esports expert, but taking a step back. The esports industry’s a bit of a misnomer in that it really encompasses two bimodal — often intersecting, but frequently not — business models. One of them is traditional sports, except think of us like a university athletics department. I’m the University of Michigan. But instead of basketball, football, soccer under one brand, I have &lt;em&gt;Dota&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXkFoE"&gt;There’s that business model, which has the same models you would see in traditional sports: sponsorship, IP and media rights, direct advertising, etc. But esports being a digital platform also bridges entertainment, so you think of content creators, digital influencers, and all of those revenue models and revenue streams. That also exists in esports. So we’re a bit of a blended form of both of those. When I had entered EG, we were just the former. We were just the athletics model, which is great. That’s the thesis we believe in. It’s why we’re here to be competitive, but it wasn’t profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQUYD8"&gt;You can’t operate player salaries that look akin to pro athlete salaries. [They] are not sustained on esports-level sponsorships today. So we really focused on bringing peripheral revenue streams into the business to support what we do but that also don’t deprecate from the core product of who we are. And how that’s manifested is, of course, the entertainment side of house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1WkJf"&gt;We’ve also developed deep collegiate and education platforms — how to bridge the world of gaming, how to make gaming accessible to different audiences — as well as data analytics and even fantasy embedding products. So we’ve been able to pull in things using our core athletics platforms to really help self-sustain the business in the past two years to keep the esports product alive but keep the lights on at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLcbqx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the questions I have for all of these digital media and entertainment models — and obviously, I work in digital media so I think about this a lot — but one of the questions that always comes up is it seems like so rarely is the core product itself the money. It’s the universe of things around it that hopefully add up to enough money to keep the core product alive. That is very different than a traditional sports league, right? Owning the Lakers is just a lucrative proposition because the Lakers play basketball, and people buy tickets, and you’ll sell the rights, and you can just do it that way&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBDtJa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here, and almost everywhere in digital, it seems like the core thing rarely makes the money itself. It is almost a loss-leader. Is that how you think of your model? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6Uyhm"&gt;I wish I had a better and more shiny answer for you, but it definitely resonates. You know, we believe in the team. The team is the crown jewel. We wouldn’t have a value proposition to exist without the athletic side. But it’s not supported by the magnitude of the revenue with league revenue share like you’d find in traditional sports today. I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t believe that won’t change over time. But today, I would be a bad fiduciary to my investors if I said, “Yeah, let’s just go athletics. That will work.” Because it won’t, unfortunately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFa3er"&gt;But also on the bright side: unlike traditional sports, the beauty of esports — you saw it during COVID: pro sports leagues stopped. Entertainment and the sports space stopped. They weren’t sure what to do, and we could keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HnD2RQ"&gt;We have a very sticky product by being digital and by being more flexible and how we engage, excite, and monetize the fan and consumer. And that’s something that while the playbook isn’t well-established ubiquitously across all of the esports universe, people are flushing it out and figuring it out and finding interesting sticky trends here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VzvjM9"&gt;So it’s very much an industry in formation still.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitbit’s Mindful Method is an exclusive wellness program for Premium subscribers </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2mwlRJlbLl9lsfItSTesuyccB7s=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68861006/20200920FitbitSense7.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Brent Rose for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CBRAnu"&gt;Fitbit is launching an exclusive wellness program for Fitbit Premium subscribers called Mindful Method. The program is created by alternative medicine specialist Deepak Chopra and builds on the company’s focus on stress management that started with the Sense smartwatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXjdy9"&gt;Mindful Method encompasses over 30 audio and video sessions on topics like mindfulness, sleep, stress management, wellness, and the mind-body connection, Fitbit says. The program is taught by Chopra, a renowned author and wellness expert, with more sessions from Chopra planned to be released over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GEu2ao"&gt;&lt;q&gt;From biofeedback to bioregulation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5bEEdv"&gt;In a press presentation of the new program, Chopra led attendees through a sample meditation from Mindful Method. Overall, the experience was not that different from what I’ve done in other meditation apps like Calm or Headspace, though Mindful Method aims to differentiate itself by featuring more of Chopra’s philosophy of wellness combined with the data provided by Fitbit’s watches and Premium service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmXJi6"&gt;Fitbit says Premium already features over 100 mindfulness audio tracks, but adding new ones from a recognizable name could make a difference for the Fitbit owner who hasn’t decided to pay &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20835674/fitbit-premium-subscription-service-personalized-data-challenges"&gt;$9.99 a month for Premium&lt;/a&gt; yet. Mindful Method also builds on Fitbit’s strategy of not just collecting and displaying a variety of data, but making it actionable, what Chopra summarized in his presentation as the move from “biofeedback” to “bioregulation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulCtow"&gt;When Brent Rose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21450123/fitbit-sense-review"&gt;reviewed the Fitbit Sense&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, he found the device’s electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor to provide a generally accurate view of when he was stressed, displayed in the Fitbit app’s Stress Management Score. The existing meditations in Premium where a good way to see how that score could change with some controlled breathing and mindfulness, but now Mindful Method might provide an even more comprehensive way to learn about why you’re stressed and what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWTQKD"&gt;The first 10 sessions of Mindful Method with Deepak Chopra are available now for Premium subscribers in Fitbit’s app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7taUz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
