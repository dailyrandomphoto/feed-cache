    <title>Alienware’s Concept Nyx aims to let you cast your PC games to any screen you own</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Alienware Concept Nyx" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I-HIgPptN7DXRmBQu7Ko0j7bTj4=/0x0:1494x996/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70340920/nyxmain.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contrary to this image, Concept Nyx squeezes both screens down in size to make the full playing space for each game viewable.&lt;/em&gt; | Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fLz1HK"&gt;For CES 2022, Alienware is showing off its Concept Nyx, which imagines a future when loading and playing games on a variety of screens can happen as instantaneously as streaming music and TV shows. The idea is simple on its face (though undoubtedly complex underneath the veil): through the Nyx software, all of your PC games would be available to stream wirelessly to a variety of screens at home, regardless of where you bought them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rr82iA"&gt;Imagine you’re playing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; on your PC display, but you want to move over to the living room couch and play on a big TV. The idea is that you’d be able to tap a button in an app, and the game would wirelessly swap displays, letting you hog the TV all to yourself or have your game squeeze next to another in a split-view mode. Alienware is working to make it possible to stream up to four games at once. Alienware demoed Nyx to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; with repurposed Concept UFO controllers that we last saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/6/21048262/alienware-concept-ufo-prototype-gaming-pc-nintendo-switch-ces-2020"&gt;at CES 2020 attached to a Switch-like tablet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware Concept Nyx" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2mQbUcIO-IZA0rigKWGz4O6d3JM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121514/cfaulkner_141231_4944_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is what the main hub looks like in Concept Nyx, though it could change if it develops into a product.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M7ohaG"&gt;In the conceptual phase, Nyx requires a machine that’s powerful enough to run multiple games at once, with networking chops to handle distributing low-latency streams. It’s unclear whether Alienware intends to release its own hardware, when that might be, how much it might cost, and whether what Nyx aims to do will be a paid service. There are clearly a lot of questions for which Alienware needs to provide answers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware Concept Nyx" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jq3-bAOYnZEL_paUTXAtF56w8zM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121516/cfaulkner_141231_4944_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;While still in concept, Nyx worked as intended in our joint session of Cyberpunk 2077 and Rocket League.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LchVo3"&gt;But compared to the likes of Google Stadia and Amazon Luna, Concept Nyx seems built to make accessing and playing your already-owned PC games even easier, with a similar level of device compatibility and, perhaps, fewer compromises in terms of visual quality. In a way, it’s remarkably similar to what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22310321/valve-steam-linux-steam-link-remote-play-together-account"&gt;Valve is already doing with its Remote Play Anywhere feature&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/remoteplay#anywhere"&gt;for free&lt;/a&gt;, to boot. Though, where Nyx intends to differentiate itself is with handling more streams at once and pulling in games from multiple platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9dg7Q"&gt;It was encouraging that Alienware was actually able to pull off the Nyx demo for us successfully, swapping between multiple displays with just a few seconds in between the pass-off from screen to screen. But we’ll need to try it at home and not in a controlled environment to see if it’s ready for the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s latest Frame TVs have a matte screen that looks and feels more like real art</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7pti1IzGKU4LrtsTculYgC4bh_k=/0x7:2040x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70340515/SamsungFrame2022.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mRDDxG"&gt;Samsung has managed to single-handedly define the category of “lifestyle TVs” — high-design TV sets that blend into the home more seamlessly than traditional TVs — with The Frame. I’ve got several friends, coworkers, and family members who have recently purchased some model in The Frame lineup. For them, the device’s stylish look, customizable bezels, and ability to showcase artwork or personal photos when the TV is “off” are more important than the latest picture quality or HDMI specs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUzUz"&gt;For 2022, the company is hoping to take The Frame to the next level and make its wall art parlor trick more convincing than ever before. Samsung says the latest models will have a matte, anti-reflective display with a “lifelike” texture that feels like canvas or paper to the touch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6cBys9"&gt;The anti-reflective display could be a huge draw for consumers; The Frame is able to match the white balance and brightness of artwork based on ambient lighting in a room, but if there’s one thing that gives away the fact that you’re still looking at a TV, it’s screen glare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D3JudfSItHKN7I6XRMtd34f9Mlw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23141061/samsungtheframe.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A comparison of last year’s Frame pitted against the new matte-screened model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vdHjgc"&gt;By introducing a new anti-reflective film and other anti-glare measures, Samsung hopes that oil pantings and other art will pop off the screen to a more impressive extent than before. Unfortunately I haven’t had a chance to see the new anti-reflective displays in person just yet to see how convincing the end result is — or whether there’s any negative effect on the picture when watching regular content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LiYoYf"&gt;The company’s art store offers over 1,600 pieces, and Frame owners can expect a new, more refined user experience in 2022 when browsing that selection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dCG2k1"&gt;For 2022, The Frame will be offered in a total of seven different sizes, starting at 32 inches at the small end and topping out with an 85-inch model. As for the tech specs of the TV itself, they sound similar to last year: The Frame will give you a nice 4K HDR picture with an expanded quantum dot color palette, but it lacks high-end TV features like full-array local dimming, 120Hz support, variable refresh rate, and so on. And Samsung continues to ignore Dolby Vision completely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZiEO3u97yym1rg5bHjAYAtFQkRQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23140162/Screen_Shot_2022_01_02_at_12.45.59_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Based on Samsung’s claims, this guy wouldn’t be seeing much glare on the new Frame.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EyJUrG"&gt;If image quality is your main priority, the company’s top-tier Neo QLED sets (with Mini LED tech) are still the way to go. But that’s not what The Frame is for. This model — and Samsung’s other lifestyle models like The Serif — are for people who want a perfectly acceptable picture in a package that complements their home decor instead of clashing with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1hES6"&gt;Pricing, release info, and more detailed tech specs for the 2022 Frame lineup should be announced closer to when the TVs begin shipping in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung promises ‘groundbreaking’ new TV feature: NFT support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cTgYFV3oCz-_ctXyMIwvT3rh7W0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70340516/acastro_190503_1777_samsung_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VGT2os"&gt;Staring at your non-fungible tokens on a smartphone or laptop screen is fine and all, but why not remind everyone who visits your home of the money you spent on digital art NFTs by showcasing them on your TV screen? Somehow we’re in a world where that’s about to become reality: Samsung says it’s planning extensive support for NFTs beginning with its 2022 TV lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVGvQT"&gt;“With demand for NFTs on the rise, the need for a solution to today’s fragmented viewing and purchasing landscape has never been greater,” the company said in a press release. “In 2022, Samsung is introducing the world’s first TV screen-based NFT explorer and marketplace aggregator, a groundbreaking platform that lets you browse, purchase, and display your favorite art — all in one place.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xIZQoUACx3vNlz3G26aD-0Yhqec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132567/Samsung_NFT_Aggregation_Platform.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A preview of Samsung’s upcoming NFT TV platform.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NnF6vh"&gt;According to Samsung, this platform (shown above) will let creators “share their art with the world” and let potential buyers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JvZNsL"&gt;Preview an NFT before purchasing it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4rPEVg"&gt;Learn about an NFT’s history and blockchain metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="NlZTbd"&gt;Samsung is also minding the details when it comes to viewing NFTs on its 2022 televisions. A smart calibration feature on the TVs will automatically adjust display settings “to the creator’s preset values, so you can have peace of mind that your work looks impeccable, with true-to-the-original image quality.” You’ve heard of things like Dolby Vision or Netflix Calibrated Mode, and now NFTs will get a similar treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wiUCHj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OH3vKf"&gt;More details on the NFT platform should be made available as the 2022 TVs start shipping in the coming months. With today’s news, Samsung becomes the first major TV manufacturer to support NFTs to such a significant degree. Are we witnessing the kickoff of a trend? Is there no going back? Might your next Roku or Amazon Fire TV also come with some level of NFT integration? Stay tuned to our coverage of CES 2022 to see whether other companies follow suit. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new TV remote uses radio waves from your router to stay charged</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VNK6eRHLhRP1Bp0RG8QkbyJBARU=/89x0:1952x1242/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70340510/samsungremote.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image; Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MYb9Qc"&gt;CES is always a moment when companies reiterate their dedication to environmental causes and trumpet their latest, more efficient products and packaging. After introducing a solar-powered Eco Remote for its 2021 TVs, Samsung is back again with a new version that comes with a pretty fascinating trick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O7Jvoj"&gt;Like the previous Eco Remote, this one can be charged with solar energy, but Samsung has also added RF harvesting capabilities that let the remote preserve its charge by “collecting routers’ radio waves and converting them to energy.” Neat. You don’t see this in many gadgets — mostly because it’s really only practical for low-power devices. But remotes certainly fall into that category. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvwnDe"&gt;Aside from the new RF harvesting option, the Eco Remote can be charged from both outdoor and indoor light or (for the fastest results) over USB-C.  Samsung says it’s introducing a white model of the remote this year, which the company says is meant to better complement its “lifestyle” TVs like The Frame, Serif, and Sero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIFkJB"&gt;As with the original remote, the intention here is to ditch AAA batteries. &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/preserving-our-planet-2-making-tv-accessories-more-sustainable"&gt;Samsung has previously estimated&lt;/a&gt; that switching to solar-powered remotes could avoid 99 million discarded batteries over the course of seven years. It has also explored other ways of self-charging the internal battery such as “harnessing the kinetic energy that’s created when the remote is shaken” and “using the vibrational energy that’s created when the microphone picks up sounds.” But this time around it settled on adding RF harvesting as another way to keep the clicker functioning whenever you need it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new 2022 TVs bring Nvidia GeForce Now and Google Stadia gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZcTXnzZmz1F6JaBapQFNvp-N-dY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70340511/GAMINGHUB_LANDINGPAGE_3_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The new “Samsung Gaming Hub”  | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1u6XKr"&gt;Samsung is revealing a new lineup of smart TVs at CES 2022 today, including features as exotic as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22624431"&gt;radio-wave powered remote controls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22622739"&gt;support for NFTs&lt;/a&gt; — and they also happen to be the first Samsung sets in a while to let you play triple-A video games from the cloud instead of just your Xbox, PlayStation or PC. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747063/samsung-cloud-gaming-service-tizen-tv-announcement"&gt;After an vague tease in October&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung is now confirming that “select” 2022 models will explicitly offer access to Nvidia’s GeForce Now, Google Stadia, and the Utomik cloud gaming service as part of a new “Samsung Gaming Hub,” a user interface which Samsung’s intending to expand to additional services as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNY3Gz"&gt;The Samsung Gaming Hub isn’t just for cloud gaming, either. Intriguingly, the company says that your HDMI-connected video game consoles will be part of it as well — complete with passthrough controller inputs. That means you might be able to play cloud games and console games with the same controller, instead of having to maintain separate controllers or pair back and forth, with both PlayStation and Xbox controllers supported at launch. It’s also promising “AI Gaming technology” that will create curated game recommendations on your TV’s home screen, which... okay, sure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIPHjV"&gt;It’s interesting to see TV manufacturers embrace cloud gaming again, after a bit of a lapse. While LG and Samsung both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/5/3066544/samsung-gaikai-cloud-gaming-service"&gt;competed for the rights to stream games from Gaikai and OnLive back in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, and some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/9/8752917/playstation-now-samsung-smart-tv-launch"&gt;Samsung TVs offered Sony’s PlayStation Now&lt;/a&gt; between 2015 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/15/14626676/playstation-now-discontinued-ps3-vita-smart-tvs"&gt;and 2017&lt;/a&gt;, it’s only this winter that LG and Samsung are back in the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22823092/google-stadia-comes-to-lg-smart-tv-webos-5-6"&gt;with Nvidia and Google’s services.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9HkDB"&gt;It’s not clear whether Samsung’s TVs will offer the best picture and audio quality for cloud gaming quite yet, as the company was unable to say whether either GeForce Now or Google Stadia would offer 4K streaming. “We are working with partners to bring their best levels of service to our platform,” reads part of a statement from Samsung gaming product director Mike Lucero to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We will be announcing details as we get closer to launch.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oe04l6"&gt;If you’ve got an earlier Samsung Smart TV, there’s also no telling whether you’ll get access to any of these features. “We are starting with our 2022 models and are working to make the Gaming Hub available to even more Samsung customers,” writes Lucero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71nY73"&gt;It’s interesting to me that Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming, aka xCloud, isn’t part of this launch. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134167/microsoft-samsung-xbox-partnership-xcloud-cloud-game-streaming"&gt;Microsoft and Samsung prominently partnered on cloud gaming&lt;/a&gt; in February 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514030/microsoft-xcloud-samsung-smart-fridge-doom-enternal-xbox-games-android"&gt;and we got xCloud on a smart fridge&lt;/a&gt; and some Samsung Android phones, but the Xbox app for smart TVs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612714/microsoft-xbox-app-tv-xcloud-streaming-app"&gt;that Phil Spencer told us about in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; hasn’t materialized yet. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527420/microsoft-xbox-tv-app-streaming-stick-xcloud"&gt;only got a brief mention last June&lt;/a&gt; ahead of — instead of during — the E3 2021 video game expo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NnkDm"&gt;Samsung Smart TVs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15930676/samsung-smart-tv-4k-steam-link-streaming-games"&gt;have offered a Steam Link app&lt;/a&gt; for a while, but Lucero tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;it won’t be part of this Gaming Hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxVqQh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, 9:37 PM ET: Samsung says that GeForce Now, Stadia and Utomik will be offered via the hub, but will not come preinstalled on the TVs as we initially implied. Also, Samsung adds that Xbox and PlayStation controllers will be among those supported for passthrough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s 2022 TV lineup has big software changes, smaller hardware upgrades</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4k6f_sUcRqq9BGS5n3lZDjkpZW4=/91x0:1950x1239/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70340521/samsung2022tv.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6UoYJj"&gt;Samsung introduced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215172/samsung-neo-qled-4k-8k-tv-announced-specs-ces-2021"&gt;first TVs with Mini LED technology&lt;/a&gt; at CES 2021, and they wound up being perhaps the best sets that the company has produced yet — not counting the exorbitantly priced The Wall, that is. So this year, Samsung is opting for a different approach: it’s taking smaller strides in hardware and focusing more of its efforts on software refinement and new features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mbvehv"&gt;Samsung’s 2022 TVs will continue to run the company’s Tizen OS, but they’ll now come with a totally revamped home screen that’s described as “a testament to our vision for the future of TVs.” The first part of the new user experience is what Samsung calls the Media Screen. This will “put all of your streaming service content into one, easy-to-browse place” with a continue watching section that aggregates content “from any provider” — so Samsung claims, anyway. There will of course be personalized recommendations as well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wmmgmGC5G799fstyRFt19PjCBSo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23140148/2022smarthub.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung has redesigned its TV home screen for 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3XHl6F"&gt;It all sounds very similar to Google TV and the Apple TV app; everyone wants to be your main portal for browsing entertainment, leaving streaming apps just to play the movies and shows you want to watch. The streaming services don’t always love this strategy; Netflix in particular has a history of pushing back against letting others curate its content, and as a result doesn’t participate in either Google TV &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208083"&gt;or the Apple TV app&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfokFR"&gt;Here are some other software additions coming in 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xIK4ks"&gt;Watch Together: Samsung is expanding its multi-view feature to deliver what it claims is “the world’s first TV-based platform for experiencing live and streaming content with friends and family” remotely. You’ll be able to plug in a USB video camera or even use a smartphone or tablet’s camera for video chatting with those you’re watching with. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BFHA4L"&gt;NFT aggregation platform: Yes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22622739"&gt;NFTs are coming to the living room&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung’s the first major TV manufacturer to significantly put its weight behind NFTs. The company says it will provide “a groundbreaking platform that lets you browse, purchase, and display your favorite art — all in one place.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="psoSgM"&gt;MicroLED TVs come in new sizes, remain out of reach for normal people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ijK0KY"&gt;Samsung is producing new models of its MicroLED displays that debuted several years ago as The Wall. For 2022, the company says MicroLED displays are now “bezel-free.” As always, the modular panel technology allows (extremely wealthy) customers to configure whatever screen size works best for their situation — topping out at an enormous 178 inches. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KIWbj7gfdIxEmGPf3woJslEFwyU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23140137/samsungmicro.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s ultra-luxury MicroLED displays now have a bezel-free design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kvZRve"&gt;Aside from the custom jobs, Samsung also offers pre-made models of MicroLED TVs in 99- and 110-inch sizes. For 2022, the company is adding an 89-inch MicroLED TV to that lineup. There’s no pricing info as of yet, but you can expect MicroLED to continue to cost far more than even the nicest, biggest OLEDs on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzhHsb"&gt;As a refresher, MicroLED shares many properties with OLED — the microscopic LEDs deliver self-emissive, pixel-level light control — but doesn’t come with the same downsides (like the “organic” part that can limit a panel’s lifespan or potentially lead to burn-in). It could succeed OLED if prices ever come down, but 2022 certainly won’t be the year that happens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Se9MYG"&gt;Samsung’s Mini LED TVs now look even better when bright&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EQjUEi"&gt;Since this will be just the second year that Samsung offers Mini LED 8K and 4K TVs as part of its “Neo QLED” line, the company isn’t making drastic hardware changes. And it doesn’t really &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to, since last year’s sets represented a significant step up in contrast, black levels, and gaming performance. Samsung says it has “increased the luminance scale from a 12-bit to a 14-bit backlight — delivering significantly more accurate brightness” for the 2022 models. It calls this 14-bit HDR Mapping. And the TVs now use AI to analyze a scene and better separate the foreground subject from the background, creating a greater sense of depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exSt9h"&gt;Additionally, AI also helps produce adaptive “shapes of light” with the many backlight dimming zones to cut down on blooming and enhance brightness and contrast. Combined with 14-bit HDR Mapping, Samsung says this will bring out details that weren’t so obvious on last year’s Neo QLED TVs and make details pop more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwL8As"&gt;Sadly Samsung still isn’t getting on board with Dolby Vision in 2022. Maybe next year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BXBhSp51O1A0c68sZtxS6Xs2qpA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23140144/SamsungNEOQLED.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung says its 2022 Neo QLED TVs will feature improved depth and expanded 14-bit HDR Mapping. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oPuk56"&gt;For the PC gaming crowd, Samsung says select models of its 2022 TV lineup will be capable of variable refresh rates up to 144Hz — up from 120Hz — and will be among the first TVs to support &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/free-sync"&gt;AMD’s FreeSync Premium Pro&lt;/a&gt;. All HDMI ports on the higher-end TVs will be 2.1 and support 4K 120Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADcueW"&gt;Most significant of all, the company is adding a new, more comprehensive Gaming Hub to this year’s TVs as another piece of the software improvements. My colleague Sean Hollister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22626855"&gt;covers that feature more here&lt;/a&gt;. On last year’s models, Samsung had a gaming bar that let you see a game’s FPS or quickly adjust important next-gen gaming settings, but the new hub goes further and aims to be an all-in-one destination for both console and cloud gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWcRtp"&gt;The upper-end TVs come with a bundle of audio features like Active Voice Amplifier, Object Tracking Sound (to make it seem like sound is actually coming out of the screen), and SpaceFit Sound for automatic calibration. But as ever, Samsung would prefer you pair its 2022 TVs with a range of soundbars and other home theater gear &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-2022-micro-led-neo-qled-lifestyle-tvs-personalization-options-ces-2022/?utm_source=pr&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ces2022"&gt;it’s also announcing at CES 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for further coverage as all of the company’s latest products get closer to shipping in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTuber figured out Asus Z690 Hero motherboards melted down due to backward capacitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z_X9mfqRGCtklwFKH2VcQxFuTD0=/214x0:2446x1488/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70340147/asus_z690_hero_motherboard_burning.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An Asus Z690 Hero motherboard with burnt up MOSFETs. | Image by Actually Hardcore Overclocking via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VkO4wiEAY4" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rLsyHK"&gt;A YouTuber who goes by the name of Buildzoid on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrwObTfqv8u1KO7Fgk-FXHQ"&gt;Actually Hardware Overlocking channel&lt;/a&gt; has figured out that a backward capacitor on the Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Hero motherboard is causing it to melt down, according to a report by &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/asus-owns-up-to-fiery-z690-motherboard-flaw-starts-recall-program"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Asus has since acknowledged the issue &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Fus%2Fnews%2Fu5866wtjwmbj1fue%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F2%2F22864072%2Fasus-z690-hero-motherboards-meltdown-backward-capacitors" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a post on its site&lt;/a&gt; and plans on issuing replacements to customers with affected motherboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ei1Uly"&gt;Problems with the Z690 Hero motherboard started turning up on the &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/forum/showthread.php?127013-ASUS-Z690-Maximus-Hero-Motherboard-Burnt-with-QCODE-53-and-QLED-Orange"&gt;Asus support forum&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/rjjjzm/asus_rog_maximus_z690_hero/"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/rjp8tt/asus_rog_z690_hero_motherboard_two_mobos_dead_in/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, and the issues experienced by users are pretty much identical. As noted by &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/asus-z690-hero-failure-figured-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, users reported that their motherboards started smoking in the same spot: the two MOSFETs (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) next to the DIMM slots and the Q-code reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tOmice"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2VkO4wiEAY4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nrrFnw"&gt;In a video on his channel, Buildzoid diagnoses the issue using only the pictures posted to support forums and on Reddit, attributing the Z690 Hero’s failure to the backward capacitor installed next to the MOSFETs, not the MOSFETs themselves. Buildzoid looks closely at the images of the motherboard, pointing out that the text on the capacitor is actually upside down, a potential sign that it’s installed incorrectly. As &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; mentions, a reversed capacitor results in reversed polarity, causing the MOSFETs to malfunction and burn up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HMxXeI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have preliminarily identified a potential reversed memory capacitor issue”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOcxGU"&gt;After news about the issue started gaining traction, Asus confirmed that Buildzoid’s diagnosis is, in fact, correct. “In our ongoing investigation, we have preliminarily identified a potential reversed memory capacitor issue in the production process from one of the production lines that may cause debug error code 53, no post, or motherboard components damage,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Fus%2Fnews%2Fu5866wtjwmbj1fue%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F2%2F22864072%2Fasus-z690-hero-motherboards-meltdown-backward-capacitors" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus announced&lt;/a&gt;. “The issue potentially affects units manufactured in 2021 with the part number 90MB18E0-MVAAY0 and serial number starting with MA, MB, or MC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yigb2m"&gt;The company says you can find your Z690 Hero’s serial number and part number on the side of your motherboard’s packaging, as well as on the sticker that’s placed on the top or bottom of the motherboard itself. In &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ASUSPCDIY/permalink/4773559936060389/"&gt;a separate post&lt;/a&gt; on Asus’ Facebook page, the company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Fsupport%2Frog-maximus-z690-hero-checking&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F2%2F22864072%2Fasus-z690-hero-motherboards-meltdown-backward-capacitors" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;added a link to a tool&lt;/a&gt; that checks whether your Z690 Hero is affected by the issue based on its serial number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLFYfZ"&gt;“Going forward, we are continuing our thorough inspection with our suppliers and customers to identify all possible affected ROG Maximus Z690 Hero motherboards in the market and will be working with relevant government agencies on a replacement program,” Asus states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUL89Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T, Verizon CEOs reject FAA request to delay 5G expansions scheduled to start January 5th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8UYB9Ro1T8EwZdxzmrseNt1ZLTI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70339935/DSCF1198-3.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="27VCuY"&gt;In an ongoing battle pitting the FAA and airlines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834080/5g-rollout-delay-faa-fcc-letter"&gt;against the FCC&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon, and AT&amp;amp;T over their planned launch of mid-band 5G service, the mobile carriers are declining a request by the FAA for a two-week delay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKG5X6"&gt;Earlier this year, an FCC auction &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;sold the two carriers rights to use so-called “C-band” frequencies at a price of nearly $70 billion&lt;/a&gt;. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are eager to roll it out so that in addition to offering ultra-fast 5G connectivity in specific areas using high-band millimeter-wave technology and much slower 5G over low-band frequencies, the new spectrum will provide in-between performance over much wider areas. T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746708/att-5g-plus-expansion-tmobile"&gt;currently uses mid-band spectrum that isn’t in the C-band&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="iYGP4g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better  ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="dqEUXt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thank goodness: No more delays for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/5G?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#5G&lt;/a&gt; in C-Band! We can have safe wireless and safe flights. Reasoned people should accept US wireless industry not have more C-Band limitations than France.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon CEOs reject U.S. request for 5G deployment delay &lt;a href="https://t.co/AJVZoCofuq"&gt;https://t.co/AJVZoCofuq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike O’Rielly (@MPORielly) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MPORielly/status/1477713404710244355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 2, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RLKcpu"&gt;On Friday, US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and FAA Administrator Steve Dickson sent a letter to AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey and Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/1/22862481/buttigieg-faa-request-two-week-5g-delay-aircraft-safety"&gt;asking them to push back plans to start commercial deployment on January 5th&lt;/a&gt;. The air travel regulators said they’d use that time to identify priority airports, notify flights, and line up alternate methods of compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcW0It"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-02/at-t-verizon-reject-u-s-request-for-delay-in-new-5g-service"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/att-verizon-ceos-reject-us-request-5g-deployment-delay-2022-01-02/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report that in a response letter today from the two CEOs, the companies, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;had already ceded to a 30-day delay request&lt;/a&gt; and agreed to reduce the power of their signals, said no. They propose to start using the C-band spectrum to expand their 5G services, but with a commitment to avoid deployment around certain airports for six months, saying a similar system is already in place in France. However, that commitment relies “on the condition that the FAA and the aviation industry are committed to doing the same without escalating their grievances, unfounded as they are, in other venues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSPJju"&gt;In the letter (included below), they say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HS7GC8"&gt;“Now, on the evening of New Year’s Eve, just five days before the C-Band spectrum will be deployed, we received your letter asking us to take still more voluntary steps - to the detriment of our millions of consumer, business and government customers - to once again assist the aviation industry and the FAA after failing to resolve issues in that costly 30-day delay period, which we never considered to be an initial one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXEdKr"&gt;“At its core, your proposed framework asks that we agree to transfer oversight of our companies’ multi-billion dollar investment in 50 unnamed metropolitan areas representing the lion’s share of the U.S. population to the FAA for an undetermined number of months or years. Even worse, the proposal is directed to only two companies, regardless of the terms of licenses auctioned and granted, and to the exception of every other company and industry within the purview of the FCC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9i3XL1"&gt;“...we will again volunteer, in the spirit of cooperation and good faith, to alter our use of the C-Band spectrum during the same six-month period (unless we and the FAA determine that these voluntary limits should be relaxed sooner). Specifically, for six months, until July 5, 2022, we will adopt the same C-Band radio exclusion zones that are already in use in France, with slight adaptation to reflect the modest technical differences in how C-band is being deployed in the two countries. That approach – which is one of the most conservative in the world – would include extensive exclusion zones around the runways at certain airports. The effect would be to further reduce C-band signal levels by at least 10 times on the runway or during the last mile of final approach and the first mile after takeoff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="b4h9nS"&gt;FCC commissioner Mike O’Reilly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MPORielly/status/1477713404710244355"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; about the letter, saying, “We can have safe wireless and safe flights. Reasoned people should accept US wireless industry not have more C-Band limitations than France.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWfiVb"&gt;At issue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822875/5g-faa-rule-c-band-landing-airport-bad-weather-visibility"&gt;is the idea&lt;/a&gt; that guided landing systems for aircraft “could be limited due to concerns that the 5G signal could interfere with the accuracy of an airplane’s radio altimeter, without other mitigations in place,” according to the FAA. C-band 5G and these radio altimeters don’t actually operate in the same band, but the bands are close enough that the fear exists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcqWym"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; points out that the trade group &lt;a href="https://www.airlines.org/"&gt;Airlines for America&lt;/a&gt; that represents American Airlines, JetBlue, Delta, FedEx, and UPS, among others, has threatened to go to court on Monday if the FCC does not take action on the 5G rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2zopI"&gt;So far, the FAA’s response to the letter is that “We are reviewing the latest letter from the wireless companies on how to mitigate interference from 5G C-band transmissions. U.S. aviation safety standards will guide our next actions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft issues a fix for Exchange Y2K22 bug that shut down company emails</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ehK6HL20PSAwFOmtzIsRAyfqHQc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70339887/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2gYpL8"&gt;If you woke up on January 1st, 2022, and found that your work email’s inbox was unusually empty, you aren’t alone. Microsoft rang in the New Year with a bug that prevents Exchange servers from sending emails, but fortunately, a fix has since been issued, as detailed in a report by &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-releases-emergency-fix-for-exchange-year-2022-bug/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4V368m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The problem relates to a date check failure with the change of the new year”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pLckVJ"&gt;“The problem relates to a date check failure with the change of the new year and is not a failure of the AV engine itself,” Microsoft explains in &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/email-stuck-in-exchange-on-premises-transport-queues/ba-p/3049447"&gt;a post on its Tech Community forum&lt;/a&gt;. “The version checking performed against the signature file is causing the malware engine to crash, resulting in messages being stuck in transport queues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNgPrt"&gt;Microsoft outlines the solution to the problem in its post, requiring administrators to either implement the fix manually or apply an automated script. The post also contains a detailed FAQ, noting that the solution “will take some time” for administrators to implement. And depending on how many emails are stuck in the queue, it may take a while for the messages to land in their intended recipients’ inboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4Mz7r"&gt;Problems started cropping up at midnight on January 1st, with &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/rt91z6/exchange_2019_antimalware_bad_update/"&gt;an Exchange administrator on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; calling attention to the issue. As explained by &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-exchange-year-2022-bug-in-fip-fs-breaks-email-delivery/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, administrators began noticing error messages in the Exchange Server’s Event Log, such as “The FIP-FS Scan Process failed initialization. Error: 0x8004005. Error Details: Unspecified Error” or “Error Code: 0x80004005. Error Description: Can’t convert “2201010001” to long.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIW88v"&gt;Administrators were forced to come up with alternate solutions during the time it took for Microsoft to address the issue, but now that the company has released an official fix, it looks like the Y2K22 crisis is over.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla delivered close to one million vehicles in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U6KjI9crz_PpzkuocI-ngJ8McHc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70339586/jbareham_180213_2301_0109.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yGNZG2"&gt;Tesla delivered a record 936,172 vehicles in 2021, as outlined in a &lt;a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q4-2021-vehicle-production-deliveries"&gt;report from Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, representing an 87 percent increase over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210191/tesla-delivery-goal-elon-musk-vehicles-2020"&gt;499,550 vehicle deliveries Tesla made in 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zRznkj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Great work by Tesla team worldwide! &lt;a href="https://t.co/lsDTCJtMrp"&gt;https://t.co/lsDTCJtMrp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1477700424933253123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 2, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FFS2cd"&gt;The company managed to deliver 308,600 cars in the last quarter of 2021 alone, up from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22704830/tesla-sold-241300-cars-third-quarter"&gt;241,300 deliveries in the third quarter&lt;/a&gt;. Of those deliveries, 11,750 were for the Model S and X, while 296,850 were for the Model 3 and Y. Both the Model 3 and Y also made up the majority of deliveries throughout the entire year at 936,172 shipments, compared to the 24,964 Model S and X deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1leKyH"&gt;Tesla previously stated that it plans on increasing its deliveries by about 50 percent every year, and although it didn’t hit one million shipments, it has still surpassed its annual growth goal. In November, an internal memo revealed that Tesla CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807387/tesla-quarterly-deliveries-end-rush-elon-musk-memo"&gt;told his employees to stop rushing&lt;/a&gt; to make deliveries by the end of the quarter and to instead focus on cutting costs, noting that he expected a wave of vehicles from Tesla’s factories in California and China to reach customers in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAcH8e"&gt;The ongoing chip shortage has caused a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787339/chevrolet-trucks-heated-seats-2022-models-chip-shortage-supply-chain-issues"&gt;number of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701086/cadillac-super-cruise-2022-escalade-semiconductor-shortage"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765709/bmw-chip-shortage-touchscreen-car-suv-manufacturing"&gt;manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; to pump their brakes, Tesla included. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;Tesla rewrote its own software&lt;/a&gt; to help mitigate the impact of the shortage, and also had to briefly &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-temporarily-halted-u-s-production-over-parts-shortage-11614295075"&gt;shut down production at its California plant&lt;/a&gt; in February. Some customers even reported that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/13/22780037/tesla-reportedly-shipping-cars-without-usb-ports"&gt;USB ports were missing&lt;/a&gt; in their vehicles, potentially because of the shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBvReC"&gt;Despite all this, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744504/hertz-tesla-order-100000-vehicles-electrify-fleet"&gt;Tesla’s value exceeded $1 trillion&lt;/a&gt; in October after rental car company Hertz added 100,000 Teslas to its fleet. The company even had its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736859/tesla-q3-earnings-profit-chip-shortage-sales-elon-musk"&gt;most profitable quarter ever&lt;/a&gt; in the third quarter of 2021, but that may change, considering that earnings for the final quarter of 2021 have not yet been released.&lt;/p&gt;
