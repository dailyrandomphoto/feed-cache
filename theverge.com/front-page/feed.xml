        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You should now be able to download iOS 15.2&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NjCL3h"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15.2, which includes a ton of features and fixes, has started to become roll out to iPhones after an extensive beta period. According to Apple’s release notes, posted by &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/13/apple-releases-ios-15-2-watchos-8-3-and-tvos-15-2-to-all-users/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/apple-releases-ios-15-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the update includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="txvrW9"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774873/apple-digital-legacy-program-comes-to-ios15-iphones-macs"&gt;The Digital Legacy program&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22812264/digital-legacy-death-estate-google-apple-how-to"&gt;designate who gets access to your data&lt;/a&gt; when you die&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1i2stA"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22749352/apple-app-privacy-report-ios-15-2-beta-feature"&gt;The App Privacy Report&lt;/a&gt;, which shows what permissions your apps use, and what websites they connect to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TqxDX0"&gt;Apple’s $4.99 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822631/apple-music-voice-plan-ios-15-2-release-candidate"&gt;voice-only plan for Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5Jr09g"&gt;A fix for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778650/apple-iphone-13-pro-beta-macro-mode-button-auto-switching"&gt;somewhat confusing state of the 13 Pro’s macro mode&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="2XMGjZ"&gt;The update also brings with it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776028/ios-15-2-beta-communication-safety-messages-children-sexually-explicit-nudity-scan-notifications"&gt;some of Apple’s communication safety features&lt;/a&gt;, one of which will blur iMessages sent to children that an on-device scan tags as potentially being explicit. The feature was part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;Apple’s controversial suite of changes&lt;/a&gt; meant to fight child sexual abuse material (CSAM), which involved on-device scanning of photos uploaded to iCloud, as well as automatically notifying parents if their child chose to view pictures tagged as inappropriate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ItxICe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kb2zI4"&gt;Apple has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;delayed the photo library scanning feature&lt;/a&gt; and has made it so that children get to choose whether to notify their parents. iOS 15.2 also brings changes to Safari and Siri that will redirect users to resources if they search for topics related to CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpg3CG"&gt;The update also includes Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22824733/apple-iphone-part-service-history-ios-15-2"&gt;new parts and service history feature&lt;/a&gt;, which can show you which parts on your device have been replaced and whether the job was done using genuine Apple parts. Apple says that the iPhone XR, XS, and SE second-gen will show if your battery was replaced and that the iPhone 11 and up will also show if your display has been replaced. The iPhone 12 and 13 models will be able to show info about camera replacements as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsjGrg"&gt;The repair history will show up in Settings &amp;gt; General  &amp;gt; About, under the name and software version section. If you haven’t replaced the battery, screen, or camera on your phone, it won’t show up, according to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212878"&gt;Apple’s support document&lt;/a&gt; for the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCRjka"&gt;To download iOS 15.2, go to Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Software Update. As usual, it can take a moment to roll out to everyone, so if you don’t see it you may want to check back in after a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qY1oWF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 13th, 3:04PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added info about repair history info.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok’s 2021 music recap says it’s getting even better at creating billion-listen megahits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X3Xavq_yGCAkcBQaNmfEWKgByYg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70265996/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pBzv5R"&gt;TikTok says that around 430 songs exceeded 1 billion video views on the platform this year, three times as many songs as last year, as noted in &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/year-on-tiktok-music-report-2021"&gt;2021’s Year on TikTok Music Report&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the most popular songs in this bracket garnered around or above 20 billion views in videos that use them as soundtracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1gB4cK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Over 175 trending TikTok songs made it to the Billboard Hot 100 this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xxWQ1W"&gt;TikTok’s yearly recap also includes some numbers on how these songs performed when not attached to a TikTok video. Over 175 trending TikTok songs made it to the Billboard Hot 100 this year, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/year-on-tiktok-music-2020"&gt;up from 90 in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. TikTok also takes credit for helping a number of artists skyrocket themselves to stardom, like ex-Verizon employee Tai Verdes, who made it to the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time with his trending TikTok song “A-O-K.” Another emerging artist on TikTok, PinkPantheress, racked up “hundreds of millions of combined streams” on Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFS2nT"&gt;The most popular artists on the platform come as no surprise — Megan Thee Stallion and Doja Cat landed in the number one and two spots, respectively, echoing the leaderboard from last year. Rapper Popp Hunna was the third most popular artist this year, a spot previously held by Pop Smoke. Meanwhile, “Astronaut in the Ocean” by Masked Wolf, “Beggin’” by Maneskin, and “Adderall (Corvette Corvette)” by Popp Hunna took the top three spots as the most popular songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulQpLu"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/year-on-tiktok-2021-us"&gt;TikTok also debuted its yearly roundup&lt;/a&gt; of the most popular videos on the platform. This time around, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@totouchanemu/video/6990181852803894533"&gt;@totouchanemu’s video&lt;/a&gt; of himself dancing — which was shot with a drone — was the most viral video on the platform with 43.9 million views. An &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chipmunksoftiktok/video/6975140587196517638"&gt;adorable video of a chipmunk&lt;/a&gt; stuffing its face with nuts from @chipmunksoftiktok was the second most popular, while &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@_catben_/video/6959661816582622469"&gt;@_catben_’s oddly satisfying video&lt;/a&gt; of restocking various household products took third place. In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21827432/bella-poarch-tiktok-top-viral-video-2020-420doggface208-jason-derulo-savage-love"&gt;Bella Poarch’s “M to the B” lip sync was the most viral&lt;/a&gt; video on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4o66WU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"TikTok rolls out Creator Next and expands money-making opportunities for creators ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811973/tiktok-creator-next-monetization-tips-video-gifts"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="CBBduo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple releases Android app to help find sneaky AirTags</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KY4BEXF4EvnZH2A-B3nMIj0kPB0=/0x56:566x433/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70265952/Screen_Shot_2021_12_13_at_11.13.48.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tracker Detect works on Android 9 and above.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hnHV3z"&gt;Apple has released an app called Tracker Detect, which the company says will let Android users search for AirTags or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;other Find My-compatible trackers&lt;/a&gt;, such as the Chipolo One Spot tracking tag (&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-launches-airtags-and-find-my-detector-app-for-android-in-effort-to-boost-privacy/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to the app, it looks for devices that have been separated from their owners — if it finds any, it will let you play a sound on it so you can locate it, and it will give you instructions on how to figure out who the AirTag belongs to and how to disable it if need be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drdQju"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22516178/apple-airtags-tracking-devices-update-play-sound-privacy-android-app"&gt;announced that this app was coming in June&lt;/a&gt;, promising that it would allow Android users to find potentially malicious trackers being used without their knowledge. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227"&gt;Unlike on iOS&lt;/a&gt;, though, it doesn’t seem like this app will constantly do scans in the background and alert you if something is up — it’s purely a manual search. Tracker Detect also doesn’t help you keep track of the AirTags attached to an Apple account, so it’s not helping Android users actually &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; AirTags.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YdF_fcB-zP5g6_1OrmVltlHAPow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085120/Screenshot_20211213_133032.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can run a manual scan with Tracker Detect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zFc8wj"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but told &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; that the app “gives Android users the ability to scan for an AirTag or supported Find My enabled item trackers that might be traveling with them without their knowledge. We are raising the bar on privacy for our users and the industry, and hope others will follow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhVEWl"&gt;For at least two &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffers, Tracker Detect didn’t show up in a Play Store search on our devices. However, you can install it by &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.trackerdetect"&gt;following this link to its store page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart is selling PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles at 3PM ET today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jEAPQKgxo17PSg21TNBCvbqwM5U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70265886/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wpWwfJ"&gt;If you haven’t been able to secure a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X, you might be in luck. Walmart is opening orders for Sony’s &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1219877/9383?subId1=VergePS5WalmartRestrock121321&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 PS5 Disc Edition&lt;/a&gt; and Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1219877/9383?subId1=VergePS5WalmartRestrock121321&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; (online only) at 3PM ET today, December 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWRDoK"&gt;Several previous drops &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"&gt;have been limited to people who pay for its Walmart Plus subscription&lt;/a&gt;, but this one is open to everyone in the US — no extra fees necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9g41pi"&gt;Remember, it’s usually the first who gets the worm, but not always. If you miss out on the first wave at Walmart, the retailer usually releases more in 10-minute intervals, with the next being at 3:10PM, 3:20PM, and so forth until it runs out of stock. For your best chance, try reloading the page just a few seconds before 3PM ET, and possibly open up the site or app on your phone using a cellular connection to have another way in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="T2BM0q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Wdz7DM"&gt;Also, if you don’t get lucky at first, persist! Sometimes, the “add to cart” button will pop up intermittently, so just be patient and watch closely. It’ll only help your chances of securing a console if you sign in to your Walmart account and ensure that all of your shipping and payment details are set so you can fly through checkout if you get a PS5 or Xbox in your cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gI5wAx"&gt;We’ll add more retailers to this post if any join in on the fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArYNbs"&gt;If all you wanted was the console, well, you’re all set with the links above. But there are several games and accessories you could add to your cart right now that’ll let you have more fun with your PS5 or Xbox Series X when it arrives. Oh, and if you’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791886/ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-consoles-games-delays-supply-shorage"&gt;not sure if we’re in the next generation of gaming yet&lt;/a&gt;, then make sure the first thing you install on your new system is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22828860/the-matrix-awakens-ps5-xbox-series-x-free-next-gen"&gt;Epic Games’ impressive (and free) &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens&lt;/em&gt; demo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mnxwkb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10909049"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ypu17y"&gt;Accessories for the PlayStation 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ft8FYf"&gt;If you do manage to secure Sony’s next-gen console, there are a few additional accessories and games we recommend picking up. You’ll find a few of our favorites below, including Sony’s Pulse 3D headset and two notable PS5 exclusives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2H2zmr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499071"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="PeoPFU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420564"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="qs3S2y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10759065"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="G7fXvi"&gt;Accessories for the Xbox Series X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YjBH3W"&gt;There’s no shortage of accessories available for Microsoft’s Xbox Series X. We’ve highlighted a few of our favorites below, whether you’re looking for a quality headset or a way to burn through &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s campaign without paying $60.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="5VYkaK"&gt;Microsoft is now selling its own Xbox Red Ring of Death poster to commemorate the release of the &lt;em&gt;Power On: The Story of Xbox&lt;/em&gt; docuseries. The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjBp_7RuDBUYbd1LegWEJ8g"&gt;six-part documentary&lt;/a&gt; is a warts and all look at 20 years of Xbox highs and lows, including the infamous red ring of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LafMp"&gt;The Xbox 360’s red ring of death was represented by three out of the four LEDs on an Xbox 360 turning red, a problem that affected a lot of initial consoles as failure rates were incredibly high. It indicated a hardware failure, and it meant Xbox 360 owners had to send their console in for repair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUe1m1"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2d6IMBS8oY"&gt;chapter five of &lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, former Xbox chief Peter Moore reflects on the mistake that cost Microsoft more than $1 billion to fix. “By the time we looked at the cost of repairs, the loss sales that we factored in, we had a $1.15 billion problem,” says Moore. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LxAUzK-I95sdE2CwCgDMNquOpIo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085081/PowerOn_HERO1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power On documents the 20-year history of Xbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wxZ9Xi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://gear.xbox.com/collections/power-on-the-story-of-xbox-premium-prints/products/red-ring-of-death-premium-poster"&gt;The Red Ring of Death poster is $24.99&lt;/a&gt;, which won’t go very far in making up the $1 billion loss, but I’m sure those who worked on Xbox 360 would never have imagined Microsoft would be selling a poster about the failure more than 15 years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6K8Ij4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt; also documents the origins of the first Xbox, released 20 years ago, featuring interviews with those who helped bring it to life. Even former Xbox chief Don Mattrick makes an appearance in the docuseries, discussing the Xbox One launch and the problematic focus on TV, Kinect, and always-connected digital approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edulEz"&gt;If you’re interested in the history of Xbox or video games in general, &lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt; is certainty worth a watch. While it’s created by Microsoft, the company doesn’t shy away from acknowledging its failures, the strong Sony competition, and its impressive achievement of creating a new game console. &lt;em&gt;Power On: The Story of Xbox&lt;/em&gt; is available on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redbox.com%2Fondemand-tvshows%2Fpower-on-the-story-of-xbox&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2F22832667%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-red-ring-of-death-poster-power-on-docuseries" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Redbox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjBp_7RuDBUYbd1LegWEJ8g"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://s.majornelson.com/Proxy.ashx?TSID=98119&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fvideo%2Fdetail%2FB09MXLNXVT&amp;amp;dtb=1"&gt;IMDbTV,&lt;/a&gt; The Roku Channel, &lt;a href="http://s.majornelson.com/Proxy.ashx?TSID=98119&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fseason-1%2F8d6kgwxn5t5q%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab"&gt;Microsoft Movies &amp;amp; TV&lt;/a&gt;, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo Switch and Xbox Series take top slots in US console sales as shortages continue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Ipk4eBVu4q0pdiuepHaMLWUzfw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70265536/acastro_210113_1777_gamingstock_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="erXrqS"&gt;We’ve heard you: many of you are still trying to secure a new video game system, and we’ve done what we can to help people find them. But now, a year after the “next-gen” PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S consoles debuted, they’re still in short supply — and the same goes for Nintendo’s Switch and Switch OLED. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoDHv5"&gt;The retail sales trackers at NPD Group said console hardware sales in November have fallen off by 38 percent to $883 million in November compared to the same month in 2020, which is when the new PlayStation and Xbox launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIFP7w"&gt;That drop comes despite a still-intense desire to obtain the systems, as well as the availability of a new version of Nintendo’s console. This past November, the Switch still dominated sales, and &lt;a href="https://press.nintendo.com/Nintendo-Switch-is-the-Best-selling-Video-Game-Console-in-November-Wit"&gt;the data shows&lt;/a&gt; that, combined, the new and old versions sold 1.13 million units last month, including 550,000 in the week of Black Friday and Thanksgiving. Just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22776640/nintendo-switch-oled-sales-october-2021-doug-bowser-interview"&gt;like it was in October&lt;/a&gt;, it’s the system people can actually get, and it has topped sales charts for 35 of the last 36 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vRbHFl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The global chip shortage is a gamer’s nightmare before Christmas ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oEW7wV"&gt;Sony and Microsoft didn’t eagerly uncover detailed sales data, but NPD analyst Mat Piscatella &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1470385101745786882"&gt;confirmed in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; that the Xbox Series family came in second in unit sales. Regular and extended availability of the slightly less powerful and much cheaper Xbox Series S likely explains their position in November and might suggest one way for those interested to get into next-gen gaming, while the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;chip shortage grinch&lt;/a&gt; keeps a tight hold on supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden launches federal effort to make online benefits less painful</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jyZNRtB_qYJPrSKK_CgBVu7djhI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70265321/51683509077_b3464b6055_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/51683509077/" target="_blank"&gt;White House / Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bYNhON"&gt;President Biden is expected to sign an executive order on Monday that would make it easier for Americans to access a broad swath of federal services and benefits, like renewing a passport or accessing retirement benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvP1h7"&gt;“This executive order is really focused on how the federal government delivers services to the public and ensuring that we deliver a high quality product to the public,” Neera Tanden, senior advisor to the president, told reporters on a press call on Monday. “So, we looked at the points of greatest friction for people with their government like filing taxes, applying for Social Security benefits, waiting in TSA lines, and focused on ways to reduce that friction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNPjQL"&gt;The executive order streamlines government services that have traditionally been difficult for Americans to access. Many government services, like retirement, force people to interact with several federal agencies at once to receive benefits, creating significant administrative burden on both aid recipients and the federal workforce. A more streamlined system could make it easier for people to receive certain services and benefits, bringing the government closer to the standard of online services from the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eAOZ4a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The order targets 36 different “customer experiences” across 17 federal agencies for improvement&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2MHOXZ"&gt;The White House released a fact sheet detailing the order on Monday, writing that the order targets 36 different “customer experiences” across 17 federal agencies for improvement. In the order, Biden promises to revamp USA.gov, brandishing it as a “digital Federal front door” for people seeking access to government services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0WUkt"&gt;Federal agencies will be required to publicly report their progress in developing and launching these new processes and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NKRgW"&gt;“The Federal Government interacts with millions of people each day and provides vital services during some of the most critical moments in people’s lives,” the fact sheet said. “But too often, people have to navigate a tangled web of Government websites, offices, and phone numbers to access the services they depend on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjPSat"&gt;Outside of retirement and disaster relief, the order also promises “shorter security and check-in lines at airports” and better access to federal student loan management. On Monday’s call, senior White House officials did not go into detail on any new technologies that would be used by the TSA, but Tanden said “biometric scanning” may be something the government decides to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEfRgA"&gt;“[The order] organizes our reform efforts around life experiences, like retiring, having a child, or surviving a natural disaster. Those are moments where people, where individuals, may need to interact with the federal government in a really critical way in that critical moment, but also may need to interact with multiple agencies,” Jason Miller, deputy director for management at the office of Management and Budget, told reporters on Monday. “That’s a process that should be simple and seamless. We’re one enterprise and we should operate accordingly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ym2RMA"&gt;The federal government has struggled to make efficient online experiences for Americans seeking benefits, most notably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/8/4814098/why-did-the-tech-savvy-obama-administration-launch-a-busted-healthcare-website"&gt;the Obama administration’s bumpy healthcare.gov rollout&lt;/a&gt; in 2013. At the time, users were unable to make accounts, and others received miscalculated healthcare subsidies. In the wake of that debacle, then-President Obama founded the US Digital Service, which has since launched new systems for Medicare payments and VA discharge forms. The Biden administration’s new order would bring that work to a much greater scale, potentially touching every citizen-facing agency in the federal government in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5D8fj"&gt;“The President is making sure we’re building accountability and transparency into everything we do and that we’re good stewards of taxpayer dollars,” the fact sheet said. “As the President has said: ‘We have to prove democracy still works, that our government still works and can deliver for our people.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IUUHl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vm1NeO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>$300,000 Bored Ape NFT sold for $3,000 because of misplaced decimal point</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YjtwNWDGbpouc3kD6ajde-4jV9s=/155x88:995x648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70264945/bored_ape_nft_accidental_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or just right click &amp;gt; save image to save yourself $$$.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Image via &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://opensea.io/assets/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/3547" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OpenSea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hkcIZT"&gt;How much have you ever lost on a typo? Probably not hundreds of thousands of dollars. But that’s just what happened to one unlucky individual this weekend, who accidentally sold a Bored Ape NFT for $3,000 instead of $300,000 — all because of a misplaced decimal point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSES21"&gt;As first &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/bored-ape-yacht-club-someone-accidentally-sold-a-300k-nft-for-3k/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the NFT’s owner Max (or maxnaut) listed the NFT for sale on Saturday. Max, who describes himself as a “solo-traveller, bored ape, marketing agency owner &amp;amp; NFT investor,” had meant to price the NFT at 75 ether (around $300,000) but accidentally typed &lt;em&gt;0.75 ether&lt;/em&gt; instead (roughly $3,000). Before they could correct the mistake, the NFT had been snapped up, apparently by a bot programmed to find and buy undervalued listings. You can see the drama play out &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/3547"&gt;on the NFT’s OpenSea page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T7xZTQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How’d it happen? A lapse of concentration I guess.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="McZK7p"&gt;“How’d it happen? A lapse of concentration I guess,” Max told &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;. “I list a lot of items every day and just wasn’t paying attention properly. I instantly saw the error as my finger clicked the mouse but a bot sent a transaction with over 8 eth [$34,000] of gas fees so it was instantly sniped before I could click cancel, and just like that, $250k was gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISJRnq"&gt;These sorts of so-called “fat-finger errors” are &lt;a href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/barclays-flash-crash-and-the-top-five-fat-finger-trades-20210415"&gt;well-known in the world of finance&lt;/a&gt;. In 2015, for example, a junior Deutsche Bank employee &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0546944a-7682-11e5-a95a-27d368e1ddf7"&gt;accidentally sent $6 billion&lt;/a&gt; to a hedge fund client after messing up their calculations. But traditional markets generally have some means of recourse when the worst happens — whether legal in nature or stemming from social pressure. In the case of Deutsche Bank, it seems the hedge fund simply sent the money back the next day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SOi2hL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to sneak into a Bored Ape Yacht Club party","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22824387/bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-party-new-york"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dhqwQy"&gt;For Max, there’s no way to get his cash back. It doesn’t help that the NFT he sold belongs to a particularly valuable collection. There are 10,000 Bored Apes in existence, each mixing and matching certain attributes (laser eyes, sunglasses, etc.) to create a portrait with the aesthetic qualities of a mid-2000s gamer avatar. NFTs aren’t about the quality of the artwork, though: they’re about speculation and perceived value. And Bored Ape NFTs are an exclusive club, with owners including celebrities like Jimmy Fallon and Steph Curry. They originally sold for 0.08 ether, around $320, but now cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ka9xu"&gt;Despite the loss, Max seems to be taking things in stride. “Sometimes you fuck up, make a bad buy, out of gas fail, send Eth to the wrong wallet or fat finger a listing,” he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/maxnaut/status/1469995426652868610"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s going to happen. But, letting it occupy your mind for even one second after you can no longer affect the outcome is purely hurting yourself twice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P58iuB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

    <title>Adobe launches Creative Cloud Express, a new app that simplifies its powerful editing tools</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ylESU7ZovEOTsgW5_Gx0VOQClnY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70264921/CC_Express_Social.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GQoVZv"&gt;Adobe knows there’s a bigger audience of would-be creators out there than full-on pros, so it’s launching a new app that attempts to open up some of its more powerful tools to amateurs. The app, called &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fadobe.com%2Fexpress&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2F22828544%2Fadobe-creative-cloud-express-app-announced-launch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Cloud Express&lt;/a&gt;, offers basic versions of image and video editing tools, letting users work with layers, AI effects, and a huge font library, all with a simplified interface that’s supposed to make the features easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZhGgW"&gt;“A lot of people need something simple and more accessible, and these customers are increasingly content-first and more focused on outcomes than process,” Scott Belsky, Adobe’s chief product officer, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Creative Cloud Express is designed so new users don’t have to “endure the learning curve” of Adobe’s more capable tools like Photoshop and can quickly make something that looks good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kOGvel"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Start to deliver innovation that anyone can access, as opposed to just the creative pros”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pPROOY"&gt;The app seems to be designed for social media managers, small business owners, and anyone else who has something to promote but isn’t a pro at graphic design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTl1HY"&gt;When starting it up, you’ll be able to choose from pre-designed templates made for different purposes: a flier, a Facebook post, an Instagram story, a YouTube thumbnail, a restaurant menu, a book cover, and so on. Once you choose a template, you’ll be able to adjust all the features within it. In a short demo video sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Adobe product manager showed how you could adjust the text, import new assets from Adobe’s stock image library, and add animation. One particularly clever feature automatically removed the background from a stock image, letting the image focus just on its subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FiUEHy"&gt;The app is free to start, but additional features — like access to Adobe Stock images — are available for a $9.99 per month subscription (they’re also included for existing subscribers of many Creative Cloud plans). It launches today and is available on iOS, Android, and the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dLXz6G"&gt;Belsky sees this launch as a step toward creating accessible versions of all of Adobe’s most powerful tools. “I hope I can tell my teams ... whatever you do that’s amazing for After Effects or Premiere Pro,” Belsky says, “find a light and accessible version of it that might be accessible to everyone else and start to deliver innovation that anyone can access, as opposed to just the creative pros.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Analogue Pocket review: Game Boy games have never looked so good</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A modern handheld that celebrates the classics&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Od0O4K"&gt;For the last week or so, I’ve been buried in cartridges from my youth. I’ve spent hours slicing through cute blue slimes in &lt;em&gt;Dragon Warrior III&lt;/em&gt; and reacquainting myself with a decades-old team of monsters in &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Yellow&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;While all my friends have been raving about &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve instead been reminding myself just how inexplicably good &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater&lt;/em&gt; was on the Game Boy Advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQ502G"&gt;Often going back to play classic games like this can be a reality check. There have been plenty of times when I’ve popped in an old cartridge only to realize that these games I grew up with just don’t look the way I remember them. But that hasn’t been the case this time — in fact, they’ve looked better than ever. This is the promise of the Analogue Pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ip3YBa"&gt;Analogue has made a name for itself by releasing a stream of high-end hardware designed to play old games. It started with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/31/14451542/analogue-nt-mini-nes-review"&gt;the NES&lt;/a&gt; and has since expanded to include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/7/16981722/analogue-super-nt-snes-nintendo-review"&gt;SNES&lt;/a&gt;, Sega Genesis, and soon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21517472/analogue-duo-retro-console-nec-turbografx-price-release-date"&gt;the TurboGrafx-16&lt;/a&gt;. The concept is simple: while many of these older games have aged well, the hardware hasn’t, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18513025/analogue-console-clones-gaming-history-preservation-code-hardware"&gt;Analogue is creating a way to preserve them by making them playable on modern televisions&lt;/a&gt;. And, unlike most retro machines, Analogue consoles utilize &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323002/mister-fpga-project-retro-computer-console-early-pc"&gt;field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology&lt;/a&gt;, which basically means they function just like the original hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DS0Y4w"&gt;The $220 Pocket takes this same philosophy and applies it to handheld games; it might be the company’s most ambitious product to date. It’s also far and away the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wX7kvD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10917195"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CMb2KZf_kcyBbx5a90FT7ueGJ3o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055814/vpavic_211129_4897_0070.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DJULHwsU0QpCkwIxc1iA3trpCBI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055810/vpavic_211129_4897_0050.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pwB6C70tcfeSUHp3FtTeG7Quk6o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055804/vpavic_211129_4897_0013.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jh2naz"&gt;At a glance, the Pocket looks like production on the Game Boy never stopped and Nintendo kept revising it over the past three decades. It has basically the same form factor as the original Game Boy. The Pocket is a plastic brick you hold up vertically, available in either black or white, with a square screen up top, a D-pad and face buttons below, and a cartridge slot in the back. There are a few changes, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahYV0J"&gt;There are four main face buttons instead of two, along with a pair of shoulder buttons on the back of the device, on either side of the cartridge slot. There’s also a home button that sits between the tiny start and select buttons, a USB-C port alongside a headphone jack and the old-style link cable port on the bottom of the device, and a microSD slot on the side for firmware updates and such. It’s powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery instead of AAs, and you’ll get between six to 10 hours of gameplay depending on the brightness settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="H0HVCq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10916744"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qNFoun"&gt;The biggest change, though, is the incredible screen. The Pocket features a 3.5-inch LCD display made of Gorilla Glass, with 1600 × 1440 resolution. That’s &lt;em&gt;10 times&lt;/em&gt; the resolution of the original gray brick Game Boy. In practice, it looks absolutely amazing. Out of the box, the Pocket supports cartridges from the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance (for other supported platforms, see the sidebar on accessories) and it’s hard to overstate just how good these games look rendered at such a high resolution, with such a bright and sharp display. The monochrome look of the original Game Boy is crisp and clear, but it especially shines when you’re playing color games where you can really see the sprites pop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Thh5lM"&gt;It sounds cliche, but the Pocket breathes new life into old games by showing them at their very best. You also have plenty of ways to customize the visuals. In the main menu there are various options, including platform-specific customizations on a system level. So if, for instance, you want to render all of your Game Boy Color games with the original grid of pixels visible, you can do that. Or you can stick to the default option where everything looks nice and clean. Likewise, for original Game Boy games, you can stick with the classic green hue or view things in a more modern-looking grayscale. You can also adjust the sharpness and desaturation or tweak the size and position of the image displayed. I stuck mostly with the default options and kept the brightness jacked to 85 percent, and I had no issues at all. It looked amazing. (I should note that GBA games are rendered slightly smaller, since the Pocket has a square screen and the Advance had a more widescreen display.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="750ylx"&gt;The Pocket doesn’t fundamentally change these games. You’re still playing the same cartridges; they just look a lot better and are more convenient to play. The closest thing to a quality-of-life tweak is one of my favorite features: the sleep option, where you can put the Pocket in a battery-saving mode without losing progress. It’s great for playing old-school RPGs that have a little too much time in between save locations. The handheld also supports pretty much everything the original hardware did, which Analogue says is nearly 2,800 cartridges. I tested more than a dozen games across all three Game Boy platforms, including some oddballs like the gyro-equipped &lt;em&gt;WarioWare Twisted&lt;/em&gt;, Japan-only titles like &lt;em&gt;Densetsu no Stafy&lt;/em&gt;, and even the original Game Boy Camera. Everything worked without any issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3uNRc"&gt;For the most part, the Pocket was also extremely comfortable to use. The matte plastic has a nice feel to it, and there are vertical lines engraved across the back to make it grippier. It gets a little warm during prolonged sessions but not to the point that I found it uncomfortable. I also really love the D-pad on this thing, which is clicky and responsive. The only real quibble I have is with the placement of the shoulder buttons. For games that use them a lot — like &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk&lt;/em&gt; on the GBA — I found my fingers cramping up after long sessions. It’s a bit like playing on the old GBA SP. It’s not a deal-breaker, but I definitely felt the strain. Remappable buttons are coming in a future firmware update, but I wasn’t able to test them for this review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PaYUFb"&gt;(Outside of playing old-school cartridges, the Pocket also has a built-in music tool called Nanoloop and support for DIY game creation tool &lt;a href="https://www.gbstudio.dev/"&gt;GB Studio&lt;/a&gt;. However, given that I have no musical nor game design abilities, I have to admit that these features have been mostly lost on me so far.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/92YKJvQF8htiaqPL4jL4KlvZglg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055808/vpavic_211129_4897_0030.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZHmei"&gt;Really, for all of its features, the Analogue Pocket is a device that’s designed to do one thing: honor the classics. Every aspect of it, whether it’s the brilliant display or the fine-grain customization options or the very welcome sleep button, all works in service of making the cartridges you already own look and play their best. And that’s exactly what the Pocket does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JFCeY"&gt;That might make it something of a niche product, especially considering its premium price tag. For around the same price you could grab &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;a Nintendo Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt;, and many of these games are available elsewhere, whether on modern consoles or smartphones. It’s never been easier or cheaper to play the classics. But for many players, myself included, there’s still something special about playing the original versions of these games, especially given the fleeting nature of digital media. I don’t want to keep buying new versions of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy V&lt;/em&gt;, unsure of what strange tweaks Square Enix may have made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="1dq0Pw"&gt;I already own the perfect port. It came out in 2006 for the Game Boy Advance — and 15 years later, I now have the perfect place to play it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WW4XNS"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Analogue Pocket begins &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22796303/analogue-pocket-preorder-ship-date"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;shipping on December 13th for those who preordered&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;, while &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827971/analogue-pocket-order-price-increase-handheld"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;sales open up again on December 14th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
