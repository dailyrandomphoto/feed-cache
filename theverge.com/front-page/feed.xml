    <title>Razer’s Blade 15 Base is $500 off today, but this Asus Zephyrus G14 deal is the one I’d pick</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fr4-UXpYImSvDK6LZYSexG3w4Yg=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68851657/awhite_200319_3954_4.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WdEbTi"&gt;Pop quiz: which is the better deal, $500 off a Razer Blade laptop, or $150 off an Asus Zephyrus G14? It might hinge on whether you need a webcam, because in practically every other way the Asus is the laptop I’d buy today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5Xlkc"&gt;That’s not to say there’s anything particularly wrong with the Razer Blade 15 Base at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086MGY9TZ/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;today’s unheard of price of $1,099 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (regularly $1,599): aside from the paltry 256GB of solid state storage, you’re looking at a speedy 6-core Core i7-10750H processor, GeForce GTX 1660 Ti graphics that should competently tackle yesteryear’s biggest titles, a 144Hz 1080p screen, plus plenty of ports packed into an attractive black CNC aluminum chassis with single-zone RGB lighting. The deal at midnight PT Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GMcPAxqZtHaUD38xNaWIsZDkzOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22318899/blade_zephyrus.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uObDu2"&gt;But for just $100 more, you can currently get the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 at Best Buy for $1,199, which just so happens to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;our pick for the best ultraportable gaming laptop you can buy&lt;/a&gt;. While its Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q graphics can actually be slightly slower than the 1660 Ti (depending on the game) and there’s no Thunderbolt ports, you’re likely looking at nearly double the battery life from its 8-core AMD Ryzen 9 4900HS chip — plus a 1TB SSD that should be able to actually hold a decent selection of games. It weighs far less at just  over 3.5 pounds; compare to 4.7 pounds for the Razer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGa3pG"&gt;That’s just based on the spec sheet: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;you can read our whole review for more&lt;/a&gt;, or our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21340554/razer-blade-stealth-13-review-keyboard-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer Blade Stealth 13 review&lt;/a&gt; where the Asus still managed to blow a newer and lighter Razer laptop out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oVVRlR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505867"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2DZD8Z"&gt;All that said, I could still easily see you picking the Razer for the slightly more powerful graphics, the $100 cheaper price, the sleek profile, the blacked-out design, or that all-important webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8phOs"&gt;And remember that neither of these machines have the latest and greatest graphics: Nvidia’s RTX 30-series laptop GPUs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226544/nvidia-rtx-3080-laptops-gpus-ces-2021"&gt;are only barely starting to roll out&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t need a new machine soon, it might be worth waiting a while longer to see what an RTX 3060 laptop might do for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FAA is no longer concerned with SpaceX’s Starship SN9 and SN8</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w2WswsojJsV6_nItjYskEqVUyJE=/45x0:435x260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68851460/spaceship_crash_space_x.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T5RD5K"&gt;The FAA seems satisfied with its investigations into Elon Musk’s last two SpaceX Starship tests, each of which ended in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262937/spacex-sn9-starship-test-flight-successful-explode-landing"&gt;an explosive crash&lt;/a&gt;, and the conclusion of those investigations should clear the way for a new SN10 flight in the very near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSD9CZ"&gt;Late last month, we broke the news &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256657/spacex-launch-violation-explosive-starship-faa-investigation-elon-musk"&gt;that SpaceX had violated its launch license&lt;/a&gt; with its Starship SN8 launch in December, but an FAA spokesperson now says that matter has already been settled, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jackiewattles/status/1362888690586980353"&gt;according to CNN’s Jackie Wattles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QQeLlI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"SpaceX flies Starship prototype rocket to highest altitude yet — but doesn’t stick the landing","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22030125/spacex-starship-prototype-flight-test-12-5-kilometer-launch"},{"title":"Another SpaceX Starship nails clean test flight, but explodes on landing","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262937/spacex-sn9-starship-test-flight-successful-explode-landing"},{"title":"Elon Musk’s SpaceX violated its launch license in explosive Starship test, triggering an FAA probe","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256657/spacex-launch-violation-explosive-starship-faa-investigation-elon-musk"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="K9UMkS"&gt;As for the SN9, which similarly exploded during a landing attempt on February 2nd, the FAA says it “failed within the bounds of the FAA safety analysis” and “its unsuccessful landing and explosion did not endanger the public or property.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GK7H6p"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"The FAA provided oversight of the SN9 mishap investigation conducted by SpaceX. The SN9 vehicle failed within the bounds of the FAA safety analysis. Its unsuccessful landing and explosion did not endanger the public or property."

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cdsFET"&gt;It’s not yet clear when the Starship SN10 might launch, but &lt;a href="https://www.cameroncounty.us/spacex/"&gt;Boca Chica is already closing the local highway and beach&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for “non-flight testing activities” on Monday, which some are interpreting to mean &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle_system_tests#Static_fire"&gt;a static fire test.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Orwg5Q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A note, the paperwork filed for next week's closure specifies    -       activities.  For comparison, the SN9 flight was described as 'space flight activities' in the same part of the equivalent filing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Throttle expectations appropriately.&lt;a href="https://t.co/7Er5HdRaH6"&gt;https://t.co/7Er5HdRaH6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/SZSwkOkLvn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SZSwkOkLvn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Boca Chica Road Closures (@BocaRoad) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BocaRoad/status/1362598116461924352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3Z5Wj"&gt;NASASpaceflight journalist &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BocaChicaGal"&gt;BocaChicaGal&lt;/a&gt; has been following progress at the launch site closely, and seems like a stellar follow if you’d like to keep tabs as well. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1360774866023112704"&gt;Elon Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that he thinks the SN10 has a 60 percent chance of actually landing. Better than a coin flip, I suppose?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>United Airlines flight safely lands after dramatic engine failure caught on camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rz9R4z6sfx_wfuItgh6tmMpIsA4=/53x0:1988x1290/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68849369/UE328.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Hayden Smith / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/speedbird5280/" target="_blank"&gt;speedbird5280 (Instagram)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8MCKWr"&gt;A United Airlines flight experienced a dramatic-looking engine failure just after takeoff from Denver International Airport on Saturday afternoon. UA328, originally headed to Honolulu, quickly circled back to the airport and made a safe landing after the pilots calmly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DillonMThomas/status/1363239538185756673"&gt;made a “mayday” call&lt;/a&gt; to air traffic control. There were no injuries among the 231 passengers and 10 airline staff on board, according to the FAA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pZAty"&gt;Since it’s 2021, the incident was thoroughly captured with both photos and video. Passengers shared video of what looks to be a significant right engine failure, with visible damage, flames, and trailing smoke:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C5zJ0c"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Flight 328 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/united?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@united&lt;/a&gt; engine caught fire. my parents are on this flight    everyone’s okay though! &lt;a href="https://t.co/cBt82nIkqb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cBt82nIkqb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— michaela  (@michaelagiulia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/michaelagiulia/status/1363241125495136267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nYpUeM"&gt;That isn’t what I’d want to see looking out the window seat. Engine failures are rare, but do happen. Modern planes are designed so that they’re able to remain in the air for an extended period and safely land with only a single functioning engine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfI9RS"&gt;Photographer Hayden Smith snapped a series of images of the Boeing 777-200 plane that offer a closer look at the damaged engine from the ground and posted them to Dropbox not long after the plane safely landed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/05IwDokARrXS3vCxRwxp2fcLRzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22317735/plane2.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V2zoLN"&gt;But even before that, a dash cam managed to get the moment that the engine seemingly blew out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pWTTAS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RyanCBS4?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@RyanCBS4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/tekFSpr94P"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tekFSpr94P&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— JACDEC (@JacdecNew) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JacdecNew/status/1363241662022103040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oQ3xGE"&gt;Reports followed of engine debris landing in neighborhoods near the plane’s flight path, which was also caught on video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jz4DBK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pedestrians filmed the falling engine parts impacting the nearby soccer field. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BAREESTHETICSCO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BAREESTHETICSCO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/YYPdrpqP5Z"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YYPdrpqP5Z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— JACDEC (@JacdecNew) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JacdecNew/status/1363241028690599938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ffeseH"&gt;Local authorities are investigating and say that so far there’ve been no injuries related to the shed debris. The plane’s engine cowling is visible in some of the images shared across social media. Nearby residents are being asked to check their property for any pieces of the engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Yx8X46"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;These pictures are wild. According to reports, plane debris fell from the sky and landed in different neighborhoods in Denver &lt;a href="https://t.co/aRKtJP4q7u"&gt;https://t.co/aRKtJP4q7u&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/8EC6DesIZ2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8EC6DesIZ2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Phil_Lewis_/status/1363237308074496002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="87DHrb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A Code Red was sent out to about 1,400 residents around Commons Park, Northmoor and Red Leaf asking them to look for debris in yards.&lt;/p&gt;— Broomfield Police (@BroomfieldPD) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BroomfieldPD/status/1363256495840784384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B9Y6gl"&gt;As is usual in these circumstances, the FAA and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NTSB_Newsroom/status/1363254016558399492"&gt;NTSB&lt;/a&gt; will investigate what went wrong with UA328’s engine. But the incident is another reminder of just how resilient airplanes are designed to be — and how anytime there’s an incident of this magnitude in modern times, it’s going to be captured extensively from nearly every angle within minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="AqUQ6q"&gt;I know it’s often mocked when people cheer their airplane touching down safely after a completely normal flight, but in this case, I think I can relate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rare’s unreleased N64 game Dinosaur Planet has leaked </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U0NPA4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dinosaur Planet&lt;/em&gt; is an unreleased Nintendo 64 game by Rare that ultimately evolved into &lt;em&gt;Star Fox Adventures&lt;/em&gt; for GameCube. But thanks to the preservationists at Forest of Illusion, it’s now possible to play that unfinished, original title. A build of the game from December 1st, 2000 — well into its development cycle — was retrieved from a disc purchased from a private collector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbx1Q4"&gt;Screenshots of the game feature Fox McCloud; as noted by &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-02-20-rares-unreleased-dinosaur-planet-for-n64-out-in-the-wild-gameplay-emerges"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto was reportedly influential in pushing the developers to shift the game into a Star Fox title. &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry’&lt;/em&gt;s John Linneman uploaded 20 minutes of gameplay, and here you can also see Fox replacing one of the original game’s intended protagonists, Sabre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhaWrZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today we have released Dinosaur Planet by Rare for Nintendo 64. The development was halted and moved to the GameCube, where it was then released as Star Fox Adventures.

&lt;p id="WmIhUU"&gt;Forest of Illusion notes that “the game will currently not run 100 percent perfectly on any emulator. Expect many graphical issues with shadows and lighting, and some slowdown. It should however, work perfectly fine with flashcarts.” Flashcarts allow for games to run on original N64 console hardware &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="6LYkFf"&gt;The influence of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&lt;/em&gt; is evident, but it’s very interesting to get a look at the moody atmosphere that Rare was working on before &lt;em&gt;Dinosaur Planet&lt;/em&gt; became &lt;em&gt;Star Fox Adventures&lt;/em&gt; on the GameCube. Forest of Illusion also &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/dino_20210220"&gt;uploaded the game to the Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fy4rtf"&gt;February is proving to be a month of gems for Rare’s fans; earlier in February, the canceled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267913/goldeneye-007-xbox-360-live-arcade-nintendo-64-remake-remaster-rare"&gt;Xbox 360 remake of &lt;em&gt;GoldenEye 007&lt;/em&gt; was leaked&lt;/a&gt; onto the web. Much like Dinosaur Planet, it’s very playable despite being unfinished. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some viewers of Metallica’s BlizzCon performance heard the least metal music imaginable </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pmGgPnwIrkhXKRe832G_2QtQYUI=/215x0:2099x1256/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68848532/Screen_Shot_2021_02_20_at_12.02.48_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That disclaimer at the bottom would prove relevant.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gi56ia"&gt;Despite its later-than-usual timing and going completely virtual for the first time, yesterday’s BlizzCon keynote brought with it some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22285677/blizzcon-2021-news-trailers-diablo-wow-burning-crusade"&gt;big news and exciting trailers&lt;/a&gt;. It also featured a musical performance from Metallica. The band isn’t new to BlizzCon, having first appeared at the conference in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYqIij"&gt;Viewers on many platforms (including Blizzard’s own Twitch and YouTube channels) heard a performance of Metallica’s 1984 tune “For Whom The Bell Tolls.” Several Twitch streamers broadcasting BlizzCon muted the feed during Metallica’s appearance to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525481/twitch-streamers-dmca-takedown-notices-riaa-copyright"&gt;any potential DMCA troubles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDCJfy"&gt;But on the &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/920716549"&gt;Twitch Gaming feed&lt;/a&gt; that was &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; carrying the stream, well, things took an amazing turn. Within seconds of the song beginning, the audio was replaced by what &lt;a href="https://music.avclub.com/twitch-censors-live-metallica-concert-with-dorkiest-mus-1846314134"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AV Club&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; perfectly summed up as “the dorkiest, most &lt;em&gt;Zelda &lt;/em&gt;forest-ass music imaginable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8n16R2"&gt;The transition really makes the whole story here, so please watch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6zmU5Q"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gKhc21Y0Xdw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iO6BB1"&gt;It would seem the music performance rights that Blizzard obtained for its own channels didn’t extend to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21271803/twitch-gaming-channel-exclusives-news"&gt;Twitch’s in-house gaming channel&lt;/a&gt;, so we were instead rewarded with this glorious moment. Could they have just cut the audio altogether? Sure, but that wouldn’t have been as fun. This version of the opening keynote stream currently has over 1.2 million views. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8vSihx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;the current state of Twitch: the official Twitch Gaming channel cut off the live Metallica concert to play 8bit folk music to avoid DMCA &lt;a href="https://t.co/sCn56So8Ee"&gt;pic.twitter.com/sCn56So8Ee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rod Breslau (@Slasher) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1362901765029527553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RnpnqH"&gt;If you want to see Metallica’s actual performance, it’s right at the 1:24:50 mark on either &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1AvJ0SRjw8"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/920697882"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. But me? I’m always going to remember it the Twitch Gaming way. The right way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Dizj8S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitch apologizes to streamers for its mishandling of music copyright ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560913/twitch-streamers-dmca-copyright-tools-apology"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5bIBjv"&gt;And no, it’s not lost on anyone that this happened to a Metallica performance. There’s a lot to chew on there with Napster and the contentious DMCA quagmires that regularly pop up today. But let’s leave that for another day. For now, just imagine Lars Ulrich and company actually jamming out to this RPG adventure music. It all syncs up nicely at times.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Postmates workers are getting scammed out of their earnings by phishing schemes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shake Shack Plans To Return $10 Million Loan To U.S. After Uproar" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENqQiHP-WMdzfhs-MP7qZOtX1QE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68848016/1210482601.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SoDRLL"&gt;Over at &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/working-for-an-algorithm/2021/02/18/postmates-drivers-have-become-easy-prey-for-scammers-and-drivers-say-the-companys-not-helping"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an alarming story about a rash of phishing scams that have been targeting gig workers for Postmates. Drivers are receiving phone calls from people claiming to be Postmates employees, who urge the workers to give over their login details — usually under the guise that it’s necessary to keep a driver account in good standing or avoid claims of fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvD5PH"&gt;Once the scammers obtain that info, they switch the debit card information on the account — Postmates makes weekly deposits of a worker’s earnings, but instant transfers can also be requested — and then drain the balance of everything that’s in there. &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; has spoken to many Postmates gig workers who’ve been preyed upon with this scam, and others are using Reddit and social media to warn their fellow drivers about the phishing and social engineering attempts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkIjAx"&gt;The unknown call usually comes in right after an order. (Placing an order allows the perpetrators to easily reach their Postmates driver by phone.) Some scammers have gone so far as to involve restaurants in their scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZvcmn"&gt;Drivers say that Postmates isn’t doing enough to make them aware of the phishing threat, which has only grown more common during the COVID-19 pandemic. Scammers are taking advantage of how busy and hurried these gig workers often are, so drivers are asking for more safeguards in the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oRCks"&gt;One suggestion is an automatic hold on a driver account whenever the deposit information changes, just to give some more time to prevent a worker’s money from being siphoned out. Another measure that could help would be a caller ID that clearly identifies when a call is coming from a Postmates customer account. Postmates has &lt;a href="https://support.postmates.com/fleet/articles/360022299432-article-How-can-I-keep-my-account-safe-"&gt;this support page&lt;/a&gt; on protecting accounts, but several drivers told &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; they’d never seen it before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbPxXJ"&gt;Postmates says it has implemented two-factor authentication and can block cashouts if fraud is suspected. But drivers that’ve been hit by the scam say the company is hard to reach, so they have little hope for recouping their lost earnings. The whole story at &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; is worth a read — and yet more reason to tip well whenever you lean on the gig economy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stretched vaccine timelines re-enter the spotlight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vaccination process against COVID-19 begins in Colombia" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FV_Ru2IicYlPOiV2Bj44VEwstDg=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68847802/1231243754.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xkFQQR"&gt;As the pandemic drags on, experts are exploring ways to stretch still-limited vaccine supplies to get as many people protected as possible. One idea that’s resurfaced this week involves allowing more time in between the first and second doses of the two-dose vaccines. This time, though, there’s some additional data that suggests it might work.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VX0bZf"&gt;Here’s the idea: two leading vaccines, made by Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna require two doses. But their early data &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/health/covid-vaccine-pfizer.html"&gt;showed pretty significant protection after the first dose&lt;/a&gt;. That got people thinking — is it worth giving more people partial protection with just one dose? Or should they stick to the schedule and fully vaccinate fewer people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="q5WGNa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7YTwEw"&gt;Back in December, some experts &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/opinion/coronavirus-vaccine-doses.html"&gt;encouraged researchers to set up trials&lt;/a&gt; to find out if a single dose of a two-dose vaccine would be effective. Around the same time, health authorities in the UK &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-delays-second-covid-19-vaccine-dose-as-europe-ponders-how-to-speed-up-immunization-11609334172?mod=article_inline"&gt;decided to plow ahead &lt;/a&gt;without those studies, and prioritized getting first shots in arms, allowing people to delay their doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Y66g6"&gt;This week, we got more data that shows that a single dose of Pfizer / BioNTech actually does a pretty good job of preventing illness. A study in Israel found that a first shot was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/pfizer-vaccine-may-offer-strong-protection-first-dose-israeli-study-fi-rcna300"&gt;85 percent effective&lt;/a&gt; at reducing symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in healthcare workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpXv0h"&gt;There are some caveats. Here’s a major one: most of the people in the study ended up getting their second dose relatively quickly. That means researchers can only say that the first dose is effective between 15 and 28 days after a person gets that first shot. How long protection lasts beyond that is still unknown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PGXTC"&gt;That’s why some experts are still urging caution when it comes to changing the schedule between those vaccines. “Until such time that there are good clinical trials that show that a single dose provides an equivalent level of protection, I don’t know that we should abandon our approach or create new policies,” &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/pfizer-vaccine-may-offer-strong-protection-first-dose-israeli-study-fi-rcna300"&gt;Jonathan Tempte told &lt;em&gt;NBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQJmdS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/why-delaying-the-second-covid-vaccine-shot-is-messy-quicktake"&gt;It’s messy&lt;/a&gt;, and researchers don’t agree. Some, including Anthony Fauci maintain that sticking to two on-schedule doses can &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/both-covid-vaccine-doses-critical-stay-ahead-variants-fauci-says-n1257041"&gt;help keep the US ahead of dangerous variants&lt;/a&gt; of the virus. Others lean towards taking a strategy more like the UK’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LfAaFZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s an old saying that we wouldn’t use parachutes or aspirin if we waited for randomized trials, either.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VkmD68"&gt;“I think this [strategy] is something on which reasonable people could disagree, but saying you should only do something supported by randomized evidence when there’s an emergency would have precluded us from using masks, social distancing, from doing all the things we know are good public health practices,” Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard told &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/02/experts-tout-delaying-2nd-covid-vaccine-dose-us-deaths-mount"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CIDRAP News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. He added: “There’s an old saying that we wouldn’t use parachutes or aspirin if we waited for randomized trials, either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEoUfc"&gt;Here in the US, states are trying to speed up doses — and looking to the federal government for guidance. The CDC has already said that in extreme circumstances, providers &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html"&gt;can stretch the window&lt;/a&gt; between their patients’ shots from three to four weeks up to six. This week, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-16/cdc-advisers-weigh-guidance-for-delaying-second-covid-shots?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that a committee that advises the CDC was considering whether or not to recommend changing the schedule in a smaller working group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rz7XOw"&gt;That discussion might not make it to the full committee any time soon. The working group might decide that they need to see more data, or it might not make it to the next COVID-19-related meeting in favor of discussing more pressing issues — including their recommendations for the single-shot Johnson and Johnson vaccine. (Another meeting of that committee &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/agenda-archive/agenda-2021-02.pdf"&gt;is planned for this coming week&lt;/a&gt;, but its focus is on a host of other deadly diseases, including ebola, dengue, and rabies.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKi80h"&gt;Even if the committee &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; take it up immediately, the question of when to administer doses is fascinating, and one we’ll be watching as the vaccine rollout accelerates, and more data just keeps pouring in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="um8S35"&gt;Here’s what else is happening this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TKdp0v"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspectives: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But, buoyed by the possibility of being able to see their friends safely and, in the case of my son, upgrading his AirPods, they rolled up their sleeves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id="G13i0h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yhi9ZX"&gt;It sounds crazy, right? Am I crazy? I definitely have that psychological battle where I start to doubt everything. Could it all be in my head? I’ll tell myself I need to try harder. I’ll force myself out of bed, but then I get in the shower and the hot water turns my hands purple. My heart rate spikes. I get so dizzy I have to sit down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id="KL46Ps"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="nBh9TN"&gt;As my father’s health declined, I thought about how MAD the world is now; behind all the well-meaning gestures to honor frontline workers like him, there is the willingness to endanger their lives to keep commerce flowing. A willingness to destroy and be destroyed for a sense of normalcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Here are the best deals of the week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZXNyuijx1zzHLTkuZtHbrh9Nrs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68847542/akrales_201012_4137_0020.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i7CkJf"&gt;This is the first time in recent memory where several deals we’ve written about through the week are still available. It’s always great when readers have an extended window of time to snag a deal. So, below you’ll find a few of our favorite picks from the week, along with one new exclusive deal for &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers. I won’t keep you in suspense, it’s on the Pixel 5. We worked with a partner to secure some refurbished units that are in great condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="AHTjVN"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 5 in “Sorta Sage” green" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwtTHObhdNhcOLQIYTN5ZKz75zE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21955670/akrales_201012_4137_0117.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lVGfEG"&gt;Snag a refurbished Google Pixel 5 for under $600&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="m04iWf"&gt;The lowest price for a like-new refurbished Pixel 5 on Amazon is $610, but you can save more with this reader-exclusive deal from Daily Steals. It’s offering &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers a few options, actually. You can get either the unlocked or Verizon-locked phones in black or sage green (shown above). These units ship with a 90-day warranty and are in “Grade A” refurbished condition and may have minor scratches. They’ll ship with an aftermarket charger and cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l62FQI"&gt;One thing to note, if you’re wondering which to get: Verizon’s policy says it locks phones for 60 days after they’re purchased as new, then they automatically unlock. So, there’s a very high likelihood that the lock is no longer in effect on these refurbs, which would let you use the phone with any carrier. Daily Steals couldn’t confirm what their status is. But it’ll either arrived unlocked, or at worst, you’ll need to wait 60 days post-purchase. If you’re not happy with that solution, you can return the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="DNmqDQ"&gt;

&lt;li id="htuyiI"&gt;

    <title>The Oatmeal’s creator says his new game is a way to ‘play the comic’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Comic-Con International 2014 - Day 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BrlV92tZLzkZlnYs9emVkFrDbxQ=/0x73:2000x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68847517/452705690.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Daniel Knighton / WireImage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="00tbrs"&gt;The creator of &lt;em&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/em&gt;, Matthew Inman, released a new cat-themed mobile word game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278773/kitty-letter-mobile-game-ios-android-the-oatmeal-exploding-kittens"&gt;called &lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that feels like playing one of his silly comic strips. That feeling was intentional, Inman told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwvZN4"&gt;“My comics have always been rhetorical,” he said. “You don’t interact with the comic, you have no say in it, you’re just experiencing it. So, with [&lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter&lt;/em&gt;], I got a chance to introduce some elements where people get to play the comic, and I thought that was a lot of fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HtO5ki"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter&lt;/em&gt; has a structure that Inman described as “&lt;em&gt;Scrabble&lt;/em&gt; combined with &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt;.” Your goal is to beat your opponent by spelling words from a combination of letters at the bottom of your phone’s screen. When you spell a word, you’ll send a small army of cats up an invisible “lane” toward your opponent. Meanwhile, your opponent is sending armies of cats to try and defeat you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UFbbBu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dbI4NA6K63I?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H6K8fD"&gt;The game was actually going to be multiplayer-only at first, Inman told me. This might be surprising for those who’ve played the game, since it has a robust story mode spanning 13 chapters. But that story mode was born from creating the game’s tutorial, said Inman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQDdsc"&gt;“I started drawing this tutorial on how to play, and then the tutorial became that single-player mode, where you have this neighbor that moves in and tells the whole story about him,” Inman said. But then, he realized, “I got in too deep. I had written all this stuff, I was like, ‘I have to end this,’ and I ended up writing like 12 chapters. But it became my favorite part of the whole thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99w4WH"&gt;Inman also discussed the game’s free-to-play model, which is very generous. Unlike many free-to-play games, &lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter’s&lt;/em&gt; single-player story mode and multiplayer are completely free, with no restrictions. The decision to offer all of that came from what Inman disliked about other free games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43BnPa"&gt;“I play free-to-play games, but I play them because I like the games,” Inman said. “The actual mechanics involved, like grinding and unlocking chests and getting gems and coins, I hate them. I fucking hate them. If [developers] were like, ‘pay us $20 and we’ll give you everything,’ I would do that. I much prefer that model.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxNC8R"&gt;The game does offer paid cosmetics for multiplayer, but they don’t provide any gameplay benefit and they’re buried in a menu. And Inman says that revenue from them has been “pretty much non-existent.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EfuEXM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Kitty Letter is a new mobile word game from the creator of The Oatmeal, and it’s good","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278773/kitty-letter-mobile-game-ios-android-the-oatmeal-exploding-kittens"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="n0IOEg"&gt;Inman acknowledged that he can offer the game largely for free because of his other successful ventures, which include&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/28/7927121/exploding-kittens-most-backed-kickstarter-project-ever"&gt;hugely successful card game Exploding Kittens&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m not just some altruistic guy that doesn’t want to make a living from his work,” he said. “To be completely candid, we make a great living from our card games, and we make a great living from some of the other things that I do. With [&lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter&lt;/em&gt;], it felt like we could just get away with making it as enjoyable as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTJ8Vt"&gt;“This app more generates that currency of — and this is so fucking corny — currency of love and joy, like you have a joyful experience with the game,” he said. “So, in turn, you love Exploding Kittens more, and maybe one day, if you want to buy a card game from us, you can.” It’s a business model similar to that of &lt;em&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/em&gt;. Inman offers the comics for free online, but sells books and has offered merch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="utkPUl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was cats from day one”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IBCcn6"&gt;Inman has a lot of ideas for what’s next for the game. He’d like to improve the arcade mode, add more single-player levels, and squash bugs. He’d also like to port the game to Steam and the Nintendo Switch, but those might be a little further away. “I would probably call it six months,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tz63Ig"&gt;And I had to ask: were cats always the focus of the game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUI9AQ"&gt;“It was cats from day one,” Inman said. “It was called &lt;em&gt;Cats Royale&lt;/em&gt;, originally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPYzum"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztD67Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Furosystems Aventa e-bike review: ice breaker</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Ease your way into the joys of commuting by electric bike&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4ZqxHI"&gt;Aventa is a new electric bike with a secret: its battery is removable despite the clean design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="ts5ZN1"&gt;London-based &lt;a href="https://www.furosystems.com/aventa/"&gt;Furosystems just launched the Aventa series of pedal-assist e-bikes&lt;/a&gt; into the European market. A more powerful US model is planned for later this year, or early in 2022 if the double whammy of Covid and Brexit creates undue complications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBkg14"&gt;Aventa is sold in three variations, with the first deliveries starting in mid-March. Each model is priced to include all the accessories needed for typical urban commuting: mudguards, bell, luggage rack, kickstand, and front and rear lights. The standard Aventa ships with a 10.4Ah 375Wh battery, hydraulic disc brakes, and full-sized LCD display for €1,799. If you want more range, then you can opt for the Aventa Max, which costs €1,999 and has a bigger 14Ah 504Wh battery. The Aventa Pure is the entry-level model. It lowers the specs with mechanical disc brakes, a tiny 7.8Ah 281Wh battery, and a miniature LCD display. That also lowers the price to €1,599, which compares favorably to commuter e-bikes from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21454206/cowboy-3-electric-bike-review-price-features"&gt;Cowboy&lt;/a&gt; (starting at €2,290) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof&lt;/a&gt; (starting at €1,998), and city bikes like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21199370/muto-review-electric-bike-price-features"&gt;Muto&lt;/a&gt; (starting at €1,799).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pCXUZ"&gt;It’s the entry-level Aventa Pure model I’ve been testing for the past month in frozen Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TVlWktzN--y2yZj5xZO3WIdFwRw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313151/aventa_pure_on_ice.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;First canal freeze in years, so why not?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="h5jJ0r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10349823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BN399E"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is always on the hunt for affordable and attractive electric commuter bikes. But they need to be from reputable companies. After all, if you’re going to spend a couple of grand on an e-bike meant for daily use then it had better be reliable and serviceable for years to come, not sold by some fly-by-night operator on Amazon or Indiegogo that’ll go bust just as soon as you need to make a warranty claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9ZqE7"&gt;Furosystems appears to be a company with staying power. It recently raised £750,000 (about $1 million) from investors ahead of the Aventa launch. That’s pennies compared to the recent funding rounds by Rad Power Bikes ($150 million), VanMoof ($40 million), Cowboy ($26 million), and Super73 ($20 million), but CEO Eliott Wertheimer tells me that the company was already profitable before the November funding round. In addition to the new Aventa e-bikes, Furosystems already sells Fuze scooters and the Furo X folding e-bike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvviFj"&gt;Last year Furosystems did 60 percent of its sales in the UK, according to Wertheimer, with the remaining 40 percent split across France and Italy. This year the company is planning to grow sales from about 3,000 units to 10,000 by expanding into Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. Aventa e-bikes are being assembled in Portugal with components sourced from around the world. Wertheimer tells me that his ultimate goal is to design and manufacture every part themselves, but to do that now would be too costly. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The battery with key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x2Yquut9XkTXTbv5r0aX3InExdA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313097/verge_DSC_3377_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The battery, inserted backward, but you get the idea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qFvMqb"&gt;The Aventa Pure e-bike I’ve been testing is built for European roads. That means a motor with 250W of continuous power (and 500W peak) and a top speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph). That speed is fine in congested city centers, but too slow for anyone commuting along lonely roads or protected rural bike paths for any great distance. Mind you, that’s criticism of European transportation policy, not the Aventa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jlrS_QkJEO1sFDYL9lQackK_KRE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313074/verge_40kmph_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 25 km/h speed limit can be overridden for markets that allow it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYP9TQ"&gt;Furosystems does provide instructions to override the speed limit “to comply with local regulations,” requiring just a few taps on the buttons surrounding the LCD display. With that tweak the Aventa will reach a top speed of between 32 km/h and 36 km/h depending upon the rider’s size, I’m reliably told. But I was a good boy for this review. While I confirmed the speed hack was legit (and thrilling), I stayed within the European limits for my testing now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558235/vanmoof-slows-s3-x3-europe-japan-speed-limit"&gt;police are increasingly cracking down&lt;/a&gt; on illegally fast e-bikes in cities throughout Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ityn1W"&gt;Furosystems says that the Aventa Pure’s 281Wh battery is capable of more than 40 km (25 miles) of range. In my testing, on long stretches of uninterrupted rural roads, I’ve already gone well beyond that estimate since I’m often pedaling at speeds greater than 25 km/h. At those speeds the motor is just idling as it’s not needed to supply power to the pedals. As a result, my battery says it’s still more than 50 percent full after 47 km (29.7 miles) of riding, despite riding at the max of five pedal-assisted levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYpFyp"&gt;Although the Aventa lacks any kind of throttle or boost button, the sturdy little Bafang motor fitted to the rear wheel hub was able to flatten the steepest hills I could find (which aren’t anywhere close to San Francisco steep) thanks to its ability to generate 500W of peak power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uO0s4G"&gt;When riding in stop-and-go traffic, power is provided smoothly and evenly to each downstroke of the pedals despite the lack of any torque sensor like you’ll find on more expensive e-bikes. On flat surfaces, I barely used the nine speeds allowed by the Shimano Altus derailleur. But those gears definitely came in handy when trying to start under heavy loads on inclines or when getting some exercise at top speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9VVwq"&gt;The Aventa puts the rider into a somewhat sporty forward lean on a saddle you’ll want to replace if regularly riding long bumpy distances. The ride is almost silent, disrupted only by a thin rattle when riding over some of the bumpiest brick roads I could find. While I wasn’t able to pinpoint the exact source of the rattle, it did go away when I rode without the battery installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnNvKS"&gt;Removing the battery is an easy, but awkward, procedure as it’s locked into place by a key at the base of the downtube. To extract it the bike has to be laid unceremoniously onto the ground. You can also flip the bike upside down, but at 16.5 kg (36 pounds), the Aventa may be relatively lightweight for a fully loaded e-bike, but it’s definitely not light. Nevertheless, being able to remove the battery for indoor charging is a necessity for many city dwellers who don’t have the space, or strength, to lug a hulking e-bike up narrow stairs to an apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The top image with better cable management is what buyers today will receive in mid-March, compared to the review bike which was sold in December and January. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zhJafd"&gt;Now, about the cable management. The Aventa Pure e-bike sent for review has far too many exposed cables and connectors for my liking. Fortunately, that’s being fixed for anyone preordering an Aventa today, as the bikes being manufactured now for delivery starting mid-March will route the cables through the frame. While integrated cabling certainly looks better, the exposed cables and connectors on my review bike make it more modular and therefore easier to service whenever a part needs replacing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76frC6"&gt;My review unit arrived with a smashed headlight, for example, caused by a clumsy courier. Furosystems sent me a new assembly which I was able to install myself by releasing a pair of screws and unclipping the damaged unit. It took all of two minutes. Ease of repair is an important consideration for a young direct-to-consumer company that lacks a sophisticated global repair network. Shipping a busted e-bike to a foreign country for service is no fun for anyone, least of all the owner. Just ask &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;early adopters of the VanMoof S3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHm00L"&gt;Wertheimer tells me that Furosystems is constantly iterating and taking on customer feedback, and is willing to switch back to the external cabling if customer surveys suggest a strong preference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w1bnuc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10349799"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRbrM5"&gt;Other notable specs and observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gfT0hm"&gt;Charges in about 4.5 hours, or as long as 7 hours if you buy the Aventa Max with higher-capacity battery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Xlg9cZ"&gt;The aluminum frame can fit riders between 165 cm (5 feet 4 inches) and 195 cm (6 feet 4 inches) and up to 120 kg (265 pounds).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gmVuhT"&gt;The lighting kit on the Aventa Pure features an integrated front light that can be controlled from the display pad (which also controls the LCD’s backlight). The rear clamp-on lamp has to be operated manually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AlTndH"&gt;The mini LCD display is fine for showing battery level, speed in km/h or mph, and distance traveled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QWfYWf"&gt;There isn’t Bluetooth or an app, which is fine by me — the Aventa is powered on via a button below the LCD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cfthPB"&gt;I hate the giant logo printed on the downtube. I get it, the company is young and needs to build recognition, but it comes at the expense of the buyer who’s transformed into a rolling billboard for a brand without any prestige (yet). One bystander asked me if I got it from some bike-sharing startup. Ugh, the humiliation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="k3dHuV"&gt;The battery can be inserted backward accidentally. It really should be keyed to make insertion idiot-proof (hi, I’m an idiot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6aiEaZ"&gt;The quick-release front-wheel and saddle stem are convenient but also magnets for thieves. Be careful out there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NmSl-ioR-8DY-hamKeIyVjlGvQo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313044/verge_DSC_2901_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LIrB5j"&gt;The entry-level Aventa Pure is a lot of bike for the price, coming in at €400 less than the VanMoof S3, which has become a benchmark of sorts for commuter e-bikes. The Aventa Pure also has a removable battery unlike the S3, and that might make all the difference for many buyers. True, the Aventa Pure doesn’t have all the gee-whiz features you’ll find on premium e-bikes at €2,000 and above. But expensive features like integrated security, theft recovery, at-home servicing, crash detection, and apps that can recommend the least polluted bike routes are ultimately just nice-to-haves, not critical functions of an electric bike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtS64Y"&gt;The Furosystems Aventa Pure is an attractive, inexpensive, and bare-bones e-bike for commuters. It will get you from A to B and back safely and reliably, and likely well into the future. And honestly, what more do you need? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="loh3kM"&gt;The Aventa Pure is a great icebreaker for anyone wanting an introduction to e-bike commuting.&lt;/p&gt;
