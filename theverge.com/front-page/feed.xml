    <title>Chrome for iOS will let you lock down incognito tabs with Face ID</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zVFCrm"&gt;Chrome’s latest update for iOS will let you secure your incognito tabs with Touch ID, Face ID, or a passcode (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/chrome-biometric-authentication-incognito-tabs/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). When the new feature is rolled out to you, you can turn it on by navigating to the settings menu, then tapping “Privacy,” then “Lock Incognito tabs.” I just updated the app and the option wasn’t there for me, so you might have to wait just a bit until you can flip it on. Google first revealed it was testing this new privacy feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279719/google-chrome-face-id-incognito-mode-ios-support-feature"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHl2DH"&gt;The update brings a few other handy features to Google’s mobile browser, including the ability to take a full-page screenshot of a website. You can use it by snapping a screenshot with the button combination specific to your device, tapping the screenshot preview, and then tapping over to the “Full Page” tab that will appear, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/20/chrome-92-ios/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (I don’t have this feature yet, either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCbS8Y"&gt;You can download Chrome 92 &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-chrome/id535886823"&gt;from the App Store now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram introduces a setting to control sensitive content in your Explore tab</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R5W-igcNyErp031220QpoAoSJos=/0x0:890x593/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69608523/CD21_455_NRP_IG_Sensitivity_Content_Control_Inline.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RW1A3k"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/introducing-sensitive-content-control/"&gt;Facebook is announcing&lt;/a&gt; a new setting that allows you to limit how much potentially sensitive content shows up in your Instagram Explore tab. According to Facebook, the new Sensitive Content Control setting will let you “see more or less of some types of sensitive content,” which may be “upsetting or offensive.” How much content the three levels, “Allow,” “Limit (Default),” and “Limit Even More” will or will not show is pretty vague, and we’ve reached out to Facebook for clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DfRl7"&gt;On &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/251027992727268"&gt;the support page for Sensitive Content Control&lt;/a&gt;, Instagram says that sensitive content could include sexually suggestive or violent posts, as well as posts that promote things like tobacco or pharmaceutical use. Facebook is clear that this setting is based on its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/313829416281232"&gt;Recommendation Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, which govern what can show up on the Explore page, and not &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119"&gt;its Community Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8XW7FB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Graphic” violence or nudity will still be taken off the site&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p6kT1b"&gt;Posts that flat-out violate Facebook’s rules will still be removed, Sensitive Content Control just gives users more options about how much they want to be exposed to content that could be upsetting in the Explore tab. For example, &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/251027992727268"&gt;Facebook says&lt;/a&gt; content showing a fight or people in see-through clothing may be considered “sensitive,” and therefore shouldn’t show up on the Explore page for people who have sensitive content limits. “Graphic” violence or nudity, however, would be taken off the site and wouldn’t show up even for those who have Sensitive Content Control set to “Allow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKYAVV"&gt;Facebook didn’t respond to a request for comment on how much of a difference the setting makes to the amount of potentially sensitive content that’s shown to a user. The descriptions shown in Facebook’s screenshot of the feature, seen at the top of this article, are a bit vague, though — the Limit Even More setting doesn’t say that you won’t see sensitive content, just that you “may” see fewer posts that “could” be upsetting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pabmy2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The descriptions of how much content will be shown are a bit vague&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I6Kgqh"&gt;According to Facebook, the setting will be accessible by going to your profile, then tapping Settings &amp;gt; Account &amp;gt; Sensitive Content Control. The feature doesn’t seem to have rolled out to all users yet: the option didn’t appear for me or a few of my colleagues. Facebook says that the setting to allow sensitive content may not be available to people under 18 years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRoeXB"&gt;This announcement comes at a time when many social networks, especially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557942/instagram-no-longer-photo-app-video-entertainment-focus"&gt;photo and video sharing platforms&lt;/a&gt;, are trying to figure out how to deal with content that may be upsetting to some users but engaging for others. Last year, TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175889/tiktok-updated-community-guidelines-violent-disturbing-content-warning-labels-opt-in-vaccine-info"&gt;introduced warning screens&lt;/a&gt; for potentially graphic videos, and Pinterest recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558960/pinterest-weight-loss-ads-ban-social-media"&gt;a ban on weight loss ads&lt;/a&gt;. Instagram itself tries to blur out images that could be potentially triggering for people struggling with eating disorders, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295693/instagram-eating-disorder-resources-help-lines"&gt;and provides resources&lt;/a&gt; to users searching for content related to disordered eating. Today’s announcement doesn’t seem to signal a drastic change for the Explore page, but it should give people a bit more control over what they see on it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max launches a group watch tool to stream full episodes on Snapchat </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ro3z3-ZVgfwVfP6uFGADmUpT3Uc=/0x8:2414x1617/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69608483/Triptych.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HBO Max Minis shown on a mobile device.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HBO Max&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jxfYD5"&gt;HBO Max has partnered with Snapchat to bring full-length episodes of its series to the social media platform. With HBO Max Minis, users will be able to stream the pilots of select series with up to 63 other Snapchatters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYf8Mk"&gt;The feature was &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-max-brings-free-episodes-snapchat-new-app-co-viewing-experience"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; today and is offered through Minis, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21286537/snap-minis-snapchat-partner-summit-2020-announcements"&gt;launched late last year&lt;/a&gt; and hosts third-party app experiences within Snapchat. Minis allow users to do anything from meditate with Headspace to buy movie tickets with friends through Atom. And now, HBO Max Minis will allow anyone on Snapchat to view entire episodes of more than a dozen series from the streaming service for free, including pilots from &lt;em&gt;Lovecraft Country&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;. With synchronized playback, everyone watching the title will be able to stream the same title together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYIfX0"&gt;Snapchat users will be able to access the HBO Max episodes through search or by clicking the rocket icon from chat. Once HBO Max Mini is launched, users will be required to verify their date of birth, which will filter which episodes are streamable. The &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-max-brings-free-episodes-snapchat-new-app-co-viewing-experience"&gt;full list of episodes&lt;/a&gt; available to stream on an age-restricted basis are as follows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OGHEah"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Betty&lt;/em&gt; (season 2, episode 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WaH0vI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Craftopia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1nXfAp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Euphoria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EG7Ru9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flight Attendant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LqqCQp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cRIeoW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genera+ion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0AqE1P"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Gossip Girl&lt;/em&gt; (2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lCEPUT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looney Tunes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fBQE9E"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fSpDFE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lovecraft Country&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PABfbq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Selena + Chef&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="taQVym"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Titans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VepaBg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warrior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tesUZN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;World of Calm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="RbU42y"&gt;Up to 64 users can join an HBO Max Mini session through a shared in-chat link or by clicking a shared sticker, and users will be able to chat and send reactions while streaming a title. The pilot episodes from the aforementioned series are free to stream even to users who aren’t subscribed to HBO Max. But users who are 18 years old and above will be prompted to subscribe to HBO Max to continue streaming a series once the pilot episode has ended. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2WCklbMEPfH1e6fc8Frn6ivBAQI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729138/unnamed__2_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HBO Max&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In-app streaming with HBO Max Minis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nYj9Hn"&gt;Watch parties are an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22092452/hulu-watch-party-now-available-all-subscribers"&gt;increasingly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432411/disney-plus-watch-party-feature-test-canada-scener-netflix-amazon-prime-video"&gt;popular&lt;/a&gt; feature launched by major streamers. Apple, for example, is releasing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;FaceTime integration&lt;/a&gt; later this year to support group streaming with SharePlay, but many streamers like Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney Plus have their own in-app group watch tools. HBO Max’s arrival on Minis marks the first major streamer to support streaming entire episodes without ever leaving Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFL76x"&gt;“People love to come together to watch their favorite HBO Max shows and talk about what’s unfolding,” Sarah Lyons, EVP of DTC global product management at HBO Max, said in a statement. “Our partnership with Snapchat is another step towards fulfilling that desire for human connection and providing our fans with co-viewing opportunities, while deepening their emotional relationship with the brand.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s gaming expansion starts with mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wT03y_BYKhH9s7Od7inytuRN6MQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69608381/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SWOM4W"&gt;Netflix revealed that its initial efforts in gaming will be focused on mobile games and that the games will be included with users’ Netflix subscriptions, the company announced as part of its second-quarter earnings report on Tuesday. The news comes just days after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577868/netflix-video-games-confirmed-mike-verdu-ea-oculus-facebook"&gt;the company said it hired&lt;/a&gt; former EA and Oculus exec Mike Verdu to head up its gaming work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyHJ5A"&gt;Here is exactly what Netflix said about gaming, &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;from its letter to investors&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="sm3E6C"&gt;We’re also in the early stages of further expanding into games, building on our earlier efforts around interactivity (eg, &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;) and our &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; games. We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV. Games will be included in members’ Netflix subscription at no additional cost similar to films and series. Initially, we’ll be primarily focused on games for mobile devices. We’re excited as ever about our movies and TV series offering and we expect a long runway of increasing investment and growth across all of our existing content categories, but since we are nearly a decade into our push into original programming, we think the time is right to learn more about how our members value games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OPRa37"&gt;There are still no details on what types of games will actually be available, though Netflix recently extended its TV deal with Shonda Rhimes &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/netflix-shonda-rhimes-extend-deal-to-include-feature-films-gaming-and-virtual-reality-content-1235014998/"&gt;to include feature films and gaming content&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also no word on how games will be delivered to Netflix subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXDMdT"&gt;The company has acknowledged in the past that it competes with games for time and attention, with co-CEO Reed Hastings writing that “we compete with (and lose to) &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; more than HBO” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/17/18187357/netflix-views-numbers-disney-amazon-fortnite-youtube-earnings-bird-box"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. COO Greg Peters discussed the company’s interest in games in April (&lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Netflix-Inc.-Q1-2021-Earnings-Call-Apr-20-2021.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) as part of its first quarter earnings. And the company has already dipped its toes into gaming with experiences like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152973/netflix-carmen-sandiego-interactive-special-black-mirror-gaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carmen Sandiego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV1aJe"&gt;But with the recent hiring of Verdu and the new information shared Tuesday about its initial plans, now it seems like Netflix is more focused on games than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9bQ5Ri"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Netflix snags former EA, Oculus exec to lead its video game efforts","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577868/netflix-video-games-confirmed-mike-verdu-ea-oculus-facebook"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Square launches checking and savings accounts for small businesses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eTajYh-zTRqtFianwDXWUqTVGhs=/38x0:2438x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69608373/square_register_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Square&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="px4Oqe"&gt;Square is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsquareup.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpress%2Fintroducing-square-banking&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F20%2F22585365%2Fsquare-banking-checking-savings-business-accounts" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;launching a new free banking service&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday that connects to the payment and point-of-sale products the company already offers to small businesses. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsquareup.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fbanking&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F20%2F22585365%2Fsquare-banking-checking-savings-business-accounts" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Square Banking&lt;/a&gt; combines checking accounts, savings accounts, and Square’s existing small business loans (now called Square Loans) into a package that the company claims is both fair and accessible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpxnK4"&gt;In terms of features, Square’s new savings account can automatically set aside money from every sale made on Square’s platform. Square Savings will also let users create custom folders for saving toward specific goals. Funds in a Square Checking account will be instantly available to use for payroll and other payments using a Square debit card, and Square says its accounts have no account minimums, overdraft fees, or recurring fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xAU9Qa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A Square closed loop&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ7Xih"&gt;Square says Square Loans are offered based on a small business owner’s previous sales history through its platform &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsquareup.com%2Fhelp%2Fus%2Fen%2Farticle%2F6454-square-capital-eligibility-faqs&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F20%2F22585365%2Fsquare-banking-checking-savings-business-accounts" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rather than their credit score&lt;/a&gt;. The company hasn’t made any dramatic changes to its loan service (formerly Square Capital), but users will be able to pay off their loan with a percentage of each sale on Square, and Square says in the future loans will be available immediately in a Square Checking account once approved.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s Short Nite film festival is coming back on July 23rd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yHYI4aOXL-QLV6z3_9mKesRxi84=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69608171/fortnite_gildedguy_items_1920x1080_0923ded75d70.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bqo6rX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is hosting a second round of its animated short film festival, dubbed “Short Nite 2,” — a successor to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22278892/fortnite-film-festival-short-nite-party-royale"&gt;game’s original Short Nite festival&lt;/a&gt; that developer Epic held earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEmHzi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/short-nite-2-watch-web-shorts-on-the-big-screen-in-fortnites-party-royale"&gt;According to Epic&lt;/a&gt;, Short Nite 2 will feature “a series of animated, online shorts by up-and-coming-creators,” which, like the original event, will air on the game’s combat-free Party Royale mode. Short Nite 2 will kick off on Friday, July 23rd, at 2PM ET, and last for about 40 minutes. If you can’t make the debut, the short films will continue to play nonstop until 2PM ET on July 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aQopTL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Another short film festival is on its way&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bsJzAf"&gt;The developer hasn’t announced the full list yet, but it’s highlighting that the stream will feature two Gildedguy animated shorts, including a debut of a new short film in the series, &lt;em&gt;Gildedguy Gets Up!. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yjmf8S"&gt;To celebrate, Epic is also releasing Gildedguy as a character skin in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; itself — it’ll be available to purchase from the item shop starting July 22nd at 8PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qVfw1F"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Get ready for another round of animated shorts on the Big Screen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Short Nite 2 comes to Party Royale starting at 2 PM ET on July 23 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Catch online shorts made by up-and-coming creators from around the world including the premiere of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GildedguyArt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GildedguyArt&lt;/a&gt; Gets Up!&lt;a href="https://t.co/s4wqQ3aplv"&gt;https://t.co/s4wqQ3aplv&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/NMXqa9QdzA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NMXqa9QdzA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1417515005554135042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Space billionaires get skewered in the first promo for Jon Stewart’s Apple TV show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RPL-gUZEuLW95reYAtW0on8g7Ks=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69608088/Screen_Shot_2021_07_20_at_12.04.07_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jason Alexander as Jeff Bezos.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Jon Stewart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7uUsHO"&gt;Jon Stewart shared a video promoting his upcoming Apple TV Plus show, &lt;em&gt;The Problem with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s an odd one: the three-minute and ten-second clip shared on Twitter is a comedy skit roasting the recent billionaire &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585470/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-amazon-customers"&gt;space&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/17/22573791/space-tourism-industry-bezos-branson-musk-billionaire-phase"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, starring Jason Alexander as Jeff Bezos and a mop as Richard Branson. There are also a lot of dick jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zL6eff"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonstewart/status/1417557259886940162"&gt;Here’s the clip, if you’re curious&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CTAh9R"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sorry for the aborted launch!!! I’m a bad twitterer. &lt;br&gt;Enjoy this small step for man! &lt;a href="https://t.co/6gBHHJLByQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6gBHHJLByQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Stewart (@jonstewart) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonstewart/status/1417557259886940162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K1LxoS"&gt;It’s unclear exactly how this might relate to the show itself, which is set to debut in September. Apple announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371914/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-release-launch-date-fall"&gt;in April&lt;/a&gt; that the show would be “a multiple season, one-hour, single-issue series” and each season will have a “companion podcast” released alongside it — it didn’t mention anything about comedy sketches lampooning space billionaires. It’s also still unclear how many episodes will be included in a season or how many seasons the show will have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHi2xI"&gt;I have to say that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chelseadevantez/status/1417565284773281793"&gt;this is pretty hilarious, though&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qYIUAr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We filmed the hat weeks ago   &lt;a href="https://t.co/OsJ8iIkTdY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OsJ8iIkTdY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chelsea Devantez (@chelseadevantez) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chelseadevantez/status/1417565284773281793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WbCaMn"&gt;Apple first revealed that the show was in the works &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537071/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-announced"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. Stewart’s iconic show &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart &lt;/em&gt;ended in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s new PS5 Digital Edition for Japan is mysteriously two-thirds of a pound lighter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FMVlII49MS7TqW6XFP1V4370QGU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69608041/vpavic_4278_20201030_0281.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s4gp40"&gt;Sony sleuths just stumbled onto a surprise in Japan: the company has quietly kicked out a new version of the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition that’s listed as 300 grams lighter than the original (&lt;a href="https://www.psu.com/news/new-ps5-digital-edition-model-revision-coming-weighs-300-grams-lighter/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;PSU&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). That’s two-thirds of a pound, bringing the mammoth console down from &lt;em&gt;well over&lt;/em&gt; the eight-pound mark to just slightly under it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHOMxm"&gt;How, you might ask? Well, that’s the question! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fULeQi"&gt;According to Sony’s official manual (&lt;a href="https://manuals.playstation.net/document/pdf/CFI-1100B-3.0_2.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) and quick start guide (&lt;a href="https://manuals.playstation.net/document/pdf/CFI-1100B-3.0_1.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;), as spotted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PS5sokuhouInfo/status/1417462433526939648"&gt;by PS5sokuhouInfo on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; differences between the new CFI-1100B and the original CFI-1000B are that change in weight and a new thumbscrew for the PS5’s vertical stand so you don’t need a screwdriver or coin to get it set. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PSuCm5V72NdHc1VAF__TBJtD8p8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729048/ps5_thumbscrew_japan.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new textured thumbscrew.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hPrBW1"&gt;It’s not like the console lost any girth: Sony’s documentation shows it has the same exact dimensions. So what could have possibly changed? The system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22170536/ifixit-teardown-playstation-5-dualsense-controller-gamepad"&gt;does have a beefy internal power supply, giant heatsink, and lots of shielding&lt;/a&gt;, so those come to mind, but we’ll have to wait for a new teardown to be sure. Or perhaps it’s just a typo. For context, the full-fat PS5 with the disc drive weighs just under 10 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uduTDs"&gt;The new version is already listed at Japanese retailers and will go on sale at the end of July, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PS5sokuhouInfo/status/1417458950333554689"&gt;according to PS5sokuhouInfo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Venmo drops the global social feed that could make your payments visible to strangers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hwkyG1J8cYMMMsMMsiwjJbX4FvI=/0x0:800x533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69607871/Updated_Venmo_home_screen_LQ.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated Venmo app without the global social feed.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Venmo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sWgx5h"&gt;Venmo announced it's &lt;a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/07-20-2021-The-Venmo-App-You-Know-and-Love-Now-Has-a-New-Look-and-Feel"&gt;removing its global social feed&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, the payment app’s notorious feature that allows strangers to potentially view payments you make and receive on Venmo (&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-20/venmo-makes-it-so-users-can-t-see-payments-between-random-people"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goovqP"&gt;Now Venmo’s social elements will be limited to your actual friends on the app in the “friends feed” without you having to toggle any features in the app. The company buried the change &lt;a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/07-20-2021-The-Venmo-App-You-Know-and-Love-Now-Has-a-New-Look-and-Feel"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; detailing an update to the Venmo app. Venmo writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ouQoGz"&gt;As part of our ongoing efforts to continually evolve the Venmo platform, while staying true to the heart of the Venmo experience, we are removing the global feed, and the friends feed is now the only social feed that will appear in the app. The Venmo community has grown to more than 70 million customers, so this change allows customers to connect and share meaningful moments and experiences with the people who matter most. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rDA5MZ"&gt;Until recently, Venmo also offered users no control over who saw their friends list within the app, which is potentially incriminating in an entirely separate way from seeing the content of a transaction. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/we-found-joe-bidens-secret-venmo"&gt;After &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;discovered President Biden’s Venmo account and the accounts of people in his inner circle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436847/venmo-contact-friends-list-not-private-president-joe-biden"&gt;via the friends list&lt;/a&gt;, the company added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22459163/venmo-privacy-controls-friends-list-joe-biden"&gt;additional privacy controls&lt;/a&gt; for the visibility of your Venmo contacts. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SaHfpqm9scsELr6qYrRMv4307wE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22728863/Goods_and_services_payments_LQ.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Venmo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How the new “goods or service” payment toggle appears in Venmo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HcveCS"&gt;Along with the major change to what’s actually visible in the Venmo app, the company is also giving users the ability to mark if they’re making a payment for a “goods or service” and receive the benefits of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvenmo.com%2Flegal%2Fus-user-agreement%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F20%2F22585467%2Fvenmo-removes-global-social-feed-private-payments" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Venmo’s Purchase Protection program&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone accepting payment for goods or a service is charged a small fee to receive their money (1.9 percent of the transaction plus 10 cents), but Venmo says it may cover the buyer and seller for refunds, which brings Venmo more in line with the Purchase Protection &lt;a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-safety-and-security"&gt;its parent company PayPal offers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjoeZ2"&gt;Venmo says the updated app experience should be available in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden to nominate Google critic Jonathan Kanter to lead DOJ antitrust division</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tEmFKRHAzYJ07-WJ70h5XcqCmtw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69607723/51268580333_f21dc6b731_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Adam Schultz&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y9vkBx"&gt;President Joe Biden will nominate Jonathan Kanter, an ardent Google critic and competition lawyer, to lead the Justice Department’s antitrust division, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-20/biden-to-name-google-foe-jonathan-kanter-as-doj-antitrust-chief?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dl798T"&gt;Kanter has a long history of representing companies in competition cases against Google, and he opened his own law firm last year. If confirmed by the Senate, Kanter would take the helm on a slate of cases against big tech companies led by the Justice Department, including a monopoly lawsuit filed against Google last October. The case accuses the search giant of creating an illegal monopoly in the digital ads market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="i4Mrop"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Jonathan Kanter is a distinguished antitrust lawyer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vrf2N9"&gt;“Jonathan Kanter is a distinguished antitrust lawyer with over 20 years of experience,” the White House said in a press release Tuesday. “Throughout his career, Kanter has also been a leading advocate and expert in the effort to promote strong and meaningful antitrust enforcement and competition policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttABz4"&gt;The Justice Department is also currently engaged in a sweeping competition investigation into Apple and the requirements it places on developers in its App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FL2xWc"&gt;Kanter is just the latest Biden nomination marking a significant step forward in antitrust enforcement, especially in the tech industry. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;Biden nominated Lina Khan&lt;/a&gt;, a tech antitrust pioneer and author of the widely cited “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox” legal paper, to chair the Federal Trade Commission. Tim Wu, another progressive antitrust champion, currently sits on the National Economic Council. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0XreO"&gt;Kanter aligns closely with Khan and Wu. But unlike Khan, who needs a majority of votes at the FTC to enforce antitrust law, Kanter would be able to file lawsuits to stop mergers on his own as deputy attorney general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9QdafM"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569869/biden-executive-order-right-to-repair-isps-net-neutrality"&gt;Biden signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; designed to promote competition with a strong focus on technology companies. The order included a new mandate requiring “greater scrutiny of mergers, especially by dominant internet platforms, with a particular attention to the acquisition of nascent competitors, serial mergers, the accumulation of data, competition by ‘free’ products, and the effect on user privacy.” The order also called on the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to issue new rulings promoting policy goals like the “right to repair” and net neutrality. &lt;/p&gt;
