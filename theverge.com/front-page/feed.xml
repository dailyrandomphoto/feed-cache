    <title>Amazon Prime members can now send gifts with just a phone number or email address</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8dLXvTD1FaGABeSBtm_-SKzsy7A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69947040/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon Prime members can now send gifts without having the recipient’s address. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1rT0ri"&gt;Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/node=23555099011#nav-top"&gt;launching&lt;/a&gt; a new gifting feature today that will allow subscribers to its Prime service to send gifts to others using only an email address or phone number — no address required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Q5zBt"&gt;Gift-givers have to be Amazon Prime members, the program is limited to the continental US, and it can only be used on mobile devices for the time being. And even though Amazon has built in some safeguards— the gift-giver never gets access to the recipient’s mailing address— this sounds like a bad idea that is ripe for abuse by scammers, stalkers, and those who take pleasure in the online harassment of others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yvf6b5"&gt;Here’s how the new feature works: Gift-giver wants to surprise recipient with a present but doesn’t know recipient’s mailing address. Gift-giver does, however, have either recipient’s email address or phone number. Gift-giver chooses the gift on his Amazon mobile app, selects the “add gift receipt for easy returns” options during check-out, and will see an option to “let the recipient provide their address.” The giver then adds the recipient’s email address or mobile number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxDoAg"&gt;At this point the gift-giver’s card isn’t charged, but a hold is put on their payment card for the amount of the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYh34W"&gt;Recipient then gets a notice —via either a text message or email— that there’s a present from gift-giver waiting for her.  Note that if recipient doesn’t have an Amazon account, they can create one at this point. The recipient has to have an Amazon account to accept the gift, but only the giver has to be a Prime member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPfRF2"&gt;The recipient can click on the notice from Amazon to reveal what the gift-giver sent, then she can decide whether to decline the gift, accept the gift but convert it to an Amazon gift card—the gift giver won’t be notified— or, she can just accept the gift. If the recipient accepts the gift, the giver’s payment card is charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8A4VIX"&gt;If the recipient ignores the gift notification entirely, it expires within a few days, and the gift-giver gets his money back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ctcIIz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WbaD-dl83cg?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=95&amp;amp;start=95" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zjz2hz"&gt;I asked Amazon if there was a mechanism for its members to opt out of this new service; there is not. Amazon’s stance is that if the recipient doesn’t want the gift, they can just decline it, or ignore the notification. What’s to stop a troll/harasser/stalker from sending multiple gifts to a recipient just to spam them with notifications, when the giver knows the recipient won’t accept? Technically nothing, although the recipient could notify Amazon customer service, which will decide what action to take. Such behavior would appear to violate Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=help_search_1-2&amp;amp;nodeId=GLHXEX85MENUE4XF&amp;amp;qid=1633180599372&amp;amp;sr=1-2"&gt;community guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUxuRu"&gt;Not everything Amazon sells is eligible for the new gifting feature, but “millions” of items are, the company said. The eligible items include products sold by Amazon and third-party sellers on its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhUYs5"&gt;This is a clever feature from Amazon that will theoretically drum up more members; remember, you can’t accept a gift through this process without an Amazon account. It’s well-timed, too; the holiday shopping season is approaching and we’re already hearing warnings about &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/germanys-christmas-king-gets-caught-up-in-shipping-chaos-11632475801"&gt;shipping delays&lt;/a&gt; and supply shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPiZmX"&gt;But the idea of getting a gift from someone who doesn’t have your address is problematic; there may be a very good reason the recipient’s address isn’t known to the gift-giver. If someone spams your phone or your inbox with multiple gift alerts, even if you don’t accept them or decline them, it will be up to the recipient to notify Amazon of the problem. Theoretically, since Prime members register their names, addresses and a payment method with Amazon, they wouldn’t risk having their account revoked by sending fake gifts. This is hardly a foolproof method for preventing harassment, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6d9JM"&gt;Amazon says it will roll out this feature over the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLEPDL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook encourages hate speech for profit, says whistleblower</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_GB8DFDxs2V5EqaZTlvK8KyrDD0=/387x0:2388x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69946435/7CF1506A_B241_40D9_9565_05E4C77C2DC7.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen appears on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GjQkgB"&gt;The whistleblower behind the leak of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;an enormous cache of Facebook documents&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, Frances Haugen, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-whistleblower-misinformation-public-60-minutes-2021-10-03/"&gt;went public on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, revealing more of the inner workings the most powerful social media platform in the world. Revealing her identity on national television, Haugen described a company so committed to product optimization that it embraced algorithms that amplify hate speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNTay4"&gt;“It’s paying for its profits with our safety,” Haugen told &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; host Scott Pelley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4boPU"&gt;According to a since deleted LinkedIn profile Haugen was a product manager at Facebook assigned to the Civic Integrity group. She chose to leave the company in 2021 after the dissolving of the group. She said she didn’t “trust that they’re willing to invest what actually needs to be invested to keep Facebook from being dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5cFvGm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There was conflict... between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PV1Jdl"&gt;Consequently she leaked a cache of internal research to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the hopes of driving better regulation of the company. She noted that she had worked at a number of companies, including Google and Pinterest, but that “it was substantially worse at Facebook” due to the company’s desire to put its profits over the welfare of its users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJrYKb"&gt;“There was conflict... between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook,” Haugen told Pelley, “and Facebook chose over and over again to optimize for its own interests — like making more money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSIrpG"&gt;While the company repeatedly claims it is helping stop hate speech, at least on its own products, one internal Facebook document leaked by Haugen says, “We estimate that we may action as little as 3-5% of hate and ~0.6% of V&amp;amp;I [Violence and Incitement] on Facebook despite being the best in the world at it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ruHTer"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Misinformation, toxicity, and violent content are inordinately prevalent among reshares,” said an internal document&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J4KuvT"&gt;Another document was even more blunt. “We have evidence from a variety of sources that hate speech, divisive political speech, and misinformation on Facebook and the family of apps are affecting societies around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZ4FXB"&gt;Haugen claims the root of the problem is the algorithims rolled out in 2018 that govern what you see on the platform. According to her they are meant to drive engagement and the company has found that the best engagement is the kind instilling fear and hate in users. “Its easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions,” Hagen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qfYOL5"&gt;At the time, Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16881102/facebook-news-feed-changes-meaningful-interactions"&gt;presented the algorithm changes as positive&lt;/a&gt;. “We feel a responsibility to make sure our services aren’t just fun to use, but also good for people’s well-being.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaTR4c"&gt;But according to the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting on Haugen’s concerns, the result was a sharp turn towards anger and hate. “Misinformation, toxicity, and violent content are inordinately prevalent among reshares,” said one internal memo quoted by the Journal, assessing the effects of the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITqMKf"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; began publishing its findings from the cache under the name “The Facebook Files” in September. One report &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;alleging Facebook had research proving Instagram harmed teenage girls&lt;/a&gt; has since led to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696698/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-markey-blumenthal-blackburn-pause"&gt;Congressional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704308/finsta-instagram-facebook-privacy-kids-safety-richard-blumenthal-blackburn"&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt;. Ahead of the hearing Facebook attempted to change the narrative &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22695629/facebook-says-instagram-is-not-toxic-for-teens-despite-damning-wsj-report"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, which reproduced two of the reports referred to in the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irvkLs"&gt;Ahead of the &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; report, Facebook attempted the same deflections in a different form. Facebook Vice President of Global Affair Nick Clegg appeared on CNN’s &lt;em&gt;Reliable Sources&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ReliableSources/status/1444730430461251585?s=20"&gt;to defend the company&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday afternoon, just hours before Haugen would appear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsEpXw"&gt;“I think that’s ludicrous,” Clegg said of the allegation that social media was responsible for the January 6 riots. “I think it gives people false comfort to assume that there must be a technological, or technical, explanation for the issues of political polarization in the United States.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2bkYb9"&gt;Haugen ended the interview by calling for regulation of social networks more broadly, something Facebook itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/2/19/21142478/facebook-regulation-content-moderation-singapore-pakistan"&gt;has called for&lt;/a&gt; in more limited form. She is &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/facebook-whistleblower-testify-us-senate-hearing-next-week-lawmakers-say-2021-09-29/"&gt;scheduled to appear before a Senate Commerce&lt;/a&gt; panel on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Eternals, Welcome to Earth, The Girl in the Woods, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9rfnfdYaZO_96uwjg-qkqoGrPD0=/371x0:1546x783/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69945868/eternals.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Eternals comes to theaters November 5th | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHpUqVktG74&amp;amp;ab_channel=MarvelEntertainment" target="_blank"&gt;Marvel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t6bQzf"&gt;So we had the big heel turn that’s been hinted at all season, plus some big moments for two of the show’s couples, which made &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s penultimate episode of season two very stressful to watch (for me, at least). I have no idea how they will wrap it all up in the finale; I think we’re headed for a cliffhanger on at least one front. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93QeWc"&gt;There’s too much good on streaming right now, it’s really a nice problem to have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSAITj"&gt;Here’s this week’s trailers roundup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yJ7tMu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wHpUqVktG74?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pBbLLZ"&gt;Eternals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2cqgG"&gt;A brand-new trailer for Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; has some of the action sequences we’ve seen in prior teaser/trailers, plus, a first look at Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos, along with his husband and son, apparently the first queer couple in the MCU to appear on the big screen (h/t &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Poc55U2RPMw&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;for that detail). To recap: The&lt;em&gt; Eternals&lt;/em&gt; are mega-hero guardians who have been waiting to jump in and help humanity and have decided the time is now. Also starring Gemma Chan, Angelina Jolie, Kumail Nanjiani, Salma Hayek, and Kit Harington, &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; comes to theaters on November 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TxgnYe"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i0MTCXgil1M?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="THroja"&gt;Welcome to Earth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6gnhiT"&gt;Will Smith opens this trailer with a confession: he’s never climbed a mountain or swum in a lake and is beginning to think he might be missing something. &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Earth&lt;/em&gt; is a six-part series from National Geographic— with its usual stunning location photography— that follows Smith on a trip around the world to some out-of-the-way places. It arrives on Disney Plus In December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xDXFqP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKJOsy3Kf18?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PjMonH"&gt;Sexy Beasts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="a60CKY"&gt;This ... unusual dating show where people wear elaborate animal/monster/creature costumes and makeup to hide their looks from potential suitors so they can be judged only on their personalities is back for a second season for some reason. The trailer leans all the way in to the weirdness, using &lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/tv/2021/7/21/22587027/sexy-beasts-netflix"&gt;quotes&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2021/06/netflixs-sexy-beasts-is-a-dating-show-fever-dream.html"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; like “A sign of the end times” and “the stuff of nightmares, truly,” which sort of begs the question: did we really need a second season? Clearly Netflix thought so. Season two of &lt;em&gt;Sexy Beasts&lt;/em&gt; premieres October 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="knrChD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7MudPmb8s8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oJKX6o"&gt;The Girl in the Woods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dDEU0V"&gt;A girl in the Pacific Northwest escapes from a colony of mysterious people who live behind a door in the woods, and guard the world from monsters. Krysten Ritter signed on to direct some episodes of the series, which stars Stefanie Scott, Misha Osherovich, Sofia Bryant Will Yun Lee, Reed Diamond, and Leonard Roberts. &lt;em&gt;The Girl in The Woods &lt;/em&gt;comes to Peacock October 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZoZcTY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Poc55U2RPMw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2ytEGa"&gt;The Harder They Fall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="goxsb0"&gt;We got a teaser for this western about rival outlaw gangs back in June, but here’s our first official trailer and a release date for the impossibly star-studded &lt;em&gt;The Harder They Fall. &lt;/em&gt;We get a little more backstory for Nat Love and why he’s gunning (literally) for Rufus Buck, who just broke out of a train car where he was imprisoned. Jonathan Majors, Zazie Beetz, Idris Elba, Delroy Lindo, Damon Wayans, Jr. and Regina King star in&lt;em&gt; The Harder They Fall,&lt;/em&gt; coming to Netflix November 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1Ocxy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Europe-Japan mission to Mercury sends back photos of the planet’s cratered surface</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q7ZgZtt25Cm3_ktf6aJNgys4Fe8=/3x85:1021x764/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69945193/Hello_Mercury.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The BepiColombo mission snapped this photo of Mercury on October 1st. | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2021/10/Hello_Mercury" target="_blank"&gt;ESA/BepiColombo/MTM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3n2YD0"&gt;Photos from a fly-by of Mercury, the least-explored planet in our solar system, show ithas a crater-riddled surface that resembles Earth’s Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JeTle2"&gt;The photos came from BepiColombo, a joint mission between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) that launched from Europe’s Spaceport in 2018. The mission has two linked orbiting spacecraft, the Mercury Planetary Orbiter and the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter. The mission is planned to reach Mercury’s orbit in late 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZD0PR"&gt;BepiColombo aims to gather more information about Mercury and its composition, and how it evolved so close to our Sun. Temperatures on Mercury can exceed 350 degrees Celsius, or about 660 degrees Fahrenheit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fazrvd"&gt;ESA explains where the craters came from and what the surface of the planet is believed to be like: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VOxC8w"&gt;One theory is that it may have begun as a larger body that was then stripped of most of its rock by a giant impact. This left it with a relatively large iron core, where its magnetic field is generated, and only a thin rocky outer shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqRKtU"&gt;Mercury has no equivalent to the ancient bright lunar highlands: its surface is dark almost everywhere, and was formed by vast outpourings of lava billions of years ago. These lava flows bear the scars of craters formed by asteroids and comets crashing onto the surface at speeds of tens of kilometers per hour. The floors of some of the older and larger craters have been flooded by younger lava flows, and there are also more than a hundred sites where volcanic explosions have ruptured the surface from below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fly-bys allow the spacecraft to use Mercury’s gravity to enter the planet’s orbit. Friday’s fly-by of Mercury was the first of six planned before it enters the planet’s orbit for closer study. BepiColombo will also build on data collected by NASA’s Messenger mission, which orbited Mercury between 2011 and 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EM7if1"&gt;As the spacecraft get closer to Mercury, it will be able to take higher-res images. More images from Friday’s fly-by will be available in the coming days, ESA said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SNL says what we were all thinking in its billionaire Star Trek sketch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Blue Origin Launch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lpoIbEfAhiAwUAVP76_nr0eZx9k=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69944523/1329693390.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="omwaS7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; returned this weekend and the show wasted no time taking aim at the weird &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/17/22573791/space-tourism-industry-bezos-branson-musk-billionaire-phase"&gt;billionaire space tourism race&lt;/a&gt; that unfolded over the past few months. Guest host Owen Wilson played former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in a sketch about a fictional new show called &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Ego Quest, &lt;/em&gt;about “the voyages of the SS New Shepard and its crew of random weirdos,” whose mission is “to just sort of fly around space goofing off in a ship that looks like a penis,” according to the voiceover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5lNg4"&gt;You’ll recall the real &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22580542/jeff-bezos-space-launch-live-stream-time-date-blue-origin-ns16-new-shepard"&gt;Bezos traveled to the edge&lt;/a&gt; of space in Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket in July, along with a crew that included his brother Mark (played in the sketch by Wilson’s brother Luke), 82-year-old pilot and space legend Wally Funk, and Dutch high school student Oliver Daemen. But Richard Branson, CEO of Virgin Galactic, beat Bezos to space by few days when he took a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;trip aboard his company’s SpaceShipTwo spaceplane&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22667339/spacex-inspiration4-first-all-civilian-crew-dragon"&gt;SpaceX sent its first crew of private citizens&lt;/a&gt; into space earlier this month, but CEO Elon Musk didn’t join them for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOT9c7"&gt;In the SNL sketch, Branson (Alex Moffatt), flying nearby in a ship with purple mood lighting, challenges Bezos to a race after they exchange some standard bro greetings for a flight the voiceover refers to as “a midlife crisis of cosmic proportions,” in which they accidentally wreck into the international space station. But wait, danger lurks around every corner: Suddenly Bezos’ ship is being pelted by photon torpedoes and yes of course it’s Elon Musk (Mikey Day, doing a spot-on impression of Musk’s speaking style).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKZQnW"&gt; “Space is only big enough for one white, weird billionaire,” “Musk” tells “Bezos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zW9Gdf"&gt;In reality, of course, neither Bezos or Musk has had much of a sense of humor about the other’s space aspirations. “You cannot sue your way to the moon,” the real &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699254/musk-bezos-spacex-blue-origin-code-confernce-2021"&gt;Musk told journalist Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; in an interview last week while discussing Bezos and Blue Origin. In response, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700600/amazon-elon-musk-jeff-bezos-blue-origin-spacex-lawsuits"&gt;Amazon sent&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; a 13-page PDF&lt;/a&gt; list that included all the times SpaceX has filed lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqrH5Z"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; sketch took one last jab at Bezos before it wrapped: an Amazon employee (Kenan Thompson) beams aboard Bezos’ ship to deliver a package, and before he beams out asks to use the bathroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2WSvh"&gt;Wilson-as-Bezos tosses him a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365330/amazon-apology-pee-bottles-worker-warehouse-union-pocan"&gt;plastic bottle.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford and GM working toward settlement over the term ‘Cruise’ for hands-free driving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="brMA7O"&gt;Ford and General Motors told a federal judge they’re planning to settle a trademark battle over the term “Cruise” to describe hands-free driving. Attorneys for the automakers said they’re working out the terms of the settlement and &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22897484/cruise_vs_ford_settlement_notice.pdf"&gt;asked the court for a conditional dismissa&lt;/a&gt;l. The two sides will report back within 60 days if they’re unable to come to an agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEsNfw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383460/ford-bluecruise-hands-free-adas-f150-mustang-mache"&gt;Ford announced BlueCruise as the name&lt;/a&gt; for its hands-free driver assist feature in April. The legal skirmish began in July, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22591805/gm-cruise-lawsuit-trademark-infringement-hands-free-driving-autonomous"&gt;GM filed a trademark infringement lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; claiming that the name BlueCruise was too close to its autonomous vehicle subsidiary Cruise, as well as Super Cruise, the name of the hands-free driving tech GM introduced in 2017.  GM said in its complaint that the two the companies had been involved in “protracted discussions” over the name but were unable to come to agreement. GM said it introduced Super Cruise in 2012, and its Cruise self-driving subsidiary has been in business since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0yuxU"&gt;In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/14/22624945/ford-dismiss-cruise-gm-lawsuit-driver-assist-blue-cruise"&gt;Ford filed a motion&lt;/a&gt; to have the suit dismissed, arguing that the term “cruise” had been been in “ubiquitous use” for 50 years as a term for driver-assist features, a term that consumers don’t associate with any one carmaker. A Ford spokesperson called GM’s trademark claims “meritless and frivolous,” adding that Ford had petitioned the US Patent and Trademark Office seeking to have GM’s trademarks of “Cruise” and “SuperCruise” rescinded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXvDjy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLGqQG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpQd90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A very big eagle escaped from the National Aviary in Pittsburgh and is still at large</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AC4-4nlfGeJaL5K95CU8tEj9ZUw=/0x81:940x708/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69942472/kodiak_the_stellers_sea_eagle.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Kodiak (Kody) the Steller’s sea eagle, who escaped the National Aviary in Pittsburgh September 29th | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/National_Aviary/status/1444319155843477508?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;National Aviary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJJcYY"&gt;A Steller’s sea eagle &lt;a href="https://www.aviary.org/birds-habitats/kodiak-the-stellers-sea-eagle/"&gt;escaped from its enclosure&lt;/a&gt; at the National Aviary in Pittsburgh last Saturday, and despite the valiant efforts of the Aviary staff, and numerous sightings in the local neighborhood &lt;a href="https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/kodiak-the-sea-eagle-still-missing-in-pittsburgh-has-had-quite-the-weekend/Content?oid=20270465"&gt;posted to social media&lt;/a&gt;, Kodiak —Kody to his friends— is still on the loose and we are all a little worried about him, to be perfectly honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDIQfo"&gt;This is a bird that would be difficult to miss: he’s large (although in Pittsburgh we probably wouldn’t call him “giant” because “Giant Eagle” is a grocery store chain here), with a yellow beak, white tail and white feathers on the tops of his wings. He’s bigger than a bald eagle, and has a wingspan of about six feet. Kody has been spotted in and around the Pittsburgh neighborhood where the Aviary is located, which seems like a good thing. But he’s been tough to catch because you can’t just toss a net over him and call it a day, as licensed falconer Richard Lawson &lt;a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/outdoors/2021/09/30/National-Aviary-Stellers-sea-eagle-missing-bird-Kodiak-Kody-search-Pittsburgh-falconry/stories/202109300130"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; &lt;/em&gt;a specialized (and obviously humane) trap is going to be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZVeai"&gt;The Steller’s sea eagle (&lt;em&gt;Haliaeetus pelagicus&lt;/em&gt;) typically weighs between 13 and 20 pounds, and stands about four feet tall. It has no natural predators, &lt;a href="https://www.aviary.org/birds-habitats/our-birds/?category=30"&gt;according to the Aviary&lt;/a&gt;, but Kody has lived in captivity for 15 of his 16 years, so he may be a little rusty on the whole hunting/prey thing. Steller’s sea eagles eat fish, and more fish, “scavenged mammals” (ew) and even other birds “when fish is in short supply.”  And in case you wondered, they’re named for German naturalist &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Georg-W-Steller"&gt;Georg W. Steller&lt;/a&gt;, who encountered the birds on a visit to Alaska in 1741.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JdvQfN"&gt;The Aviary has been posting updates to social media and getting tantalizingly close to retrieving Kody, but he’s eluded them so far. I was half-hoping Kody might make some kind of majestic appearance at the Steelers’ game last Sunday since Heinz Field is not far from the Aviary, and the team was at home against the Bengals (we’re not going to talk about that game today, though). Alas, he did not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mb6Kcc"&gt;On Thursday, the Aviary’s animal care experts camped out to monitor his roost in a high tree in the North Park area of the city, and they confirmed he was in good condition. They tried to entice him with some food, but he didn’t come down. But look at this handsome, handsome boi:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SRH2Wa"&gt;Many people— including me, before I moved to Pittsburgh a thousand years ago— don’t know what a hidden gem the National Aviary is, or, that it’s in Pittsburgh. &lt;a href="https://www.aviary.org/programs-encounters/animal-encounters/penguin-encounter/"&gt;Their penguins&lt;/a&gt; are usually the big celebrities (hi, this is &lt;a href="https://www.nhl.com/penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;), but they also have very cute— as well as very large—owls, eagles, flamingos, falcons, and canaries among other birds. You can sign up for educational “animal encounters” with many  of the birds— I recall visiting when my son was little; we sat in a large auditorium where some birds of prey were flying around, and we got like a popsicle stick with some food on it (I would prefer not to think about what the food actually was) and you’d hold it up until one of the birds swooped down to eat it. Extremely awesome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="muZhhM"&gt;If you are in Pittsburgh and see Kody call the National Aviary at 412-323-7235. Don’t try to approach him, you run the risk of scaring him off. And when the Aviary team shows up, stay out of their way. They want to get him safely home. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DC will give away free superhero NFTs to people who register for its FanDome event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zyzyQjsnVl0jvuQvWs-LCHjUOWA=/0x100:600x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69942002/superman.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A Superman cover that may be among the NFTs available from DC | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2021/09/29/dc-x-palm-nft-faqs" target="_blank"&gt;DC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qmmik8"&gt;DC is giving away free non-fungible tokens (NFTs) of its superhero comic book covers to people who register for its October 16th FanDome event. The NFT drop is set for October 5th, and those who &lt;a href="https://www.dcfandome.com/"&gt;register for FanDome&lt;/a&gt; will receive one free, randomly-selected NFT, and become eligible for a second free NFT if they post about their first one on social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqYbkl"&gt;The NFTs will come in three levels of rarity; common, rare, and legendary, and will include Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Harley Quinn options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="YXr6Up"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LxfZpw"&gt;DC is working on the NFTs with Palm NFT Studio, which the comic maker chose for its “environmentally sustainable and energy efficient” technology, which let the company mint “millions of NFTs for fans with near zero cost,” &lt;a href="https://www.warnerbros.com/news/press-releases/dc-partners-palm-nft-studio-epic-digital-collectibles-drop-dc-fandome-2021lm-nft-faqs"&gt;according to a news release&lt;/a&gt;. The companies aren’t saying how many comic-book cover NFTs are planned. “This drop pays homage to our 87 year history while visualizing a future in which NFTs play a foundational role in novel ways of interacting with DC content and unlocking new experiences,” DC’s Jim Lee said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBO69C"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397238/fandome-dc-zack-snyder-justice-league-batman-robert-pattinson-black-adam-gotham-knights"&gt;Last year’s virtual FanDome&lt;/a&gt;, the first ever for DC Comics and Warner Bros., provided first-look trailers for Zack Snyder’s &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;, and Robert Pattison’s turn as &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;. It drew an estimated 22 million views. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0PM36"&gt;This year’s lineup is expected to include a new trailer for &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;, as well as previews of upcoming movies &lt;em&gt;Black Adam&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Flash&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, &lt;/em&gt;new details about the next seasons for its shows &lt;em&gt;Harley Quinn, Batwoman, Superman &amp;amp; Lois, and Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt;, and the next chapter of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399355/batman-fortnite-zero-point-comic-book"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite — Batman&lt;/em&gt; crossover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NBCUniversal and YouTubeTV reach agreement to avoid dropped channels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the NBC Sunday Night Football..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pkam8ki9vKonbOaWjIQxK5Od5G4=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69941898/1224647361.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5IhHkm"&gt;After YouTube TV and NBCUniversal announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702511/youtube-tv-nbcuniversal-extension-dispute-negotiation"&gt;a “short” extension&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday to keep more than a dozen channels on the live TV service, YouTube TV and NBCUniversal say they have finalized a deal — meaning NBC-owned channels will stay put on YouTube TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vfn9sz"&gt;“We’re thrilled to share that we’ve reached a deal to continue carrying the full NBCUniversal portfolio of channels,” according to a Saturday &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-nbc-programming-update/"&gt;update to YouTube’s blog&lt;/a&gt;. “That means you won’t lose access to any of their channels, and YouTube TV will continue to offer 85+ networks for $64.99. We appreciate NBCUniversal’s willingness to work toward an agreement, and we also appreciate your patience as we negotiated with them on your behalf.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imfEEA"&gt;With a deal reached just days after it looked as though the channels &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22695937/nbcuniversal-youtube-tv-carriage-dispute"&gt;could get dropped&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube TV users will still have access to a dozen-plus channels that include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9uT75t"&gt;NBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FXM4fG"&gt;Bravo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6kLUEx"&gt;CNBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fzHULB"&gt;E!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2YViN7"&gt;Golf Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uD9Jpf"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hRIX6q"&gt;Oxygen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4akJE3"&gt;SYFY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Jx8NK"&gt;Telemundo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Tx1jfb"&gt;The Olympic Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nh0mtc"&gt;Universal Kids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="F0LgTZ"&gt;Universo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7CLBb8"&gt;USA Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DoKsAs"&gt;Plus, regional sports networks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="G9EjTj"&gt;NBC Sports Bay Area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1gauL3"&gt;NBC Sports Boston&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZQPTSH"&gt;NBC Sports California&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YwwI4q"&gt;NBC Sports Chicago&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3okHSr"&gt;NBC Sports Philadelphia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bGCh71"&gt;NBC Sports Washington&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rYhCfK"&gt;SNY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qGTwmA"&gt;YouTube TV had said that should the service lose the channels, it would have lowered its prices by $10 per month. But with a deal reached, the price will stay the same — and YouTube TV users will still be able to find their TV within one app without needing to subscribe elsewhere to get coverage from NBC-owned properties.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla sold 241,300 cars in the third quarter while other automakers saw big drops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vk3uAyDhCruPDSB7hU60ipYseao=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69941646/tesla_model_3_0638.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Li5RpP"&gt;Tesla has bucked the wider trend of declining sales brought on by the global chip shortage in the third quarter this year, as it sold 241,300 cars — a total of 102,000 more vehicles than the same quarter last year. It’s the most Tesla has ever sold in a quarter (and for some added perspective, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047233/tesla-2019-deliveries-q4-record-model-3-sales"&gt;sold 367,500 in all of 2019&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CDS0d"&gt;The company managed to deliver more vehicles once again despite the fact that major automakers saw huge drops this past quarter. General Motors, the largest automaker in the US, said &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2021/10/01/gm-sales-chip-shortage-suv/5934699001/"&gt;Friday morning&lt;/a&gt; that it only sold 446,997 vehicles in the third quarter — a 33 percent drop from the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LlJaq"&gt;Tesla has avoided similar problems in part because it has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560608/tesla-q2-2021-deliveries-elon-musk"&gt;sourcing different semiconductors and rewriting software on the fly&lt;/a&gt; to make those chips work in place of the ones not currently available. Beyond that, the company continues to see strong sales in China, where it started making and selling vehicles in early 2020. The Model Y SUV has also become a popular option in the United States, and Tesla &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/08/23/tesla-tsla-starts-model-y-deliveries-europe/"&gt;just started selling them in Europe, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPVdxY"&gt;Even more production is set to come online in the coming months, too, as Tesla has built an enormous part of its factory in Austin, Texas and is finally making it through some of the last approvals to start operating its new plant outside Berlin, Germany. That’s despite delaying some products, like the Cybertruck and second-generation Roadster. &lt;/p&gt;
