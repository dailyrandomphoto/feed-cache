    <title>GoDaddy cut off Texas Right to Life’s abortion ‘whistleblowing’ website, and it might be gone</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PUy8f0"&gt;In case you haven’t heard, Texas now has a law that makes it illegal for anyone to help women get an abortion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22656392/lyft-uber-legal-fees-drivers-lawsuit-texas-sb8-abortion-law"&gt;after six weeks of pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; with no exceptions for rape or incest — and to take advantage of that, the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life is encouraging citizens to report those people at a dedicated “whistleblower” website, promising to “ensure that these lawbreakers are held accountable for their actions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLQOwQ"&gt;On Friday, Texas Right to Life had to find a new home on the web, because hosting provider GoDaddy gave the group 24 hours to find a different place to park its website. “We have informed prolifewhistleblower.com they have 24 hours to move to another provider for violating our terms of service,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/03/technology/texas-abortion-law-website-tiktok.html"&gt;a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3VEtx"&gt;By late Friday, it appeared it found that home: Epik, the provider that also helped save &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18049132/gab-social-network-online-synagogue-shooting-deplatforming-return-godaddy-paypal-stripe-ban"&gt;controversial sites Gab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22236178/parler-resurfaces-sunday-app-banned"&gt;social media platform Parler&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754943/8chan-epik-offline-voxility-service-cutoff-hate-speech-ban"&gt;internet hate forum 8chan&lt;/a&gt; when other web service providers wouldn’t take them, is now listed as the registrar and name server provider for prolifewhistleblower.com as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssajkq"&gt;But the site may have gone too far for any web provider to touch, even Epik. Initially, GoDaddy told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the whistleblower site violated “multiple provisions” of its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.godaddy.com%2Flegal%2Fagreements%2Funiversal-terms-of-service-agreement&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F3%2F22656196%2Fgodaddy-texas-right-for-life-abortion-whistleblowing-site" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt; including Section 5.2, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="uQcvnG"&gt;You will not collect or harvest (or permit anyone else to collect or harvest) any User Content (as defined below) or any non-public or personally identifiable information about another User or any other person or entity without their express prior written consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VdDqlT"&gt;After Epik stepped in, the website still had plenty of trouble staying online. As of 4AM ET Saturday, we saw HTTP 503 error codes when trying to access it. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/09/texas-abortion-snitch-website-kicked-off-godaddy-for-invading-peoples-privacy/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Texas anti-abortion group tried to use Digital Ocean as a hosting provider first, but may have fallen afoul of that provider’s rules as well, and it’s not hosted there anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1Z61S"&gt;On Saturday, the site appeared to have migrated to BitMitigate, a webhost owned by Epik itself, and one that specifically advertises &lt;a href="https://bitmitigate.com/sovereign-hosting.html"&gt;its “sovereign hosting” services&lt;/a&gt; for platforms under attack. Yet by Saturday evening, the site was not loading for us at all, throwing an “accessed a banned URL” error. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CatEmbedded/status/1434317058620207105"&gt;Reportedly&lt;/a&gt;, Epik also decided hosting the form that allowed citizens to inform on their neighbors was against its terms of service, too, and has cut it off once more. We’ve reached out to Epik to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zw3kD"&gt;The anti-abortion group’s website has been under siege for days now, with angry protesters flooding it with fake tips — including at least one fake claim that Texas governor Greg Abbott himself had violated the law, according to the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;. One activist on TikTok even created a script that can automatically feed fake reports into the website’s tipbox, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3x9ba/tiktok-texas-abortion-law-bot-site-ios-shortcut"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;reported yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. He told&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; that the automated tools he’d created had received over 15,000 clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Qc5bIa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@black_madness21/video/7000057713975725318" data-video-id="7000057713975725318" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@black_madness21" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@black_madness21"&gt;@black_madness21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reply to @black_madness21 &lt;a title="texas" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/texas"&gt;#texas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="abortion" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/abortion"&gt;#abortion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="gregabbott" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gregabbott"&gt;#gregabbott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Sean Black" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7000057554395007750"&gt;♬ original sound - Sean Black&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zQ1vqM"&gt;But on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/here-s-how-you-can-help-shut-down-the-vile-website-for-1847557293"&gt;Gizmodo’s Shoshana Wodinsky suggested another way for activists to protest&lt;/a&gt;: blowing the whistle on Texas Right to Life itself, by complaining to GoDaddy about what it was doing. That’s what appears to have happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bxPLM"&gt;It’s not the first time web hosting providers or even GoDaddy specifically have played this role: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/28/18036520/gab-down-godaddy-domain-blocked"&gt;Gab.com had to find a new home in October 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and GoDaddy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/4/17320086/godaddy-domain-registrar-richard-spencer-altright-com-offline"&gt;took down white nationalist Richard Spencer’s Altright.com&lt;/a&gt; that May. Neo-nazi news site the Daily Stormer was similarly given 24 hours by GoDaddy to find a new home &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/14/16142384/daily-stormer-site-go-daddy-hosting-providers-hackers-anonymous"&gt;in August 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and wound up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16150668/daily-stormer-alt-right-dark-web-site-godaddy-google-ban"&gt;moving to the dark web&lt;/a&gt; instead. Gab was able to return, though, and Texas Right to Life at least briefly did as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mUtk1j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why the alt-right can’t build an alt-internet","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/21/16180614/charlottesville-daily-stormer-alt-right-internet-domain"},{"title":"Why banning hate sites is so hard","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20757267/8chan-offline-hate-sites-internet-problems-el-paso-texas-dayton-ohio-cloudflare"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tkF776"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 4:36PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional context from GoDaddy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oFf3gR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 4th, 4AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Epik appears to be Texas Right to Life’s new home for its site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L28LVF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 5th, 12:18AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that the site now appears to be down, following a report that even Epik wasn’t willing to host the whistleblower form.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony to offer free Horizon Forbidden West PS4 to PS5 upgrade after criticism</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/unkK9aJ4aIlLAckYQ-qI65jMFxE=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69818210/011c8fd12276586aaf21afa308317ab0.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yd7GB1"&gt;Sony is now planning to offer a free &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; upgrade from PS4 to PS5. The U-turn follows widespread criticism after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654091/horizon-forbidden-west-no-next-gen-upgrade-ps4-ps5"&gt;company announced&lt;/a&gt; there would be no upgrade path for &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West &lt;/em&gt;PS4 players, despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/4/22657200/sony-upgrade-playstation-horizon-forbidden-west-ps5"&gt;an original promise of a free upgrade&lt;/a&gt; to the PS5 version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Mbq6j"&gt;“It’s abundantly clear that the offerings we confirmed in our pre-order kickoff missed the mark,” &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/04/pre-order-horizon-forbidden-west-now-collectors-and-digital-deluxe-editions-detailed/"&gt;admits Jim Ryan&lt;/a&gt;, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment. “While the pandemic’s profound impact pushed &lt;em&gt;Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; out of the launch window we initially envisioned, we will stand by our offer: Players who purchase &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; on PlayStation 4 will be able to upgrade to the PlayStation 5 version for free.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAVDeh"&gt;Sony had originally planned to force PS4 players of &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West &lt;/em&gt;to purchase the $79.99 Digital Deluxe edition, $199.99 Collector’s edition, or $259.99 Regalla edition to get access to both the PS4 and PS5 versions of &lt;em&gt;Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzpWip"&gt;Sony is now also committing to a $10 digital upgrade option for both digital and physical versions of PlayStation first-party exclusive cross-gen titles. That means the next &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt;, and other Sony first-party cross-gen games will have a $10 digital upgrade option for PS4 players wanting to move to the PS5 version of the games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Labor Day deals happening now</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Last year’s M1 MacBook Air is just one of many items on sale this Labor Day weekend.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2LBXuy"&gt;Labor Day deals are now in full swing, with a slew of notable discounts available on some major hardware and accessories across the tech spectrum. Whether you’re picking up some last-minute gear for school or preparing to hunker down for the fall TV season with your favorite streaming device, this weekend might be the last real opportunity for you to save some serious money on TVs, headphones, and other gadgets until Black Friday and Cyber Monday roll around in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzRWwT"&gt;To make sorting through the abundance of deals easier, we’ve curated a selection of the best Labor Day sales and deals available, the bulk of which should last through the long weekend. We’ve also rounded up the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/9/2/22653796/best-labor-day-2021-tv-sales-4k-led-qled-oled-deal"&gt;best Labor Day TV deals&lt;/a&gt;, whether you’re in need of an OLED, midrange QLED, or a cheaper LED TV.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Horizon Forbidden West was supposed to have a free upgrade from PS4 to PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YQ68DXc12OlvYFCBL90Ml_og-Dw=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69817476/horizon_forbidden_west_screenshot_10_disclaimer_en_27may21.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a8uypp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE: Late Saturday, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/4/22657679/sony-horizon-forbidden-west-ps4-ps5-upgrade-free"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony reversed course and updated its blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, confirming that it will in fact offer a free Horizon Forbidden West upgrade from PS4 to PS5. Our original story continues below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKersT"&gt;On Thursday, Sony announced that its &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; game, sequel to &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654091/horizon-forbidden-west-no-next-gen-upgrade-ps4-ps5"&gt;available for pre-order &lt;/a&gt;ahead of its February 2022 release date. But contrary to what Sony said last year (h/t &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2021/09/03/sony-explicitly-said-a-ps5-horizon-forbidden-west-upgrade-would-be-free/?sh=3342fbae9306"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), there’s no upgrade path for the game from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJPF40"&gt;In a September 2020 blog post, Sony said &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West &lt;/em&gt;would be among the games to have a free upgrade from PS4 versions to the PS5 version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6aXWlM"&gt;“Additionally, we know that the PS4 community will transition to PS5 at different times, and we’re happy to announce PS4 versions of some of our exclusives. Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Sackboy A Big Adventure, and Horizon Forbidden West will also launch on PS4. While these three games were designed to take advantage of PS5 and its unique next-gen features like the ultra-high-speed SSD and DualSense controller, PS4 owners will also be able to enjoy these experiences when they launch. The PS4 digital versions of launch games include a free upgrade on both PS5 consoles, while the PS4 disc versions of these games include a free upgrade on the PS5 with Ultra HD Blu-Ray disc drive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="recirc-unit"&gt;And as &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22654502/horizon-forbidden-west-ps4-upgrade-ps5-special-edition-preorder-release-dates"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, Jim Ryan, chief executive of Sony Interactive Entertainment, told the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/09/16/ps5-retail-units/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post’s Launcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; section last year that games for PS5 would be “built from the ground up.” and that for games like&lt;em&gt; Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;, the company had “an upgrade path for PS4 users to get the PS5 versions for free.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2TRa4"&gt;Ryan told the &lt;em&gt;Post &lt;/em&gt;that “no one should be disappointed,” adding that “It’s about people having choice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sn6kXu"&gt;But what Sony announced this week was... not that. Gamers who want to start playing &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; on PS4 will have to buy the more expensive versions of the game that offer digital copies for both consoles: those packages are priced at $79.99 for the Digital Deluxe edition, $199.99 for the Collector’s edition, and $259.99 for the Regalla edition. Otherwise, you can get the PS4 standard edition for $59.99 and buy an entirely new PS5 copy of the game later at its full price of $69.99. There are no plans for an upgrade in the future, &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/games/horizon-forbidden-west-support/"&gt;according to the support page&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWjiOv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXlLLn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch2h5U"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qg4F74"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Home Depot says its smart home app is for people who find the smart home space ‘intimidating’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kRPZmJjg0EFKjcyaBxLyvEQ-bi4=/0x184:1500x1184/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69817141/HubspaceDeviceScan2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Scan a QR code on a compatible product to add to Home Depot’s Hubspace  | Home Depot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l3TbkO"&gt;Home Depot has launched a smart home app meant to be an all-in-one for smart appliances and accessories the big box store sells, but it’s debatable why anyone would need it when Google Home and Amazon’s Alexa already exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6dVCq"&gt;Called Hubspace, the free app is available in Android and iOS app stores, and “enables light bulbs, smart plugs and ceiling fans to be controlled from anywhere,” according to a press release from Home Depot.  It’s compatible with Google Home and Amazon Alexa devices, and works with a short list of products that Home Depot sells, from its proprietary brands such as Hampton Bay and EcoSmart. “There’s no need for a hub or extra equipment, and the platform already works with more than 20 products,” the press release explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYOpfs"&gt;OK, so there’s no hub required and you can control third-party devices from one app, which seems like it would add some convenience if you’ve got a ton of mismatched smart home brands in your collection but don’t want to set up a hub. But there are plenty of smart home products that users can control via the product’s own smart home app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvpGuk"&gt;We asked a Home Depot spokesperson why consumers should use this app to control their smart home products instead of Alexa or Google Home to be sure we weren’t missing something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EryZsN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Is Hubspace meant to be a competitor to Alexa and Google Home? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1x7d5L"&gt;A. Hubspace was designed to be a simple, reliable, and responsible way to bring products from The Home Depot’s proprietary brands such as Hampton Bay, EcoSmart, and other product lines into Smart Home. Hubspace-connected products provide customers with a high-quality user experience to control products in the Hubspace app, once products are connected to the Hubspace platform it offers the ability to seamlessly integrate their products with third-party platforms in the fastest easiest way possible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVGY4K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Because it appears all of the items on the list of compatible products are already compatible with Alexa or Google Home – why would someone need this third option? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrnXVD"&gt;A. At The Home Depot, we know our DIYers look for easy-to-install and convenient solutions. Hubspace was created to make the convenience and sustainability benefits of Smart Home products available to anyone with a smart device and an internet connection – with no hub necessary and at an affordable price. Smart Home can be an intimidating space for some customers, Hubspace was designed to simplify the experience and to allow all customers the [sic] enjoy the benefits of Smart Home products.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYx93K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. And is it limited to that list of products only?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Smmbzq"&gt;A. The Hubspace app was designed with the ability to support products from all the aisles of The Home Depot. We have started with products from within our lighting and electrical areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDCf9a"&gt;So there you have it. If you’re intimidated by smart home products, really don’t want to install a hub, and have these products that are sold at Home Depot, maybe you want this app. Each product can be added to Hubspace by scanning the QR code on the product’s packaging, and then connected to whatever voice assistant you prefer. Connecting the Hubspace account to a voice assistant (like Alexa) enables the voice commands. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says its AI mislabeling a video of Black men as “primates” was “unacceptable”</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z7ENFYChhVDAJQnEsOtXeh--aNA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69816953/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook is apologizing for applying a “primates” label to a video of Black men | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g8hY9u"&gt;Facebook is apologizing for an incident where its AI mislabeled a video of Black men with a “primates” label, calling it an “unacceptable error” that it was examining to prevent it from happening again. As reported by the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/03/technology/facebook-ai-race-primates.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, users who watched a June 27th video posted by the UK tabloid &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; received an auto-prompt asking whether they wanted to “keep seeing videos about Primates.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFrJBN"&gt;Facebook disabled the entire topic recommendation feature as soon as it realized what was happening, a spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bE7LNa"&gt;“This was clearly an unacceptable error,” the spokesperson said. The company is investigating the cause to prevent the behavior from happening again, the spokesperson added. “As we have said, while we have made improvements to our AI we know it’s not perfect and we have more progress to make. We apologize to anyone who may have seen these offensive recommendations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCOfnk"&gt;The incident is just the latest example of artificial intelligence tools showing gender or racial bias, with facial recognition tools shown to have a particular problem of misidentifying people of color. In 2015, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/1/8880363/google-apologizes-photos-app-tags-two-black-people-gorillas"&gt;Google apologized&lt;/a&gt; after its Photos app tagged photos of Black people as “gorillas.” Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21333405/facebook-instagram-racial-bias-equity-team-formed-ai-algorithms"&gt;Facebook said it was studying&lt;/a&gt; whether its algorithms trained using AI—including those of Instagram, which Facebook owns— were racially biased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSxOzG"&gt;In April, the US &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2021/04/aiming-truth-fairness-equity-your-companys-use-ai"&gt;Federal Trade Commission warned&lt;/a&gt; that AI tools that have demonstrated “troubling” racial and gender biases may be in violation of consumer protection laws if they’re used decision-making for credit, housing or employment. “Hold yourself accountable— or be ready for the FTC to do it for you,” FTC privacy attorney Elisa Jillson wrote in a post on the agency’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEQHGb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PC7GJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch PlayerUnknown describe Prologue, a post-PUBG project all his own</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AfE7fyrU1sgvG9stKKWuJ77-z2o=/428x0:3668x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69815725/game_image.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0RcAx5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;, more commonly known as &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;Game for Peace&lt;/em&gt; in China) is already one of the most successful and influential games ever made just four years after release. Its director Brendan Greene, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/pubg-playerunknown-brendan-greene-interview-july-2017/"&gt;a former DJ and web designer from Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, is credited with launching the entire battle royale genre, directly inspiring what you now know as &lt;em&gt;Fortnite,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;CoD: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ofvpo"&gt;But this past week, he announced that he’d left the Korean company whose work on his battle royale vision propelled him to fame to build a studio all his own — and late Thursday, he revealed what to expect from his next project.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R0C38g"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/dipZpUSeNY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dipZpUSeNY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PLAYERUNKNOWN (@PLAYERUNKNOWN) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PLAYERUNKNOWN/status/1433682802931904518?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NuTOjp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://playprologue.com/"&gt;It’s called Prologue&lt;/a&gt;, and it will be a pay-what-you-want tech demo designed to illustrate the kinds of games that Greene wants to build next: “We want to create realistic sandbox worlds on a scale that’s seldom attempted, worlds hundreds of kilometers across with thousands of players interacting, exploring and creating,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFb3Dh"&gt;Greene says his new team has built a neural network that can generate “massive realistic open worlds at runtime — each and every time you press play,” calling it a “breakthrough,” and that Prologue will be “a simple introduction to an early iteration of our technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iiU74w"&gt;Here’s his full description of Prologue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Pwg4Rp"&gt;You’ll need to find your way across a runtime generated wilderness and use found tools and gathered resources to survive on a journey where harsh weather is your constant foe. There will be no guidance, no path for you to follow, just a world, a spot on the map to reach, and the tools you need to get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="84JbQH"&gt;There’s no word on when we should expect Prologue yet, but Greene gave an exclusive interview to &lt;em&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/em&gt;’s Dean Takahashi. It should go live at 8:45AM on Saturday, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/09/03/brendan-playerunknown-greene-reveals-an-ambitious-new-game-world-dubbed-prologue/"&gt;according to the publication.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2GGc2"&gt;The company that Greene left has a stake in his new company too, &lt;em&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/em&gt; reports. Krafton (formerly known as PUBG Corp, and before that Bluehole Studio) is also working on its next game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22639319/krafton-pubg-project-windless-fantasy-franchise"&gt;a fantasy epic currently known as “Project Windless”&lt;/a&gt; that’s based on Korean folklore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eO6xpJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lyft and Uber to cover legal fees of drivers sued under Texas anti-abortion law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SXVByRiencZslrKanPVzOKge_hQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69815468/akrales_181010_3013_0065.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UU76Ay"&gt;Lyft and Uber are committing to pay legal fees for any driver on their respective platforms who get sued under Texas’ controversial anti-abortion law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Of0sDi"&gt;The new law, which was signed this week by Texas governor Greg Abbott, bans abortions of fetuses after six weeks (which is before many women even know they are pregnant) and offers no exceptions for rape or incest. The law also empowers private citizens across the country to sue anyone for “aiding and abetting” abortions past the six-week mark, including clinics, anyone who pays for the abortion, or even people who drive someone to the procedure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S26NVA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the law allows people to sue those “aiding and abetting” abortions past six weeks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MPzQts"&gt;“This is an attack on women’s access to healthcare and on their right to choose,” Lyft co-founder and CEO Logan Green tweeted Friday afternoon. Green said Lyft is creating a “driver legal defense fund” to cover 100 percent of legal fees if drivers on its platform get sued under the new law. He said Lyft is also donating $1 million to Planned Parenthood to “ensure that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UXgI9B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Right on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/logangreen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@logangreen&lt;/a&gt; - drivers shouldn’t be put at risk for getting people where they want to go.  Team &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Uber?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Uber&lt;/a&gt; is in too and will cover legal fees in the same way. Thanks for the push. &lt;a href="https://t.co/85LhOUctSc"&gt;https://t.co/85LhOUctSc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— dara khosrowshahi (@dkhos) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dkhos/status/1433894081487273987?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wdaEiI"&gt;Shortly after, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi announced in a tweet that his company would follow suit. “[D]rivers shouldn’t be put at risk for getting people to where they want to go,” he wrote. Uber “will cover legal fees in the same way,” he said, quoting Green’s tweet. “Thanks for the push.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yjdKlO"&gt;The announcements from Uber and Lyft came after Bumble and Match Group (which owns Tinder) announced the creation of &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/bumble-and-match-have-created-a-relief-fund-to-help-cov-1847613072"&gt;a relief fund for women seeking abortions&lt;/a&gt;. Match Group CEO Shar Dubey said in an internal memo obtained by &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/match-ceo-bumble-create-funds-texas-staff-after-strict-abortion-law-2021-09-02/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the company “generally does not take political stands unless it is relevant to our business. But in this instance, I personally, as a woman in Texas, could not keep silent.” Both companies are headquartered in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H22pfp"&gt;Pressure &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/corporate-americas-response-to-texas-abortion-law-silence"&gt;ramped up on companies that do business in Texas&lt;/a&gt; to act late this week after the Supreme Court’s conservative majority (minus Chief Justice John Roberts) &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/us/supreme-court-texas-abortion-law.html"&gt;declined to step in and halt the restrictive law&lt;/a&gt;. But so far corporations have only announced reactive measures like defense funds, despite calls to move their business elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8dkxG"&gt;It’s also possible that the law could &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/the-texas-abortion-ban-could-force-tech-to-snitch-on-users"&gt;spur an explosion of requests&lt;/a&gt; to tech companies for information on users who may have helped someone get an abortion, Evan Greer, director of the digital rights group Fight for the Future, told &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; this week. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is reportedly set to bring Game Boy and Game Boy Color games to Switch Online</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6zVUOe"&gt;Nintendo may be finally ready to bring its storied handheld gaming library to the Nintendo Switch — Game Boy and Game Boy Color titles will soon join &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443321/nintendo-switch-online-may-2021-retro-games-total-library"&gt;the 100-plus NES and SNES games&lt;/a&gt; that it offers via its Switch Online subscription service, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yFRi2jd0xMg"&gt;according to rumors&lt;/a&gt; from the “Nate the Hate” podcast, corroborated &lt;a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/rumour_nintendo_will_expand_its_switch_online_service_with_game_boy_and_game_boy_color_titles"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Nintendo Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday and now again on Friday &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-09-03-game-boy-and-game-boy-color-titles-headed-to-nintendo-switch-online"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not every day we see a Nintendo rumor that strong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxxxZr"&gt;There’s no word on which titles might arrive, and I wouldn’t necessarily expect your favorites to be among them, particularly to start. Nintendo has curated its NES and SNES libraries for Switch very slowly, some of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275714/nintendo-switch-online-games-february-2021"&gt;are pretty deep cuts&lt;/a&gt;, and many titles like &lt;em&gt;Earthbound&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Chrono Trigger&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Super Mario RPG&lt;/em&gt; are still MIA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20848125/super-nintendo-games-snes-switch-online-service-mario-zelda-tomorrow"&gt;two years later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUoulh"&gt;But it makes a lot of sense that Nintendo would ramp up more classic content, particularly now that the Switch is well into its life and Nintendo is watching its competitors capitalize on remakes, remasters and next-gen patches that make older games look better and give their new consoles some extra life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CSA4mj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Does this mean a Game Boy Classic Edition isn’t happening?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nvj6bl"&gt;For a while, we were wondering if Nintendo would continue going down the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/3/13507516/nintendo-nes-classic-edition-hands-on-first-impression-how-to"&gt;NES Classic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/27/16363696/super-nintendo-snes-classic-edition-review"&gt;SNES Classic&lt;/a&gt; route, releasing cute limited-edition miniature USB versions of its Game Boy or Nintendo 64 with preloaded games on board, too. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18311479/nintendo-game-boy-30th-anniversary-switch-gaming"&gt;the Game Boy’s 30th anniversary&lt;/a&gt; came and went without a miniature Game Boy, and now we’re in the midst of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;a global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;. I’d love to see more opportunities to let new gamers in on old classics, and not just in terms of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20871958/legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review-nintendo-switch-updates-graphics"&gt;remakes like &lt;em&gt;Link’s Awakening&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(originally on Game Boy, Game Boy Color). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdkJRo"&gt;Here’s hoping for Game Boy Advance, too, because folks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22466240/nintendo-metroid-dread-side-scroller-e3-2021-switch"&gt;playing the new &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deserve to play its amazing prequel &lt;em&gt;Metroid Fusion&lt;/em&gt;, and some of the best &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem&lt;/em&gt; games ever made came out there. Oh, and &lt;em&gt;Golden Sun&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; does say other consoles  beyond Game Boy and Game Boy Color may be “on the cards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjoss8"&gt;Amusingly, Nintendo offered this official statement: “We have nothing to announce on this topic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ze9Tq"&gt;Which Game Boy and Game Boy Color games are on your shortlist? I’m going with &lt;em&gt;Wario Land&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Pokemon Pinball.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DfZ77e"&gt;Switch Online costs $4 a month, $20 a year, or $35 a year for a family membership.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AI computers can’t patent their own inventions — yet — a US judge rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xoNtwwJIp7t8hXD3pG0gLq2x8sM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69814568/jbareham_170215_1460_0001_v2_5_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CeKVWH"&gt;Should an artificially intelligent machine be able to patent its own inventions? For a US federal judge, the larger implications of that question were irrelevant. In April 2020, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241251/artificial-intelligence-inventor-united-states-patent-trademark-office-intellectual-property"&gt;ruled that only “natural persons” could be credited as the inventor of a patent&lt;/a&gt;, and a US court decided Thursday that yes, that’s what the law technically says (via &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-03/only-humans-not-ai-machines-can-get-a-u-s-patent-judge-rules?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vKG9L"&gt;Not every country agrees with that direction. &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-01/historic-decision-allows-ai-to-be-recognised-as-an-inventor/100339264"&gt;South Africa and Australia decided to go the other direction&lt;/a&gt;, granting one patent and reinstating a second patent application filed by AI researcher Steven Thaler, whose AI system DABUS reportedly came up with a flashing light and a new type of food container. Thaler is the one who sued the US in this case as well — he’s part of a group called &lt;a href="https://artificialinventor.com/"&gt;The Artificial Inventor Project&lt;/a&gt; that’s lobbying for AI recognition around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DS52N"&gt;You can read the US’s whole decision against Thaler for yourself at the bottom of this post, but it’s pretty simple when you boil it down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="anH6Tz"&gt;The US Patent Act says inventors an inventor must be an “individual” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2puwAz"&gt;Previous legal decisions have clarified that “individuals” have to be people (not, say, companies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IP55o0"&gt;It’s also pretty clear from context that the Patent Act was referring to people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1wBUNo"&gt;AI systems are not people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="IxEMyP"&gt;Oh, and the court says it can only overrule a US agency’s decision if it’s arbitrary, capricious, or obviously illegal — but in this case, the USPTO already laid out its entire reasoning why it plans to stick to the status quo last April. It also asked for public comment in 2019, before it made its ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KUW9H5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The USPTO wants to know if artificial intelligence can own the content it creates","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20961788/us-government-ai-copyright-patent-trademark-office-notice-artificial-intelligence"},{"title":"We’ve been warned about AI and music for over 50 years, but no one’s prepared","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18299563/ai-algorithm-music-law-copyright-human"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QVnR3i"&gt;As to the bigger question, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WA4qst"&gt;“[T]here may come a time when artificial intelligence reaches a level of sophistication such that it might satisfy accepted meanings of inventorship. But that time has not yet arrived, and, if it does, it will be up to Congress to decide how, if at all, it wants to expand the scope of patent law.” &lt;/p&gt;
