    <title>Verizon is offering customers free Apple Arcade or Google Play Pass for up to a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NbGxCieqwryDJ_uVp_c1udB_CF0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69333468/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kLwTrr"&gt;Verizon has a new deal for new and existing unlimited plan subscribers starting May 25th: up to a year of &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/gaming/apple-arcade/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/gaming/google-play/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Play Pass&lt;/a&gt;, free of charge. Specifically, customers who pay for the Play More Unlimited and Get More Unlimited plans get 12 months of either app subscription service for free, while all other unlimited plans get six months. It’s worth noting that both free options are longer than the ones Apple or Google offer themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pccJT7"&gt;The $80 per month Play More plan or $90 per month Get More plan (that’s the price for a single line) also come with other benefits to sweeten the deal. Play More comes with an “unlimited” mobile hotspot with up to 15GB of 5G data, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21371902/verizon-unlimited-plans-free-disney-plus-espn-hulu-bundle"&gt;the Disney Bundle&lt;/a&gt; (Hulu, Disney Plus, ESPN Plus), six months of Apple Music, and 12 months of Discovery Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5MdnOH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not quite unlimited, but the add-ons are nice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E7CmXf"&gt;Meanwhile, Get More offers an “unlimited” mobile hotspot with up 30GB of 5G data, the Disney Bundle, a continuous subscription to Apple Music, and 12 months of Discovery Plus. Verizon frequently offers all sorts of other promotions so you can check &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/plans/?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D39986104348088388961888296802413619485%7CMCAID%3D304EA1F622850B1E-40001414C26A22B2%7CMCORGID%3D843F02BE53271A1A0A490D4C%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1621640023&amp;amp;mboxSession=4b9bd75675694d1c8939eaadd9212408" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt; for the most up-to-date deals. (Each plan only guarantees 50GB of 5G/4G data at most, so none of them are technically “unlimited.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGn63Y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20878843/google-play-pass-bundles-350-android-games-and-apps-for-4-99-per-month"&gt;Google Play Pass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18280589/apple-arcade-gaming-subscription-release-date-pricing-features"&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/a&gt; are similar conceptually — pay monthly for access to a selection of the best apps from a platform without in-app purchases — but differ meaningfully in what they actually offer. Apple Arcade is focused on games and by far has some of the most interesting exclusives. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/26/21026128/apple-arcade-best-games-iphone-ipad"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grindstone &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Card of Darkness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were early favorites, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"&gt;the recent addition of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a JRPG from the creator of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;, is also well worth subscribing for, even if you have to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxAtTn"&gt;Play Pass is a bit more holistic as an offering, but might be worth it if you’re new to Android. Google includes popular games &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; apps in the service, spanning everything from a farming sim like &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley &lt;/em&gt;(normally $4.99) to a utility app like AccuWeather (free, but includes in-app purchases). It also offers a larger selection than Apple Arcade, with &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/31/google-play-pass-800/#:~:text=Google%20Play%20Pass%20now%20offers%20more%20than%20800%20Android%20apps%20and%20games&amp;amp;text=Google%20introduced%20Play%20Pass%20in,of%20the%20%244.99%20monthly%20membership."&gt;now over 800 apps and games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8a0jgO"&gt;Neither Apple Arcade nor Google Play Pass are particularly expensive on their own at $4.99 per month each, but their free trials also aren’t as long as what Verizon is offering. Apple will toss in three months of Arcade for free if you purchase a new Apple device, but otherwise offers a one-month free trial. Google also only offers a one-month free trial for Play Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rk9jdR"&gt;If you’re interested in Verizon’s deal, but want a better understanding of what’s available to you, check out our lists of the best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178231/apple-arcade-iphone-ipad-best-games-2020"&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22170029/best-play-pass-games-google-android-phone"&gt;Play Pass&lt;/a&gt; games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SiriusXM is starting a TikTok music channel to appeal to the teens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AtlyyUSgK7qxBVnFY1zm4y8T7EU=/78x0:1203x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69333225/WF_788501_TikTokPlaylistsPromotionalCampaign_PR_Design_R3_BlogHeader_1280x750.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;SiriusXM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H9zHk0"&gt;SiriusXM wants to reach the youth, and starting today, it’s going to do so through the cultural cachet of TikTok. Sirius, which owns Pandora and the podcasting company Stitcher, announced a new partnership with the social video app today that’ll bring TikTok-popularized music to the satellite radio provider. TikTok Radio, a new music channel, will broadcast trending sounds through the SiriusXM app, browser, and connected devices. Sirius says tuning in should sound like swiping through TikTok’s “For You” page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnTSPF"&gt;It’s also using the partnership to launch a new Pandora series, called TikTok Tastemakers, that’ll involve popular TikTok creators, like Bella Poarch, hosting and curating playlists with their favorite songs alongside commentary. They’ll also promote the shows on TikTok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loDhag"&gt;The partnership really seems to mutually benefit both companies. TikTok gets even more brand promotion, while Sirius now has something to market to teens. Right now, the company’s most prominent deal is with Howard Stern, someone many teens likely haven’t tuned in to hear. Offering a TikTok station might make selling them a satellite radio subscription slightly easier — or if nothing else, it’ll make driving around in their parents’ car more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Metro Exodus on PC adds support for PS5 controller’s amazing adaptive triggers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="DualSense" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qwrXsQ02WIelATSSt5VeSOv--dU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69333123/vpavic_4261_20201023_0028.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="btApyF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt; has become one of the first PC games to support the PS5 DualSense controller’s haptic feedback and adaptive triggers thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.metrothegame.com/news/patch-notes-pc-hotfix/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20added%20playstation%205%20dualsense%20controller%20support"&gt;a recent patch&lt;/a&gt;. Although many PC games already support the PS5 controller’s basic features, with Valve adding support for it to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591013/steam-input-api-ps5-dualsense-controller-support"&gt;Steam Input API last year&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt; now supports its advanced haptics, as well as its trigger features, which add extra resistance depending on what you’re doing in-game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwylhA"&gt;Videos posted by Twitter user &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mrdomino_/status/1395878817441271810"&gt;@mrdomino_&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndyPlaytonic/status/1396112580511518729"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VGC&lt;/em&gt;’s Andy Robinson&lt;/a&gt; show the feature in action, including showing the controller’s right trigger springing back with the recoil from various weapons. It’s nothing new compared to what we’ve seen from native PS5 games like &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;, but it’s great to see that same functionality replicated on PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W6Z4e9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;PS5’s DualSense is now fully functional on PC, via Metro Exodus’ latest update. &lt;a href="https://t.co/97yVVYYIJy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/97yVVYYIJy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Andy Robinson (@AndyPlaytonic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndyPlaytonic/status/1396112580511518729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="poJ3Zo"&gt;The patch means &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt;’s full support for the controller has actually arrived on PC before the PS5 itself. The official PS5 version of the game isn’t due to release &lt;a href="https://www.metrothegame.com/news/metro-exodus-gen-9-coming-june-18/"&gt;until June 18th&lt;/a&gt;, when it will include full support for the controller’s haptic features alongside other features like ray tracing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8c5sH"&gt;There appears to be a couple of downsides for PC players, however, with &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metro-exodus-is-the-first-pc-game-to-utilise-ps5s-dualsense-features/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VGC&lt;/em&gt; reporting&lt;/a&gt; that the advanced DualSense features only seem to work over a wired connection, and not wirelessly. &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/metro-exodus-dualsense-support-on-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; also reports&lt;/a&gt; that the feature is exclusive to the Steam version of the game, and won’t work on purchases from the Epic Games Store or GOG. We’ve followed up with the game’s publisher for confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQZbLl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fypg5K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford’s F-150 Lightning Pro is an electric pickup truck for businesses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1H4toINMEmiyi9YQDF88Ex6kbkk=/188x0:2213x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69332936/ford_f150_lightning_pro_0025.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G07eZ3"&gt;Ford has revealed a version of its new F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck aimed specifically at commercial customers. It’s called the F-150 Lightning Pro, and it starts at $39,974 for a version with an estimated 230 miles of range. Extended-range versions of the truck, which are expected to get 300 miles on a full battery, will start at $49,974.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2DCql"&gt;Much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;the retail version of the electric F-150&lt;/a&gt;, the Lightning Pro stands to win Ford a lot of business as long as the company executes well when the truck starts shipping in 2022. Fleets all over the country are already considering a switch to electric vehicles, either to get ahead of zero-emission guidelines at the state or federal level, or in an attempt to take advantage of what should be a lower total cost of ownership with electric vehicles. Ford claims the Lightning Pro could cut maintenance costs up to 40 percent over eight years and 100,000 miles of use compared to a 2.7L EcoBoost F-150.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CeaYJF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The F-150 Lightning Pro is one of the only electric trucks aimed at commercial customers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdpcPD"&gt;Multiple electric pickups are coming to market over the next year or two, including Tesla’s Cybertruck, the GMC Hummer EV, and the Rivian R1T. But almost none are geared specifically towards commercial fleets. One of the only examples is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302966/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-truck-ev-endurance-unveiling-pence"&gt;electric pickup truck being developed by Ohio startup Lordstown Motors&lt;/a&gt;. That truck is supposed to go into production later this year, but it will start at around $52,000, and the company doesn’t have anywhere near the track record of an established automaker like Ford. Paired with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21559954/ford-e-transit-electric-delivery-cargo-van-price-specs-range"&gt;the E-Transit van&lt;/a&gt;, the Lightning Pro gives Ford a potent one-two punch in the fight to electrify the commercial market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N987VR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10515280"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IIwun5"&gt;There aren’t a lot of obvious differences between the Lightning Pro and the retail versions of the electric F-150 that Ford revealed last week. Like the retail version, it only comes in a four-door SuperCrew cab and 5.5-foot bed configuration. Buyers can choose to equip the Lightning Pro with the standard or extended range battery. The standard range version will have a max 7,700-pound towing capacity when equipped with the optional towing package, while the extended range can pull up to 10,000 pounds. Both versions use a dual-motor, all-wheel drive setup, with the standard range truck maxing out at an estimated 426 horsepower, while the extended range version can make around 563HP.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="k1gzl6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ford F-150 Lightning revealed: an electric truck for the masses","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uH8g3T"&gt;Both Lightning Pro trucks have onboard power available, which can run electric tools or other accessories, though buyers will have to pay more for extra outlets (including a 240 volt plug in the bed) and higher total output. The extended range option also comes with an 80-amp charging station that can pretty much help refill a truck’s battery overnight. All versions of the commercial truck come with the massive, water-resistant front trunk, which has 14.1 cubic feet of storage and its own set of electrical outlets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTLb9C"&gt;There is one big difference between the commercial and retail versions, though: the Lightning Pro will come with Ford’s commercial telematics software, which makes it easier for fleet owners to keep tabs on the location, charging status, or health of their vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGkjC2"&gt;“It’s actually complimentary for customers, and it gives insights such as: what’s your odometer [at]? What warning lights and diagnostic trouble codes are there? And we’re going so far as to provide preventative and proactive prognostics,” says Alex Purdy, the head of connectivity on Ford’s business operations side. Purdy says Ford even offers a data service that works with any other third-party fleet telematics software businesses might already have up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="INPO5D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“there are unique challenges”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qivY2n"&gt;Ford’s fleet software will also help operators tackle some of the more unconventional issues that might crop up as they switch to electric vehicles. For instance, some workers take their fleet vehicles home at night, fill up the gas tank on their own, and get reimbursed by their employer. Ford could help install home chargers for those workers, Purdy says, but the company has also written into the fleet software a way to let employers reimburse workers for the cost of at-home charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kq2Cs"&gt;“These are the kinds of things that make Ford different,” Purdy says. “We say that we know how people use their vehicles, and it feels like a hollow thing — it’s not actually hollow in this case at all, because there are unique challenges with making an electric vehicle, relevant, useful, and adoptable by commercial customers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces bigger and smaller versions of its TV-like Smart Monitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jdq5m-75yjM2IaLkZaAyndfnnac=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69332653/Smart_Monitor_PR_main1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vLuDrb"&gt;Samsung’s Smart Monitor range is expanding. The company’s line of Tizen-powered smart computer displays &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expands-smart-monitor-lineup-worldwide-to-meet-growing-demand-of-do-it-all-displays"&gt;now includes&lt;/a&gt; a 43-inch 4K M7 model as well as a 24-inch 1080p M5, marking the biggest and smallest Smart Monitors to be made available to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egIBP3"&gt;Samsung introduced the Smart Monitor last year and describes it as a “do-it-all” display designed for both work and entertainment. The screens have built-in speakers and smart TV functionality through Samsung’s Tizen platform, meaning you can run video apps like Netflix directly on the device, as well as remote desktop access and productivity software like Office 365. The Smart Monitors have a remote control that works with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Bixby, and there’s also wireless support for DeX, Samsung’s desktop-style environment that runs on Galaxy smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MCpkG2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung’s new Smart Monitor is like a TV for your PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/15/21562738/samsung-smart-monitor-m5-m7-tizen-smart-tv-airplay-2-usb-c-release-date-price-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JATagp"&gt;The M7 series now includes 43-inch and 32-inch 4K options. The M5 series uses 1080p panels and comes in 24-inch, 27-inch, and 32-inch sizes. Samsung is also introducing a white version of the 27-inch and 32-inch M5 Smart Monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXji3o"&gt;Samsung hasn’t announced pricing yet for the new models, but for context, the 32-inch M7 was released at $399.99 while the 27-inch M5 was $229.99, so you can probably expect prices slightly above and below those two extremes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook reportedly hit with campaign by pro-Palestinian activists leaving 1-star app store ratings</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Iny5gO"&gt;A social media campaign by pro-Palestine activists has pushed down the ranking for Facebook’s app in Apple and Google’s app stores, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/pro-palestinian-activists-target-facebook-1-star-app-store-reviews-n1268258"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The activists are seeking to protest Facebook’s alleged censorship of Palestinian accounts on its platform, and are instructing people to leave Facebook’s app a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Skkyy__/status/1394588317900025858"&gt;one-star review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50MaNh"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;NBC New&lt;/em&gt;s, Facebook is treating the situation as a high-priority issue internally; one software engineer wrote in a post on an internal Facebook message board that “users are upset with our handling of the situation,” adding that the users “have started protesting by leaving 1-star reviews.”  Facebook has reached out to have the reviews removed, but so far, Apple has declined the request to remove the reviews. It’s not clear how or if Google responded to the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRbdQF"&gt;The rating for Facebook’s iOS app on the App Store as of Sunday afternoon was 2.3 stars out of 5, with 1-star ratings far outpacing others. In the Google Play store the situation was similar; the Android Facebook app had a slightly higher 2.4 rating, with the majority of the reviews 1-star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvjnPi"&gt;Apple and Google did not immediately reply to requests for comment Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4ezoe"&gt;Facebook did not reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but a spokesperson said in a statement to&lt;em&gt; NBC&lt;/em&gt; that the company does not censor it users, but applies its policies equally “regardless of who is posting or their personal beliefs.” The spokesperson added that the company has a dedicated team that includes Arabic and Hebrew speakers who are “closely monitoring the situation on the ground, who are focused on making sure we’re removing harmful content, while addressing any enforcement errors as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrUndz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Trese, Respect, Friends: The Reunion, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZoVXqVZmNzNXdvoIg5FHZ8sfhvs=/0x4:1358x909/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69331064/trese.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trese&lt;/em&gt; comes to Netflix in June | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUy0RgeggCQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=NetflixPhilippines" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Q7QtV"&gt;Still reeling from that shocking ending to last week’s &lt;em&gt;Mare of Easttown&lt;/em&gt;? Me too! I have literally no idea what to expect in tonight’s episode or from next week’s finale. I can’t say the same for &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead,&lt;/em&gt; a movie I really, really wanted to like but which felt really predictable. I found myself wishing the entire movie could have been as wild as its opening credits. &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; looks spectacular (except perhaps for the digitally-added Tig Notaro character), but could have done away with a few of the rag-tag mercenary characters and tightened things up a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e9QyiE"&gt;Here are this week’s trailers: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R8iD42"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jUy0RgeggCQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lCpj1c"&gt;Trese&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pRJFzO"&gt;This long-awaited adaptation of the award-winning Filipino comic of the same name, &lt;em&gt;Trese&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a woman who protects Manila from monsters that are based on Filipino mythology. In the English-language version, Shay Mitchell stars as Trese (Liza Soberano voices her in the Filipino-language version), along with Griffin Puatu, Manny Jacinto, Lou Diamond Phillips, and Dante Basco. &lt;em&gt;Trese &lt;/em&gt;comes to Netflix in the US on June 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SJgHCs"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qTtxoz3OIlU?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=3&amp;amp;start=3" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AI3VjS"&gt;Respect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sAtLhj"&gt;Jennifer Hudson stars in this biopic of the late Aretha Franklin and looks at the Queen of Soul’s early years as her star was on the rise. Naturally, it looks and sounds amazing. Forest Whitaker and Audra McDonald also star in &lt;em&gt;Respect&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ThBOqg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUpFzScK7P8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nGO7t9"&gt;The Mysterious Benedict Society &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7XYxKb"&gt;Four gifted orphans are recruited for a secret mission by Mr. Benedict to figure out what’s behind the mysterious LIVE Institute. This series is based on the book series by Trenton Lee Stewart, with Tony Hale starring as Benedict and his shady twin brother Mr. Curtain. Kristen Schaal also stars in &lt;em&gt;The Mysterious Benedict Society&lt;/em&gt;, which premieres on Disney Plus June 25th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3yY1jJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRXVQ77ehRQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YwwePC"&gt;Friends: The Reunion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cGv7eG"&gt;This trailer does not make me want to watch this reunion, but I was already leaning in that direction anyway.&lt;em&gt; Friends &lt;/em&gt;was, of course, wildly popular in its decade-long run on network television, and is a popular show on streaming as well. But I’m far from the first person to point out that this is not a show that aged well— in addition to the conspicuous lack of non-white characters throughout most of the show’s run, it had &lt;a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/09/04/fat-monica-friends-25-years-later/"&gt;ongoing fatphobic storylines&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.out.com/television/2019/10/01/heres-your-reminder-friends-was-really-really-homophobic"&gt;homophobic&lt;/a&gt; jokes and storylines as well (and also for the love of god, who cares whether you were “on a break,” Ross: you were in the wrong, the end). If the reunion would deal with and discuss some of &lt;em&gt;Friends’ &lt;/em&gt;more problematic elements, that might be interesting to watch. But the trailer makes no indication this will be the case;  rather it looks like it will include a lot of obsequious questions for the cast members from James Corden (?). The &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; reunion comes to HBO Max on May 27th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SXBY5i"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zG9RuJb3QU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MzKv8c"&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aDonQ"&gt;We got a glimpse of this movie with a teaser a couple of weeks ago but this is the first full-length trailer for &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt;, a post-apocalyptic fairytale based on a DC comic, with a hybrid deer-boy seeking answers about other hybrid children like him. I’m into it. &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; comes to Netflix June 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The needless drama of buying a PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-SKPnBNhfD9hT9qezauEBfTzDeo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69330601/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="STXeel"&gt;Securing a PS5 is not easy, and it feels like it could be. With a combination of greed and incompetence, the stores selling PS5s in the United States have transformed the process into a weirdly dramatic affair where you’re forced to join Discords and follow overly exuberant guys on Twitter in the hopes that they’ll give you a heads-up on a PS5 “drop” — a store making a big shipment of PS5s available for purchase. These stores have turned every drop into an event, when really, buying a PS5 should be as easy as buying a pepper grinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAccHq"&gt;The other day, a package was sitting in the vestibule of my apartment building. I noticed my name on the label and mentally cataloged any recent purchases I may have made or packages someone mentioned sending. This didn’t match anything I was expecting, and I brought it upstairs, carefully opened the box... and found &lt;a href="https://mannkitchen.com/blogs/blog/what-makes-the-worlds-best-pepper-mill-the-worlds-best-pepper-mill"&gt;the pepper grinder I’d Kickstarted back in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. It began shipping months before, and my name had finally popped to the top of the queue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oTS7ZT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I have gotten extremely good at Recaptcha&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4CBFt"&gt;Buying a PS5 feels like trying to enter a supremely pricey raffle, securing a COVID vaccine slot in March 2021, or getting tickets to a &lt;em&gt;Serenity&lt;/em&gt; preview in 2005 before we knew Joss Whedon was an awful human and Browncoats were insufferable. Every time a PS5 “drop” is imminent, my blood pressure rises to the occasion, trying to prepare me for a Sisyphean “Add to Cart — slog through a Recaptcha — watch the PS5 leave my cart” process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4BDr1"&gt;Again and again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvVzOT"&gt;I have gotten extremely good at Recaptcha. (I only learned Thursday that my ad-blocker may be responsible for my prolonged experience with Recaptcha and that I should white list any site I’m trying to buy a PS5 from.) I can spot the smudgiest bus and the most hidden car with ease. I can now safely tell you that it’s okay to not click on the one tiny bit of the bicycle in a lonely square but to not ignore things that look like a crosswalk but aren’t because Recaptcha’s database is different from the database you call a brain and cares not for logic but only for your furious clicks of things it approximates are other things. Recaptcha was created to teach computers to see, and I am confident that when a nuclear murder robot one day tracks me down in the midst of a crowd to forcefully shuffle off my mortal coil, I will have trained the damn thing with Recaptcha clicks to buy a PS5 that I still do not own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJbeO0"&gt;I didn’t take part in the initial rush to buy Sony’s next-generation console. I already had an Xbox Series X and told myself I’d get a PS5 when the furor had died down and an exclusive I was interested in was closer to launching. I’m old enough now that lining up for hours outside Walmart or Best Buy has lost any romance it once had. I like to think I am an adult and can patiently wait to buy the thing when it does not involve Black Friday rushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mthcuh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A whole weird sub-economy has sprung up around the PS5&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uOnzvu"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&lt;/em&gt; is out in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5la9WX"&gt;Six months in, the furor to buy a PS5 has not died down. Thanks to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;semiconductor shortage&lt;/a&gt; affecting everything from laptops to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423479/semiconductor-shortage-new-car-truck-prices-sales"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt;, the PS5 supply has not been able to meet demand. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428322/sony-ps5-supply-constraints-2022-hiroki-totoki"&gt;Sony admitted the delay would last well into 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nAovp"&gt;If a PS5 were like my pepper grinder, video game preorders at GameStop, or most things at mom-and-pop stores, then I would simply put my name on a list at a retailer, put some money down, and patiently wait for my name to appear in the queue and then the PS5 on my doorstep. But that isn’t what has happened. Instead, a whole weird sub-economy has sprung up around the PS5 and other products affected by the semiconductor shortage, like the Xbox Series X, AMD’s entire new lineup of GPUs and CPUs, and Nvidia’s newest GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nW0GGV"&gt;Sites, including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, have gotten very good at pointing readers to restocks that become obsolete minutes after the drops go live. Personalities on Twitter have developed whole brands around restocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EU1Cal"&gt;Retailers have put labyrinthine mechanisms in place in an attempt to discourage scalpers who resell the products for hundreds more. In practice, scalpers still seem to have no issue stocking up, while typical consumers are left feeling like they’ve entered a lottery and the prize is spending hundreds of dollars. Enterprising programmers have attempted to halt scalpers in other ways, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-nvidia-rtx-3080-ebay-debacle-exposed-a-scalper-bot-1845133050"&gt;such as overbidding on products on eBay&lt;/a&gt;, but for the most part, people are in a race with other people who just want to try out &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; and a guy who wants to try to sell a PS5 for $500 more on eBay or StockX. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yq0rLy"&gt;NewEgg’s solution has been to transform buying a PS5 into an actual raffle. Newegg periodically announces free drawings. The prize? You get to buy a PS5! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="In8PIq"&gt;Best Buy and Target’s apparent method to halt scalpers is to force you to wait between the first and second click to add the item to your cart and then require you to pick up the PS5 in person. Given I live in New York City, where one walks everywhere, I have been okay with losing out on these PS5s, as I assume it also means missing out on being robbed as walk home with a giant PS5 box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="l7aZYm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Retailers have put labyrinthine mechanisms in place in an attempt to discourage scalpers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="36VZqa"&gt;Walmart and GameStop both ship you the actual device. That’s perfect! However, both are inconsistent with drops, and GameStop forces you to pad your purchase with gift certificates and games you probably don’t want. Worse, neither company has updated its website since, I think, HTML became the primary language of websites. After many Recaptchas, I got a PS5 into my cart at both stores, only to lose them when the checkout process ground to a crawl.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dr1var"&gt;Sony will sell you a PS5 directly but uses a randomized queue similar to the one San Diego Comic-Con relies on to book hotels. You can use as many computers as you like to sit in the queue (and you will be forced into a few Recaptcha processes along the way). But unlike the others, if you get in, you actually get in. No elation over getting a PS5 in your cart only to experience the extremely stupid but very real annoyance of losing it because they’re sold out in your area or the Waltons’ billion-dollar empire can’t handle a few thousand people trying to check out at once. You’re in. You get a PS5. You have to pay shipping because Sony only offers free shipping on purchases over $510. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpmxYU"&gt;And this awful and overly dramatic way of doing business isn’t going away anytime soon. The semiconductor shortage means there will be plenty of must-buy gadgets in short supply and the companies with barely functional webpages have feverish consumers in need of the next new thing over a barrel. They can make us jump through hoops just for the chance — the mere chance — of buying something because they have the supply and we all have the demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aw2G3X"&gt;My PS5 apparently ships from Sony next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P28pPw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G UW review: extreme durability for an extreme price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A pricey phone built to withstand the elements&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="RqQfv2"&gt;The Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G is a rugged phone that doesn’t require you to give up too many modern conveniences to gain the benefits of extreme durability. It’s common for rugged phones to feature older processors and lack modern features — these phones often have specialized uses, like barcode scanning or taking payments, and more or less just need to keep working in harsh environments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgtCHM"&gt;The DuraForce Ultra 5G includes both the durability of a rugged phone and modern features like 5G, wireless charging, a high-quality processor, and dual rear cameras. At $899, it’s an expensive phone — you can buy a very nice non-rugged phone for that much — but if durability is a must and you don’t want to sacrifice performance or convenient features, the DuraForce 5G is (quite literally) a solid choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EUeitz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10511069"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LCwS5H0Rr6eSgsG4CWaocFtUhG8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526443/ajohnson_20210514_4587_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W7VFuv"&gt;Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G rugged features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bgM0jd"&gt;Pick up the DuraForce Ultra 5G and you’ll know right away that you have a rugged device in your hands. The top and bottom of the phone are wrapped in thick plastic bumpers, the sides feature a texturized finish, and at 278g (9.8oz) it’s much heavier than your standard smartphone. The screen itself isn’t very big — just a 5.45-inch 1080p LCD panel — but the sizable bezels and thick chin make it a chunky device overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdguzi"&gt;Despite its dimensions it’s actually easy to use one-handed, since the screen itself is relatively small. The phone will fit in a jacket pocket, but it’s too bulky for any of my jeans pockets. Haptics are aggressive, even at the “medium” default setting, which is a good thing in a phone you might be using with gloves. Otherwise, you can turn touch vibrations down to low or off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKFwdX"&gt;The phone is both IP65 and IP68 rated, meaning there’s generous protection against water intrusion both from jets and immersion (up to 6.5 feet for up to 30 minutes). The DuraForce Ultra 5G meets the Military Standard 810H specifications and includes protection against vibration, blowing dust and sand, extreme temperatures, drops from five feet onto concrete, high altitudes, and plenty of other hostile conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6wpa1D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Aside from some minor scuffs acquired in the driveway test, the DuraForce Ultra 5G merely shrugged at my efforts and kept on working just fine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hJWRm2"&gt;I couldn’t test it against all of those conditions, but I did subject the phone to plenty of abuse including an hourlong stay in the freezer, water immersion for 30 minutes in the kitchen sink, exposure to sand, and a drop from about five feet onto driveway asphalt. Aside from some minor scuffs acquired in the driveway test, the DuraForce Ultra 5G merely shrugged at my efforts and kept on working just fine. Kyocera does include a two-year warranty with purchase, so as long as you use the phone within the conditions it’s rated to withstand, you shouldn’t be putting your purchase at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpGg8x"&gt;In addition to rugged features, the DuraForce Ultra 5G is just loaded with buttons. There’s a power button with embedded fingerprint sensor, three programmable keys, and a large volume rocker that’s easy to press with gloves on. I frequently pressed one of the programmable buttons accidentally when I grabbed the phone — they’re in easy reach when you’re using the phone, but that unfortunately means a lot of unintentional presses, too. These buttons do require a long press to bring up whatever shortcut function you’ve assigned to them, so a brief press won’t do anything. You can also assign any of them to “do nothing” when pressed if you’d rather not use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FLffBgLPWI_Llf-npqmIGqOt0UY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526445/ajohnson_20210514_4587_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GXpg0z"&gt;Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G screen, performance, and battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="E8kAww"&gt;Aside from the obvious difference in appearance and ergonomics, the DuraForce Ultra 5G handles pretty much the way any other Android device does. The screen looks a little low on contrast in comparison to your standard display — likely because the panel is optimized for viewability in bright sunlight. That’s probably more important to the phone’s target user than a rich multimedia viewing experience, and the panel is indeed usable even in very bright direct light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sccb8"&gt;The screen’s protective “Sapphire Shield” remained free of scratches during my testing, but it does pick up reflections easily outside, more so than other phones with Gorilla Glass. It wasn’t enough to bother me, but someone planning to use the phone outside in bright light often might find it distracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l13Zen"&gt;The DuraForce Ultra 5G ships with Android 10; Kyocera says it will provide an update to 11, but that the timeframe is still being determined. Android 10 is fine for now, but given that Google is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;readying Android 12 for the public&lt;/a&gt;, it’s definitely a step behind. Kyocera says it will provide a minimum of two years of security updates, which is a common if not terribly generous policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EKwQAE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This model works with both widely available sub-6GHz frequencies and hard-to-find but much faster mmWave spectrum&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HPDPTP"&gt;The DuraForce Ultra 5G uses a Snapdragon 765G processor with 6GB RAM, which puts overall performance on par with a midrange phone. There’s some slight stuttering when scrolling quickly through screens with lots of images and video, and a noticeable pause after taking a photo in the camera app, but other than that it keeps up well — especially considering the lower performance bar in the rugged class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mjmbC"&gt;There’s a 4,500mAh battery built into the DuraForce Ultra 5G. It’s a comparatively large battery for the class, and it got me through a full day of moderate to heavy use. The phone supports Qi wireless charging, which is uncommon among rugged phones. The phone was a little finicky on my stand-style Belkin wireless charger, but it eventually worked when set on the charger in landscape orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrNjuL"&gt;And of course, there’s one of the DuraForce Ultra 5G’s namesake features: 5G. This model works with both widely available sub-6GHz frequencies and hard-to-find but much faster mmWave spectrum (also called Ultra Wideband by Verizon, hence the UW in the phone’s name). It’s only sold through Verizon in the US, which makes sense: the company has been pushing mmWave much harder than the other major carriers and does offer more coverage, though it’s still relatively scarce. Verizon’s 5G network is kind of lackluster overall at this point, though it will improve over the next couple of years. It’s a good feature to have on a phone you’re going to hang onto for a while, but definitely don’t buy this (or any phone, really) just for mmWave since you’ll probably have a hard time finding a signal anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9K8_BvBox1IIgUPqGHpe6gIS1iE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526441/ajohnson_20210514_4587_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SstD0A"&gt;Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nEfbUr"&gt;The DuraForce Ultra’s rear camera array consists of a 24-megapixel f/1.8 standard wide and a 16-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide, plus a time-of-flight sensor. Around front, there’s an 8-megapixel f/2.0 selfie camera. That’s a cut above what’s offered on many rugged phones. Picture-taking likely isn’t a high priority for prospective DuraForce Ultra owners, and image quality is certainly not up to what you’d find on conventional $900 phones, but it does the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SUrxOC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10511127"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HkQEvB"&gt;Photos in good light look fine, if a bit on the low-contrast, washed-out side. Exposure and color can shift noticeably between two images taken with the same camera at slightly different angles, and I noticed some odd misses here and there, like a blurry shot of a static subject where it looked like the camera had tried to apply too much HDR. But most of the time in bright light, photos are perfectly fine, and a cut above what I’d expect from a rugged phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPE5GH"&gt;There’s also a mode that will overlay live information on your still image or video about whatever extreme situation you happen to be in, including location, altitude, speed, and G-force. Extreme activities are generally not recommended in your second trimester of pregnancy, so I didn’t really test this out. I imagine if you’re into something like mountain biking or climbing and you want to record that kind of information with your activity, you probably have a better way of doing so already. In any case, it’s there, and it’s definitely more of a casual, fun feature than it is practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RdoMQqBzgM7hSRn2TD79gBmGDB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526440/ajohnson_20210514_4587_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="lwm3nQ"&gt;If you’re merely curious about living a rugged phone lifestyle, the DuraForce Ultra 5G isn’t for you. The phone’s extremely hardy specifications would be appealing to anyone who’s nervous about dropping their phone or occasionally brings their phone to rough environments like beaches or backcountry camping. If that’s you, spend your $900 on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"&gt;good standard phone&lt;/a&gt; (many are IP68 rated) and a rugged case. You’ll get better performance, a better camera, timelier software updates — basically, a lot more for the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uGUklv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The inclusion of 5G, wireless charging, and processing power that’s a cut above the rest of the class makes it a good tool on and off the job site&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jansg3"&gt;If you need a rugged phone on the job as a frontline worker, first responder, or construction worker, for example, then the DuraForce Ultra 5G makes a lot more sense — especially if it’s going to be your primary phone off the job and you’d really like some extra bells and whistles. The inclusion of 5G, wireless charging, and processing power that’s a cut above the rest of the class makes it a good tool on and off the job site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gd8RS"&gt;However, $900 is an awful lot to spend on a phone, and I think that very specific kind of customer for this phone is a pretty small group. You could buy a less expensive rugged phone with more limited functionality like &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/kyocera-duraforce-pro-2/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kyocera’s own DuraForce model from last year&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;darn good midrange phone&lt;/a&gt; for around the same price. You probably can’t get mmWave 5G that way, but that’s no great loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Z3Jnx3"&gt;Still, the DuraForce Ultra 5G represents a convenient option for a particular type of person if two phones feels like too much fuss. It certainly handled everything I threw it at, and functioned well as a daily companion for more pedestrian tasks like scrolling social media and navigating trips across town. If extreme durability is a must and you don’t want to give up too much to get it, then the DuraForce Ultra 5G is a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>India reportedly orders social media platforms to remove references to “Indian variant” of COVID-19</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5BMn9lPARBgY5gDIk6xrT_r6ck8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69330457/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K1T2Ap"&gt;India’s government has sent notices to social media platforms ordering them to take down content that refers to an “Indian variant” of the COVID-19 virus, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/india-asks-social-media-firms-remove-reference-indian-variant-coronavirus-2021-05-21/"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; reported. The letter from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology sent Friday was not made public, but was viewed by several news outlets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRXYW2"&gt;It was not clear which social media outlets received the letter, but India’s government has recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;ordered Twitter to remove tweets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/27/991343032/indias-government-is-telling-facebook-twitter-to-remove-critical-posts"&gt;Facebook and Instagram to take down posts&lt;/a&gt; that were critical of its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SBhjF"&gt;“There is no such variant of COVID-19 scientifically cited as such by the World Health Organisation (WHO). WHO has not associated the term ‘Indian Variant’ with the B.1.617 variant of the coronavirus in any of its reports,” the letter states, adding that the phrase is “completely FALSE.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yd9Blk"&gt;A variant of the coronavirus first detected in India last year, B.1.617 is believed responsible for the latest wave of COVID-19 cases in south Asia. &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/who-classifies-b1617-variant-first-identified-in-india-as-global-variant-of-concern-1.6020830"&gt;The World Health Organization has classified it&lt;/a&gt; as a variant of global concern, with some evidence that it is more contagious than other strains of the virus.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exJGOr"&gt;But while India’s approach to censoring information about the coronavirus and variants is extreme, WHO and other health organizations and scientists are critical of the practice of referring to viruses and variants with geographic nicknames, since it can be stigmatizing and inaccurate. The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/08-05-2015-who-issues-best-practices-for-naming-new-human-infectious-diseases"&gt;WHO’s 2015 guidance&lt;/a&gt; for naming infectious diseases discourages using place names, human names, or animal species names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0zRVZ"&gt;However, as &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/how-virus-variants-get-their-confusing-names-and-how-to-make-them-better"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt; notes in its very good explainer&lt;/a&gt; about how virus variants get their names, the current naming conventions are cumbersome and confusing, making them difficult for non-scientists to grasp or remember. &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt; reports that WHO is working with virologists to create a new way of naming viruses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJHeno"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
