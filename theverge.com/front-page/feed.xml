    <title>Razer’s Barracuda X wireless headset plays nicely with PS5, Switch, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Barracuda X" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zuJzYOyFZTw0ebqvnKp2dp7Jdi0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69575639/cfaulkner_210705_4660_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Barracuda X borrows the sleek design of Razer’s Opus headphones.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9cBpNd"&gt;Razer has introduced the Barracuda X, a multiplatform wireless gaming headset that takes design cues from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262459/razer-opus-review-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones-thx-over-ear-price-specs"&gt;the company’s Opus noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;. They’re launching today for $99.99, which is more aggressive than I expected, given that the company usually comes in at a premium price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKOmKi"&gt;The Barracuda X is a big step for Razer in that it’s finally jumping into USB-C connectivity — both in terms of how the headset charges and how it transmits audio wirelessly. Included in the box is a small USB-C wireless transmitter that’s almost identical to the one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20836987/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-usb-c-nintendo-switch-gaming"&gt;SteelSeries has included with some of its headsets since 2019&lt;/a&gt;. It allows compatibility with the Nintendo Switch in portable mode, the PS5’s front-facing USB-C port, and some phones and tablets directly through their USB-C ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LGT7f"&gt;Razer includes a five-foot USB-A cable with a USB-C female end that the transmitter can plug into for devices that don’t have a USB-C port, like a PC, PS4, or the Switch’s dock. It can also serve as an extender if there’s some interference between the headset and your USB-C port. None of this is cutting-edge in the headset world at this point, but it’s a broad amount of compatibility for $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60JUcI"&gt;The headset also works wired, and includes a 3.5mm cable. The headset isn’t compatible with Xbox consoles due to the fact that they operate on Microsoft’s own wireless protocol, which is unsupported. This is disappointing, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21502286/steelseries-arctis-7p-7x-xbox-series-x-s-ps5-usbc-wireless-gaming-headset"&gt;SteelSeries’ Arctis 7X&lt;/a&gt; includes a similar dongle with a toggle switch to work on Xbox and other platforms. Razer will likely get there at some point, but not today. You can plug the Barracuda X audio cable into your Xbox controller’s 3.5mm jack. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C transmitter is relatively low-profile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1CmULe"&gt;This product is the first in the line of Barracuda headsets, and it’s setting a strong precedent  for future iterations. The style of the Barracuda X is a far cry from the likes of the Kraken and the BlackShark V2, looking more like headphones than a gaming headset. Razer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was aiming for a design that appears platform-agnostic, so as to indicate to people that this is a headset that’s likely made for your preferred platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E8A2bm"&gt;The Barracuda X weighs 250 grams, and Razer says this is its lightest wireless headset yet. After wearing it for about a week, I can vouch that it’s comfortable to wear after several hours of use. The ear pads are soft and breathable, yet dense enough to create some passable noise isolation. The cups themselves can swivel 90 degrees, which is handy for slimming their profile for storage in a bag. But that swivel feature works backwards when you’re wearing them. For some reason, Razer engineered them to swivel in the opposite direction than I prefer, resting the hard side of the cups against your chest instead of the soft ear cups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Barracuda X" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zsqmrV-GjuLLdWiRutAdW4aO0gM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22703918/cfaulkner_210705_4660_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The mic and all the controls are placed along the edge of the left ear cup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4WUFiL"&gt;In terms of performance, these sound great for a $100 headset. These employ the same “TriForce” driver design &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345836/razer-blackshark-v2-x-budget-friendly-wired-gaming-headsets"&gt;originally found in the BlackShark V2 headset&lt;/a&gt;, with three distinct sections for delivering bass, mids, and treble. Though, the drivers are a bit smaller in the Barracuda X: 40mm compared to 50mm in the BlackShark V2 series. I still need to test them a bit more to give a verdict, but &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; on PS5 rivaled Sony’s Pulse 3D Audio headset — both in terms of sound quality and positional audio capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsjXgK"&gt;Other hardware features to note include a detachable boom microphone (which doesn’t support mic monitoring, unfortunately), and its on-headset controls are all located along the edge of the left ear cup. There’s a mute button, a volume wheel, and a power button, which can serve as a multifunction button when connected to some devices. Tapping it once while connected to my Android phone paused music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOUxYY"&gt;One thing to note is that it’s possible Razer may release a more fully-featured version of the Barracuda. Historically, products with an “X” in the name tend to be the low to mid-end offering, and usually a “Pro” model follows after a few months. It’s tough to say what a Barracuda Pro (if that’s what it’d be named) would offer over this version announced today, but features like Bluetooth, an extra dial for game and chat audio mixing, mic monitoring support, or Xbox wireless compatibility are just a few that are on the table. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Machine learning model from the largest US COVID-19 dataset predicts disease severity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RwWxaKeng6za8B_d0QYnCWxcwkM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69575644/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1eMdQ9"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522863/health-data-records-covid-coronavirus-model-nih-privacy-n3c"&gt;centralized repository of COVID-19 health records&lt;/a&gt; built last year is beginning to show results, starting with a &lt;a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.16901?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=071321"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published today. The repository is the largest set of COVID-19 records to date, and was built by a team of researchers and data experts last year to help make sense of COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RCAq3"&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, looked at risk factors for severe cases of COVID-19 and traced the progression of the disease over time. The authors&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;built machine learning models to predict which hospitalized patients would develop severe disease based on information collected on their first day in a hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCS2UP"&gt;Using the centralized database, called the National COVID Cohort Collaborative Data Enclave, or &lt;a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/n3c"&gt;N3C&lt;/a&gt;, meant the research team was able to include hundreds of thousands of patients’ records in its analysis. The study used data from 34 medical centers and included over 1 million adults — 174,568 who tested positive for COVID-19 and 1,133,848 who tested negative. It includes records stretching from January 2020 to December 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00yL1U"&gt;The analysis shows how treatment for COVID-19 changed over the course of 2020, as doctors tried new treatments and gained more experience with the condition. The percentage of patients who were treated with the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which was promoted by former President Donald Trump before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21291694/fda-hydroxychloroquine-emergency-authorization-trump-barda"&gt;proving to be ineffective&lt;/a&gt;, dropped off to nearly zero by May 2020. Use of the steroid dexamethasone ticked up in June, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292765/steroid-coronavirus-survival-data-results-dexamethasone-oxford"&gt;studies showed&lt;/a&gt; it could improve survival rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JNxWq"&gt;It also confirmed that survival rates for patients with COVID-19 improved over the course of 2020. In March and April, 16 percent of people admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 died. In September and October, that dropped to just under 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsKwQH"&gt;People who had higher heart rates, breathing rates, and temperatures when they arrived at the hospital were more likely to need drastic interventions like ventilation. They were also more likely to die. Abnormal white blood cell count, inflammation, blood acidity, and kidney function were also linked to more severe cases. The research team built machine learning models using those and other data points that could predict which patients would get seriously ill. The models could eventually be used as the basis for decision-making tools with additional testing, the authors wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNzShh"&gt;Researchers have been analyzing the trajectory of COVID-19 since the very start of the pandemic. This study has the advantage of pulling from a large and diverse dataset — it’s not restricted to one hospital or one state. In the US, researchers are often limited to studying the medical records from patients at the institutions where they work. That means the number of records they’re able to include in studies can be limited, and they’re not able to easily check if their conclusions would apply in other places. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0m1Xss"&gt;A resource like N3C, which pulls together records from dozens of institutions, sidesteps those limitations. By now, N3C includes data from &lt;a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/news/releases/2020/access-to-N3C-COVID-19-data-analytics-platform-now-open"&gt;73 health institutions&lt;/a&gt; and has records from over 2 million COVID-19 patients. More than &lt;a href="https://covid.cd2h.org/projects"&gt;200 research projects&lt;/a&gt; using the data are underway, including studies examining risk factors for COVID-19 re-infection and the disease’s impact on pregnancy. It’s not perfect — standardizing information across hospitals is hard, and there may not be complete data on many patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C90pPt"&gt;Still, having such a large set of data is invaluable. Researchers are using the resource to run studies that they may not have been able to tackle with just their own institution’s resources, Elaine Hill, a health economist at the University of Rochester working on pregnancy research, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522863/health-data-records-covid-coronavirus-model-nih-privacy-n3c"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last fall&lt;/a&gt;. “It makes it possible to shed light on things we wouldn’t be able to,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s PS5 exclusive Ghostwire: Tokyo is delayed until 2022</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tango Gameworks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZTVRLW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghostwire: Tokyo, &lt;/em&gt;the paranormal action game from Japanese studio Tango Gameworks, is being delayed to early 2022. Tango Gameworks posted the news &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playGhostwire/status/1414947726731751443"&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;, saying it will show more of the game in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owtb0V"&gt;“We want to get the game in your hands as soon as possible so you can experience the unforgettable version of a haunted Tokyo that we’ve been hard at work building. At the same time, we’re also focused on protecting the health of everyone at Tango,” the announcement reads. “Our new release window will give us time to bring the world of &lt;em&gt;Ghostwire&lt;/em&gt; to life as we’ve always envisioned it.” The game was previously slated for release in fall of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WElyJ5"&gt;

A few months later, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448877/microsoft-bethesda-softworks-zenimax-acquisition-xbox-game-pass-series-x"&gt;acquired Tango’s parent company ZeniMax&lt;/a&gt;, making &lt;em&gt;Ghostwire&lt;/em&gt; one of two Microsoft-owned but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449121/microsoft-bethesda-ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-consoles-exclusives"&gt;initially PlayStation-exclusive games&lt;/a&gt;. The other exclusive, Arkane’s &lt;em&gt;Deathloop, &lt;/em&gt;was also delayed but is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442372/deathloop-preview-arkane-studios-ps5"&gt;scheduled for a September release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSuO0K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghostwire&lt;/em&gt; puts players in a Tokyo that’s been nearly deserted by humans and invaded by ghosts. Its executive producer is Tango founder Shinji Mikami of &lt;em&gt;The Evil Within&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; fame, although it’s &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ghostwire-tokyo-everything-we-know/"&gt;supposedly less focused&lt;/a&gt; on survival horror than those games. Original &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2019/6/9/18659141/ikumi-nakamura-bethesda-e3-2019-ghostwire-tokyo-presenter"&gt;creative director Ikumi Nakamura&lt;/a&gt; stepped away from Tango soon after the initial announcement, later &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/ikumi-nakamura-talks-about-her-new-studio-while-explori-1846546822"&gt;saying she’d left&lt;/a&gt; because of health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to teach TikTok what you like to watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4PuDcr1tLAEeWDpdHlzoZ2CMRqg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69575537/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="grDwtA"&gt;TikTok is a brand-new type of social media platform. Unlike more traditional platforms like Instagram or Twitter where you manually curate your feeds by choosing to follow others — most likely, people you know — TikTok uses an algorithm to curate a highly personalized feed of videos. This algorithm can get shockingly specific as it gathers the videos it thinks you’ll like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqxEOh"&gt;TikTok’s main page is named the For You page — and that really means &lt;em&gt;for you&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, after I’d been on TikTok for a while, the algorithm figured out that I’m a grown-up emo kid (it was never a phase, Mom) who is trying to learn French, spends too much time playing &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sims 4&lt;/em&gt;, and is also queer. But TikTok’s algorithm didn’t get that shockingly specific by itself. It took time and effort for me to tailor the videos so perfectly to my tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IuFzb9"&gt;While TikTok does eventually learn the type of videos you like, when an account is brand-new, it can be challenging to find content that appeals to you. At the start, the For You page will typically show mega-viral videos from the app’s most popular users, but if you want to see what other videos and creators are out there, there are a few steps you can follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="roarz4"&gt;Use the discover tab to find trending sounds, hashtags, and effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="22GuVn"&gt;When starting out on TikTok, the easiest way to find videos is by looking at what’s trending. At the bottom of the screen next to the upload button is the Discover icon. Tap on it to find a collection of popular hashtags, sounds, and effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nchuOo"&gt;By clicking through these videos, finding entertaining content is quick and enjoyable. By saving the sounds or interacting with the videos through likes, sharing, or commenting, the algorithm starts to get an idea of what you like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="TikTok’s Discovery page lets you search on hashtags." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CiH0jMLsOjvByrlDdoJNFVLjza4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713500/IMG_8007.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TikTok’s Discovery page lets you search on hashtags.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can also find all the videos that use the same sound." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4YVqF9Ii0erD3Rr3fpxdTV3Se2Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713512/IMG_8011.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also find all of the videos that use the same sound.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Bqvmei"&gt;Search for things you like &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rUFnjI"&gt;While you’re in the Discover tab, use the search bar up top to look for topics you enjoy. When I first typed “Science” into the search bar, Tiktok showed me all the top videos for that topic. If I wanted to explore even more, I could have clicked through the options for users, hashtags, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FoZFXe"&gt;As opposed to looking at trending sounds and topics, this method is an easy way to find a variety of videos with different hashtags and music. Liking the videos (by clicking the heart-shaped “like” button on the side) and following the creators (by clicking the creator’s icon on the side of the screen and then on the red “Follow” button) will help ensure that the type of content you enjoy comes up on your For You page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Use the Search bar in the Discovery page to find content you like." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b4FYupn50QQdvmwZgKj1TjcIxrw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713504/IMG_8008.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use the Search bar in the Discovery page to find content you like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JCYuX2"&gt;Click on sounds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zzVzGY"&gt;The more the algorithm learns about you, the more you’ll start to notice trends within whatever TikTok rabbit hole you’ve gone down. A lot of the time, these trends are built around sounds. The sounds can be audio clips from popular media, music, or even audio created by another user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wexCYu"&gt;In the bottom-right corner of a video, you’ll see a rotating circle, and this is where the sound lives. By pressing that, it’s easy to find a trove of other videos that use that sound (if the sound is trending or at least relatively popular). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgYYxs"&gt;Although you’ll only be watching videos that use the same sound, this is a great way to find a large variety of creators that might not have made it to your For You Page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXfg4C"&gt;TikTok can be a great tool to pass the time, socialize, or learn new things. At the start, though, it can take a little time to build up the patterns before the algorithm begins to do the work for you. Just be careful — it’s very easy to accidentally lose three hours of your day watching TikToks without realizing it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Loki built a different reality with retro hardware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M-dF0xE28pPTFHJLIT7ysnJdtJY=/0x0:2412x1608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69575328/moc1040_102_comp_v012_03038a04.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Production designer Kasra Farahani explains the show’s distinct look&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="3WH9Ww"&gt;For me, watching &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; has meant pausing each episode to admire the devices that keep the Time Variance Authority running — all curved silhouettes and comically tiny screens and hazy orange readouts. By the time I asked &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; production designer Kasra Farahani about the show’s prop design inspirations, I’d convinced myself that the TemPad had to be based on a Nintendo DS. It’s all I can think of whenever Mobius (Owen Wilson) flips open the little oblong compact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4i980"&gt;“Actually, the primary piece of research that we were looking at is, there’s this crazy image that I found of a calculator watch on a wrist,” says Farahani, when I ask him about the TemPad’s aesthetic origins. “But the calculator watch is huge, it’s like the size of an iPhone, almost... it’s basically a scientific calculator strapped to [someone’s] wrist.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zqx5OS"&gt;Like its &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1107129/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; sibling &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; takes a slight detour into the outer wilds of Marvel comicdom that don’t just involve beating the crap out of overbearing villains. While the series is very much a Marvel product, from the MCU in-jokes to the one-line zingers, its production design tells a more nuanced story about the multidimensional world that TVA agents Mobius and Ravonna Renslayer live in — a world built on old technology that conjures a romantic past when machines were still curious and funny and even a little bit magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="loki" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GNQYMTceMutsCmaT5yWT2HSK0vY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713467/tll4800_104_comp_v002_ffedfcbe.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6Wvdci"&gt;“Basically all the computers were custom builds, with a combination of retro televisions and retro computers combined with disparate, other random pieces of tech, all kind of kludged together,” explains Farahani, who plans to post more detailed, up-close photos of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; toys after the last episode airs on July 14th. According to the series’ style guide, the all-powerful TVA has been able to pick and choose different technologies from different timelines as they please. “The conceit behind the technology at the TVA as we imagined it was that... digital technology never existed, and that analog technology just continued to get more and more sophisticated,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="ckuICo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10599029"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AiFYXj"&gt;And yet, with the power to use any kind of technology they want, the TVA still gravitates toward &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube"&gt;cathode ray tube&lt;/a&gt;-style screens, which continue to be major sentimental and historical touchpoints in conversations about &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/crt-tube-tv-hot-gaming-tech-retro-games/"&gt;nostalgia&lt;/a&gt; and tech &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16973914/tvs-crt-restoration-led-gaming-vintage"&gt;preservation&lt;/a&gt;, especially in games. &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;’s Richard Leadbetter &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2019-modern-games-look-beautiful-on-crt-monitors"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the beauty and significance of playing modern games on CRT screens, not just because of their low latency and reduced input lag. It seems that even in Earth-199999 — the version of Earth in the MCU — these same feelings prevail, even if the hardware is in service of a monolithic bureaucracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GBDuTh"&gt;According to Farahani, the &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; design team was big on primitive CRT playback aesthetics, which were mostly green (“there are amber-colored versions of it,” he adds). In the first episode, the TVA paperwork clerk can be seen playing solitaire on his tiny orange-hued monitor, and you get the feeling he isn’t the only desk jockey running games on their work computer. One might wonder what kind of games can be played on the TemPad by bored TVA agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YauTbW"&gt;“We made a decision that there should never be color on the screens, really, that they should be monochromatic... and it’s like an 8-bit look, almost like a first-generation Game Boy,” says Farahani. “So even when you look at ‘video footage’ on the TemPad, it’s been digitized into that monochrome 8-bit look.” (&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; director Kate Herron &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22525909/loki-director-kate-herron-interview"&gt;previously told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the TemPad’s display “was definitely inspired by SNES games and also the old Game Boy Camera.”) Even from a cursory glance at the TVA devices in the first few episodes, it’s easy to get &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; Pip-Boy vibes from some of the old-timey computer interfaces; the TVA’s trademark orange tint is also a neat callback to analog &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SELF-SCAN#"&gt;Burroughs SELF-SCAN displays of the 1970s&lt;/a&gt;, which ushered in a memorable era of CRT monitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BHGHo"&gt;In creating this vast, faceless bureaucratic machine, the &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; design team needed to source enough old hardware to furnish whole offices. “A lot of it was our set decorator Claudia Bonfe and her team [who] found an amazing array of retro televisions,” says Farahani. “Some of these things, they’re old and they’re brittle, so by the time you get them, the amount of modifications that we wanted to do to them, they just wouldn’t hold up. So it was easier in many cases to just fabricate them or build them from scratch.” (There is, however, a prominent &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/what-are-the-cool-computer-terminals-in-marvels-loki"&gt;Lear Siegler ADM-3A&lt;/a&gt; sitting on the reception desk when we first see the TVA, which could be the real deal.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="loki" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hI2zoDhXOTMocUU8RBIsY_CDqKQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713476/tac1120_104_comp_v006_aa38eee4.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mhzdJE"&gt;The team built custom props like the Chronomonitor — the 7-foot-wide screen in the Time Theater — which weighed hundreds of pounds and was constructed from scratch. (Sadly, it’s not functional; playback was done in post). The eye-catching red bubble monitor is another bespoke creation. It’s essentially a remote control for the Holoprojector, which runs off 70mm analog film reels. To preserve the idea that the TVA is an old-school WiFi-free zone, the two are connected with a huge cable that runs across the set. The team also built the hanging monitors that play the Miss Minutes animation and the yellow TVA computers in quantum monitoring, inspired by retro technological form language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fBPb6"&gt;Naturally, the old-school elements also extended to the in-show visuals, from the Miss Minutes cartoon to the Time Theater’s holographic projections. “We tried very hard to keep… almost a photographic quality in terms of aberrations and fuzzy edges and film grain… and having the glitches be analog glitches, not digital types of glitches, which is a very different look,” Farahani says. “These are small details, but they’re super important for us both in the design of the hardware… because all of it in the end contributes to the worldbuilding of the TVA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jaSKBG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Analog technology just continued to get more and more sophisticated”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Ioedd"&gt;But what was the kind of world that produced this now-obsolete tech to begin with? Farahani says that, from an industrial design standpoint, the &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; crew drew their inspiration from the imaginative, weird window of time that encompasses the post-WWII and Cold War era. “In our fiction, [the TVA is] a bureaucratic organization that was probably super well-funded or incepted, or had been renovated in the post-war era,” he explains. “Imagine that a bureaucracy, or an organization that gets this massive infusion of resources at a certain point, and then doesn’t again for decades, and then they’re just using that same tech, and it’s slowly degrading.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M64aM3"&gt;The idea that a near-omniscient galactic surveillance agency is shuffling along on outdated technology probably hits a little too close to home for people who have struggled with simple government administration processes in the present day. But it’s a tried-and-tested approach to visual storytelling that takes a page from Terry Gilliam’s &lt;em&gt;Brazil&lt;/em&gt; (and even, to an extent, his later film &lt;em&gt;Twelve Monkeys&lt;/em&gt;). Even as all this old machinery highlights the inefficacies and archaic qualities of a bloated bureaucracy, there’s still something so intrinsically romantic about watching a TVA clerk — our solitaire-playing, cat-owning buddy who does the processing paperwork — print out reams of dot matrix printer paper with the iconic perforated sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZuaAo"&gt;A somewhat bittersweet effect of watching &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; has been thinking about the technologies — particularly gaming hardware — that we’ve lost to time. Seeing the 8-bit TemPad even brought to mind my old 4-bit Game &amp;amp; Watch collection — small tablet-like LCD-screen handhelds popular in the 1980s, that came in a dualscreen clamshell version for specific games (namely &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong&lt;/em&gt;). A small part of me hopes that &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; has, perhaps unintentionally, prompted viewers to consider the importance of archiving and preserving old things, which is somewhat ironic given the TVA’s tendency to prune everything that doesn’t quite fit in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="uoiqMb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; isn’t so much a story about a fantastical possible future, but a reality that could have been. “I think anachronism is... an important archetype for suggesting a parallel reality,” Farahani says. “It helps to suggest an alternate evolution of parameters, that things just worked out in a slightly different way, in this place.” There may be no magic in the TVA, but for some of us, the idea of a universe where beautiful old machinery still has a place and purpose is the most otherworldly thing of all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea and Sonos picture frame speaker review: wall of sound</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The latest Symfonisk collaboration is another attempt to camouflage tech in the home&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GGcJ4x"&gt;Ikea and Sonos are back with the latest product in their collaborative Symfonisk series. The lineup’s purpose is to make technology — in this case, wireless speakers — fit in better with home decor and furnishings. After releasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound"&gt;a table lamp and bookshelf speaker&lt;/a&gt; two years ago, the companies have come up with a third act that doesn’t require any table, shelf, or floor space at all — because it hangs on your wall. The new $200 Symfonisk “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsymfonisk-picture-frame-with-wi-fi-speaker-white-50487329%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22573890%2Fikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;picture frame with Wi-Fi speaker&lt;/a&gt;” will be available at Ikea’s stores on July 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P95gUR"&gt;The name is a bit of a misnomer since you can’t actually put any of your own pictures or posters inside this frame. “Wall art speaker” would be more accurate, but the end result is another attempt to camouflage gadgets with a more pleasant design that blends in with the rest of your home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Xj6vM7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10649263"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DBsiO7"&gt;The picture frame is designed for mounting and comes with all of the hardware (bracket, screws, etc.) required for that. But you can also just prop it up against a wall and use it that way; Ikea includes silicone feet for this purpose, and there are preinstalled felt pads to keep the frame from causing any wall damage. Whether you hang it up or just stand it up on a shelf, it can be oriented horizontally or vertically. The majority of the product is made from plastic, but the front panel with the artwork is a polyester fabric. Three physical buttons for play / pause and track controls are located behind the left edge of the frame; the Ikea and Sonos branding is a visual cue for where to reach, and they’re easy to feel for after a while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eb5Mgx"&gt;Ikea’s default art design on the mesh fabric isn’t going to be for everyone. Artist Jennifer Idrizi has said that it’s inspired by the “structure” of music — the fade in and fade out. But on Twitter, the look has been mocked as something that’d be at home in a chain hotel, dentist’s office, or kitschy Airbnb. I don’t envy the challenge of making art that appeals to a wide audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WFwJ0iZTwHr6rxucGeG2e0CXtP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712714/cwelch_210709_4665_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you don’t like the default art, you can buy other prints to replace it with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z5ohC9"&gt;Ikea plans to sell a range of different art prints for $20 each; swapping between them is as easy as pushing out the panel through the eight cutouts at the frame’s back corners. Some people aren’t going to love &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the selections, and I really wish you could order custom designs of your own photos. Unfortunately, that’s not something Ikea is offering, but the company says it will release new designs regularly. If the Symfonisk frame proves popular, maybe an aftermarket of prints will emerge on Etsy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofvNZF"&gt;Another aspect of the picture frame speaker that people have quibbled about is the power cord. A piece of artwork with a cable running down the wall?! I can only speak for myself, but it really hasn’t bothered me in the slightest. The fabric-covered white cord — even the black frame comes with a white cable — is 11.5 feet long, so you’ve got plenty of slack for reaching the nearest outlet. If you don’t need all that length, there’s a little storage nook on the back of the frame where you can wrap up and store unneeded cable (with a Velcro strap to keep everything tidy). If you’re that turned off by the wire, maybe try to work some magic with a recessed outlet or just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cable+concealer&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2"&gt;buy something to conceal it&lt;/a&gt; with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FC9Fg3rnmb1SWFxGKrTAD826dRY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712717/cwelch_210711_4665_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The visible power cord bothers some, but I didn’t mind it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ssMTrr"&gt;Ikea and Sonos have put a lot of consideration into the frame’s design, and one of my favorite little touches is that there are several different cord routing paths that lead out of the frame, so you can have the power cable come down from the left or right side if dead center doesn’t work for you. It’s also possible to daisy-chain two of the wall speakers together with a cable (sold separately) if you want to keep things looking cleaner and spare a second outlet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JVPheumNqhDqCj2T9VIeF0J0Ky8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712712/cwelch_210709_4665_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The controls are located behind the frame’s left edge and easy to feel for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yn8c-VEz78rjts4BIdn9h2w5G4k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712715/cwelch_210709_4665_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The back of the frame has built-in cord management.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j7N5u0"&gt;Since they cost the same, you might be wondering how the picture frame speaker compares to the Sonos One speaker in terms of sound quality. They’re actually remarkably close in performance. It feels like that’s the measuring stick Sonos uses for the Symfonisk line. The bookshelf speaker was 80 percent of the way there (for much less money), but the frame speaker is basically on par with the One — despite the latter having more depth to work with. There’s enough bass to give music the oomph it needs, but your walls aren’t going to be rattling at normal volume levels. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bmPTA3PJD7d-Z7Keny4jA6g085A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712709/cwelch_210709_4665_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you don’t have much desk space to spare, AirPlay 2 support makes the Symfonisk frame a good speaker for any Mac.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rSzSOB"&gt;Much like the One, the picture frame speaker is a rung or two above your average smart speaker (like the Amazon Echo or Apple’s HomePod Mini) in terms of audio quality. Sonos put a waveguide in front of the tweeter to help evenly distribute high-frequency sounds around a room, and in general, the hardware here is sufficient for filling most average-sized spaces. You can also use Sonos’ Trueplay feature in the iOS app to tune the speaker’s output for a particular room’s acoustics. There are no built-in microphones on the picture frame speaker, which is in keeping with previous Symfonisk products. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NjKMGCJZbmQcVz6stZoUjlOdyj8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714459/app.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setup is done with the Sonos app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OuJ1Qf"&gt;If you buy two of the Symfonisk wall speakers, they can be used as surrounds for a Sonos Arc or Beam soundbar. Ikea sent me a pair so I could test out how they perform at home theater duty, and I came away impressed. Once you set up the second speaker, the Sonos app automatically asks whether you want to use them for surround purposes with whatever Arc or Beam is already part of your system. Tap a button, and the three devices are grouped together for both TV audio and music. (For music in this setup, you can choose whether the picture frames output a subtle mix — letting the soundbar take the lead — or something more full and substantial.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WfEFoFKbiAavTMP3cMiJ4COEPIE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712707/cwelch_210709_4665_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It does stick out from the wall quite a bit, but at least you’re getting good sound in exchange.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1nkc1_NmBL2s_WHe49iBHzSr_Rc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712711/cwelch_210709_4665_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonos added a waveguide to the tweeter to more evenly fill a room with sound.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L8I2U7UOmWNF7itFTXFYblpn-So=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712706/cwelch_210709_4665_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ikea includes an 11.5-foot cord that should be enough to reach an outlet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pYXCcI"&gt;Having a picture frame speaker handle surround sound is quite different from a Sonos One; the latter can be placed basically anywhere in your TV room on a shelf or stand for ideal immersion. If you’ve got the right wall situation for two Symfonisk frames behind your couch, you’re probably fine; other layouts might need some experimentation with placement and volume. They sounded great in my bedroom paired with an Arc and my LG CX OLED. There are settings in the Sonos app where you can input how far from you the surround speakers are, and you can also crank up their audio (separate from the soundbar’s volume) if they’re farther back in a room than surrounds ordinarily would be. The sound quality doesn’t disappoint, but you might have to tinker around with settings for the most satisfying results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="oWbcNt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10649840"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4GwGemKyCrT9noi-XHMT5ZXytaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712719/cwelch_210711_4665_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In terms of sound, the picture frame speaker is very close to a Sonos One.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2p1ibx"&gt;The Symfonisk picture frame is fundamentally a Sonos speaker; you can play virtually any music streaming service on it through the Sonos app. It also supports AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect — though there’s no Bluetooth present, nor any 3.5 auxiliary input. You can group it with other Sonos speakers and play different music in each room, or have your whole system play the same thing in tandem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GDDdx"&gt;In terms of functionality and what it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;, nothing about the latest joint effort from Ikea and Sonos is new or unique. And unlike the previous two Symfonisk products, this one isn’t a particularly cheap way into the Sonos ecosystem. It’s purely about the form factor and aesthetic. If there’s a section of your house where a normal speaker just won’t work — or if you live with someone who’s not fond of having very obvious gadgets in every room, maybe this will do the trick. If you immediately jumped at the idea of wall speakers for home theater surround, the picture frame speaker won’t disappoint. You’d just better hope you and Ikea have similar taste in art.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fundamental goal is for it to blend into your home like tech rarely does.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos’ launch to space clears final regulatory hurdle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos Introduces The Blue Origin&amp;amp;nbsp;New Shepard&amp;amp;nbsp;System" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IfNyKafx7-Y0m9FHfO2qKNJuEBk=/0x1499:3567x3877/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69575260/665033910.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7emzYx"&gt;The Federal Aviation Administration approved Blue Origin’s license to launch its billionaire founder Jeff Bezos and three other passengers to the edge of space next Tuesday, clearing the last regulatory hurdle for this month’s second billionaire space entrepreneur flying into space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vEOJZC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“New Shepard is go for launch”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qQIpU0"&gt;Blue Origin is gearing up to launch its first crew of humans on July 20th aboard its suborbital New Shepard rocket, which launches from a remote desert site in Van Horn, Texas. The license from the FAA to fly humans, approved Monday night, is valid until August and came after a meticulous review of New Shepard’s hardware and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CoKWZ"&gt;“New Shepard is go for launch,” Blue Origin said in a statement on Monday just before the license approval was complete. Liftoff is set for 9AM ET next Tuesday, with a live company broadcast starting on YouTube at 7:30AM ET. It’ll mark New Shepard’s 16th launch, with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383407/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-new-shepard-launch-first-crewed-flight"&gt;most recent test in April&lt;/a&gt; launching as an uncrewed astronaut rehearsal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rV8hv"&gt;Blue Origin’s space tourism rival, Virgin Galactic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;launched its billionaire founder Richard Branson&lt;/a&gt; and three other company employees to space on Sunday. Branson was previously set to fly on a later mission but had his flight bumped up in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559964/richard-branson-space-before-jeff-bezos-virgin-galactic"&gt;a not-so-subtle move&lt;/a&gt; to beat Bezos to space by nine days. (Branson calls it a coincidence.) That decision kicked off weeks of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570287/space-tourism-virgin-galactic-branson-blue-origin-bezos"&gt;snark and sass from Blue Origin&lt;/a&gt;, which tweeted an infographic days before the flight comparing New Shepard to Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo spaceplane.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yiu-o5eDIYZYGRXdZQE6sf8-Whg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6172587/Blue_Origin_New_Shepard_launch.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Blue Origin&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o5xLvb"&gt;Virgin Galactic’s FAA license approval to fly Branson came 16 days before its July 11th flight, with Blue Origin’s coming a week before Bezos’ flight. Virgin uses a different method of getting its passengers to space: SpaceShipTwo took off from a New Mexico runway attached to a carrier plane before dropping at 45,000 feet and igniting its rocket engine to blast further toward space, some 53.5 miles above ground (the altitude that NASA and the FAA consider space). Branson and his crew landed safely on the same runway in New Mexico minutes after floating in microgravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpPL9R"&gt;Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket is a roughly six-story-tall suborbital launcher that sends a gumdrop-shaped crew capsule roughly 62 miles high, an altitude that many countries consider space. The rocket booster returns for a vertical landing, while the crew capsule, after spending a few minutes in microgravity, floats back to land under parachutes. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522313/jeff-bezos-space-launch-brother-blue-origin-july-20"&gt;Bezos, his brother Mark&lt;/a&gt;, aviation icon and astronaut candidate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558908/wally-funk-flight-jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-new-shepard"&gt;Wally Funk&lt;/a&gt;, and an undisclosed fourth passenger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22530907/blue-origin-auction-new-shepard-jeff-bezos-space-28-million"&gt;who paid $28 million during an auction&lt;/a&gt; for their seat will be on board New Shepard for the flight on July 20th, the date humans first stepped foot on the Moon in 1969.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LIsQAC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Shaping up to be a very special July for the space!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BdZxtg"&gt;The FAA license governs the safety conditions for people and buildings on the ground in proximity of Blue Origin’s launch site, rather than the safety of the passengers on board. Current US law bars the FAA from regulating spaceflight passenger safety, a years-old rule designed to give the nascent commercial space sector flexibility to innovate. So Blue Origin, and any other space company launching humans to space, has its passengers sign “informed consent” forms to ensure they’re aware of the safety risks of launching a rocket to space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHaXXd"&gt;“Shaping up to be a very special July for the space!” Blue Origin’s sales director Clay Mowry &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ClayMowry/status/1414611477210746886?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring’s end-to-end encryption is rolling out globally</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cKybCx9HQTXJg7Fw1YgjUFUGrh0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69575145/dseifert_20210323_4486_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sAohuC"&gt;Ring’s end-to-end encryption for video streams is leaving technical preview, is now available to US users, and is currently rolling out globally, the Amazon-owned company announced on Tuesday. The opt-in feature makes it so that your video streams can only be viewed by you on an enrolled iOS or Android device, meaning that Ring can’t access that footage even if it wanted to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MO1G3n"&gt;The feature works with 13 Ring cameras, and you can see the full list of compatible models and follow the steps on &lt;a href="https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360054941551-How-to-Set-Up-Video-End-to-End-Encryption-E2EE-"&gt;how to set up end-to-end encryption on Ring’s website&lt;/a&gt;. Ring’s battery-powered video doorbells and cameras don’t support end-to-end encryption, according to that page.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x0Bln-OF7kYrETtN1l3Y5nYE2mg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713850/OTS_Press_Kit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring’s end-to-end encryption settings menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aIzRrb"&gt;End-to-end encryption is a boon for customers who want to ensure Ring can’t access their footage — turning it on ensures that Ring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22258856/amazon-ring-partners-police-fire-security-privacy-cameras"&gt;can’t turn over captured video to law enforcement&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Ring first announced video end-to-end encryption &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453581/ring-end-to-end-encryption-video-neighbors-app-amazon"&gt;in September 2020&lt;/a&gt; and launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22225716/ring-end-to-end-encryption-video-launch"&gt;technical preview in January&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjabhs"&gt;Alongside end-to-end encryption, Ring is introducing new features to help customers protect their accounts. If you use two-step authentication to provide extra security to your account, Ring now supports authenticator apps, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/16/18098286/vovox-security-breach-two-factor-authentication-2fa-codes-exposed"&gt;which can be more secure than SMS&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also rolling out CAPTCHA in both the Ring and Neighbors app, which can prevent bots and spammers from logging into your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mq8eml"&gt;Ring is also making it easier to transfer ownership of a used Ring device. Right now, that process requires that you call Ring’s customer service department, but in the “coming weeks,” you’ll be able to transfer ownership of a used device to yourself right from the Ring app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x4P7uu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ring adds end-to-end encryption to protect your video streams","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22225716/ring-end-to-end-encryption-video-launch"},{"title":"Ring plans to offer end-to-end encryption by the end of the year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453581/ring-end-to-end-encryption-video-neighbors-app-amazon"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ojkEvu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: End-to-end encryption is supported on 13 Ring cameras, not 12. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Firefox says its revamped SmartBlock won’t break Facebook login buttons anymore</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yw5qJZQB89ENS0bDsxVO58-2OcA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69575009/acastro_200207_3900_firefox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1HSZIg"&gt;Firefox 90 introduces the next version of SmartBlock, the browser’s tracker blocking mechanism built into its private browsing and strict modes, which now has improvements designed to prevent buttons that let you log into websites using your Facebook account from breaking, Mozilla announced on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydtHbN"&gt;SmartBlock was first introduced with Firefox 87 in March, and if you aren’t familiar, here’s Mozilla’s description of how it works, &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/03/23/introducing-smartblock/"&gt;from the company’s blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qDQ8Cp"&gt;SmartBlock intelligently fixes up web pages that are broken by our tracking protections, without compromising user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7AlGhZ"&gt;SmartBlock does this by providing local stand-ins for blocked third-party tracking scripts. These stand-in scripts behave &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; enough like the original ones to make sure that the website works properly. They allow broken sites relying on the original scripts to load with their functionality intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qjXN4v"&gt;Sometimes, though, the feature would break Facebook login buttons. &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/07/13/smartblock-v2/"&gt;In a new blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Mozilla’s Tom Wisniewski and Arthur Edelstein explain why this would happen, using an example of trying to log in to Etsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HiMRA"&gt;“Prior to Firefox 90, if you were using a Private Browsing window, when you clicked on the ‘Continue with Facebook’ button to sign in, the ‘sign in’ would fail to proceed because the third-party Facebook script required had been blocked by Firefox,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epPqYd"&gt;With Firefox 90 and SmartBlock 2.0, though, you should be able to use Facebook login buttons all while SmartBlock 2.0 still blocks cross-site tracking. On the updated browser, “initially, Facebook scripts are all blocked, just as before, ensuring your privacy is preserved,” they write. “But when you click on the ‘Continue with Facebook’ button to sign in, SmartBlock reacts by quickly unblocking the Facebook login script just in time for the sign-in to proceed smoothly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcLrvS"&gt;Firefox 90 is launching Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Can Polestar design a new kind of car company?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vrK-QfAq4c7tOay7v5PKkzMEv5o=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69575056/VRG_Decoder_ThomasIngenlath_site.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath wants the freedom of an auto startup with the benefits of an established player&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="FkhoFK"&gt;We are back after our week off, and we’ve got a good one today. On this episode, I’m talking to Thomas Ingenlath, CEO of Polestar, a new car company with close family ties to Volvo. Polestar has two models you can go out and buy today: the $150,000 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16487290/polestar-volvo-hybrid-electric-revealed"&gt;hybrid Polestar 1&lt;/a&gt; sports coupe and the somewhat more reasonable $60,000 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;Polestar 2 sedan&lt;/a&gt;, which has been getting pretty good reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMG4gp"&gt;Now, Polestar is an interesting company. It’s effectively a startup with tight ties to Volvo, and Thomas himself is Volvo’s chief design officer. So we talked a lot about what kind of company Polestar is — it’s pretty small and has the ability to rethink a lot of things about how a car company is organized, while having the ability to fall back on a larger company if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbM7ew"&gt;We also talked a lot about what makes a car company a car company at a time when everything about cars seems up for grabs. Thomas told me he doesn’t think of Polestar as an &lt;em&gt;electric&lt;/em&gt; car company. Instead, he sees the brand as a set of “core values” about what a car is, with the technology underneath replaceable over time — maybe a long period of time. Eventually, Thomas told me, something else will take over from EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeFiOi"&gt;But back here on the ground, the transformation of cars into rolling electric computers is just getting started. We also talked about some basic questions that keep coming up: how is the charging network for Polestar EVs getting built up? Polestar and Volvo have chosen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537200/google-android-auto-volvo-polestar-2-hands-on-demo-io-2019"&gt;to run Android Auto for the entire center stack&lt;/a&gt;. Why give up that part of the experience to Google? As cars slowly head toward self-driving capability, who should own the maps and navigation information? And how should we think about upgrading the computers in our cars over time? If you listened to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444294/ford-f150-lightning-pickup-truck-jim-farley-interview"&gt;my interview with Ford CEO Jim Farley&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll note that Thomas’ answers are strikingly different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="go7kvI"&gt;In fact, I’ll leave on that note: Thomas is still a designer at heart, and I think you can hear that when you listen to this conversation. You’ll see what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sAq87W"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP2477017309" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BzLh8b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following transcript has been edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4YSwk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a lot to talk about. Polestar is a new car company. There are quite a lot of new car companies lately, there’s an EV revolution happening, but I want to start at the beginning. Polestar began as part of Volvo. It was spun out in 2017. You’re still using some of Volvo’s dealer network. You have some Volvo design elements. Give me the brief story of where Polestar came from and what that relationship to Volvo is now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBYS4i"&gt;The relationship to Volvo is very simply put into a picture. It’s a parent company, it was born there and it raised its baby and it’s growing up and becoming an adult, and we are on the progress of moving out, earning our own money, and becoming independent. We will always be some kind of family, but of course we will develop our own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDDQzj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How big is Polestar? How many employees do you have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcDlUF"&gt;Size-wise, we are still not at all [a] big fat OEM, despite the fact that we have two cars in production. We are still around 1,000 people. The trick here, and that is where the main business idea behind Polestar lies, [is that] we use elements that are existing in the family, like contract manufacturing, partly, as well as technology platforms that we’re using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfNJL1"&gt;Of course, hundreds and thousands of engineers and workers are working there, but they’re not employed by Polestar. We do contract engineering, contract manufacturing, and have that type of asset-light approach to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMzzxU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that a different approach than Volvo? One of the core questions I have for you is: the reason you spin out a company is to get rid of some of the institutional baggage that has developed over a long period of time. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02H324"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Polestar trying to make a new kind of car company and reset, or do you want to get better efficiency out of all the assets that Volvo has, but point them at a different market?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fX9QSw"&gt;For us at Polestar, it’s definitely the speed and the way you can really build that company and make decisions on innovation, [and] how you set up your customer business. You can really do this in a small company much, much faster, and then embrace it, and the day that you [make a] decision, you can implement it immediately. That works so much faster here and you definitely have that advantage of a new company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrFdgW"&gt;Having said that, at the same time you use [the] efficiency of the infrastructure of manufacturing and really bring that to a higher use as that’s a benefit for all of us. That’s really where, of course, it’s as much a win for us as it is for the big Volvo there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BH10tr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polestar has two models out now. There is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16487290/polestar-volvo-hybrid-electric-revealed"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Polestar 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, a hybrid sort of sports coupe. It’s very expensive. It starts at $155,000. I just specced one out. I made it more expensive than that very quickly. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sRpI1a"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Polestar 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is sort of the more mainstream model. It’s all electric, it’s a hatchback. It starts at $61,000. Why start there at the very top of the market, when it seems like there’s a lot of opportunity for more mainstream electric cars?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubHJCj"&gt;These two products exactly frame the brand. Yes, we put the Polestar 1 as that highlight product, really showing the ambitious technology that we put in there and of course, a high price ticket. It’s a super luxurious car. It’s very low volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z53d9z"&gt;A year later we showed the foundation, the entry ticket to the brand, where [the] Polestar 2 came in as this electric premium hatchback. That’s really where we framed what will be the playground of where we develop, now, the brand. The future portfolio that comes out now over the next three years, will fill the space in between. I understand that there’s still an empty space in between, but we have to start somewhere and we decided to frame it first and then start painting, rather than to start somewhere in the middle and you diffuse to the ends and you don’t know where the borders are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VTLDG4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do the hybrid at all? If you think the future is EVs, obviously hybrids are an interim step, but why start with gas-engineered cars at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z96vWr"&gt;We had that discussion, of course, in the beginning. Why do you have a hybrid at all in your lineup? In the end, [we said] “should we really be so dogmatic about it?” It is a car that has the longest electric range of a hybrid, 120, 130 kilometers you can go. For a lot of people, that car is actually a great entry into that electric arena. It helps people to actually feel comfortable about driving an electric car, people who might have never, ever thought about it before. They discover with that car, “Wow, actually the electric part is the really cool part about it,” and it was always clear. It is that one fulfillment of a dream that we all had, a super beautiful GT and the technology is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="v8obM0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7I4lzv"&gt;Hybrid is part of the electric journey. We will, of course, from now on have the electric lineup of the portfolio. Yeah, a little bit of an unorthodox beginning, but then again it’s the whole thing, the whole brand Polestar. It’s not just a marketing exercise where you do a perfect plan from A to Z. It is a living thing. It has its history, how it all grew, and I think it has its charm to it, that we actually don’t just simply do everything textbook. [We] give it a little bit more [room] to breathe, and at the end decided, it is absolutely in line with what the company philosophy is about and that’s why we felt at the end of the day, electric will be a certain period of Polestar. Let’s face it, in 50, 60, 70 years, we will still be Polestar, but technology might have changed again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIUpor"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a really interesting way of framing it. The startup company CEOs tell me, “We’re an electric car company.” The big company CEOs say, “We’re on our journey to being an electric car company.” You’re not saying that. You’re saying, “We’re a car company and we have to adapt over time.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCNoWA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think of Polestar as an electric car company in the way that many new car companies explicitly frame themselves that way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpUTSA"&gt;I totally believe what we create here over time is a brand and that is the core value. We create something that I really hope that in 100 years we look back and we think, wow, what a brand we created. And imagine if Porsche would have said, “Oh, we are a combustion engine company.” Then you bury yourself. Now, no. Of course you reinvent yourself and okay, combustion engines were the first, I don’t know, 50, 60 years, and now they go into electrification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8VVpL"&gt;For me, that is of course a super important period. I mean, don’t get me wrong. Electrification is the topic of the time and I’m the first one to say, “Come on, we have to fully switch into that gear now,” but we should not think that [from] now till eternity that will be the drivetrain. It will be for quite a long time, but then again, what will happen in 50, 60 years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="G8lmD7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In 50, 60, 70 years we will still be Polestar, but technology might have changed again.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4PHqoP"&gt;Maybe there will be something else. I never would connect a specific technology as a core of the brand. I once had a boss in R&amp;amp;D and he said, “We are a proper company. We need a combustion engine factory, otherwise we are not a proper car company,” and already at that point in time, I thought, “What you create is a brand and the brand is the core value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="at0DCv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me push you on that a little bit. For the longest time — maybe they didn’t know it — but companies like Porsche, Honda, what have you, they were combustion engine companies. They were organized around this big, heavy thing that you had to put in front of the car and it needed a gas tank, and it needed to vent the exhaust out, and they had to manage heat, all this stuff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7ht7D"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the entire apparatus of designing and selling and maintaining their product was organized around the drivetrain and so, even if they didn’t know that they were combustion engine car companies, they had to build themselves around the reality of the core piece of their product. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ty4F9q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I talk to the CEOs of new car companies, they often say, “Oh, the old car companies won’t be able to do this because they have 500 engineers who work on exhaust systems who will be resistant to change and the opportunity with electric cars is to completely rethink a car from the ground up and to throw out all of the baggage.” Where do you see that balance? Because you have what is a fairly unique viewpoint so far that I’ve heard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fZFnP"&gt;To a certain extent, of course, it is a problem to initiate now this change, from what has been a company that has been so entirely busy with making a combustion engine work in a car, which actually is very difficult because it’s quite a funny way of changing movement from going up and down into rotation. So, that has its problems. They solved it quite nicely, but of course it involved lots of people doing that. Both extremes to me are wrong. I mean, that combustion engineering, yes. You really need a big, big effort to change a company from that kind of locomotion going in that direction into a different direction. That’s a hell of a task and that’s, of course, our advantage, that we are not busy with that. We can fully concentrate on the new. Fine, but it’s again not just simply making a computer on wheels or a mobile on wheels. It’s still that kind of experience that you have to embrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTwTe0"&gt;And that has a digital aspect. It has, as well, an emotional and physical aspect. The car is a moving object. It is still, for mankind, an amazing experience that you can actually accelerate yourself faster than your own feet can carry you. That is still an emotional experience. Embracing that is about an emotional experience that you have in your car and that includes the physical, the digital aspect, and the senses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xzoyN"&gt;You have to bring into the experience of the brand, and to me, it’s a much more holistic experience that is not connected just to the eternity of one technology. At the moment, how much we embrace and cherish the element of bringing your digital life that you enjoy so much into the car as well and make that seamless. It’s as important as having the electric drivetrain, like you said, that you actually have that ability to connect to your digital life in the car, as much as you do it whilst you’re cooking in the kitchen. That of course is one of the monster tasks for car companies and that’s still not solved 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="m6M9pS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The car is a moving object...That is still an emotional experience.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lVIZD5"&gt;That’s what we are all busy with, but there’s one big aspect as well, the customer relations which comes into the picture, and building a car company that is not always detached from the customer that much, and we experience that now fully. Having a direct consumer business is such a massive experience, you really are directly with the customer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYQNrz"&gt;They come with all the complaints and with all the emotions to you and that’s great, but you have to cater for that. You have to be prepared for that, where until today all the dealers out there [were] doing that for you, now suddenly you’re in the direct business. So, these are all amazing new things that we as a young company are trying to embrace and do and that is definitely where all the OEMs that are out there still have to get onto that journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtRb0d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re a former designer. What you just said had a lot of design thinking in it, a lot of user-centric thinking in it. What parts of being the CEO have surprised you the most in that transition going from head of design at various places to now the CEO of Polestar?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmcGk0"&gt;Of course, bit by bit the creative part, being in the design studio disappeared, and now I’m only, I don’t know, four hours per week over there and being together with Max [Missoni] and Robin [Page] in the design studio. That I definitely miss. Having said that, daily work on making things, [keeping] it together, [trying] to make things that are impossible possible, every day getting things over that hurdle of, “Ah, but can we not do it like that because it’s so—” Every day I try to push for that. It’s the same that I did over the last 10 years in the design studio, trying to make designs happen where it’s such an energy to bring it alive and real in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nTDcti"&gt;And it’s still the same thing. But now on a bigger scale, it’s now about a whole brand and about a whole company, and to keep it together and really make everybody feel like, wow, this is our thing. It’s not a place where you come and people provide you with something. No, it’s your workplace. And if you don’t pick up that spoon from the table when you left it there, there’s not anybody coming. Feel that ownership and treat the company like it’s your own company. And I wish everybody in the design studio does it, and everybody here at Polestar does it. That is for me a big difference of people really feeling that much engaged and involved into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvplLv"&gt;It makes me happy when I see people do it that way and feel it, and have that same passion for it. And it drives me crazy when I see that people come to work, who like it, basically, but don’t see that it has to come with yourself delivering on it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkNnfL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I ask every executive who comes on the show this question. You are the CEO of a small car company that is connected to a very big company. You’re trying to launch a new brand. You’re trying to launch new products. You have a lot of decisions to make. What is your decision-making framework?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5m3N90"&gt;I [am] really trying to understand what you mean by framework, Nilay. Can you explain it a little more? What [do] you actually mean with that question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgjkoZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think that most leaders of large organizations have to make so many decisions with unknown outputs, there’s not a right decision. Every decision is balancing a trade-off. The point of my question is to understand how leaders balance the trade-offs. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okUwYf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the leader of a large organization, you can’t know that you’re going to be right. You have to make a bet. No matter what that thing is, whether you are carving a clay model for a car, or if you are deciding how to operate your dealer network. These are just kind of repeated decisions or repeated tasks. And I think most people, even if they don’t recognize it, develop a framework for doing the things they do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVkY6K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And one of the things that gets taken for granted a lot is at some point there isn’t a right choice. There’s just a balance of priorities and interests, and making that trade-off is very difficult. So that’s what I’m always trying to get at is, what is your instinctive way of balancing the trade-offs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBLTbi"&gt;I guess such a long period of my life has been connected to making decisions within the design frame, where you have, at the end of the day, it never could be a committee decision. It is such a personal decision about deciding on which is the right way to go, left or right, model A or B. What do you do? And as much as you try to back up your opinion with maybe some kind of facts and figures that you listen to, there’s still, as well, a lot about a gut feeling. And the gut feeling is not about taste. It’s about really you judging about what the future will bring and out of the best picture that you can draw out of the information, and your sense for what is going to happen and bringing that into your decision. Just simply dare to make that decision and that prediction of what will be the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJ6zVh"&gt;I’m not scared of that anymore because I actually noticed that you can rationalize a lot of things and explain, and I’ve trained that so much, to actually make that connection of things that you predict for the future and what, partly, you feel about where the trend is going, and how you can argue about it and how you can make a rationale out of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZhMdv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s put that into practice. What risks have you taken in rethinking the car and what risks have you held back on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDyJ8c"&gt;Well, that started 10 years ago when we, for example, decided to go for... The forcefulness strategy was Volvo to go for only touchscreen, when everybody was doubting that you could make a premium car company without a minimum of six cylinders, and that touchscreen… with sticky fingers and stuff on it. So that was one decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzzvhG"&gt;The other thing, definitely embracing the Android Google thing and going for that. And when the rest of the world was saying, “Oh, how can you dare to let them into your demand? They will all dominate it,” and stuff. These are decisions where you definitely have to make brave decisions, offering a car where you say, “No. Yeah, it’s a premium car, but do you need, for a premium car, to equip it with this leather standard? No.” There is a new premium and you can offer to customers who pay lots of money for it, new materials that are not necessarily a natural leather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3w2XMi"&gt;When we did the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195499/volvo-xc40-recharge-ev-suv-first-drive-specs-price"&gt;Volvo XC40&lt;/a&gt;, for example, everybody thought, “Ah, come on, just do a little copy of the XC90, XC60.” I said, “No, we don’t do just a little copy. We do something new. We do some radical new design.” When we did the Polestar 2, we said, “Yes, that is how a modern sedan looks.” It doesn’t look like a traditional sedan and that stance and that power that it has, it’s great. And my God, there were not lots of people believing that [about] the Polestar 2, why didn’t we just do another SUV as a first start? And I’m so happy about having passionate customers who exactly feel how great that car looks and stands on the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpMkWb"&gt;But I’ll tell you, three, four years ago, there was a very [small] minority of people in our management team who believed that that would be a great success. So there are lots of decisions where you are really on your own at that point in time. And you cannot go to a clinic and just clinic it because that’s so difficult to predict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G30k7a"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about the decision to use Android in the car. Volvo was early. Now, it seems to be what everyone’s doing. Stellantis, which makes Fiat and Jeep, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/hands-on-with-stellantis-new-android-based-uconnect-5-infotainment/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;they are using Android in the car&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, in the center stack. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260176/ford-google-android-infotainment-os-2023"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ford just announced&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it will be using Android in the future. What is the balance between letting Google own what has become a primary user experience in the car and what you want to design?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KflEyA"&gt;Well, it’s customer benefit. If we promise to have a voice recognition that works, if we promise to have a navigation that actually knows that new restaurant around the block that opened a week ago, and they know already, they want to know the opening times when they put it into the navi. That is what we never can do on our own. That experience we can only do if you have a great partner with a great search engine behind it and everything. Do we give up that experience? No. People sitting in a Polestar don’t think that suddenly it is populated by something outlandish owned by Google. It is such a Polestar experience nevertheless. It’s a partnership. And that is where if you go, then, to Ford or wherever, it will be a brand experience there. That is still possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hq2vLn"&gt;Let’s face it, on my Apple iPhone, I have Google Maps, and just because I use Google Maps, it’s not that I suddenly say, “Oh, but this is not an iPhone anymore.” So I think there, we have to be a little bit more sophisticated in how we discuss it. It’s not like suddenly the whole product experience becomes a Google experience. Yeah, there’s a part of it, and I embrace what they do for our car and it’s a great partnership. And I think there the expertise of both brands come together and create just a beautiful product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uouv19"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your data sharing agreement with Google like? How much data do they get to pull out of the car?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2191b"&gt;Yeah, that’s absolutely like on the phone, where the customer can actually totally switch, even within the individual apps, he can decide on how much data he provides and how much he keeps for himself. So that is where that works very much like in any phone setting, where you go in and do your privacy settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2O69eE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the telematics that you collect about the cars, how much of that do you share with Google?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IQNrW"&gt;Well, it’s very similar. Of course, this is not like the whole software. The software that runs the car is, of course, an automotive software. The Google part is the entertainment part. So that’s where people have to understand it’s not like the whole software of the car is run by Android. That is really the entertainment part, where you go into the app store, the navigation, and all of that, is the Google Android part. While, of course, the whole safety-relevant, drivetrain-relevant, the battery management, all of that, the whole autonomous capabilities of the car, the safety, all that is our software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CT6Ys8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reason I ask is actually about autonomy. As cars begin to drive themselves more and more, as there’s more driver assistance features, things like maps become critically important to the operation of a car and telling the car where you want to go. And there is obviously a connection between your autonomous driving system and the user experience of telling the car in the center screen. The map underneath actually tells the car where it is and what might be coming up. And then the data that is collected to refine and improve self-driving. That’s a lot of layers that need to connect, and it seems like Google sits right at the middle of it for you. I’m curious how you see that relationship developing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LFMNs"&gt;No, there is clearly a big, big distinction between what is the entertainment system, and okay, the navigation is of course sitting in there. But what we provide today with our autopilot, which has very much made that difference, we don’t call this an autonomous system. It is a support system where you’re still in the loop, but this is a software that is completely independent from the Google software. In the future, when we develop, in our next car coming, this to a highway pilot, which of course then will reach, as well, autonomous qualities, but you really can let go at some point in time. That, of course, is a system which is together with the software company here in Gothenburg, who is developing that, and we have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533711/luminar-lidar-autonomous-vehicle-hands-on-demo-austin-russell"&gt;Luminar LIDAR&lt;/a&gt; then for that. So all of that is on a completely different page where we develop this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LvOPQY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think the auto industry should kind of give up on developing the infotainment stack? I watch every car review on YouTube, and every car reviewer just sort of waves at the center of the car and says it has CarPlay and Android Auto, and then they move on. I’m very curious, is that the end of the road? Is there more innovation there yet to come?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7p3oZ"&gt;I think this has become far too much of a big, big, major question. Imagine in the past, we were always buying our radio from, I don’t know, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaupunkt"&gt;Blaupunkt&lt;/a&gt; or whatever company there was. It was never the carmaker who made the radio. It was never a carmaker who made a phone. We just simply bring the stuff into the car, and I don’t see it as such a major thing. It definitely is not like suddenly this becomes the major domain. Maybe I’m too naive. Maybe I’m such a naive guy, but I don’t think that it is really this big devil that we invite to our table, and suddenly we lost it all. That to me is one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JNaMwG"&gt;And of course, it’s not as naive as saying, come on, we buy a seat from Recaro. I know that there is a bit more to it. Of course, we have to be smart and clever how we do the contracts and how much the user experience is still a brand-owned experience. And I think so far, my experience with Google is that they absolutely support that we have a brand-owned experience, even though we use their system in our car. And there, I’ve so far, over the five years that we [have been] working now together on that, have not had a negative experience, but I would be, now, more scared than we were in the beginning, rather the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cB8lqm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things that’s different between, I don’t know, a Blaupunkt radio in the ’90s, or a Recaro seat in a car now; those things are pretty modular. When I didn’t like the Blaupunkt radio in the old BMW I inherited from my mom. I just replaced it. I just took it out and put a different one in. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9fU5J"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can’t do that with a modern center stack. You can’t say, as the user, “I don’t like this,” or, say I bought a $60,000 Polestar 2. It has been on the road for five years. The computer is falling behind. Do you see a future in which people can replace the computers in their cars, the way that you might get a new phone or you might get a new smartwatch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UREiPo"&gt;To replace the computer is a difficult thing. And in the past, it was already the same. To a certain degree, technology at some point will age. What is so great about the system today is that you actually can upgrade it and it can actually download new software over the air. And that is, indeed, an amazing experience. And that makes cars that can’t do that suddenly feel really old. That’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hjemg"&gt;But one thing that you can do, you actually can run different apps. And for example, one of the great things, you can go and use a better route planner as your navigation instead of Google Maps. In the future, there will be other navigation apps as well. So you can make your choices. And there are providers that come in from other corners that give you an alternative choice. You can listen to your music from Spotify. There are choices and there’s an open system where different apps are running and you can make your selection as a consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mglj0h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. But the hardware doesn’t change. How long should a Polestar 2 last?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUGO4U"&gt;Designing a product for forever will be very, very difficult. That is where I saw some studies, and it is sometimes really, really difficult to keep a system that open that you permanently will try to upgrade it, and you at some point realize, well, it doesn’t economically make sense anymore because you start rebuilding the whole thing. And at some point, the physical elements and electric components, after a couple of decades, this is just not up-to-date. Fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yAE5u"&gt;So the capability of the car today to, through software updates, be renewed and adapt is actually a big, big step to keep the electronics and the car in sync with the physical product, and the batteries actually last an incredibly long time. The car is one of the long-lasting goods. You will replace your computer and your telephone far more often than your car. So, that the electronics and the software in the car became updateable over the air is a major step to actually make the car not feel old too early when the mechanics and everything are still working very well. So for that reason, I think we actually made a major improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JLFyV"&gt;Nevertheless, at some point in time, in 30, 40 years, this car, after it having been a second- and third-hand car, might reach the border of where this is still appropriate technology. Okay. Fair enough, that we cannot stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28RydZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forty years is high. That’s much more than I was expecting. To be very reductive, if I have a five-year-old smartphone, I know it’s time that the apps won’t run on it. The processor is old. The battery might be decaying. It’s time to get a new smartphone. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZX8Q8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But with a five-year-old car, there’s nothing to me that says it’s time to get a new car. That car is probably still working just fine, but the software in it, the smartphone part of it, the center stack, is on the same pace as the computer industry. So now I’m driving a car that has a five-year-old smartphone in the center of it, and that part I can’t replace. Do you see that coming, that you’ll eventually be able to replace just the part of the car that needs to keep pace with the smartphone industry that it’s built on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqKt7a"&gt;I believe in five years time, this is still a damn great product and the software and stuff will be absolutely still appropriate. That there might be a newer product at some point in time where you feel certain features and certain functionality is maybe more tempting for you, fair enough. Having said that, that doesn’t mean that your car being six, seven years old suddenly feels inappropriate, as I very much believe that that technology will keep quite a high value over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Egu26"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You talked a lot about the design of the Polestar 2 and rethinking it and making it look athletic. When I look at cars, the exterior design of cars can be timeless. Then you sit down in a car that’s 10 or 15 years old, and the screen in the middle is small and the graphics are bad. And you’re like, “This is dating the car more than the design trends of the moment.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBaoz9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re a designer. I’m wondering how you see that tension.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="whJOie"&gt;I don’t think that that is totally true. Culture at times is changing, and the car that is five, six, seven years old, definitely, you can tell that this time has passed into [the] exterior as well. They might be still appealing, and that is what I love about the car industry, that they’re actually not this throwaway kind of aesthetics and products. But nevertheless, you can always tell. So I think it’s pretty much in sync.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KQx8S"&gt;When I was choosing that profession of designer, I was actually not necessarily that car fanatic, that I could only have imagined becoming a car designer. But what I loved about that industry was that you actually spent that much decent time to make a product really, really mature and great, and that you would make it not age that quickly, that you actually cherish that it’s quite a lot of money that it costs, and it should last a long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5LKmr"&gt;That aspect, we still value quite highly here in the car industry. I feel on pretty safe ground there. And we’d rather have that attitude, how you will build a house and how you invest into a house, and that you respect that this is something where you put lots of resources and stuff in, and that you try to make it really long-lasting. I think that’s a really good aspect of the car industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwWa0N"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the big things that’s changing in the car industry is our relationship to charging the electric car. I bring it up because it feels like one of those things that if you buy a Polestar 2 now, your experience in driving and using and charging it today will be very different than it is five years from now. That infrastructure is building. Regardless, whenever we cover any car that’s not a Tesla, our readers come to us and say, “Well, Tesla has a superior charging network. Why would we buy anything that isn’t a Tesla?” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sK55c8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You talked about building Polestar as a brand more than a car company. Tesla is a dominant brand. It’s run by Elon Musk who says whatever he wants on Twitter whenever he wants. So there’s a brand element to competing with Tesla. And then, there’s just a very tangible “people think their charging network is superior,” and that’s the reason to buy a Tesla. Tell me about charging first and then tell me about competing with the brand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsMKhB"&gt;Well, once you drive an electric car, you realize that charging is, for most days of the year, not an issue at all. And for most people never will be, because they have it fully charged every morning in front of their door, and you actually have that advantage of never, ever having to go to a petrol station. That’s awesome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CCNdl"&gt;Yes, if you do a trip to a destination that is much further away, a town that you visit when you have to charge in between, there’s actually, in most regions in Europe, I can tell and definitely within America as well, you will find that place. It needs a bit more planning at the moment. You have to make sure that you checked it before, I acknowledge that, but it’s definitely, today, possible to do that trip. There are situations, in wintertime, going to a faraway ski resort, yes, I see that there will be situations where it’s still a hassle and why not everybody is ready to drive electric cars and maybe if it’s their only car, that I totally acknowledge. We try to help it, but it will still take a couple of years until we have total convenience and for that time being, Tesla definitely has invested a lot of money in their charging network, but I nevertheless cannot see that that is the future, because if each and every car company on the planet would do the same, we would have a parallel network of thousands of charging stations and it wouldn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLEABE"&gt;We have to, all together, work on an open charging network so that we really make a meaningful investment into the future and that’s what we try to develop and support, and just now made a really good offer over summer for each of our customers to use as well here in Europe. &lt;a href="https://ionity.eu"&gt;IONITY&lt;/a&gt; charges us a really, really attractive rate and stuff and that’s how we reached, already, a quite good status. I can see that discussion over the next two, three years will totally disappear because petrol stations will have to switch to provide electric charging and that is where, naturally, demand will create the right infrastructure. It’s an initial thing that we have to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1uWCH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you talked to Tesla about opening up the Supercharger network, about participating with them or having them participate with you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jn5FbJ"&gt;Well, there have been talks in the past and I’m sure there will be talks in the future. They sometimes say they will open it and let’s see if they, at some point, really will do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ktlozo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you ever think of just going crazy on Twitter to compete with Elon Musk and build the Polestar brand the way that he builds the Tesla brand?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEKKVM"&gt;No, I don’t think that is my style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w29GE9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you think about competing with Tesla as a brand? Tesla famously does no marketing. They’re a very different kind of company.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwv4Dx"&gt;You have to be authentic and, that’s maybe his way of being authentic, and fine, we have to be our way authentic, and we have to be as a brand as authentic as possible and I think we should never, ever try to imitate somebody [but] to see, who are we? Let people participate in our story and that is, I think, what we really followed the way of the last years, that we make people understand why we’re doing things, what we believe in, and try to share the joy and the passion about what we create and try to make that better with the people giving us feedback. That’s our way and we are not a brand that would put a specific person into the limelight for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzAuOw"&gt;It’s a different way of building it, and having said that, it’s still fairly individual and I think a colorful brand. I think that we will never [be] shy of expressing an opinion. We went very bold out and declared the end of the combustion age and said goodbye to that. We were very bold in declaring that it’s our way, going with Google Android. We have very clearly stated that we dislike the way of compensating for CO2 emissions, that we truly believe that the way to zero emissions is something that we have to do without compensation and really make it happen over the next nine years that we have a zero emission car. I think that’s where we made our points and feel that we built our brand around these beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuFutV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much do you think you have to pay attention to the broader political and regulatory climate? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370302/polestar-carbon-neutral-electric-car-no-offsets"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have called carbon offsets a cop-out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. You say you’re just going to build a zero-emissions car without buying any offsets. It looks like the Biden administration is going to approve an infrastructure plan that doesn’t have as much money in it for EV charging as people had initially hoped. Is that stuff you’re tracking and responding to? Is that stuff you think that the broader industry will have to react to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKFDMo"&gt;I think we, of course, have to take part in the discourse. We cannot shy away from that. We are not politicians. That’s their job, but definitely us as a company in the industry, we have to have our opinion and make sure we have our voice in it and that’s where we participate in the discourse, where we express our opinion and definitely try to push and say, “Come on guys. We cannot always play safe.” We have to have a position. For example, when we made our life-cycle assessment of the Polestar 2 public, I mean, of course, it was a step where we knew that people will abuse these arguments against us and where we say, “Yeah, come on, we have to survive that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIvvEK"&gt;It’s not a short-term thing. We have to take that fight, that discussion and it might not always be sunshine, but we cannot shy away from that. It’s definitely needed and we always said the car industry has to face reality and we have to be, for our customers, clear in our opinion and transparent about it. I think that is what people definitely expect from a modern brand, that you don’t put your head into the sand and just try to be as smooth as ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pbFdW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve mentioned before in previous interviews that you didn’t have any major consumer impact or cancellations through the pandemic, which is great, but one of the big issues coming out of the pandemic &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is the chip shortage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, which is hitting the auto industry particularly hard. How has that affected Polestar?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsRQIY"&gt;So far so good, but it’s definitely an issue and it is a week-by-week review of where we are, do we have the pieces together for the production? It’s definitely not predictable over the course of the next weeks and months how much the effect will be or not. This is definitely where the whole industry is in incredible difficulty in planning. [It] became a short period where you can do your planning, that it is absolutely difficult to have any prediction how it will play out over the course of the next half year. So far, we managed together with Volvo to get halfway decent through it, but definitely we have, as much as everybody else in the industry, to really monitor it week after week while we keep the production together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ib2H1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has that affected your plans for the Polestar 3? Which I think last I checked, late 2021 was the date. Are you still on track for the Polestar 3?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96HGXS"&gt;Yes. We are on track with Polestar 3. That has not affected the plans for that car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKNN7R"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the Polestar 3 is your SUV, correct?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xslnW7"&gt;Yes. The Polestar 3 will be our first SUV in the car line and using that new electric platform that will be out and first with this car, and be a really awesome car. I’m so much looking forward to [it] for lots of reasons. As we said, “Look, this is actually the design statement, the direction where we are going,” and the Polestar 3 will be full-fledged in this great Polestar language and that will not be that standard SUV, like you know it today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqOgGT"&gt;We really believe that the SUV has to change a bit when it comes to the electric age. You cannot be that high and upright in the air and at the same time, just making that coupe SUV is, as well, not our style. So, it will be a really nice, cool design statement. I mean, it’s an almost five-meter car. It’s a real big SUV for us Europeans. I know in the US you wouldn’t call it big yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9oWYj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re a car designer. What is going on with the front end of cars? You’re designing an SUV. Are you going to put a giant grill on it or those huge BMW nostrils? What is happening? Can you stop it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMH0Hd"&gt;Well, we will not go into that. The issue is of course, a car needs a face. You have to recognize the face, but you cannot just simply continue making this big open air intake, as a fake air intake—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PryJKR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But do you go to the bar with the designers at BMW and ask them, “Why are you doing this?” Do you tell your designers not to do that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Djuo5G"&gt;And they will come up with lots of reasons why that is good for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOwQEe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;... It’s a small community, I’m wondering if you have insight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ois7ip"&gt;Well, we will use the &lt;a href="https://about.polestar.com/news/precept-smartzone/"&gt;Smart Zone&lt;/a&gt; and that is what we showed, that you can see on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/26/21455850/polestar-precept-electric-car-concept-android-production"&gt;the Polestar Precept&lt;/a&gt;. We said, “Come on.” They aren’t just sensors and cameras and radars, and we nicely collect them under that transparent shield and that will be, instead of an air intake, we will have a Smart Zone and it looks super cool and electric and high-tech. So, you have to go along and I mean, instead of just having no face, I mean, of course you have to create a modern face that gives the new technology a meaning. So, we collected all of that nicely in what we call the Smart Zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2vWXA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think that car design will get more radical as we get away from the expectations around what gas cars look like and we go towards electric cars?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVFDbD"&gt;It was always a challenge to the designers to actually dare to not just simply continue on a path [where] your experience was successful in the past. I mean, that always has been the challenge that you have to dare to do that next step and yes, there’s no guarantee for success, but you cannot just simply recook the old recipe, and especially in times when you have the great opportunity of new technology coming. That’s always a driver of new aesthetics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="px32gm"&gt;So, of course you have to embrace it and really dare to take it, but at the same time, not do it superficially and just create a fancy new look to look different. It has to be rooted in the technology and the need for it and how you interpret it. It needs a really thorough, intellectual process of working it into something meaningful. So, whatever superficial styling comes, it will never work in the long run. You really have to do a decent job and do your homework and really try to make sense out of the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIMZHQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s great. Well, Thomas, thank you so much for being on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I really appreciate the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="leSvFz"&gt;It was a pleasure. Thanks a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
