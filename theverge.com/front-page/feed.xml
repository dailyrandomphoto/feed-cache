    <title>Tesla’s new Boombox feature will let car owners fart at unsuspecting neighbors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PGZbMpTkuP96LleFsOaRXqoftlQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68580788/tesla.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ClVxfl"&gt;Tesla’s new holiday update will finally give people the ability to use a new Boombox mode, which can broadcast custom audio on the outside of the car (hence the name). As is common with new Tesla features, Boombox combines real utility with lowbrow humor: owners can use fart and goat sounds in lieu of normal, boring honking sounds car horns usually make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9reYW"&gt;The mode rolled out with a number of other updates as part of Tesla’s &lt;a href="https://forums.tesla.com/discussion/180205/boombox-horn-now-farts-and-much-more"&gt;firmware 2020.48.26 update&lt;/a&gt;, and is something Tesla fans have eagerly anticipated. In the new mode, which can be seen at the timestamped section in the video below, several sounds are available for Tesla owners through the Toybox section they can use in place of a regular horn: goat baaing, applause, a little “tada” clip, someone speaking posh and, of course, the fart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NbYzER"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P6WeD7L2s0E?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=294&amp;amp;start=294" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C0sShI"&gt;While Tesla owners have been able to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/listen-to-a-tesla-make-6-farting-noises-on-demand/"&gt;create fart sounds inside the car&lt;/a&gt; for some time, the Boombox mode effectively allows people with more recent models to use the built-in speaker that blasts audio to poor unsuspecting people outside of the car. Tesla cars manufactured after September 1st , 2019 have the speaker built-in. The speakers were added because the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, “required electric cars that were silent to omit some noise to alert pedestrians,” &lt;a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-elevator-music-elon-musk/"&gt;according to&lt;em&gt; Teslarati&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Here’s a description of what Boombox mode does, &lt;a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-holiday-update-2020-release-notes/"&gt;thanks to &lt;em&gt;Teslarati&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="2ZPVfr"&gt;Turn your car into a boombox and entertain a crowd with your media player when parked. You can also customize the sound your car makes when you press the horn, drive the car or when your car is moving with Summon. Select an option from the dropdown menu or insert your own USB device and save up to five custom sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cIyCuJ"&gt;Farting isn’t just reserved for honking. An update to Tesla’s “Emissions Testing Mode,” which is code for fart sequencing, means cars can now fart whenever, and people outside won’t be able to escape the sounds.&lt;em&gt; Teslarati &lt;/em&gt;adds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="dxBqx1"&gt;Emissions Testing Mode can be used outside the car. To setup, select your desired sound and place the cushion on the external speaker. When ready, play selected sound by pressing the left scroll wheel button or using the turn signal. To access, tap the Application Launcher &amp;gt; Toybox &amp;gt; Emissions Testing Mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="c2JFIn"&gt;Alongside being able to fart, people can also use Tesla’s Boombox feature to harass neighbors in other ways. For example, now a Tesla can emit the same sound as an ice cream truck, based on the video above. So if someone really wants to play a cruel prank on kids this summer, just drive around the neighborhood playing a jovial song that makes children think of ice cream cones and popsicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQF9t7"&gt;Being able to upload five tracks also means people can drive their Tesla vehicles around town with whatever audio they want, apparently. When one person asked Tesla CEO Elon Musk if they could drive their car to Ludacris’ classic ‘00s hit, “Move Bitch,” Musk pointed to the custom upload option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mHvbni"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You can upload custom music/sounds&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1342575352392998912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 25, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mt3Oa8"&gt;There are plenty of other additions that came with this year’s holiday update. Car owners have access to three new games — &lt;em&gt;The Battle of Polytopia, Cat Quest, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Solitaire &lt;/em&gt;— they can play while parked. Supercharge display improvements and scheduled departure improvements are also included in the firmware update. A full list of updates can be read on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/kk2yi4/20204826_holiday_software_update_megathread/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fknjLj"&gt;Maybe it’s the holiday spirit in me, but allowing your car to fart properly is quite beautiful. It’s like something ripped right out of &lt;em&gt;Shrek — &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owTGBSmeKOA"&gt;better out than in!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>So you got a 5G phone, but is your plan ready? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w_lwL3NUDvxHGb7l3SNRe6r20AM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68580559/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;5G in the US isn’t mind-bogglingly fast, but it is going to get better | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Your guide to the current state of 5G carrier plans in the US, what they cost, and whether it’s worth upgrading your plan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0STAxL"&gt;You’re the proud owner of a new 5G phone — congratulations! We’ve got some bad news, though: if you live in the US, 5G &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/study-finds-that-us-5g-speeds-are-slower-than-14-other-countries"&gt;probably isn’t going to be the mind-bogglingly fast experience&lt;/a&gt; that you’ve been promised. For most regions, it’s just a little faster than the 4G speeds we’re used to using. But here’s the good news: 5G is going to get better, so if you have a 5G phone you may want to make sure your plan delivers it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUbp57"&gt;If you got a phone recently, there’s a good chance it supports 5G. Pretty much every new phone in 2021 — with the exception of some budget models — will offer some form of 5G support. Whatever your preferred brand or operating system, 5G is coming your way soon if you don’t have it already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1ylmN"&gt;Your phone is ready for the next big thing, but what about your data plan? Across the board, the major US carriers’ unlimited plans already include access to 5G. However, carriers offer a mix of 5G bands that vary in speed and coverage. It’s complicated, as all things 5G have been since it first appeared in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ov9vPM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s complicated, as all things 5G have been since it first appeared in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AeQgSC"&gt;Consider this your guide to the current state of 5G and data plans in the US — which ones include 5G, which don’t, what variety of 5G they include, and whether you should consider upgrading depending on your carrier’s implementation of 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7M860"&gt;One important note for those with a 5G phone: even if you discover that your current plan does include 5G and it’s available in your area, you may still need to upgrade to a new SIM card if you moved it over from an older device. A SIM card that was activated in a 4G device will still work with a 5G device, but you may have trouble connecting to the 5G network. Check with your carrier if you’re not seeing the little 5G logo pop up on your screen and you think you should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6877V"&gt;For comparison purposes, the prices listed in this article are for one line of service per month before taxes and fees. Additional lines bring down the monthly cost per line, but your total bill increases, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5eQLb4"&gt;Verizon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E2ySFp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: Unless you live in one of the few areas with Verizon’s truly fast UW 5G, we don’t think there’s a reason to change your plan just yet. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="yeRjtT"&gt;Verizon offers two varieties of 5G, the faster of which it calls “Ultra Wideband” (also referred to as millimeter wave or mmWave) and is available only in certain parts of certain cities. It’s scarce, but it is mind-bogglingly fast, and you’ll see a 5G UW logo on your phone screen if your phone is using that network. Oh, and 5G UW signals don’t reach indoors for the most part, so if you’re spending most of your time inside your house or apartment right now, you probably wouldn’t pick it up even if you live in a place where it’s available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="vsmFJ8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ultra Wideband is scarce but mind-bogglingly fast&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="AxSy3H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10248231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wnDLVU"&gt;“Nationwide” is the company’s other 5G, a low-band variety that’s slower than mmWave but offers much broader coverage. In fact, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/heres-why-verizon-iphone-users-must-turn-off-5g-right-now"&gt;sometimes a bit slower than 4G&lt;/a&gt;, so if you’re not happy with the 5G speeds you’re getting, you may want to try limiting your phone to LTE and see if things improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wc9Ye8"&gt;Check &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fcoverage-map%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s coverage map&lt;/a&gt; to see what’s available in your area. If you do live in a city with UW 5G, be sure to zoom &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way in to see the exact areas and streets with coverage — they’re marked in a darker shade of red that will appear once you zoom in close enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zt3rAT"&gt;Verizon’s Shared Data (data capped) plans and its $80-per-month basic unlimited plan include the lower-tier Nationwide 5G only. For access to UW in addition to Nationwide 5G, you’ll need at least the $90 “Play More” unlimited plan. Verizon offers $10 off those monthly prices if you enroll in auto pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkrFa3"&gt;Verizon also includes 5G on its prepaid data plans, which start at $65 per month for unlimited data or $40 per month for a 5GB data-capped plan. There’s a $5 monthly discount for auto pay as well. For now, UW 5G isn’t available for prepaid customers, but Verizon says that’s changing in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="H6XaJU"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dGY28e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: Don’t worry about switching up your AT&amp;amp;T plan for 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Rje9sa"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s history with 5G is… fraught. Early on, the company marketed what was essentially LTE technology as “5G E” and (rightfully) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277484/att-fake-5g-e-network-lte-study"&gt;caught a lot of flak for it&lt;/a&gt;. You won’t see that term in any of the company’s marketing these days, but AT&amp;amp;T customers still might see a 5G E logo on their phone screen when connected to this service. If you do see it, know that what you’re getting is not really 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;
&lt;aside id="P0HVlL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G really isn’t worth upgrading for yet, but if you’re on any of the company’s unlimited plans, you wouldn’t need to anyway&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="gXk39F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10248430"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C6XNQm"&gt;Outside of that debacle, AT&amp;amp;T has invested in its true 5G offerings, which are structured similarly to Verizon’s: a fast mmWave version called 5G Plus in limited places and slower but more widespread standard 5G coverage. However, 5G Plus may be even more scarce than Verizon’s UW 5G. The company doesn’t provide any coverage maps for it, and it says only that it is deployed in “select innovation zones” in parts of certain cities. Testers for &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/fastest-mobile-networks/2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;’s annual mobile network test&lt;/a&gt; didn’t encounter 5G Plus in cities where AT&amp;amp;T offers it. The carrier’s standard 5G is of the low-band variety similar to Verizon’s Nationwide, and &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; testers also found that it sometimes lagged behind 4G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCcuum"&gt;All of this is to say that AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G really isn’t worth upgrading your plan for yet, but if you’re on any of the company’s unlimited plans, you wouldn’t need to anyway. Both 5G and 5G Plus are included in all postpaid unlimited plans, which start at $75 per month ($65 with auto pay). The Unlimited Plus prepaid plan also includes it at $75 per month ($60 with auto pay). AT&amp;amp;T’s only postpaid 4GB data-capped plan doesn’t include 5G and neither do its other prepaid plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNimDg"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T may have had a somewhat rocky start with 5G, but the technology will improve. And for now at least, the company isn’t charging a premium for its fastest 5G variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5N4Cb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fmaps%2Fwireless-coverage.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T 5G coverage map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZW3lLd"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="z7bVnx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: All of T-Mobile’s postpaid plans include 5G. If you’re on the base unlimited plan and live in a congested area you might find you have more reliable access to 5G by upgrading. But no need if you don’t notice slowdowns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PxCgUp"&gt;Of the three big carriers, T-Mobile might be in the best position to bring truly faster-than-LTE 5G to the most people — but it doesn’t seem to be there quite yet. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s efforts have been concentrated around high and low-band offerings. T-Mobile offers both, too, but it’s also working on converting Sprint’s former midband frequencies to 5G. This might be a sweet spot: not as fast as the mmWave stuff, but genuinely faster than 4G. &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/race-to-5g-5g-limps-to-nationwide-status"&gt;Recent analysis&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; shows the network isn’t delivering on that promise just yet, but T-Mobile promised to extend midband 5G to 100 million people by the end of this year and doesn’t look to be slowing down any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpSW0x"&gt;All of the company’s postpaid plans include 5G, starting with the $65 per month ($60 with autopay) Essentials plan. One caveat: customers on that base-level plan are the first ones subject to slowdowns when the network is congested. T-Mobile does not offer 5G on its prepaid plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="wjFqsx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10248478"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TFa17r"&gt;For now, we think T-Mobile customers can stay put on their current plan. Essentials plan customers who are happy with their network speeds and don’t notice slowdowns probably wouldn’t gain much from upgrading just yet. But it will be interesting to see if T-Mobile can make good on its ambitious promises to bring meaningfully fast 5G to more of its customers in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uA0ipT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcoverage%2Fcoverage-map&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile 5G coverage map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m4L2q7"&gt;US Cellular&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tQnXJX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: All plans (pre- and postpaid) include access to 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJEhwO"&gt;US Cellular 5G is of the low-band variety, so it’s still only a little faster than 4G. But the good news is if you’re on US Cellular, you have access to the company’s 5G: all plans (pre- and postpaid) include it. And if you’re in a rural area, US Cellular is more likely to offer 5G to you now, while major carriers’ coverage is still mostly concentrated around bigger cities. So there’s not much to deliberate here, if you have a 5G phone and your area is covered, you should be able to connect. We just wouldn’t advise anyone to switch to US Cellular only because it offers 5G where they live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xH1tu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uscellular.com%2Fcoverage-map&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US Cellular coverage map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x37LzS"&gt;MVNOs: Cricket, Metro by T-Mobile, etc.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jpsQGR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: If you’re happy with your MVNO plan, don’t switch things up just for 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAFgq4"&gt;Most mobile virtual network operators, or MVNOs, do include 5G on their plans. Cricket’s unlimited plan offers 5G access using AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network ($60 per month for one line). All Mint Mobile plans include access to 5G on T-Mobile’s network, and Metro by T-Mobile prepaid plans come with 5G access, starting with a 10GB plan for $40 / month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rpGfnM"&gt;A significant caveat though: since MVNOs don’t own the networks they use, carrier subscribers are likely to get preferential treatment when there’s congestion. If you’re looking for the best of the best speeds, one of the big three might be the way to go. But again, that reality is still a ways off. Chances are, you wouldn’t be upgrading to a night-and-day experience if you did switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gExXvj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9hcLa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Investor sues CD Projekt over bungled CyberPunk 2077 launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g1YHS5n_CRqwrNIV14N7hY2fgz4=/31x0:969x625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68580240/cyberpunk_2077_artwork.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="frh1KV"&gt;The anticipated CyberPunk 2077 launch wasn’t just a disaster for gamers, but for the game’s investors, too. A lawsuit &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.805901/gov.uscourts.cacd.805901.1.0.pdf"&gt;filed yesterday&lt;/a&gt; against CD Projekt, the company behind Cyberpunk, claims investors were misled about the game’s performance ahead of its release, causing a significant stock price drop and losses. CD Projekt allegedly failed to convey that the game was “virtually unplayable,” the lawsuit states, and instead marketed it as a success with a few issues that would go unnoticed by players. The plaintiff, Andrew Trampe, is looking to include other investors in the suit to turn it into a class action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="La6YBd"&gt;Since the game’s launch earlier this month, it’s been plagued with bugs, prompting retailers and console makers to offer full refunds. GameStop is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195420/gamestop-cyberpunk-2077-returns-even-if-opened"&gt;accepting returns&lt;/a&gt;, even if people opened the game, which goes against its typical policy, and Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;pulled the game last week&lt;/a&gt; and began processing digital refunds for unsatisfied buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKYAPf"&gt;Still, the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195728/cyberpunk-2077-sales-copies-sold-launch-refunds"&gt;sold&lt;/a&gt; more than 13 million copies in the two weeks since its launch, making it one of the best selling games of the year. Many of those sales came from preorders after a much hyped marketing campaign, which helped CD Projekt &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/11/22170468/cyberpunk-2077-sales-revenue-cd-projekt"&gt;recoup&lt;/a&gt; the nearly decade-long costs of making the game.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uMIoac"&gt;Whether you recently bought or soon plan to buy an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"&gt;an Xbox Series S&lt;/a&gt;, or are sticking with your Xbox One console, it’s sure nice to have a stack of good games to play. And what better way to do that than to barely spend any money at all? Individual games, while sometimes worth the cost, can be pricey. Instead, you can get a ton of value out of a Game Pass Ultimate subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwNI7G"&gt;For $14.99 per month (&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate%2Fcfq7ttc0khs0%3Ficid%3DXboxDealsCat_TopStripe_GamePassUltimate%26activetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1 for each of your first three months if you’re a new subscriber&lt;/a&gt;), the all-in-one Game Pass Ultimate subscription gets you access to a growing number of games to download and exclusive discounts on popular games. You also get the ability to download games on consoles and Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4j5zjs"&gt;If you only want to run games on a PC, you can subscribe to the base Game Pass for $9.99 a month (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%2Fpc-games&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22165489%2Fbest-games-xbox-one-series-x-s-consoles#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1 for the first month if you’re a new subscriber&lt;/a&gt;). With that, you also get to download a growing number of games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3r7AD"&gt;With either subscription, you can access games from EA that were previously only available with a separate subscription. They also grant you the ability to play multiplayer games online with friends (where supported). Signing up will get you instant access to six of the 10 games below (and we’ve included the individual prices, just in case). The others listed here that are not included in a Game Pass are, however, worth purchasing by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

(Note: pricing was accurate at the time of publishing but may change.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KsOlTm"&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aoHQ5tQYkuFnEPhYik8ZZ48ubYc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22026067/apps.32669.14427542363794747.182f58ca_3a24_4a65_93bd_cdd320a35776.62f8350b_e46c_4862_b8bc_7f9cf970fbea.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sega&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NIw43w"&gt;The seventh &lt;em&gt;Yakuza &lt;/em&gt;game in the series is a big departure from the rest. It’s a turn-based roleplaying game (RPG) instead of being a straight beat-em-up that’s laced with some RPG elements, like the rest of the games in the franchise have been. But &lt;em&gt;Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt; is definitely not your average RPG. You can freely roam around a fictionalized version of Japan’s Yokohama district, meeting quirky people along the way and going on memorable quests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wyhlay"&gt;While it’s not on Game Pass, the game does support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250334/xbox-series-x-free-games-smart-delivery-one-upgrade-list-ea"&gt;Smart Delivery&lt;/a&gt;, so you’ll get improved performance by using the Xbox One version of the game on one of the newer Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5z9pyC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Yakuza: Like a Dragon","description":"Seventh Yakuza game in the series","label":"$60 at Best Buy","url":"https://shop-links.co/1726078908696077326"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="IugrGC"&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Night City overhead view in Cyberpunk 2077" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YrjuV8r1c7AYh_6FrfObA7rMvm4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150423/Cyberpunk2077_Above_it_all_RGB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Gy2Vz8"&gt;The long-awaited open-world RPG from CD Projekt Red was worth the wait, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia"&gt;Adi Robertson’s review&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to dip into the world of Night City for an RPG that’s vaster and deeper than most other games out there, check this one out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zhIYd"&gt;This game is compatible with the Xbox One, as well as the Xbox Series X / S consoles, though a proper next-gen version of the game is still in the works and will come as a free update for people who bought the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GoQTIk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Cyberpunk 2077","description":"Open-world RPG","label":"$60 at Best Buy","url":"https://shop-links.co/1726078889281949360"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="yTWIMa"&gt;Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 Remaster&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="THPS" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S7NbsRTAGNZWtHmB7Zyz5hVNl-o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21848122/New_Skater_NHuston_FINAL.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Activision&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 &amp;amp; 2 Remaster&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bO3Ida"&gt;My colleague Andrew Webster &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21419054/tony-hawk-pro-skater-1-2-review-xbox-pc-ps4"&gt;calls the remake of &lt;em&gt;THPS 1 &amp;amp; 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the “perfect remaster.” If you have any affinity for these classic skateboarding titles from the heyday of the original PlayStation, you owe it to yourself to pick this up. It features most of the same music, and the skate parks and player models have all been remastered to today’s graphical standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxXupB"&gt;It’s not available on Game Pass, but the Xbox One version of the game is compatible on the new Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="n7jlv8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2","description":"Classic skateboarding titles","label":"$40 at Best Buy","url":"https://shop-links.co/1726078822970089625"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="hYdq4p"&gt;Ori and the Will of the Wisps&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ori and the Will of the Wisps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P8cFp7yzmCM4qPtOBx7q6NhFJs4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19784918/inkwaterMarshInGame.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Moon Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ori and the Will of the Wisps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e3mCYb"&gt;The latest adventure featuring Ori&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is even better than the original. It offers similarly excellent platforming, but new to the series is some surprisingly good melee combat. The team responsible for the game crafted amazing vistas that will look especially good on a 4K television, and it all looks fantastic in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="thYznh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ori and the Will of the Wisps&lt;/em&gt; is available for Xbox One via Game Pass, and there’s now a version that’s optimized to run on the Xbox Series X / S consoles that unlocks the frame rate for smoother gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Xm4Isv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Ori and the Will of the Wisps","description":"Available with Game Pass","label":"$30 at Xbox","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps%2F9N8CD0XZKLP4%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="tPKaJv"&gt;Gears Tactics&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8_EolUVbChxUhPSo_5VkxJN8RtA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21979567/GearsTactics_BossBattle_3840X2160_final.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Splash Damage \ Xbox Game Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gear Tactics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWWGmm"&gt;There’s nothing wrong with the traditional &lt;em&gt;Gears&lt;/em&gt; games that have a third-person perspective, like the excellent &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;. But if you want to try something new, &lt;em&gt;Gears Tactics&lt;/em&gt; takes the combat and turns it into a turn-based game where each move is a roll of the dice. You’ll have to play a little smarter, making sure to support each of your characters so they don’t get overwhelmed on the battlefield. Like the title implies, you need to be tactical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9ZLOp"&gt;This game is available on Game Pass, and owners of the Xbox Series X / S consoles can enjoy an updated version with enhanced performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="63JXq5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Gears Tactics","description":"Available with Game Pass","label":"$60 at Xbox","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fgears-tactics%2F9NN3HCKW5TPC%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="jWqppm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"We built a 2020 time capsule out of synthetic DNA — here’s how","url":"https://www.theverge.com/science/22188122/dna-data-storage-synthetic-time-capsule"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="kQTRm2"&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oAX6FYXPsuamdwF2oJG5g2PCaqc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21974389/Ekxrh7dU8AAYfBP.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xbox Game Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LWk6Wn"&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fEosVU"&gt;This list obviously wouldn’t be complete without an appearance from &lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection&lt;/em&gt;. In an alternate universe, &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; would probably be on this list, but alas, that game has been delayed until later in 2021. With or without it, the &lt;em&gt;Master Chief Collection&lt;/em&gt; is essential for any first-person shooter fan. It contains the original &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; through the fourth iteration, along with &lt;em&gt;Halo: ODST&lt;/em&gt; to complete the package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wK5gsb"&gt;It’s available on Game Pass, and like &lt;em&gt;Gears Tactics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ori&lt;/em&gt;, it’s been updated to look even better on the latest Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EFfNNu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Halo: Master Chief Collection","description":"Available with Game Pass","label":"$40 at Xbox","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fhalo-the-master-chief-collection%2F9ntm9hxnlszx%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="IjJPqc"&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MK6ng_gQJcGQ2pnBblz3d2pHk9A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154740/media_stasis_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bungie&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LZXYiK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; is another semipermanent fixture on our “best of” lists because Bungie keeps updating it. The latest downloadable expansion, “&lt;em&gt;Beyond Light&lt;/em&gt;,” was recently released, adding to an already bustling list of things to do in the game. If you enjoy first-person shooters and want to dip a toe into what it feels like to play an MMO game without the monthly cost, check out &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QdKbd"&gt;The base game and the new &lt;em&gt;Beyond Light&lt;/em&gt; expansion are available via Game Pass. Bungie recently patched &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; to look and perform better on the Xbox Series X / S consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8nixs9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Destiny 2: Beyond Light","description":"Available with Game Pass","label":"$40 from Xbox","url":"https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/destiny-2"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="3WSXsT"&gt;Forza Horizon 4&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ong8uz3fhIrcxcrUuzJ3vAY4_FA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13200189/edecbd5e_4a92_4811_8a84_0fdc6e4baae3.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g0zfhR"&gt;This game isn’t particularly new, but it’s a unique one for this list. &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4&lt;/em&gt; is a racing sim that lets you go off-road in the UK, without the overly serious tone of games like &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;Forza Motorsport&lt;/em&gt; games. Whether or not you’ve had a history of enjoying racing games in the past, &lt;em&gt;Horizon 4&lt;/em&gt; is a well-designed game that’s fun to jump into for a race or two, or just some mindless driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pf2IJ8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4&lt;/em&gt; is available on Game Pass for all modern Xbox consoles, and it has received a patch for the Series X / S consoles to boost the performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PPDC0h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Forza Horizon 4","description":"Available with Game Pass","label":"$60 at Xbox","url":"https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/forza-horizon-4"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="ze3rGP"&gt;Tetris Effect: Connected&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6SJtPR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt; is a zen-like experience, marrying the stacking of &lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt; with a rhythm-based game. Having the two together might not sound like much, but it’s something you should try. The new, Xbox-exclusive (until summer 2021) &lt;em&gt;Connected &lt;/em&gt;version of the game allows for local and online multiplayer that wasn’t available in the original &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OORMw3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect: Connected&lt;/em&gt; is available on Game Pass, so your subscription will let you jump right in. It’s compatible with all modern Xbox consoles, including the One and the Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GZUtx9"&gt;Respawn Entertainment is most famous for &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/em&gt;, but its free-to-play FPS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286834/apex-legends-review-ps4-xbox-pc-fortnite-battle-royale"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is &lt;/em&gt;a must-have for your new Xbox. Similar in design to other battle royale games, like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, this game is a competitive shooter where you only get one chance to climb to the top. But what sets &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;apart is its fluid gameplay, satisfying gun play, and character classes that you’re guaranteed to have fun experimenting with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSY8B5"&gt;This game recently received a next-gen patch that makes it perform better on the Series X / S consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US requires negative coronavirus test from UK travelers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="London And South East Enter ‘Tier 4’ As New Coronavirus Strain Detected" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YIyWxpPNl9YXZkcmfEg2tbYeZ9A=/0x0:6192x4128/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68579926/1230262290.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joseph Okpako/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RUv8X1"&gt;Anyone flying into the United States from the United Kingdom will have to test negative for COVID-19 within 72 hours before their flight, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s1224-CDC-to-require-negative-test.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. The agency cited concerns over a new variant of the coronavirus as the reason for the rule, which goes into effect Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKAKb4"&gt;The coronavirus, like all viruses, has regularly mutated as it has spread through the population. Most mutations don’t make a virus behave any differently, but this new variant, which emerged in the UK, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/health/coronavirus-uk-variant.html"&gt;does&lt;/a&gt; appear to spread more easily than other forms of the virus. It &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/21/health/new-covid-strain-uk.html"&gt;does not&lt;/a&gt; appear to make people sicker and does not seem to be more deadly, although researchers are still studying that question. Experts say the already authorized COVID-19 vaccines will likely still be effective against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="porBno"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Experts say the COVID-19 vaccines already authorized will probably still be effective&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lH3BM"&gt;The new variant is spreading quickly through London and southeast England. Prime Minister Boris Johnson put the area under stricter lockdown to contain it, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/uk-travel-ban-coronavirus-variant/index.html"&gt;dozens of countries&lt;/a&gt; have banned travelers from the UK. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXnPm2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-several-airlines-uk-test-new-york-bound-passengers-coronavirus-cuomo-says/"&gt;Two US states&lt;/a&gt;, New York and Washington, already have UK travel restrictions in place. British Airways, Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic agreed to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s request to test travelers flying into the state. Washington is asking people traveling from the UK to quarantine for 14 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HO7iqk"&gt;Anthony Fauci &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/531236-fauci-assume-new-covid-19-strain-is-in-us"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/em&gt; earlier this week that he wouldn’t recommend a full ban on travel from the UK, which he called “draconian.” Testing was a more realistic step, said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUzT67"&gt;Asking travelers to get COVID-19 tests is a more effective screen than temperature and symptom checks, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429462/white-house-trump-covid-airport-screening-security-temperature-check"&gt;don’t end up catching&lt;/a&gt; many sick people. Still, a test within three days of traveling won’t be a perfect net: someone could test negative a day before their trip and develop symptoms when they land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ib4Qp3"&gt;It’s possible that the new variant is already circulating in the US, Fauci said. “When you have this amount of spread within a place like the UK, you really need to assume that it’s here already.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQViCq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>9 great games from 2020 for your new PlayStation 5</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JbO4xbBsWDt5Pcm-kYEPYUFEM0M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68579883/vpavic_4278_20201030_0247.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IsCQ64"&gt;If you’re one of the lucky few who has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;snagged a PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; since it launched in early November — congratulations. Securing a next-gen console, especially Sony’s, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;has been no easy feat&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s no telling when buying one won’t involve a mad online rush that’s basically no different than a chaotic lottery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6o09xf"&gt;If you did secure a PS5, you’re probably wondering what exactly you can play on it. After all, next-gen consoles rarely launch with rich libraries of new games. Instead, game console makers tend to reserve a handful of launch titles to hold over the early adopters until at least a year or so into the device’s life cycle, when the development of new titles really starts to pick up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NisHwp"&gt;The good news is that the new consoles from both Microsoft and Sony are backward compatible with the last generation of hardware. That means you have a bunch of older games and cross-gen titles available to you, some of which have been optimized for the new hardware’s speedier solid-state drive and more powerful processor. And it’s worth mentioning that Sony does have some console exclusives, all of which are must-play games if you’re a new PS5 owner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iigIfd"&gt;Here’s a breakdown of the nine best games to play on your new console over the holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtJlxA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve rounded up our favorite and most-used games, apps, and entertainment. Check out our app picks for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21951417"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21942553"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android phones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21943103"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows PCs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21952855"&gt;&lt;em&gt;M1-equipped Macs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; our favorite mobile games from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21942272"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21934070"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Play Pass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; and our top choices for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21929534"&gt;&lt;em&gt;gaming PCs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21941056"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21929530"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox One and Series X / S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21938238"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21941004"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. We’ve also listed our favorite streaming shows on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178393/disney-plus-hulu-espn-plus-best-shows-movies-recommendations"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22175140/best-netflix-shows-2020-streaming-recommendations-tv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Netflix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; some &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21951428"&gt;&lt;em&gt;great sci-fi books&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163667/2020-favorite-best-podcasts-tech-culture-apple-google-stitcher-soundcloud-spotify"&gt;&lt;em&gt;exciting new podcasts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. (Note: pricing was accurate at the time of publishing but may change.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oSXwNh"&gt;Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qKOq3Eec2fMutHoT3_acry3TnjE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22174858/MilesMorales_PS5_Combat_Legal_scaled.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IOIMvk"&gt;A standalone follow-up to Insomniac Games’ excellent 2018 &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; reboot,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549085/spider-man-miles-morales-review-ps5-ps4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has a lot going for it. It was developed natively for the PS5, meaning its visuals are breathtaking, and it takes full advantage of the new hardware’s benefits. So it has almost nonexistent load times and a full range of performance and visual modes that you can use to tailor your experience, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165569/spider-man-miles-morales-60fps-raytracing-new-mode-performance-rt"&gt;newly introduced “Performance RT” mode&lt;/a&gt; that achieves ray tracing at 60 frames per second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWYAYj"&gt;It’s also the first major studio game to feature the Black superhero in the role of Spider-Man, and its stellar writing and cinematic cutscenes make it a worthy narrative follow-up to the original in addition to just being a blast to play. Plus, the ultimate edition includes a fully remastered version of the 2018 release, now with the option to carry over your PS4 save file. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9LngnK"&gt;FromSoftware’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150718/demons-souls-remake-ps5-playstation-5-sony-game-of-the-year-2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;holds a special place in the hearts of FromSoftware fans everywhere. It was the first of many &lt;em&gt;Souls&lt;/em&gt; games, establishing the Japanese studio as a maker of some of the most punishing and captivating action RPGs ever made. The remake, from studio Bluepoint Games, holds the honor of being one of the only next-gen exclusives at launch, and its stunning visual makeover helps bring the 2009 classic’s unique and brutal combat to a modern canvas. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Astro’s Playroom " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6TLLcpo8Q8656QFRiEvzSq102Ps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22174865/astros_playroom_screenshot_13_disclaimer_en_06oct20.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BqPjIP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;joins &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; in being one of the very few next-gen-only releases to arrive with the PS5 this fall. It’s preloaded on the console for every user, so you don’t have to pay for it or even download it. It’s ready to go as soon as you boot up your device. And fittingly, it’s pretty much a love letter to both the PlayStation platform and the PS5 itself in cute video game form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idsfRT"&gt;The game takes place inside the innards of the new console, with different areas dedicated to various PS5 components and various portions of the game acting as a tech demo for the impressive new DualSense controller. But that doesn’t mean &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom &lt;/em&gt;isn’t fun to play. It is, in fact, a blast, and you should treat it as much more than a simple preloaded demo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kM1tz6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Astro’s Playroom","description":"Preloaded game","label":"Free with console","url":"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/astros-playroom/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="wUCDxJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"We built a 2020 time capsule out of synthetic DNA — here’s how","url":"https://www.theverge.com/science/22188122/dna-data-storage-synthetic-time-capsule"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="tSK0Rw"&gt;Bugsnax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="qno8Gg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1neEhMubpaY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="D7oLmd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bugsnax&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="h8D4r6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bugsnax &lt;/em&gt;is the latest enigmatic oddity from indie developer Young Horses, best known for creating &lt;em&gt;Octodad: Dadliest Catch&lt;/em&gt;. It’s best described as somewhere between &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;and a standard adventure game, with an island full of snack-like creatures like strawberries with eyes and caterpillars made of waffles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3X9Up"&gt;The game is a weird one, but it’s also got an unusually engrossing narrative given its subject matter. It’s also got plenty of activities to keep you busy, the most quintessential of which involves capturing up to 100 species of the edible bug creatures. Similar to &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bugsnax&lt;/em&gt; was a free launch-day PS5 release, thanks to a deal between Sony and Young Horses that made it part of the PlayStation Plus subscription plan. It’s still available as part of the subscription (or $25 without PS Plus) &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2020/10/28/bugsnax-free-at-launch-on-ps5-for-ps-plus-members/"&gt;until January 4th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, so act fast to claim it if you’re interested in taking a visit to Snaktooth Island. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LFclXV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Bugsnax","description":"Quirky adventure game","label":"Included with PS Plus ","url":"https://bugsnax.com/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="mnQP6j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"PlayStation Plus","description":"Subscription plan starting at $9.99 / month","label":"Subscribe","url":"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="nNxjUL"&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sgA80k"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; is the latest game in Ubisoft’s massive historical fiction series pitting secret orders against one another in a bid for world domination... or something. Okay, so the series isn’t really about assassins versus Templars anymore, and that’s just fine. The last two games in the series, &lt;em&gt;Origins &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, tackled ancient Egypt and Greece with impressive results; critics hailed Ubisoft’s new open-world RPG approach that makes these games much more massive and engaging than they used to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mhrDw"&gt;Now, &lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; is here with a Nordic tale of revenge set during the age of the Vikings, and it’s similarly incredible and immersive. It’s also one of the few major studio cross-gen games to arrive in time for the PS5’s launch. Like many of the other titles for the new consoles, Ubisoft has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21720887/assassins-creed-valhalla-60-fps-next-gen-consoles-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;released some much-needed patches&lt;/a&gt; to improve its performance and help it feel more next-gen. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRQMyY"&gt;The latest entry in everyone’s favorite “anime the video game” series, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15098458/persona-5-review-ps4-ps3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is not exactly a new entry in the iconic life sim-RPG crossover series. But in keeping with tradition, developer Atlus has managed to keep it alive and fresh since its 2017 release. The developer has done that by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21199604/persona-5-royal-review-ps4-atlus-rpg"&gt;releasing an expanded version of the game&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;em&gt;Persona 5: Royal &lt;/em&gt;earlier this year. The new version added new characters, gameplay additions, and quality-of-life improvements to the original’s design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCg12D"&gt;Now you have a choice to make. &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt; is included for free with the PlayStation Plus Collection series, a new library of older games Sony is giving away as part of its annual subscription to owners of the PS5. But the collection includes just the standard version of the game, not the &lt;em&gt;Royal &lt;/em&gt;one. Diehard &lt;em&gt;Persona &lt;/em&gt;fans will tell you to play &lt;em&gt;Royal&lt;/em&gt;, so perhaps it’s a good idea to use your PS Plus Collection to try the game out and purchase the expanded &lt;em&gt;Royal &lt;/em&gt;version if it seems like something you’ll want to dedicate dozens (or even hundreds) of hours to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="71Apci"&gt;Epic’s massively successful battle royale hit &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;is still going strong more than three years after release, and it’s only gotten better with the release of next-gen consoles. On Sony’s PS5, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;is rendered in 4K and 60fps, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176382/fortnite-epic-120-fps-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;new 120Hz mode that will up that frame rate even higher&lt;/a&gt; if you have the TV to support it. The game is free to play, making it a no-brainer if you’re looking for an online multiplayer game for your new console. Epic and Microsoft also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166187/fortnite-master-chief-halo-the-walking-dead-the-game-awards"&gt;just added &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;’s Master Chief&lt;/a&gt; in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;some &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; characters with its newest season&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="4Fu636"&gt;Sucker Punch Productions’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21323144/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-game-developer-samurai"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is the rare game that manages to feel both familiar and fresh at the same time. It’s a standard open-world game with many of the trappings of the genre: a lonely, empty world occasionally peppered by side quests and collectibles and traversable mainly by horse. But where &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima &lt;/em&gt;shines is in its visual beauty, deep sword combat, and the quiet moments it gives the player as they pilot samurai Jin Sakai on his quest for revenge — like composing haikus by the cliffside or following birds to mystical fox shrines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUO8KL"&gt;It’s not a groundbreaking game, but it’s a lovely one to play. It’s helped along greatly by player-friendly gestures like instant fast travel, no microtransactions to speak of, and fantastic character customization. On the PS5, &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; runs at 60fps, which, when added to its already top-tier performance and quality, makes it effectively a launch game for anyone who skipped it or held off this past summer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="7Howck"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207441/final-fantasy-7-remake-ff7-review-ps4"&gt;remake of roleplaying classic &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;could have gone wrong in so many ways, and yet, remarkably, it arrived this past April as a complete and fully formed experience that succeeds wildly at what it sets out to do. Sure, it’s just a tiny sliver of the original’s overall story, but it delivers in every way imaginable, straddling the line between nostalgia for the source material and genuine advances in evolving turn-based RPGs for the modern day. Plus, it has some out-of-left-field narrative additions that turn the whole plot on its head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbP30H"&gt;While it’s not fully optimized for the PS5, &lt;em&gt;FFVII Remake&lt;/em&gt; does get a slight performance boost through backwards compatibility, mostly to help keep its frame rate stable. It’s otherwise a must-play for any &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy &lt;/em&gt;fan that didn’t pick this up for the PS4. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GoDaddy wins our 2020 award for most evil company email</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="godaddy logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vg1s1mMzUds2jAlhyJWWClTDF6A=/97x0:706x406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68578977/godaddy-logo.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IoTVMD"&gt;What’s the cruelest prank you can make on employees who are struggling during a global pandemic when millions of people have lost their jobs or lives? GoDaddy — a web domain registrar once best known for its sexist advertisements — tried to find out when it sent employees a fake email informing them they’d receive a $650 holiday bonus. &lt;a href="https://coppercourier.com/story/godaddy-employees-holiday-bonus-secruity-test/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Copper Courier &lt;/em&gt;originally reported&lt;/a&gt;, GoDaddy sent an email phishing “test” to its employees promising much-needed money; “2020 has been a record year for GoDaddy, thanks to you!”, it said. “Though we cannot celebrate together during our annual Holiday Party, we want to show our appreciation and share a $650 one—time Holiday bonus!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4dWHY"&gt;The employees who clicked the link then &lt;a href="https://coppercourier.com/story/godaddy-employees-holiday-bonus-secruity-test/"&gt;reportedly received&lt;/a&gt; an email two days later telling them they failed the test. Instead of receiving a holiday bonus, they’d instead be required to take a training course on social engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNDGeY"&gt;Phishing tests are normal, but promising employees fake money definitely falls into the “oh no they didn’t” category. It’s probably worth mentioning that promising fake bonuses is literally something Michael Scott, the world’s worst fictional boss from &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, inflicted on his employees at Dunder Mifflin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ce4Qnu"&gt;So congratulations, GoDaddy: you win our brand-new award for Most Evil Company Email Of The Year. Let’s hope this is the first and only time we have to award it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Warner Bros. believes that theaters will still exist in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mad Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PgWJq5Nk0AbMrBwnbWEGoVtEWro=/347x0:1540x795/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68578510/Screen_Shot_2015-03-30_at_10.52.35_AM.0.5.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xmkuqd"&gt;Warner Bros. ruffled some feathers when it announced it would release all of its new 2021 movies simultaneously on HBO Max, but the company seems to be betting that theaters won’t become an apocalyptic wasteland. &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/warner-bros-mad-max-fury-road-color-purple-1234874609/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the company plans to release &lt;em&gt;Furiosa&lt;/em&gt;, the prequel to &lt;em&gt;Max Max: Fury Road, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple &lt;/em&gt;first in theaters in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRCnGy"&gt;Warner’s plan to launch next year’s films online &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;is a great thing for consumers&lt;/a&gt; who would rather stay at home than risk contracting a deadly virus to see, say, &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;. But the plan immediately made enemies of some Hollywood veterans. Director Christopher Nolan called HBO Max “the worst streaming service” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22162918/christopher-nolan-tenet-hbo-max-warner-bros-streaming-service-cinematic-releases"&gt;and accused Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt; of not telling anyone about its plan until just 90 minutes before it was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPSDfb"&gt;Despite Warner’s rosy outlook on the existence of theaters, the signs on their marquees might not look the same by 2023. AMC has warned investors that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169538/amc-theaters-revenue-closing-warner-bros-hbo-max-streaming"&gt;it will run out of cash&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of January if it can’t find $750 million.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Echo Frames review: listen to these specs</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Great in concept, but there’s a limit to what Alexa can do on a phone&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lhpWyg"&gt;I did not expect to like the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083C58VDP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Frames&lt;/a&gt; as much as I do. The concept is relatively simple: they’re a pair of eyeglasses with tiny little speakers and microphones embedded in the stems so you can listen to music and command Alexa. They run $249 and come with basic plastic lenses, but you can take them to an optometrist and get prescription lenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDa7s1"&gt;It’s a much smarter strategy than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/18/17255354/intel-vaunt-shut-down"&gt;the failed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308281/google-north-focals-glasses-purchase-acquire"&gt;smart glasses&lt;/a&gt; that tried to add a display into the mix. Maybe that’s in the works, but as with many of its products, Amazon starts with a minimum viable product and iterates. That’s doubly true for these Echo Frames, which are now widely available for anybody to buy in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575243/amazon-echo-frames-smart-glasses-alexa-loop-second-gen-available"&gt;version two of the product&lt;/a&gt; that makes some tweaks to the internal hardware and battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wy3EIQ"&gt;Amazon isn’t alone in this category, though. Bose is also on its second iteration of sunglasses (or eyeglasses) with little speakers in the stems — and it offers multiple styles, to boot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zp9ml5"&gt;The Echo Frames have sold me on the concept of having discreet, personal audio available at all times. It’s a bit like discovering headphones all over again. But while I’m sold on the &lt;em&gt;concept&lt;/em&gt;, for reasons both in and out of Amazon’s control, the experience of actually &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; the Echo Frames falls well short of their potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jbyw3D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10250111"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Echo Frames look like relatively normal — but cheap — eyeglasses" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hgy-DT5Y-Z1w9pc2liziaQuN3oY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183630/vpavic_201215_4343_0164_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Frames look like relatively normal — but cheap — eyeglasses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hfcFDy"&gt;Echo Frames hardware and style&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1wrKFd"&gt;The Echo Frames are basic, rectangular glasses. They’re made entirely of glossy plastic and come in three different colors: an all-black version, a tortoiseshell design, and a version that fades from black to blue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LkzCg"&gt;They’re also quite large. It’s a one-size-fits-all product, but that’s not really how glasses work. They felt comfortable on my head, but I do think they look a little big — maybe I just don’t like this shape. The stems have plenty of flex where they attach, at least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="nmaE6I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;They look normal, but they don’t look especially nice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The stems contain all the electronics, and are quite thick." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kkDBnCYDJq7pWQz1z-Q52xC2xqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183637/vpavic_201215_4343_0117_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stems contain all the electronics, and are quite thick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rot6Ju"&gt;Amazon has a partnership with LensCrafters to help people get prescription lenses added to the Echo Frames, but I used them as they shipped, with clear plastic lenses. Those built-in lenses are reflective as hell, making them so distracting during Zoom calls that I had to take them off. (I normally wear glasses, so I had contact lenses in during my testing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uqnZ0"&gt;As far as the techy components go, they’re subtle. There is a mic, power button, and a couple of volume buttons on the underside of the right stem — plus a magnetic pogo pin receiver for charging. Each stem has two tiny holes located back near your ear for audio. The right stem also has a touch sensor on the side that’s able to detect taps and swipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5RgCHa"&gt;All those components are there, but unless somebody is looking for them, they’re basically invisible. The only real giveaway that these are smart glasses is that the stems are quite thick, narrowing suddenly so they can actually fit behind your ears. I was worried they’d feel heavy (I prefer glasses on the lighter side to begin with), but they never felt that way to me — Amazon clocks them at 31 grams.  I was also worried they would look somehow techy, but fortunately they don’t. They just look kind of, well, cheap. Even just offering a different finish on the plastic might have helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="All the physical controls for the Echo Frames are on the right stem." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WM4B5UkQAZjmbpPh-j9olJJjcX0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183639/vpavic_201215_4343_0098_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All the physical controls for the Echo Frames are on the right stem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QIOJyu"&gt;Echo Frames software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="axhE4Q"&gt;There are two ways to use the Echo Frames: as basic Bluetooth “headphones” and as an Alexa device. Obviously Amazon intends you to do the latter, but I found that they were surprisingly decent as teleconference and telephone call headphones. Unfortunately, they can only be paired to one device at a time and require a full re-pairing to switch devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESwflB"&gt;Really, these are meant to be accessories to your phone only, and so the only good move is to set them up inside the Alexa app like any other Echo device. There are a few unique options, like setting up an automatic volume feature that tries to set the volume just loud enough to overcome ambient noise. Otherwise, if you’ve used any other Echo device, then the experience here is about the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZQwBBA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone limits what the Frames are allowed to really do&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rWJUuC"&gt;That’s both good and bad. It’s nice to just have Alexa available all the time, whether you’re at home or not. But since the Echo Frames are paired to a phone, you’d like to think that Alexa would be able to do the sorts of things you expect a digital assistant on a phone to do. It cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQAJaZ"&gt;I used the Echo Frames with an iPhone, and basic tasks that Siri can do like making calls or responding to texts are just never going to happen for Alexa. When I asked Alexa to “Call Dan Seifert,” Alexa defaulted to using its own teleconferencing system, which meant that my attempt to just ring Dan’s cellphone resulted in every single Echo device in his house ringing and annoying his entire family. (You can also use Siri with the Frames with a long press on the stem, at least.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goneZC"&gt;There is one interesting phone trick I appreciated: the ability to pick and choose which notifications get announced. When a new notification comes in, you can tap or swipe to tell the Frames whether you want to hear notifications from that app read aloud to you. I’m normally super annoyed by audio systems for notifications, but this one makes it easy to filter them down to the very urgent stuff, and to dismiss them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNbDMz"&gt;As an Alexa device, I really have few complaints. It took a little while for the Echo speakers in my apartment to figure out that I was talking to my glasses instead of them, but that eventually settled down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are tiny speaker holes right in front of your ears on each stem" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h0EL3KgTrIIOsBojdd9cJQGVgEA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183636/vpavic_201215_4343_0121_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are tiny speaker holes right in front of your ears on each stem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zxdL8V"&gt;Echo Frames audio and battery life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KwtofW"&gt;Maybe my favorite software trick on the Echo Frames is that when you set the glasses down on a table upside-down, they turn off after a few seconds. I think it’s also a necessary trick. Although Amazon promises you can get through a “14-hour day” of mixed use, that mixed use really boils down to just over three hours of actively using the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcwUvv"&gt;That’s really not long enough, honestly. I know that because I was killing the battery on these glasses by mid-afternoon every day — because I was using them much more than I expected to. Working from home, I’m constantly donning and doffing headphones to listen to music, take calls, talk to my spouse, or just give my ears a rest. With the Echo Frames, my source of audio is just &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;, unobtrusive and always available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXzt0z"&gt;They were so convenient and handy that I was all the more annoyed by their shortcomings. I couldn’t connect them to my computer without significant hassle and their battery life simply wasn’t up to the task of doing what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hxcC3u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;They were so convenient, I wanted to use them more than the battery could handle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SceIEK"&gt;I don’t know exactly how I should judge the sound quality. The Echo Frames have tiny speakers that sit just forward of your ears, so expecting deep bass or really anything great would be a mistake. They did provide clarity, however, both in listening to music and podcasts. When I used them for phone calls, people on the other end were surprised to hear I was on a Bluetooth headset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DicrII"&gt;Those little speakers are also remarkably good at being directional. In most environments, you can hear them loud and clear while somebody standing just a couple feet away would hear nothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZIrlk"&gt;It’s great that your ears are open — I felt much safer using the Echo Frames while riding my bike than with my usual one-earbud-in, one-earbud-out habit. Unfortunately, the Echo Frames just don’t get loud enough to compete with street noise. Even cranked to the max, it can be difficult to hear the Frames when there’s traffic, and if you’re in a loud subway train, forget it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon Echo Frames" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OWMd36oVzutyw7kB-zqj0Ua5NuM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183633/vpavic_201215_4343_0147_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon Echo Frames.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7wYzCW"&gt;I did have some strange moments with the Echo Frames. Wearing headphones is a big social signal that your ears are occupied and your attention isn’t immediately available to those around you. But with the Echo Frames, you look the same whether you’re staring into space or listening to a podcast, so people around you will just start talking to you as though you weren’t wearing headphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDNE34"&gt;There are places where social interactions with Echo Frames are less fraught. In a doctor’s office waiting room, for example, I could listen to a podcast while still able to listen for my name when it was called. Being able to not only do that but also not be the guy with one earbud in was nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvSBXy"&gt;A few days into using the Echo Frames, I suddenly realized I had stopped messing about with the volume on my phone anymore. I constantly am riding the volume buttons to either listen to a quick video or silence one. But just having convenient, comfortable, and personal audio on at all times meant I never had to worry about it. The audio quality isn’t great, but the convenience is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="kRP4hV"&gt;It was great, and it made me wish for a version of the Echo Frames that didn’t have to make all the compromises Amazon had to make here, especially on battery life (for the size) and on styling (for the price). Most of all, though, I found that while Alexa is great in my house, it feels like Apple put a hard ceiling on what it’s allowed to do on an iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="7m7uUl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10250138"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Tony Robbins claims he saved his employee from COVID — she says that’s a lie</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Behind Tony Robbins’ dangerous approach to the pandemic&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="N4DvmG"&gt;The story Tony Robbins told on his podcast was harrowing — if also a little convoluted. One of his staff members had come down with a fever of 102 when she started watching the news and freaking out. She went to the hospital, presumably with COVID-19, and began to hyperventilate. The doctors put her on a ventilator — then in a medically induced coma. “The doctor said … ‘If she doesn’t wake up in three weeks, we’ll declare her dead,’” Robbins recounted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2xl7W"&gt;The self-help guru had been researching coronavirus treatments and decided pressure from ventilators could damage the lungs. “I’m not saying these people are trying to harm. I think they’re all trying to help, but the research is now showing a very different component there,” he said on the &lt;em&gt;Tony Robbins Podcast&lt;/em&gt;. So Robbins asked a physician friend to call the hospital and convince the woman’s doctors to lower the pressure. “As a result, four or five days later, she opened her eyes, which we’re so grateful for, and she’s still in the hospital but she’s healing,” Robbins said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ix5fI"&gt;The episode fit neatly into Robbins’ self-aggrandizing coronavirus narrative. Since the early days of the pandemic, he’d been suspicious of the hysteria surrounding COVID-19.  He told employees in late March that the flu was worse than coronavirus, adding: “We have lost our minds on this.” He also hosted two events amid the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApPNvx"&gt;Robbins’ spokesperson Jennifer Connelly said that, since February: “Two small, private in-person meetings were held, and those were in compliance with federal, state and local regulations and guidance regarding COVID-19.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wodrcq"&gt;As a coach, Robbins always taught people that they had the ability to change their lives — not their wives or their pastors or their priests. The story he told on his podcast highlighted how little doctors knew about the illness they were supposed to be treating and underlined his own heroism in saving her life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xs0K7"&gt;But according to a new federal lawsuit filed in the Southern District of New York, the tale was largely fabricated. Debbie Kosta, the employee in question, is suing Robbins and his company, Robbins Research International (RRI), saying he lied about his part in her recovery and made it nearly impossible for her to return to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HYJG1O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;She just wanted to help people change their lives&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GUQI5y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWQOjt"&gt;The complaint lays out a starkly different picture of Tony Robbins than the inspirational coach he plays on social media. It says his organization refused to let Kosta return to work part-time while she was recovering from COVID-19 and dealing with a recent cancer diagnosis. Instead, roughly three months after Kosta got off a ventilator, the complaint alleges her managers gave her an ultimatum: return to work full-time or lose her job and her health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujThx5"&gt;In a statement, Robbins’ spokesperson said: “When we were informed Ms. Kosta had contracted COVID-19 and was hospitalized, Mr. Robbins and his organization inquired with compassion and support for her and have treated her fairly and consistent with all applicable laws. RRI answered all of her questions, provided all of her requested accommodations, and did not retaliate against her in any way. Ms. Kosta remains employed by RRI and the organization continues to pay the complete cost of her medical insurance, even though its legal obligation to do so ended in June.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMzzjJ"&gt;Kosta had been an employee of Robbins’ for 18 years when the pandemic arrived. She’d started working for him in Europe, then moved to New York and joined the sales team in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqjrQw"&gt;Sales reps at RRI sold tickets to Robbins’ live events — multiday seminars with names like “Unleash the Power Within” and “Date with Destiny.” The world-famous coach taught people to eliminate pain “for good” and urged followers not to “settle for an ordinary life when you can create an extraordinary one.” As such, tickets cost between $600 and $3,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0E6yZQ"&gt;Some of Robbins’ clients were dealing with major life issues. They were drug addicts, alcoholics, or philanderers. To them, Robbins’ philosophy of self-empowerment was entirely new. It allowed them to take control of their lives and transformed them into loyal fans along the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4CILt"&gt;But Kosta wasn’t like that. She’d always had high self-esteem and a relentlessly positive attitude. Robbins’ curriculum reminded her of Greek philosophy, and while she believed in what he was teaching, she didn’t worship him like others seemed to. She just wanted to help people change their lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnjYAV"&gt;What stood out to Kosta was Robbins’ delivery. He’d run onstage to pulsing music, high-fiving and shouting like a maniac. And it worked. “I saw it, it was like, ‘Oh, people listen to this,’” Kosta says. “People actually like high-fiving and hugging.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PErzHz"&gt;Back in New York, Kosta became one of Robbins’ top performing sales reps, according to the complaint. The gig was commission-only, but there were bonuses for people who sold a lot. One anonymous employee who worked on the sales team said they regularly made $80,000 a year in bonuses alone. Kosta liked the hustle and was willing to skip holidays if it meant succeeding at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yEPQh0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1MD7lh"&gt;Over the next nine years, Kosta made a life for herself and her two young daughters in New York City. She was able to send them to a good prep school in Manhattan and take them to Europe in the summers. But the real money went to Tony Robbins. After a particularly massive event, Kosta says he called her to congratulate her on how much business she was bringing in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBjxvj"&gt;Then, in early 2020, things started to shift. Robbins’ biggest event was scheduled to take place in San Jose, California, in March. “Unleash the Power Within” was a four-day seminar that taught people to “unlock and unleash the forces inside you to break through your limitations and take control of your life.” Unfortunately, some worried that a 12,000-person event could unleash a bunch of coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFNZvM"&gt;Less than a week before the event, Robbins was forced to cancel. Attendees started calling to get their money back, sending the sales team into a panic. RRI had a brutal policy that meant each refund came out of employees’ commissions. Some team members went from making well over $100,000 to not being able to make their mortgage payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19x5wh"&gt;In late March, Robbins offered employees a stipend of roughly $5,000 a month and urged them to “step the fuck up,” according to audio leaked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;They were told they’d need to pay Robbins back by the end of the year. The following month, in April, &lt;a href="https://projects.propublica.org/coronavirus/bailouts/loans/robbins-research-international-inc-c62b8f906ee86f60821af1e98cc0c006"&gt;RRI received a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan&lt;/a&gt; from the federal government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmxDR3"&gt;(In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;Robbins’ spokesperson wrote: “RRI properly and legally applied and received PPP support and has used those funds in compliance with the program’s rules.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLtexQ"&gt;The news wasn’t great for Kosta, but she was dealing with bigger problems. She’d developed a high fever and was having a difficult time breathing. Her daughter Stella, a 19-year-old film student at Hunter College, had never seen her mom so sick. On April 12th, when Kosta’s fever had been hovering at 104 for three days, Stella decided to call an ambulance. “She’s very strong and upbeat, so seeing her so weak, barely able to string sentences together, not breathing, it was very mind-boggling to me,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXSG7H"&gt;Stella had watched the trucks of dead bodies lining the streets in Manhattan. Everyone she knew either had COVID or knew someone who’d died from it. “I was just like, ‘My mom cannot become one of those people,’” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="drw0Rb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;But Stella says none of that is true&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zIsaFH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnhTEW"&gt;At the hospital, doctors put Kosta on a ventilator, then in a medically induced coma. Robbins called Stella to see how her mother was doing. This is where Robbins’ telling of the story really diverges from the truth, according to Kosta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYOI4J"&gt;Robbins said that Stella did her research and found that the longer her mom was on a ventilator, the more likely she was to die. “The daughter went crazy,” he said on his podcast. “She said, ‘You put her in the coma. She came in with a cough and a fever and shortness of breath…’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nrkz00"&gt;But Stella says none of that is true. “I’m not knowledgeable enough,” she says, bewildered. “Whatever the doctors were telling me, I was believing it.” At one point, she says she asked the doctors how much longer her mother would have to be on a ventilator. “But I was never like, ‘Take her off right now,’” she adds. “Why would I ever do that? I was just asking, ‘How can you make her better?’ But I never went against the ventilator. The ventilator is what saved her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80KzfO"&gt;The complaint also says that Robbins told Kosta’s clients he was the one who convinced the doctors to take her off the ventilator. And, it alleges that Sage Robbins, Tony’s wife, called Stella to “pry information from her regarding Ms. Kosta’s condition.” Kosta’s attorney, Chris Albanese, of the employment law firm White, Hilferty and Albanese, says: “Tony and his wife went out of their way to harm her, what kind of person would do that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eaSLDn"&gt;(Robbins’ spokesperson says the “allegations concerning RRI, Mr. Robbins and his wife, are false.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9KBuuJ"&gt;Robbins took advantage of Kosta’s situation for his own benefit, the complaint adds. He made it seem like she was overreacting about her symptoms because of the news. “I talked to him personally and told him about the 104 fever and how she couldn’t breathe,” Stella notes. “For him to turn around and say, ‘Oh, she had 102 fever and then watched the news and started hyperventilating’ — it was just so shocking. It’s a betrayal. I took lessons from his events at heart and tried to change my life with them. Now I’m just wondering, ‘Well, how much have you been lying then? How many of your stories and how many of your experiences that you used to teach us are lies?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYt1oF"&gt;Kosta stayed in a coma until early May. Then, miraculously, she started to get better. When she finally got home from the hospital on May 5th, she could barely walk around the block or speak a full sentence without losing her breath. But she was alive. Then her doctors discovered a growth on her chest. They said said she’d likely need six months to fully recover, according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3dBCf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iGrYic"&gt;Kosta was on New York State Paid Family Leave, but it was set to run out at the end of June. She knew she wasn’t well enough to return to work; she still needed surgery to remove the growth. Talking on the phone all day with her voice ravaged from the ventilator seemed impossible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Rp060"&gt;According to the lawsuit, she emailed HR to see if she could have more time off. They said no. If she didn’t return in July, she’d lose her health insurance. Kosta asked to reduce her hours. She was a commissioned-based employee who worked from home, so the request seemed pretty reasonable. But RRI refused, the complaint says. They offered her $15,000 in severance and encouraged her to go on disability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ai8uFy"&gt;“Debbie Kosta was at the peak of her sales career when she contracted coronavirus,” said Vincent White, Kosta’s other attorney. “Instead of supporting a woman who had not only supported his organization but enriched him personally, Tony Robbins left her without reasonable accommodation for her disability. She has lost a tremendous amount of earning potential during this time, and frankly it is impossible to put a number on the emotional damages Ms. Kosta has endured at the hands of a company that claims to lift up, not break down, the human spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5ea9r"&gt;Kosta’s complaint, which was filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ahead of its filing in federal court in New York City, says that her request to reduce her hours was a reasonable accommodation, and RRI’s refusal to grant it violates the Americans with Disabilities Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8WLOU9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m done with this Guru!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2TbZjw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSp6P0"&gt;Robbins had been walking a thin line between COVID-19 skepticism and denial. He didn’t doubt that the disease existed, but he hinted that the news coverage surrounding the death rate was exaggerated. Then, in August 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/TonyRobbins/posts/the-most-powerful-vaccine-youve-never-heard-ofjoin-peter-diamandis-tony-robbins-/10158871342659060/"&gt;he started promoting a coronavirus vaccine&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook, designed by his friend and longtime collaborator Peter H. Diamandis. Diamandis’ company, Covaxx, is backed by Prime Movers Lab, a venture capital firm where Robbins works as a business strategist and partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsdlQ0"&gt;Jennifer Connelly, Robbins’ spokesperson, said: “Mr. Robbins has invested in one of several companies working on the development of an effective COVID vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cyb0Wd"&gt;The perceived change disappointed his followers. “I can’t believe what I am actually reading from Tony Robbins who said during 7 day challenge that Covid 19 equivalent of the Flu,” one wrote on Facebook. “What a sell out Tony Robbins turned out to be promoting a ‘safe vaccine’ by one of his Business partners. I’m done with this Guru!” Another wrote: “No thanks Tony how much cash do you have invested in this vaccine?!?!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="t9aZQ2"&gt;The answer, according to Pitchbook, could be close to $2.85 million, which is the amount Covaxx raised in May, in a funding round led by Prime Movers Lab. It might help explain Robbins’ core philosophy — not self-empowerment, or personal growth, but capitalism. America’s number one coach might say his mission is to “help individuals and businesses succeed.” But according to some employees, the individual he’s most interested in helping is himself. &lt;/p&gt;
