    <title>You can now watch HBO Max on your PS5</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3VFbSb"&gt;Sony on Wednesday announced that HBO Max is finally available for its next-gen console. Support for the app, revealed in a tweet from the official PlayStation account, should be great news if you managed to get a PS5 and were planning to use it as an entertainment hub for movies in addition to games, as HBO Max was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528372/ps5-streaming-apps-support-day-one-netflix-disney-plus-twitch"&gt;last major streaming service&lt;/a&gt; absent from the console. At the moment, the app is only available to PS5 owners in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtqeaT"&gt;If you’re still on the PS4, this update likely won’t mean much to you, as that device has had the app for a while now. But it does mean any PlayStation fans should now be able to watch &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;, which will be available in 4K HDR for PS5 owners with supported TVs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;and other Warner Bros. movies&lt;/a&gt; coming out next year on HBO’s new streaming service. (Xbox Series X / S owners have had access to the app since the consoles launched.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v87Z1s"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Settle in with the biggest movies and TV series — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbomax?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@HBOMax&lt;/a&gt; is available now on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PS5?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PS5&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/EYBzSZdJrL"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EYBzSZdJrL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PlayStation (@PlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1339265875518451717?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jI3WwP"&gt;When I went to download HBO Max on my PS5, it told me the app was only available for PS4, but a quick reboot made it available to download. If you want to download it as well, you can go to the media tab on the PS5’s home screen and scroll down to the All Apps section. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch bans ‘simp’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fsnLHkzJPBF0_93ILPdQ6A3z_Mg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68525493/acastro_200901_1777_twitch_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B02KAQ"&gt;Twitch will no longer allow streamers and commenters to go around calling one another “simps.” The term — a recent favorite in the Twitch community that nominally refers to men who seem desperate for a woman’s attention — will be banned when used as an insult under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165342/twitch-hateful-conduct-harassment-policy-update"&gt;Twitch’s upcoming revamp of its harassment policy&lt;/a&gt;. “Incel” and “virgin” will be banned as insults too, Twitch COO Sara Clemens said during a live streamed town hall this afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a18Nyy"&gt;The new policy, first spotted by e-sports consultant &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1339312480057782273"&gt;Rod Breslau,&lt;/a&gt; goes into place on January 22nd. It also includes stricter rules around sexual harassment and seems to give Twitch more leeway to ban streamers and commenters who make offensive comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fq7VeV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitch is also rejecting emotes that include “simp”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BeE5XR"&gt;The policy overhaul comes after Twitch was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303185/twitch-sexual-harassment-assault-permanent-bans-streamers"&gt;inundated with reports of sexual harassment within its community&lt;/a&gt; and complaints that the company had ignored the issue for years. Twitch said in June that it was “committed to continuing our efforts to make Twitch a safer environment” and that a review of its hateful conduct and harassment policies was underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVlRW1"&gt;“Simp” is being banned under a portion of the revamped policy that prohibits derogatory statements about another person’s perceived sexual preferences. “And that does include negatively targeting another person with sexually focused terms,” Clemens said. Twitch is also “proactively denying” emotes that include the term simp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mgFk5T"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=NastyFragileTomatoSeemsGood&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CgGXFO"&gt;Twitch’s &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/harassment/20210122/"&gt;updated harassment policy&lt;/a&gt; lists a number of banned behaviors relating to sexual harassment. Among them is a ban on “making derogatory statements about another person’s perceived sexual practices or sexual morality.” The policy goes on to say that would include “Repeatedly negatively targeting another person with sexually-focused terms, such as ‘whore’ or ‘virgin.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYl51p"&gt;There aren’t details on exactly how Twitch will enforce the ban around “simp.” But moderators may find it to be tricky, given just how often the term is thrown around on Twitch. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Twitch for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An absolutely wild mod has brought real-time ray tracing to the SNES</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A picture of a Famicom console with many wires coming out of it, hooked up to a TV" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ERpeQFrlGxSFhRwkpupyCxMAVmc=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68525132/Hardware.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Ben Carter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tKdolZ"&gt;Ray-tracing technology, available for a few years on PC, has finally come to consoles: the PS5 has it, the Xbox Series S and X have it, and, 30 years after its release, the SNES is getting it. No joke — the Nintendo console from 1990 has had ray tracing run on it, &lt;a href="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/"&gt;thanks to an incredible mod&lt;/a&gt; by programmer Ben Carter (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/superhuman-hack-brings-real-time-3d-ray-tracing-to-the-1845890359"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). And it’s done by a chip he’s calling SuperRT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PldbRI"&gt;Ray tracing is usually used to make games look more realistic by simulating the way light bounces off of surfaces, leading to color bleeding from bright objects and reflecting off of shiny surfaces. As you can see from the video demo above, the tech on the SNES isn’t pushing any graphics boundaries, but come on — it’s an SNES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1P5nIQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The mod offers a look at an alternate reality&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3vRFTu"&gt;Well, technically, it’s a Famicom, which is the same hardware in different packaging for Japan. The real magic, though, is that it’s a totally stock console (except for the fact that the top has been taken off to make room for a ton of wires): all of the processing is being done by a chip Carter programmed and added to a game cartridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuKMwm"&gt;Adding processing power to the SNES by adding another processor to the game cartridge isn’t something new: &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/super-nintendo-game-uses-super-fx-chip/"&gt;Nintendo did it&lt;/a&gt; with both &lt;em&gt;Star Fox&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Yoshi’s Island. &lt;/em&gt;(Of course, it was adding 3D functionality and special effects, not ray tracing.) To achieve real-time ray tracing, Carter couldn’t just use the old Super FX chips that Nintendo did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjjHoo"&gt;Instead, he had to use a modern field-programmable gate array chip (FPGA), which allowed him to take information about the scene being rendered by the SNES and process the ray tracing for it. If you want an in-depth look at how it’s done, Carter &lt;a href="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/"&gt;has a blog post&lt;/a&gt; explaining how he did it. He also has a video explaining his methodology, embedded below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vSJ72w"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2jee4tlakqo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oycKip"&gt;This mod is super cool, not just from an engineering and hacking perspective, but because it offers a look at an alternate reality — not the one where ray tracing was magically created in the 1990s, but one where ’90s low-poly 3D games are remastered but keep the art style. As someone who grew up around that time, I love seeing 2D and 3D games get modern-looking remakes, but I’d also love to see the art style come back with modern tricks like ray tracing and anti-aliasing. And if I had to imagine what it would look like, it’d be a lot like Carter’s demo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JxXySg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter says it will start removing COVID-19 vaccine misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NrKZe-cHb1EiR3FxmFoydRigRLQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68524971/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PVykEr"&gt;Twitter announced Wednesday that it will remove tweets making false or misleading claims about COVID-19 vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRtO0N"&gt;Any tweets claiming that vaccines “intentionally cause harm to control populations” or invoke conspiracy theories will be subject to removal, according to Twitter’s blog post. Tweets falsely suggesting that COVID-19 doesn’t exist or espouse “widely debunked” claims may also be removed. Enforcement of the new policy will begin next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbTMeN"&gt;Twitter may also label or place warnings on tweets pushing vaccine conspiracy theories starting early next year. These labeled tweets could link out to authoritative public health information, similar to how Twitter directed users to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271207/twitter-donald-trump-fact-check-mail-in-voting-coronavirus-pandemic-california"&gt;verified voting information&lt;/a&gt; throughout the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1L80IM"&gt;“We will enforce this policy in close consultation with local, national and global public health authorities around the world, and will strive to be iterative and transparent in our approach,” the blog post said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCcyFz"&gt;Twitter’s new policy comes as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174075/coronavirus-vaccinations-begin-first-pfizer-health-care-workers"&gt;health care workers across the US&lt;/a&gt; have started to receive COVID-19 vaccinations after the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22158608/fda-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-authorized-emergency-use"&gt;a vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech&lt;/a&gt;. These vaccinations have been the target of countless conspiracy theories, including false allegations that they &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-covid-coronavirus-vaccine-conspiracy-myths-20201215-ubpqu26xarh75gksodmqhgnrp4-story.html"&gt;contain microchips&lt;/a&gt; or are used to alter DNA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIBhRj"&gt;The new rules expand on coronavirus-related policies put in place by Twitter earlier this year. In March, Twitter rolled out a COVID-19 tab in its Explore page and &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/covid-19.html"&gt;partnered with organizations&lt;/a&gt; like the World Health Organization to supply reputable coronavirus information on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2PzF3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Texas attorney general announces ad tech antitrust probe against Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9URvrvurbx3vTbq1j5nWyF05fKE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68524894/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LtirH5"&gt;Texas’ state attorney general has announced new antitrust charges against Google, focusing on the company’s ad tech practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2cQdi"&gt;In a bizarre video posted to the office’s verified Twitter account, Texas AG Ken Paxton says the company “repeatedly used its monopolistic power to control pricing” in online ads. “These actions harm every person in America,” Paxton continues. “It isn’t fair that Google can harm the web pages you visit and read.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="th3dRI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#BREAKING&lt;/a&gt;: Texas takes the lead once more! Today, we’re filing a lawsuit against &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Google?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Google&lt;/a&gt; for anticompetitive conduct.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This internet Goliath used its power to manipulate the market, destroy competition, and harm YOU, the consumer. Stay tuned… &lt;a href="https://t.co/fdEVEWQb0e"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fdEVEWQb0e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Texas Attorney General (@TXAG) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TXAG/status/1339283520099856384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EUaJcw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20428869-the_state_of_texas_et_al_v_google__txedce-20-00957__00010"&gt;The complaint&lt;/a&gt; specifically takes issue with Google’s historical requirements for publishers, whether limiting them to a single exchange or extracting licensing fees for the use of Google ad servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPb2dt"&gt;The most detailed allegation is that Google used its market power to sabotage “header bidding,” a practice that allows advertisers to route a single request through multiple exchanges at once. “Google viewed header bidding’s promotion of genuine competition as a major threat,” the complaint alleges, citing internal communications obtained as part of the probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emzuRz"&gt;Google eventually adopted the practice, allowing its ad server to route requests through multiple exchanges at once. But according to the complaint, Google rigged that system to rout requests to its own exchange, even when a competitor had submitted a higher bid. Google allegedly codenamed this effort after a character from the Star Wars films, although the specific character is redacted in the filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LhShqA"&gt;Eight other Republican-led states have joined the lawsuit, including Missouri, Kentucky, and Indiana. Some collaborating states reportedly left the lawsuit after &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/10/05/texas-ken-paxton-bribery/"&gt;several members of Paxton’s staff accused him of accepting bribes&lt;/a&gt;, triggering a broader crisis within the state office. More recently, Paxton’s office has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-google-texas/texas-hiring-two-law-firms-for-google-probe-team-idUSKBN28Q01H"&gt;hired private law firms &lt;/a&gt;specifically to work on the Google case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmfoLN"&gt;Since the complaint has not appeared in official filings, it is also unclear what specific charges Google will face. Paxton’s office did not respond to a request for clarification. The office’s preliminary probe largely examined Google’s dominance of the online ad marketplace, particularly its recent ad tech acquisitions, so it is expected that the case will follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtNzLV"&gt;Reached for comment, Google denied the claim that digital ad markets are suffering from consolidation, citing &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/admanager/display-buying-share-revenue-publishers/"&gt;recent declines in prices and fees&lt;/a&gt;. “Attorney General Paxton’s ad tech claims are meritless, yet he’s gone ahead in spite of all the facts,” a company representative said. “Digital ad prices have fallen over the last decade. Ad tech fees are falling too. Google’s ad tech fees are lower than the industry average. These are the hallmarks of a highly competitive industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xw2dq"&gt;Today’s case joins a number of parallel antitrust cases being brought against the tech giant. In October, the Department of Justice filed antitrust charges focusing specifically on Google’s contracts with companies like Apple and Mozilla to maintain its dominance in search. Texas has also joined that case as a co-plaintiff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1r8HYs"&gt;A third case led by Colorado’s state attorney general is also rumored to be close to filing. The Colorado case would focus on how Google’s search engine design has disadvantaged rivals like Yelp and Genius that also offer competing information services. &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2020/12/15/exclusive-states-close-to-filing-new-google-antitrust-suit-1347018"&gt;A recent &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; said a complaint could be filed “as soon as Thursday,” citing two people close to the probe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ki4tk7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to include the official complaint filed against Google, with clarifications throughout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Good luck getting a Cyberpunk 2077 refund if you bought a digital PlayStation copy</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n1LAxV"&gt;The release of CD Projekt Red’s (CDPR) highly anticipated &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; is becoming an even bigger mess, and buyers of the digital version of the game from Sony’s PlayStation Store might not have an easy path — or any path at all — to receive the refund the developer said they could. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcavOJ"&gt;Sony hasn’t officially commented on whether players who bought the game from its digital storefront are eligible for refunds. The company’s official policy is not to refund customers if they started playing a game “unless the content is faulty.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gy4QTa"&gt;Now, a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevekovach/status/1339256379014524928"&gt;message from PlayStation Support to CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;journalist Steve Kovach&lt;/a&gt; appears to further confirm that your only option in this scenario is to turn to CDPR’s own help line it opened specifically to address console refunds for the game. “CD Projekt Red is currently working on patches and updates to fix bugs and crashes, and to improve overall gameplay experience of Cyberpunk 2077,” reads the PlayStation Support message, implying frustrated players on PS4 should simply wait for the developer to fix the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cc4CIW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sony won't refund my Cyberpunk 2077 order, even after the game's developer said buyers experiencing problems could get refunds. The game literally crashes my PS4 and is unplayable. Sony's answer? Wait for the updates. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Zx2LSRhqqN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Zx2LSRhqqN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Kovach (@stevekovach) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevekovach/status/1339256379014524928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dfeumx"&gt;Sony did not respond to an official request for comment yesterday regarding its policy on &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;refunds. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out again for further clarification regarding this message from PlayStation Support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6HGeo"&gt;For those not immersed in the &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; launch, let’s back up a bit. The game released last Tuesday, and it became immediately clear that it was plagued by bugs and deep-seated performance issues that make the game an extremely frustrating experience on the standard PlayStation 4 and Xbox One platforms. While it runs generally okay on PS5, Xbox Series X, PC, and Stadia (although with plenty of bugs and crashes depending on your platform and your PC hardware and settings), the game is not well-equipped to handle old and underpowered hardware first released in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFciYB"&gt;In the wake of widespread criticism on social media and from game review sites, none of which were able to review the console versions of the game prior to launch, CDPR &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173738/cyberpunk-2077-developer-apologizes-base-ps4-xbox-one-performance-issues-refunds"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; recommending players who want their money back from the console version of the game request a refund. The company said to request refunds from Microsoft or Sony, and to email the developer as a last resort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yNk0Ai"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/jtF5WKCiro"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jtF5WKCiro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1338390123373801472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ubR6PV"&gt;What CDPR didn’t say at the time was that it had no official refund policy in place with Microsoft, Sony, or any retail partners. The company’s executives only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176279/cyberpunk-2077-performance-issues-refunds-microsoft-sony-ps4-xbox-one"&gt;revealed as much in a call with investors earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, where they blamed oversight and a fixation on the PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X / S versions of the game for the issues plaguing current-gen platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISOOsW"&gt;Microsoft has since released a statement advising players to pursue its standard refund policy, which does appear to allow most players to get their money back if they request a refund within 14 days of purchase. Sony, on the other hand, does not have as generous of a policy. And retail stores don’t have to honor refunds at all, considering they already purchased the stock from the developer’s publishing partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9n7GMh"&gt;Now, many players are stuck with their only recourse at this time involving manually contacting a CDPR email address to try to get their money back. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/patrickklepek/status/1339228060340670464"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;’s Patrick Klepak&lt;/a&gt;, some customers are receiving an automated message back from the developer telling them that they’ll receive an update on their refund most likely before the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cPtvUk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;People are starting to get this response back from CD Projekt RED, after emailing their “help” address for refunds. The language is interesting: it doesn’t tell you to request a refund from Sony anymore. You’re supposed to wait. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Hb77SQ5teD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Hb77SQ5teD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Patrick Klepek (@patrickklepek) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/patrickklepek/status/1339228060340670464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n7QfEG"&gt;In this new message CDPR is sending out, it’s advising players to pursue refunds for digital Xbox versions of the game through Microsoft’s standard refund policy, which anecdotally appears to be working for many players. But CDPR also seems to subtly cast blame on Sony here for not honoring refunds, telling PlayStation players to “please wait for us to get back to you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZpIxC"&gt;The situation is nothing short of a disaster for all parties involved, and it doesn’t look like it’s going to improve any time soon. CDPR is planning two major patches for January and February to fix bugs and improve performance on all platforms, which means the game should improve in due time. But until then, people disappointed in the game who want their money back will need to either be on the right platform to do so or will have to wait to see if CDPR can remedy the situation one way or another. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China returns sample of lunar dirt to Earth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="XINHUA PHOTOS OF THE DAY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QIIDqHhIQzhvMAZcd-dReLUfH2Q=/0x0:3648x2432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68524625/1229919452.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k1wS06"&gt;China’s first mission to return a sample of dirt from the Moon just arrived back at Earth, with a container of lunar rocks in tow, &lt;a href="https://newsus.cgtn.com/news/2020-12-17/China-s-Chang-e-5-lunar-probe-successfully-returns-to-Earth-WhpHOUX5qU/index.html"&gt;China state media confirmed&lt;/a&gt;. A capsule of lunar material scraped up by a Chinese spacecraft landed this afternoon in a very snowy Inner Mongolia, after plunging through Earth’s atmosphere and parachuting to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gubLgV"&gt;The landing marks the end of China’s third whirlwind — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21594565/china-change-5-mission-lunar-sample-return-long-march-5-launch"&gt;and incredibly complex&lt;/a&gt; — mission to the lunar surface, called Chang’e 5. The flight launched on November 23rd, sending a gaggle of four different robotic spacecraft to the Moon’s orbit. On December 1st, two of those spacecraft — a lander and an ascent vehicle — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21724067/china-lunar-mission-change-5-moon-soil-samples"&gt;touched down on the lunar surface&lt;/a&gt; in order to dig up samples of rocks from the ground. Once enough material had been collected, the ascent vehicle then blasted off of the Moon, carrying the samples to the rest of the spacecraft still in lunar orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2M2KX2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The end of China’s third whirlwind mission to the lunar surface&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tpcsM9"&gt;That started the quick journey back to Earth. The ascent vehicle transferred the samples to the rest of the spacecraft, which set a course back to our planet. This afternoon, a reentry capsule with the samples inside broke away and headed for Earth. The capsule skipped off the atmosphere once before diving through it and landing on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rRfJgL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hello there. &lt;a href="https://t.co/JbpmaOGGmZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JbpmaOGGmZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Andrew Jones (@AJ_FI) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AJ_FI/status/1339277873912418307?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IMZoY7"&gt;The landing makes China the third country to return samples from the Moon to Earth, behind the United States and the former Soviet Union. In fact, the last time any country brought back samples from the Moon was in 1976, with the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 robotic mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1Dsy2"&gt;After the landing, Chinese officials located the capsule and will soon open it up in a lab to better understand the lunar haul. China hoped to gather up to 4 kilograms of space rocks from an unexplored part of the Moon called Oceanus Procellarum, or the “Ocean of Storms.” This region of the lunar surface is much smoother than other areas of the Moon, leading scientists to suspect that the rocks there have been smoothed out recently by volcanoes late in the Moon’s lifetime. Studying this material in a laboratory setting could give scientists a better understanding of the Moon’s evolution as well as the entire complex history of the Earth-Moon system.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Project Kuiper reveals design of antennas customers will use for internet-from-space constellation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rxL-3ImHlNmZMxGd96nYL5khFec=/48x0:966x612/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68524569/Project_Kuiper_Customer_Terminal_Antenna_Graphic__2_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A graphic showing the design of Amazon’s user antenna&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9L3cjs"&gt;Today, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/amazon-marks-breakthrough-in-project-kuiper-development"&gt;revealed the design&lt;/a&gt; of the antennas its customers will use to tap into the company’s upcoming massive satellite constellation, Project Kuiper, designed to provide broadband internet coverage from space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMcYjU"&gt;The antenna, which is a phased-array design, underwent development and testing this fall, according to the company. With a diameter of just 12 inches across, the antenna is “smaller and lighter than legacy antenna designs,” Amazon claims. Testing showed the antenna can provide “maximum throughput of up to 400 Mbps.” The company also notes that the antenna can be used to stream 4K-quality videos from geostationary satellites, spacecraft that are located about 22,000 miles above the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="14TKz9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Testing showed the antenna can provide “maximum throughput of up to 400 Mbps”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jayeTv"&gt;Amazon Kuiper’s satellites will be much closer to Earth, though. In July, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348768/fcc-amazon-kuiper-satellite-constellation-approval"&gt;Amazon received approval from the Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; to launch a constellation of 3,236 satellites for Project Kuiper, with the spacecraft flying at altitudes ranging from 590 kilometers, or 366 miles, to 630 kilometers, or 391 miles. With so many satellites orbiting close to Earth, Project Kuiper aims to beam low-latency, broadband internet coverage to individual users on the planet below. The goal is to provide coverage to remote areas and regions that do not have access to traditional high-speed internet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VttFsmYgCEj7XUHI8A_iDqvcUpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22174953/Project_Kuiper_Customer_Terminal_Antenna__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Project Kuiper engineers testing the Ka-band phased array antenna.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="90BPnV"&gt;Amazon is one of a number of companies focused on launching a massive internet-from-space constellation. Notably, SpaceX is eyeing the same goal with its Starlink initiative, a proposed constellation of nearly 12,000 satellites that will also provide broadband internet from low to medium Earth orbits. SpaceX has already launched nearly 1,000 of its Starlink satellites and has even begun initial beta testing, providing select customers with at-home antennas to tap into the satellites and receive internet coverage. Amazon has yet to launch any satellites, nor has the company revealed on which rocket the satellites will launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rcv17J"&gt;Amazon argues that by making its user terminals smaller, it will reduce the cost of making the hardware as well as lower the price point for customers to opt into the program. The company claims it was able to go small by overlaying “tiny antenna element structures” over one another. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/25ajzFXkY2eH4AkITv9vk-wPDnI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22174971/Project_Kuiper_Customer_Terminal_Antenna__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antenna testing at Project Kuiper HQ in Redmond, Washington.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W814yS"&gt;“If you want to make a difference for unserved and underserved communities, you need to deliver service at a price that makes sense for customers,” Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Project Kuiper, &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/amazon-marks-breakthrough-in-project-kuiper-development"&gt;said in an Amazon blog post today&lt;/a&gt;. “This simple fact inspired one of our key tenets for Kuiper: to invent a light, compact phased array antenna that would allow us to produce an affordable customer terminal. It’s incredible to see such a small form factor delivering this type of speed and performance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLVdDD"&gt;The 12-inch diameter makes the Amazon antenna much smaller than the Starlink antenna based on photos of the SpaceX user terminals that beta-testers have posted to Reddit. To test out SpaceX’s Starlink hardware, beta-testers had to pay an upfront cost of $499 for all of the equipment and then an additional $99 a month. Amazon has not revealed its prices for Project Kuiper, but the company did vow to invest $10 billion into the program.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pinterest overhauls harassment policy following discrimination complaints</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pinterest Takes Stock Public On New York Stock Exchange" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HcO9rchE3xfDa7IHKyE8n-fcYKw=/0x1734:4160x4507/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68524214/1143514577.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sSkgF0"&gt;A five-month investigation into Pinterest’s company culture published on Wednesday recommends broad changes to how the firm handles workplace conflicts, including harassment and retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAeZzJ"&gt;Produced by the law firm WilmerHale, the report details how the company can improve its workplace conditions and prevent discrimination, specifically recommending the creation of an internal ombudsman’s office that can field employee complaints. The law firm spoke with 350 current and former Pinterest employees over the course of its five-month investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc2TYi"&gt;Pinterest’s board has already unanimously voted to adopt the recommendations, which were shared with employees on Wednesday and &lt;a href="https://www.pinterest-assets.com/m/137b577c199a60d3/original/Special-Committee-Communication-and-Recommendations-for-Pinterest.pdf"&gt;posted publicly on the company’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCJOqb"&gt;In recent months, a number of Pinterest employees have come forward with complaints about the company’s culture, some of which have led to lawsuits against the company. Earlier this week, Pinterest settled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175043/pinterest-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement-coo-francoise-brougher"&gt;a gender discrimination lawsuit with former COO Franćoise Brougher&lt;/a&gt;, paying $20 million to Brougher and her attorneys as well as an additional $2.5 million to philanthropies supporting underrepresented groups in tech. In part, WilmerHale’s recommendations are likely intended to forestall future litigation and limit Pinterest’s liability from any complaints that emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nYPr4N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It refers obliquely to allegations made by Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VITpuZ"&gt;The report begins with a section titled “How We Got Here.” It refers obliquely to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21429619/pinterest-workplace-discrimination-finance-team-unequal-culture-bias"&gt;allegations made by two employees&lt;/a&gt;, Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks, who previously worked on Pinterest’s policy team. In June, both women spoke out about racism and sexism at the company.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2A0Kr"&gt;Pinterest should establish a centralized workplace investigations team to follow up on employee complaints, the report says. “It is critical that investigations of workplace concerns are thorough, follow clear and standardized procedures, and are conducted with empathy and care,” it adds. “This includes, for example, promptly responding to employees when they file a complaint, investigating as confidentially as possible, and emphasizing, in communications during an investigation, Pinterest’s prohibition against retaliation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="n8W0C6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The report calls for an “escalations team” to investigate particularly sensitive issues &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BkVCmK"&gt;The report also recommends that Pinterest’s process for disciplining employees should be consistent: “Pinterest should formalize its existing calibrations practice so that investigators are recommending similar outcomes for similar conduct across the Company and, specifically, that its policies and standards apply equally to all members of the Pinterest community, including managers and Senior Leaders.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99bxH5"&gt;Additionally, the report calls for an “escalations team” to investigate particularly sensitive issues raised by employees. “Pinterest should also revise its escalation protocol to clarify which cases should be promptly escalated and to whom — such as the General Counsel, Chief Human Resources Officer, members of the Executive Leadership Team, or the Board — regardless of whether they warrant investigation by outside counsel or an independent investigator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gd6M73"&gt;Another recommendation calls attention to Pinterest’s lack of a standalone drugs and alcohol policy that would dictate employee conduct at work events. Such a policy should enforce managerial behavior around making employees who don’t drink feel comfortable at work events in the presence of alcohol and also emphasize that alcohol does not excuse employee misconduct, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHt227"&gt;Notably, the report says Pinterest needs to “address off-site conduct,” meaning that any policy changes going forward need to take into account any behaviors that may “impact working relationships and the broader working environment, regardless of where it occurs (including on social media).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0lwei"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Pinterest spokesperson said: “Pinterest is fully committed to making the changes recommended by the Special Committee of the Board. We value our employees and know it’s our responsibility to build a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment for everyone at Pinterest.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="pX4XzU"&gt;Hours after announcing it would bring controversial horror game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236099/devotion-horror-game-steam-twitch-red-candle"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devotion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to its platform, CD Projekt Red’s digital storefront GOG has reneged on its release plans. The company’s social media account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GOGcom/status/1339227388438306817"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that “after receiving many messages from gamers, we have decided not to list the game in our store.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhGEHG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devotion&lt;/em&gt; has been at the center of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18239937/taiwanese-horror-game-devotion-gone-steam-removed-winnie-the-pooh-meme-china"&gt;censorship controversy&lt;/a&gt; since release last year, after players found in-game content that referred to Xi Jinping, the president of China, as a “Winnie-the-Pooh moron.” The Chinese leader is &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/8/4/17651630/christopher-robin-banned-in-china-pooh"&gt;notoriously sensitive&lt;/a&gt; to the cartoon bear, to which memers have continuously compared him; the movie &lt;em&gt;Christopher Robin &lt;/em&gt;did not get a Chinese release. Mentions of comedian John Oliver were outright censored on social media after a segment that mentioned the Winnie the Pooh comparisons. Players review-bombed the game, and the developer pulled it from Steam shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KjV7CO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“after receiving many messages from gamers, we have decided not to list the game in our store”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8cC4ri"&gt;At the time, Taiwanese developer Red Candle Games issued several apologies, first claiming that they’d pulled the game due to a &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1006510/discussions/0/1796278072845376475/"&gt;QA check&lt;/a&gt;, and that the art’s inclusion &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1006510/announcements/detail/1769256475090574891"&gt;was a mistake&lt;/a&gt;. The developer &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1006510/announcements/detail/1769256475103741408"&gt;later addressed&lt;/a&gt; the art in question more thoroughly. “We failed our players’ anticipation and offended many others due to the said mistake,” Red Candle Games wrote on Steam. “For that, we feel awfully sorry and devastated ... Red Candle Games take full responsibility and bear all the condemns. We sincerely hope that this end with Red Candle, and that please do not take it out on all the innocent partners.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQCEER"&gt;In the months following, &lt;em&gt;Devotion&lt;/em&gt; struggled to find a new home. In a &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/15/20694744/devotion-red-candle-games-controversy-update-statement-re-release"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; printed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s sister site &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;, Red Candle Games said that “in the aftermath of the incident, some still possess different speculations about &lt;em&gt;Devotion&lt;/em&gt;. As regretful as the incident was, we have to bear its full consequence. We hope for a second chance in the near future. A chance to prove that, both Red Candle and its partner simply wanted to create a great game and no one wished for such incident to occur.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bR20Y7"&gt;It’s been a busy news cycle for CD Projekt Red — better known as a developer than for its PC storefront — over the past week. The studio’s highly anticipated release &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173738/cyberpunk-2077-developer-apologizes-base-ps4-xbox-one-performance-issues-refunds"&gt;plagued with technical issues&lt;/a&gt; and demands for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176279/cyberpunk-2077-performance-issues-refunds-microsoft-sony-ps4-xbox-one"&gt;refunds&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, GOG is notorious for posting &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-account-publishes-yet-another-awful-tweet-1829939458"&gt;insensitive material on social media&lt;/a&gt;, in keeping with CD Projekt Red’s habit of appealing to an &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/22058784/cyberpunk-2077-marketing-cd-projekt-red-transphobia"&gt;edgy fan base&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxaRa0"&gt;Red Candle Games’ &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/redcandlegames/status/1339148313032060929"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Devotion&lt;/em&gt; would finally find a home on GOG, however, has been short-lived. We’ve reached out to GOG for comment and will update accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
