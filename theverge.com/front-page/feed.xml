    <title>Vergecast: Two new Google antirust cases and an AirPods Max review </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QTMjBY"&gt;It seems like there’s no sign of tech news stopping for the holidays. In &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;s &lt;/em&gt;last regular episode of 2020, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Dieter Bohn and Nilay Patel bring on senior reporter Adi Robertson and editor Chris Welch to explain the biggest stories in tech from this past week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jd5sEh"&gt;In the first half of the show, Adi explains two (!) more antitrust cases brought against Google this week: one from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178988/google-antitrust-ad-tech-lawsuit-texas-attorney-general-paxton"&gt;Texas attorney general&lt;/a&gt; and the other from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22186994/google-search-antitrust-lawsuit-colorado-nebraska-state-ags"&gt;a coalition of 38 states&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;breaks down their arguments about Google’s alleged anti-competitive behavior around ad tech and search manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2gnAW"&gt;In the second half of the show, &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; shift gears to a review of the latest product announcement from Apple: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;the AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;. Chris reviewed the new $550 headphones for the site, and he details his experience on the show — from comfortability to design and sound quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaKqS2"&gt;There’s a whole lot more in between all of that — like a privacy debate between Facebook and Apple, some rumors about the next Samsung flagship phones, and the ability to “ProRAW” image capture on the iPhone 12 Pro — so listen through to hear it all. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Time is running out to snag these deals before the holidays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Animal Crossing: New Horizons" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1PhGMFVJ1TXjHlYYFe8JwAYBbt4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548233/Switch_ACNH_0220_Direct_Layout_SCRN_11_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons for the Nintendo Switch offers some much-needed joy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cpkgON"&gt;The holidays are upon us, and we’re just about to enter crunch time for gift-getting. If you haven’t made your selections, it’s possible that gifts might not get where they need to go on time — unless you pay for rush shipping or you take advantage of curbside pickup services. I know that’s a lot of pressure, but if you’re ready to make a few purchases for tech fans in your life, we have a few last-minute suggestions that also happen to be good deals. Depending on the retailer, these might not arrive in time for the holidays, but it’s the thought that counts, right? You’ve got this!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rb-rYrx0aIIqbpRvhnYsRL7skeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19927387/DSCF5984_1_2.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lMg7Sf"&gt;Google’s latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21400695/google-pixel-buds-2-2020-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Pixel Buds&lt;/a&gt; wireless earbuds rarely see a discount, but they’re $35 off at online store Antonline. Normally $179, &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/google/pixel_buds"&gt;they’re $144&lt;/a&gt; when you enter the code &lt;strong&gt;antfarm&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. This deal is available until December 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yO3sUFwh9SHcxCjhbb_m1O4BWY8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21699852/IMG_0626-1.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FRSHkA"&gt;Sony’s ever-popular WH-1000XM4 wireless, noise-canceling headphones are $278 at several retailers, which is the same $72 discount we’ve seen pop up a few times this season. Normally $349, they’re a solid option if you want high-end sound and effective noise cancellation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9kcIwS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9523565"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1lhEhV"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro are still selling for a great price at Woot. $190 is the best price heading into the holidays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eGiBjG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LiwFZ5"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show series of smart displays just got Zoom support, so you can easily boot up a video call with family over the holidays. The most affordable model is the Echo Show 5, which is just $45 at a few retailers. If you want a bigger display and better sound performance, check out the Echo Show 8 for $80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g4uAJZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="yjmxPa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NLClPI"&gt;Giving your home Wi-Fi signal a boost is never a bad idea. If you or a loved one has a one-router setup that just isn’t cutting it with the work-from-home lifestyle that the pandemic has forced us into, check out this deal on a three-pack of Eero 6 mesh Wi-Fi routers. Normally $279, you can get them for $223 at Best Buy and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kyOOYe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603441"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ScwMZ2"&gt;If you’re new to the Nintendo Switch and are in need of some games, a few of the best are discounted, including &lt;em&gt;Pok&lt;/em&gt;é&lt;em&gt;mon Sword&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shield, Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2VlfjW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="DEjyKW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514849"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="QdeD6P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10241211"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="turCoo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zreOKq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s holiday event brings back airplanes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TBxLaG9xeb1R9Ge9xyFFuwQ2rKw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548224/fortnite_snowmando_quest_frost_squad_and_snowmando_outfits_1920x1080_2177b76f5c5c.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LYRfLK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s annual holiday event is back, and this time, it brings a surprise: the return of airplanes. “&lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/operation-snowdown-starts-now-in-fortnite-unlock-free-outfits-take-flight-and-more"&gt;Operation Snowdown&lt;/a&gt;,” as it’s called, lasts from December 18th to January 5th, and it adds the expected to the game, including a snowy map and free unlockables like a soldier snowman called Snowmando. Everyone who logs in before January 5th will also get a free caroling emote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sO2KGL"&gt;The biggest feature, though, is the return of airplanes. The timing is perfect: planes were first introduced in season 7, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128743/fortnite-season-7-trailer-details-battle-pass"&gt;back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, which was also a winter-themed update for the game. (There was even a militarized Santa character.) They were later removed, and it sounds like their latest appearance will be short-lived as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uIgCMh"&gt;In addition to the new missions and free unlockable cosmetics, the event will also include a rotating selection of limited time game modes, starting with the return of Air Royale. There will also be new holiday-themed items for purchase, including a shifty-looking candy cane man.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ybhlMgrKADaDljfpV46DSA5QIpw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22182372/fortnite_holiday_outfits_1920x1080_1f6b8460b369.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NBzyDm"&gt;It’s been a busy month for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;a massive supervillain-themed live event&lt;/a&gt;, the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;kicked off its latest season on December 2nd&lt;/a&gt;, introducing new characters like the Mandalorian and Baby Yoda. Since then, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166187/fortnite-master-chief-halo-the-walking-dead-the-game-awards"&gt;Master Chief&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22151470/fortnite-god-of-war-kratos-skin-now-available"&gt;Kratos&lt;/a&gt; have joined the battle royale game, and Epic has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176382/fortnite-epic-120-fps-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;continued to improve &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on next-gen consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge guide to The Mandalorian</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FGeW76UTq-A0RzqdsGw0kc_LUCk=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67713269/HUC2_010643_R.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1SbcAl"&gt;For a show about a tiny alien, &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; sure had a huge impact. The first season of the series helped sell millions on Disney Plus, the company’s Netflix-style streaming service, while simultaneously showing how the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; universe could translate to prestige television. It was, to put it succinctly, a hit — one that became even more popular thanks to the adorable Baby Yoda. Er, I mean, &lt;em&gt;The Child&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwG2Cb"&gt;The second season, meanwhile, faces a very different challenge. Not only does it have to live up to the hype generated by season 1, but it’s also releasing at a time when many of the biggest movies and TV shows have been indefinitely delayed due to the ongoing pandemic, making it arguably the biggest entertainment release of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9llms4"&gt;To help you keep track of everything related to the show — reviews of the latest episodes, analyses on what its success means for Disney’s business, and yes, cute pictures of Baby Yoda — we’ve created this landing page to gather up all of the biggest &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; stories in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5C5C7"&gt;If you need to stay up to date — this is the way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="sZjGd5"&gt;As expected,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/star-wars/2020/10/30/21517931/the-mandalorian-news-reviews-disney-plus-star-wars-baby-yoda"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt; finale culminated in a dramatic showdown between Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) — aka, Mando — and Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) over the fate of Grogu (née Baby Yoda). But “The Rescue” didn’t just run into the expected complications for an assault on a massive Imperial cruiser: it also ran into the mainstream &lt;em&gt;Star Wars &lt;/em&gt;universe in the biggest way yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSi3rP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: Spoilers for the entirety of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; season 2 and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star Wars: The Last Jedi &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;follow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FoJsH"&gt;Par for the course for Mando, though, things didn’t go quite as planned. While the armored hero did succeed in saving his adopted son, it came at a bittersweet cost: Grogu’s earlier callout for any other Jedi was answered by none other than Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill, reprising the iconic role through a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/27/14090152/rogue-one-animators-star-wars-grand-moff-tarkin-peter-cushing-cgi"&gt;not entirely convincing&lt;/a&gt; CGI de-aging effect). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0U9Xh"&gt;The result? The Child is saved, but Luke is taking him away to continue his training in the ways of the Force. After avoiding the larger &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; universe for two seasons, &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; has found itself right in the path of the Skywalker Saga. It’s a move that has big ramifications, for both Mando and the show that bears his name.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hYa6pUTQoGYX0LjSSKGh9Rr9MH0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22182173/Screen_Shot_2020_12_18_at_8.36.31_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RqgJmf"&gt;After all, Grogu has been practically synonymous with &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; for the last two years. He’s been the guiding star that Mando has followed, the catalyst for his transformation from a cold bounty hunter who just follows the money to his next job into a loving, caring father figure. Even at the end, Mando finds it hard to let go. “He doesn’t want to go with you!” he tells Luke, before almost tearfully taking off his helmet to say goodbye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiJWkG"&gt;Where things go next is unclear. The Luke who we meet here is a very different person from the young Jedi who fought with Vader and the Emperor on the Death Star a few years earlier or the grizzled, jaded hermit living in self-imposed exile after his failure to train Ben Solo / Kylo Ren. (Interestingly enough, Ben is about four years old at the time of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;— meaning Grogu might be getting a new toddler friend who is also strong with the Force.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LWYP5"&gt;This is Luke at his prime, back when he still believed in the idea of training a new generation of Jedi. The sequence that sees Luke calmly dismantle a platoon of Dark Troopers (itself almost an inverse of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/21/14040916/darth-vader-rogue-one-final-lightsaber-scene-star-wars"&gt;chilling Vader hallway scene&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxL8bVJhXCM"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) is a demonstration of the height of Luke’s power here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIlcfW"&gt;Of course — and, rather concerning where Grogu is concerned — we know that Luke’s efforts are doomed to failure. In just a few short years (a blink of an eye for Grogu, given the comparatively slow aging of his and Yoda’s race), Ben Solo will turn on his master, slaughter the Jedi trainees at Luke’s temple, and be reborn as Kylo Ren at the forefront of the First Order. Hopefully, Grogu won’t be among them when he does.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B33OSmDVIXt6G_qpZBpKRZsi1Rs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22182193/Screen_Shot_2020_12_18_at_9.54.30_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pAy4ca"&gt;But that’s all relatively far in the future. For now, &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s second season leaves bigger questions unanswered. Where does Mando go next without his son? Does Din backslide into bounty hunting, scraping out a living now that he no longer has someone to take care of or a grand quest to pursue? Will he be dragged into the contentious world of Mandalorian politics as the current wielder of the Darksaber? And is the show really going to put Grogu — its most popular, most iconic character — on the sidelines? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rustgz"&gt;“I’ll see you again. I promise,” Mando tells Grogu before giving him over to Luke. And with &lt;a href="https://tvline.com/2020/12/10/the-mandalorian-renewed-season-3-premiere-date-disney-plus/#:~:text=The%20Mandalorian%20Season%203%20Will%20Bow%20Christmas%202021%2C%20Disney%2B%20Confirms&amp;amp;text=Christmas%202021%20has%20come%20early,Walt%20Disney's%20Investor%20Day%20presentation."&gt;more seasons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188516/boba-fett-disney-plus-show-2021-release-date-mandalorian-finale"&gt;spinoffs&lt;/a&gt; looking to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168619/disney-plus-star-wars-rangers-of-the-new-republic-ahsoka-mandalorian-spinoffs"&gt;build out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s corner of the galaxy in the coming years, it seems likely that this won’t be the last we see of the adorable green child. After all, if there’s one thing that we’ve learned about Mando in the last two seasons, he always keeps his word. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US government bans DJI over ties to Chinese government</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KjTVGidMXsRZEnYMnxZNU7J0XK4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548007/vpavic_042029_4003_0167.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A9qdgB"&gt;DJI — one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199842/bloomberg-businessweek-dji-drone-market-share-china-government-security"&gt;largest and most popular drone companies in the world&lt;/a&gt; — has been &lt;a href="https://dronedj.com/2020/12/18/dji-added-to-us-dept-of-commerce-entity-list-bad-news-for-chinese-company/"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; to the US Department of Commerce’s Entity List, designating the Chinese company as a national security concern and banning US-based companies from exporting technology to the company. &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-adding-chinese-drone-company-dji-to-economic-blacklist-official-2020-12"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; first reported the news&lt;/a&gt;, citing a conference call with a senior commerce official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yl8G3Q"&gt;The ban was put in place through the same mechanism as the US government’s ongoing ban on Huawei products, and is primarily focused on blocking the export of US technology to the drone-maker. However, the ban may make it difficult for US stores to directly sell DJI products. More directly, it will make it difficult for US businesses to provide parts or components for DJI to use in its drones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kYfGd"&gt;The ban is set to go into effect when the list is officially updated at 11:15AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iwx9PI"&gt;Surprisingly, the Commerce Department is reportedly citing human rights concerns over DJI’s involvement in providing drones to the Chinese government as the rationale for the ban, instead of security concerns, &lt;a href="https://dronedj.com/2020/12/18/dji-added-to-us-dept-of-commerce-entity-list-bad-news-for-chinese-company/"&gt;per &lt;em&gt;DroneDJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. DJI drones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199842/bloomberg-businessweek-dji-drone-market-share-china-government-security"&gt;have been used&lt;/a&gt; to surveil Uighurs in the Xinjiang province back in 2017, &lt;a href="https://api.narrativ.com/api/v0/redirect/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Ffeatures%2F2020-03-26%2Fdji-s-drone-supremacy-comes-at-a-price%3Fsrnd%3Deconomics-vp%26sref%3DExbtjcSG&amp;amp;a=1722098870466579501&amp;amp;uuid=0129be77-04d4-4fff-93e3-0a2eea64f11f&amp;amp;uid_bam=1720778310608519800&amp;amp;ar=1726904878611144427" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;per a &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Businessweek&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvclEj"&gt;But the United States government has also cited several concerns in the past over security issues with the drones, which are largely made in China and contain Chinese parts. The Department of the Interior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113533/us-interior-department-chinese-drone-ban-grounding-security-dji"&gt;has announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to ground its drone fleet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20940921/us-interior-department-drone-grounding-china-spying-cybersecurity-risk"&gt;as it reviews&lt;/a&gt; whether there are any major security concerns of Chinese spying or cyberattacks. And the Department of Justice &lt;a href="https://www.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh241/files/media/document/ojporderfundingdrones.pdf"&gt;banned&lt;/a&gt; buying foreign-made drones — which includes DJI’s products — using agency funds back in October, &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/520269-justice-department-issues-policy-banning-use-of-grant-funds-for-certain"&gt;citing similar security concerns&lt;/a&gt;. The Department of Defense has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21376917/drone-us-government-approved-dod-diu-uas-blue-china"&gt;certified several other drones&lt;/a&gt; from competitors like Parrot and Skydio for governmental use instead, after several years of review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nryl2v"&gt;It’s a significant escalation in President Trump’s ongoing efforts to block Chinese tech companies from operating in the United States. Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order"&gt;placed Huawei on the entity list by executive order&lt;/a&gt; in May 2019, citing national security concerns. Europe and the UK have largely declined to follow suit and continue to use Huawei hardware in their telecommunications networks. Trump took similar measures to block TikTok and WeChat from being hosted in US app stores, although the efforts were held up by court challenges and both apps remain widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzZmjH"&gt;It is unclear whether President-elect Biden will continue these policies after taking office on January 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3yEtg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple explains how the AirPods Max conserve battery life — with or without the case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max in case with iPod and AirPods Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6mbEe7tg3aOiglzwJ2U5i7-NDI4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547607/npatel_201209_4332_0016.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nilay Patel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ckRZ6B"&gt;After some initial confusion around how the AirPods Max handle power management, Apple has tried to clarify the issue with &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211886"&gt;an updated support page&lt;/a&gt; outlining how and when its new $550 headphones automatically conserve battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyxn56"&gt;Originally, the company said that “when stored in their soft, slim smart case, AirPods Max enter an ultra‑low‑power state that preserves charge.” But there was uncertainty about what happens when they’re left &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the case. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;In my review&lt;/a&gt;, I found that the headphones lost only a few battery percentage points when left out overnight with no case — nothing close to a worrying level of drain. But not everyone had that experience; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvvo6vUpJRc"&gt;Marques Brownlee&lt;/a&gt; observed a greater amount of battery loss when the AirPods Max were idle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgLlfQ"&gt;According to Apple, the AirPods Max enter a “low power mode” when removed from your head and left stationary for five minutes outside of the case. If they’re left in that state for 72 hours, they go into a &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; power mode that switches off Bluetooth and features like Apple’s Find My location tracking. This, essentially, sounds like when they actually turn “off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgvvoN"&gt;But somewhat surprisingly, the smart case doesn’t immediately trigger this deeper sleep mode as quickly as I would’ve thought. Inserting the AirPods Max into the case puts them into that lighter low power mode right away. But it takes 18 hours of the headphones being in the smart case for them to enter the ultra-low power mode. When the case is factored in, Apple never mentions that the headphones have to be “stationary” to enter these modes. But the fact that it takes almost an entire 24 hours for the AirPods Max to hit that point where they maximize battery — even in the case — is a bit surprising to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnVW3m"&gt;Clearly, the company is prioritizing quick device reconnections and convenience over eking every last bit of battery out of the AirPods Max. One big question is what happens if the headphones are left worn around your neck when removed; since they’re not stationary in that scenario, my guess is that they remain fully active until taken off and put on a table or stand. It’s possible that Apple could adjust these default behaviors through firmware updates, but for now, this is how the AirPods Max work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18Qv0J"&gt;Even if I’ve seen minimal battery drain, and just as I say in our video review, I still wish they had a power button. For simplicity’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA will fly Orion deep-space crew capsule ‘as is,’ despite failed component</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dor0bnohP2ZyUY0vlxq9lw03dBs=/0x0:5040x3360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547603/KSC_20201028_PH_JBS01_0137_orig.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NASA’s Orion capsule attached to its adapter and service module.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Ben Smegelsky / NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z0TMsK"&gt;NASA is opting to fly its future deep-space crew capsule Orion “as is” next year, after the agency discovered that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726753/nasa-orion-crew-capsule-power-unit-failure-artemis-i"&gt;one of the spacecraft’s power instruments had suffered a failure&lt;/a&gt;. Engineers had been mulling over whether to replace the instrument before the vehicle’s flight but ultimately decided that there was enough redundancy in the system to withstand the failed component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDvPKa"&gt;“NASA has confidence in the health of the overall power and data system, which has been through thousands of hours of powered operations and testing,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2020/12/17/artemis-i-orion-progress-update/"&gt;the agency wrote in a blog post announcing the decision&lt;/a&gt;. “Engineers will perform additional testing and continue to monitor the health of the spacecraft while Orion is powered on to provide continued confidence in the system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jOhTvM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“NASA has confidence in the health of the overall power and data system.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hRTH1v"&gt;In November, engineers at NASA and Lockheed Martin, Orion’s primary contractor, found that part of an instrument known as a power and data unit, or PDU, had failed. One of eight PDUs on Orion, the instrument is needed for activating various functions while the capsule is in flight. It’s also in a fairly hard-to-reach place. This PDU is located in the adapter that connects the Orion capsule with its service module, a cylindrical trunk that supports the vehicle during flight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4jedO"&gt;Replacing the PDU wouldn’t exactly be a quick fix. Engineers were looking at options that would have taken four to 12 months to complete. The fixes would have involved either taking apart the vehicle or tunneling through the outer walls to reach the PDU, and the extra time could have potentially caused a delay for Orion’s target launch date in November 2021. Instead, NASA has chosen not to replace the PDU. The instrument can still function; it just lost one of its power channels used for redundancy. That means this PDU will fly without a backup system in case its primary channel fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ie9Hil"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Replacing the PDU wouldn’t exactly be a quick fix&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q4rVy4"&gt;NASA claims that fixing the PDU presented more risk than flying &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the PDU. “[Engineers] determined that due to the limited accessibility to this particular box, the degree of intrusiveness to the overall spacecraft systems, and other factors, the risk of collateral damage outweighed the risk associated with the loss of one leg of redundancy in a highly redundant system,” the agency wrote in its blog post. “Therefore, NASA has made the decision to proceed with vehicle processing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2e3j4F"&gt;No people will be on board this Orion spacecraft when it flies. The vehicle is slated to fly uncrewed on top of NASA’s future massive rocket, the Space Launch System, or SLS. That rocket is also undergoing testing ahead of that flight, and it’s unclear if it will be ready by November 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US plans major expansion of facial recognition authority at airports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6BCFT0WMI5-3sAu0FWVhEdiuQhE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547532/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W6SWkv"&gt;US Customs and Border Protection has filed for a significant expansion in its authority to conduct facial recognition at airports. On November 19th, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/11/19/2020-24707/collection-of-biometric-data-from-aliens-upon-entry-to-and-departure-from-the-united-states"&gt;submitted a filing to the Federal Register&lt;/a&gt; seeking to expand the ongoing biometric exit program, broadening the program’s scope to include all air and land ports. The filing also shifts the program’s focus entirely to facial recognition, at the expense of alternate methods like fingerprinting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPAodL"&gt;The filing is subject to public comment for a brief time after its submission. That comment period will end on Monday, December 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zFT8TE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All aliens may be required to be photographed upon entry”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZBFmX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15332742/us-border-biometric-exit-facial-recognition-scanning-homeland-security"&gt;First deployed in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, biometric exit has operated as a pilot program, limited to a handful of ports in order to assess its viability, although customs officials &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/18/18484581/us-airport-facial-recognition-departing-flights-biometric-exit"&gt;spoke openly about plans to expand it&lt;/a&gt;. As part of the pilot authorization, Customs officials could only collect data from select ports and travelers — but this new proposal would allow border agencies to expand the program at their own discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcqRPw"&gt;“If this proposed rule is adopted as a final rule, CBP would continue to expand testing as necessary,” the filing reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5fOih"&gt;In particular, that will mean a blanket authorization to collect photographs of the faces of non-citizens. Under the new rule, anyone going through customs on the way in or out of the country should expect to have their face photographed and run through a facial recognition program. The system may also be used to identify US citizens, although they retain the option to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoOEcm"&gt;“This proposed rule provides that all aliens may be required to be photographed upon entry and/or departure,” the filing explains. “The use of facial recognition technology upon entry and departure will make the process for verifying an alien’s identity more efficient and accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3brAx"&gt;Initially proposed as a means to verify travelers’ identities and prevent visa fraud, the biometric exit program has expanded to include new measures to identify suspects of unrelated crimes. As &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-cbp006-ats-december2019.pdf"&gt;the privacy assessment explains&lt;/a&gt;, the database that matches visa photographs to travelers “will also match those available photographs against available photographs associated with derogatory records, such as TECS lookout records, Terrorist Screening Data Base (TSDB) records, and outstanding wants and warrants.” Travelers with outstanding warrants will be flagged for further review by customs agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UlzHjU"&gt;It remains unclear how President-elect Biden will handle the expanding system when he takes office on January 20th. Biden was largely silent on facial recognition throughout his campaign and has not committed to a stance on the program. Earlier this month, a coalition of civil rights groups pushed the incoming president for stricter regulation of the technology &lt;a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2020/12/08/advocates-to-press-biden-congress-on-facial-recognition-curbs/"&gt;in an open letter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKxGnH"&gt;In June, lawmakers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303355/facial-recognition-ed-markey-ayanna-pressley-ban-federal-agencies-fed-law-enforcement"&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt; to ban facial recognition at the federal level, but the proposal has not moved forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRMQ2t"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAzjs8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In 2020, live product launches turned into infomercials</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jWImwY"&gt;In a year when the spread of COVID-19 made bringing large crowds together impossible, companies around the world had to reevaluate their love affair with the live product launch. Packing hundreds of attendees into extravagant venues to hang on every word of company executives was never going to be possible in an era of social distancing. Instead, events moved online, and many changed completely in the process as companies dropped risky product demonstrations in favor of slick prerecorded video segments. These events effectively turned from live launches into infomercials, and it makes me wonder how the likes of Apple, Amazon, Google, Sony, or Microsoft will be able to go back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRrRDC"&gt;It’s a striking change, thanks in part to how consistent the format for most launches has stayed over the last three decades. In 1984, Apple CEO Steve Jobs &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tQ5XwvjPmA"&gt;showed off the Macintosh’s features&lt;/a&gt; through onstage demonstrations, a slideshow presentation, and video segments like the famous &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zfqw8nhUwA"&gt;Ridley Scott-directed ad&lt;/a&gt;. Decades later, in 2019, the format had barely changed. When Apple CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6XBRvfupm0"&gt;launched the iPhone 11&lt;/a&gt; alongside a host of other devices last year, the budgets may have been bigger, the product list longer, and the demos more polished, but the whole event followed the same playbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mHJV2R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The format for products launches has been consistent for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uHYfIu"&gt;One day after Samsung held a similarly traditional in-person event in February to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guptCU6yUEk"&gt;unveil its Galaxy S20 smartphones&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21127754/mwc-2020-canceled-coronavirus-trade-show-phone-mobile-world-congress-gsma-statement"&gt;GSM Association canceled Mobile World Congress&lt;/a&gt;, an annual trade show that was due to take place in Barcelona. The announcement didn’t come out of the blue — multiple companies, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21123169/lg-electronics-mwc-2020-cornavirus-cancel-withdraw-outbreak-concern"&gt;LG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131118/mwc-2020-coronavirus-intel-sony-amazon-cancel"&gt;Nvidia, Intel, Vivo, Sony, and Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, had already dropped out — but it made it clear to the industry that the days of business as usual were over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62ajMi"&gt;But even in a pandemic year, especially a year where many needed new equipment to adapt to new ways of working, gadgets still needed to come out. The question became &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;to launch them. Early on, many companies appeared to simply take the presentations they would have otherwise done in person and move them online. The reduced audience noise was the only hint that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4nFTqmuQxY"&gt;Huawei’s P40 series launch event in March&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t happening in a typical room full of journalists, while &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOWVrkL_DEE&amp;amp;t=1209s"&gt;OnePlus was more upfront about the empty auditorium in which it launched its 8 series&lt;/a&gt;. Sony didn’t even bother with a big empty room for its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph8LyNIT9sg&amp;amp;t=513s"&gt;PS5 Game Developers Conference presentation&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it opted to have the console’s lead system architect, Mark Cerny, outline its capabilities in front of what appeared to be a green screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D74V8K"&gt;Before long, however, companies were experimenting with formats that would have never been possible with an in-person audience. Samsung, for example, had giant augmented reality versions of its devices appear during its &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/KnkckgwLcV8?t=508"&gt;August Unpacked event live stream&lt;/a&gt; for its onstage presenters to pretend to gawp at. The presentation may have been happening live, but these elements wouldn’t have been possible with a regular audience present.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Oexepa3emEXVjYuu4z8-l3uSus=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159720/msedge_IHNfdSlQh9.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmS5rlX9cDA&amp;amp;t=4686s" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visual flourishes like this would be impossible during an in-person event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4fAy7o"&gt;No one shifted quicker or more completely to a new presentation style than Apple. Its live product launches gave way to streamlined prerecorded presentations filled with computer-generated graphs and sweeping transitions around the firm’s monolithic donut-shaped headquarters (often nicknamed “the spaceship”). The first of these was its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q8AKghK44M"&gt;Worldwide Developers Conference keynote in June&lt;/a&gt;, but it used similar formats for its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMk1PYowq8M&amp;amp;t=8s"&gt;trio&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpw_z9vBPAE&amp;amp;t=4s"&gt;hardware&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umoEDgl_xBo&amp;amp;t=3s"&gt;launches&lt;/a&gt; later in the year. Other companies, like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaBXd-96uNg&amp;amp;t=10s"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSE1Ya_xOoY&amp;amp;t=488s"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, followed suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpVMKZ"&gt;They may have changed their launches primarily for health and safety, but they gained a lot from their new approach. Presentations could be more dynamic and densely packed with information as they were honed to their essential elements. These new launches were also less reliant on the often-shaky onstage charisma of company executives. But most importantly, these presentations removed the possibility of anything &lt;em&gt;going wrong&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C4TrvN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Prerecording a presentation removes the possibility of things going wrong&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IzHFB2"&gt;The tech world has a long and illustrious history of onstage mishaps — whether it’s an &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42614281"&gt;LG robot that repeatedly fails to respond to commands&lt;/a&gt;, the Tesla Cybertruck’s supposedly bulletproof glass that &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/m7atGkba-Z8?t=72"&gt;smashed not once but twice&lt;/a&gt; after being hit by a ball bearing, Apple’s new facial recognition security &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TLMpuZp4iw"&gt;failing to recognize faces&lt;/a&gt;, or Microsoft’s speech recognition technology &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX8oYoYy2Gc"&gt;failing to recognize speech&lt;/a&gt;. Live demonstrations always carry the risk of things going sideways. Sometimes nothing goes wrong onstage at all, but an audience’s laughter will shatter the illusion that $999 is a reasonable price to pay &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuW4Suo4OVg"&gt;for a monitor stand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="poPv1t"&gt;But the risk of failure means a live demonstration is that much more impressive when it goes right, like Google’s demonstration of its Glass eyewear at its I/O developer conference &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7TB8b2t3QE"&gt;back in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. “This can go wrong in about 500 different ways,” was how Google co-founder Sergey Brin introduced the demo, which saw a group &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/27/3121164/project-glass-demo-io"&gt;live-stream their skydive&lt;/a&gt; down to San Francisco’s Moscone Center using Google Glass. It was an excessive, over-the-top display, but it left little doubt that the device was capable of what Google showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sccj7O"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D7TB8b2t3QE?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=524&amp;amp;start=524" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ryY5CU"&gt;Few launches are as over-the-top as this, but everything from a demonstration of a voice assistant to new augmented reality developer tools is made that little bit more believable by watching it happen live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="siAiSw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Live” doesn’t guarantee “real,” but it helps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kR5KnF"&gt;And yet, a live demonstration is no guarantee of authenticity. Take the presenters who played &lt;em&gt;Kinect Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; at Microsoft’s E3 press conference in 2010, who appeared to be &lt;a href="https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/publishing/e3-2010-star-wars-kinect-video/"&gt;miming along with the on-screen action&lt;/a&gt; rather than controlling it directly. Other showcases give unfinished products a bit of a helping hand, like when the original iPhone’s antennas had to be &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/magazine/and-then-steve-said-let-there-be-an-iphone.html#after-story-ad-2:~:text=The%20software%20in%20the%20iPhone%E2%80%99s%20Wi%2DFi,wouldn%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20travel%20as%20far."&gt;connected to wires running offstage&lt;/a&gt; during its 2007 unveiling to make up for its unstable Wi-Fi radio software. In some cases, we’re so conditioned to expect trickery that an onstage hiccup can actually make a presentation more impressive by revealing that it’s being done for real, like when &lt;em&gt;Uncharted 4 &lt;/em&gt;co-director Bruce Straley found himself onstage &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/20/8817971/uncharted-4-e3-demo-blooper-snafu-gaffe"&gt;without the controller to actually play the game&lt;/a&gt; at Sony’s E3 presentation. The resulting 30 seconds of idle animation was enough to prove that the subsequent gameplay was definitely being played live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjhyIQ"&gt;Live demos don’t prove that what you’re seeing is real, but they’re still a lot more believable than something prepared ahead of time. A prerecorded infomercial just doesn’t have the same stakes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/peIeoOEkrFTQ2e_USYh2TppYDHs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159748/msedge_BlyQF5A9fz.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AwdkGKmZ0I" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was harder to believe Apple’s performance claims based on a prerecorded presentation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Q9LqJ"&gt;In 2020, every presentation went off without a hitch, but it was hard not to doubt what we were being shown. Apple attempted to re-create some of the impact of a live event &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GEZhD3J89ZE?t=5718"&gt;during its WWDC 2020 presentation&lt;/a&gt; when Craig Federighi revealed that a previous macOS Big Sur demonstration had &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; taken place on Macs running Apple Silicon rather than Intel chips. But considering any crashes or hitches could have been easily edited out, the revelation didn’t have the same impact as it would have. Most remained skeptical of the company’s claims until they were actually able to use the laptops for themselves months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KL1ozA"&gt;2020’s shift in product launches saw companies trade risky live demonstrations for tightly scripted videos. The question now is how quickly they’ll want to go back when it’s safe to do so. For some, I suspect the control they’ve had this year will be hard to give up. They’ll have seen how consistent and reliable a virtual launch can be, and the idea of returning to the unpredictability of doing things live won’t seem worth the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2441uH"&gt;Personally, I hope most companies avoid the temptation. Live launches might be fraught, logistical nightmares, but they’re also an opportunity to have a real impact and show why a new device, service, or game is actually worth paying attention to. Journalists will always exist to eventually separate reality from marketing, but a show-stopping event can be the thing that gets people interested enough to read a review in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
