    <title>In photos: the pro-Trump mob’s invasion of Congress</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Supporters of US President Donald Trump protest inside the US Capitol on January 6th, 2021, in Washington, DC. Demonstrators breached security and entered the Capitol as Congress debated the 2020 presidential Electoral Vote Certification. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Saul Loeb / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;As seen from inside the Capitol building&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="zudOLi"&gt;On Wednesday afternoon, a mob of pro-Trump protesters stormed the US Capitol, resulting in chambers being vandalized and at least one death. The attack came in the middle of an ongoing vote to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, and it sent both lawmakers and members of the press scrambling for safety. Some found discreet paths out of the building, while others took shelter in the tunnels beneath the Capitol. But some photojournalists wandered the halls of the Capitol alongside the intruders, capturing stunning images of the mob at work. With police struggling to bring the nation’s capital under control, those images gave us a first-hand look at the chaos and disgrace of today’s events.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook declares ‘emergency situation’ and removes Trump video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wSOk8xdbHH9yU_VOxXQO253sqLQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68630097/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7Zq9fM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;As rioters stormed the US Capitol&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, Facebook removed a video from President Donald Trump responding to the violence. The decision came around an hour after the video was posted on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKxwZE"&gt;“This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump’s video,” Guy Rosen, Facebook vice president of integrity, said in a tweet Wednesday. “We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UaLv6j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump's video. We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.&lt;/p&gt;— Guy Rosen (@guyro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guyro/status/1346950532372393985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6RKGut"&gt;In Trump’s video, he responded to the mob violence descending on the US Capitol as lawmakers were set to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. In the minute-long clip, Trump called on rioters to peacefully “go home” hours after the initial invasion began. He also made false claims that the most recent US election results were fraudulent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4gmSh"&gt;“We had an election that was stolen from us,” Trump stated falsely in the video. “It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side. But you have to go home now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnyGq8"&gt;Less than an hour later, Facebook also removed a text post from Trump which sought to justify the attack, telling supporters to “remember this day forever!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FdcDUK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter restricts Trump video, citing ‘risk of violence’ ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="7aSiE7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"YouTube removes Trump video addressing Capitol attack ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="li1aEt"&gt;Facebook placed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"&gt;a handful of labels&lt;/a&gt; on Trump’s video before finally deciding to remove it altogether. These previous labels focused on debunking Trump’s claims that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent. YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation"&gt;also removed&lt;/a&gt; the video, saying in a tweet, “Like other companies, we’re allowing these videos because discussion of election results &amp;amp; the process of counting votes is allowed on YT. These videos are not being surfaced or recommended in any prominent way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s67CI5"&gt;Twitter labeled Trump’s video, citing “a risk of violence,” but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"&gt;did not remove it&lt;/a&gt; as of publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9ZS0H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 6:21PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Facebook’s decision to remove Trump’s text post in addition to the video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube removes Trump video addressing Capitol attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y4ok4B46SQGjdOAPf6Qto4LH3tc=/0x1:2039x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68630050/GettyImages_1294927709.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Win McNamee / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cvaxy5"&gt;YouTube has removed a video from President Donald Trump addressing a mob attack on the Capitol today because the president repeats false information about the outcome of the 2020 election, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lfsjzd"&gt;The company will allow Trump’s message to appear in other creators’ videos if there is &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/look-how-we-treat-educational-documentary-scientific-and-artistic-content-youtube/"&gt;proper educational or news context&lt;/a&gt;; basically, if people are talking about Trump’s message as part of a greater point, YouTube will allow it to remain up. The removal comes after YouTube instituted a new policy update in December 2020 that forbids any type of content that alleges widespread voter fraud impacted the results of the 2020 presidential election. In Trump’s new video, which was also posted to Twitter and Facebook, he continued to spread misinformation about the 2020 election, calling the results fraudulent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVcayh"&gt;“We had an election that was stolen from us,” Trump stated falsely. “It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZ9FRq"&gt;He also used the video to call on rioters to “go home” following hours of the attack. Trump did not denounce any violence that occurred today. Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"&gt;placed restrictions on his video&lt;/a&gt;, preventing people from liking, retweeting, or replying to Trump’s original post. Twitter cited “risks of violence” as the reason. Some time later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"&gt;Twitter fully removed the video and two other Tweets&lt;/a&gt;, saying they had violated its rules. Trump’s post on Facebook initially received a label saying, “The US has laws, procedures, and established institutions to ensure the integrity of our elections,” but it has since removed it completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ajAMsJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Trump has continued to spread misinformation about the 2020 election, calling the results fraudulent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CfUBcb"&gt;YouTube’s move comes after the company faced criticism over the way it handled misinformation appearing on its platform the day of the election. At the time, YouTube defended leaving up a number of videos from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21550180/youtube-oann-video-election-trump-misinformation-voting-final-results-facebook-twitter"&gt;outlets like OANN and individual creators&lt;/a&gt; that  flocked to the site to spread misinformation about fraudulent results. Videos with titles like “Trump Won. MSM hopes you don’t believe your eyes” were allowed to remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Zx5nHG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter restricts Trump video, citing ‘risk of violence’ ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="bNUZcS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook declares ‘emergency situation’ and removes Trump video ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217788/facebook-remove-trump-video-emergency-situation-mob-violence"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mJUZpC"&gt;“Like other companies, we’re allowing these videos because discussion of election results &amp;amp; the process of counting votes is allowed on YT. These videos are not being surfaced or recommended in any prominent way,” YouTube wrote on Twitter at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKCxjJ"&gt;Since then, YouTube has reevaluated its policies. Today, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217421/capitol-building-trump-mob-protest-live-stream-youtube-twitch-facebook"&gt;people live-streamed the attack on Capitol and posted videos&lt;/a&gt;, the moderation teams are “working to quickly remove livestreams and other content that violates our policies, including those against incitement to violence or regarding footage of graphic violence,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That didn’t stop a few channels from using the attack to monetize their own live streams. YouTube has not said if it will revoke those payments if the streams are found to violate the company’s guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRh3FF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 6:45pm ET, January 6th: Updated to note that &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter also eventually pulled the video&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter pulls Trump video that it said posed a ‘risk of violence’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pc6qmW"&gt;In the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;an unprecedented mob attack on the Capitol building&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter restricted and then removed a tweet from President Donald Trump, including its attached video. Users initially could no longer reply to, like, or retweet the post due to what Twitter referred to as a “risk of violence.” The tweet containing the video was then deleted entirely with a nonspecific link to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/notices-on-twitter"&gt;Twitter’s policy guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="170CDU"&gt;In Trump’s Wednesday Twitter video, he responded &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;to mob violence&lt;/a&gt; at the US Capitol calling on rioters to peacefully “go home” hours after the chaos began. But he also repeated false claims that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent and did not denounce the violence, leading some to find the calls for order unconvincing. “We had an election that was stolen from us,” Trump said in the video. “It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side. But you have to go home now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iH4L1O"&gt;Twitter has previously labeled content posted by the president over the last year. Throughout the 2020 presidential election, the platform placed labels on dozens of Trump’s tweets that made false or misleading claims about voter fraud. It has also removed Trump content that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18303841/trump-twitter-the-dark-knight-rises-copyright-infringement-video-removed-hans-zimmer"&gt;subject to a copyright claim&lt;/a&gt;. However, this appears to be the first time Twitter flagged a tweet as posing “a risk of violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fEayqn"&gt;Twitter did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but it pointed to an earlier statement made Wednesday in a tweet thread. “In regard to the ongoing situation in Washington, D.C., we are working proactively to protect the health of the public conversation occurring on the service and will take action on any content that violates the Twitter rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Fugumj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"YouTube removes Trump video addressing Capitol attack ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="dAFAkX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook declares ‘emergency situation’ and removes Trump video ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217788/facebook-remove-trump-video-emergency-situation-mob-violence"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bXNcIH"&gt;Twitter’s statement continued, “We are also exploring other escalated enforcement actions and will keep the public updated with any significant developments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2eAu5p"&gt;Trump’s video was also posted to Facebook. Shortly after it was published, Facebook labeled the post directing users to factual information on 2020 election results. Later, Facebook imposed a stricter label that reads, “Joe Biden has been elected President in results that were certified by all 50 states. The US has laws, procedures, and established institutions to ensure the peaceful transfer of power after an election.” It then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217788/facebook-remove-trump-video-emergency-situation-mob-violence"&gt;deleted the video&lt;/a&gt;, declaring an “emergency situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7T7OMO"&gt;“The violent protests in the Capitol today are a disgrace,” Facebook said in a statement Wednesday. “We prohibit incitement and calls for violence on our platform. We are actively reviewing and removing any content that breaks these rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIg2Oy"&gt;Police are still regaining control of the Capitol in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;wake of the mob attack&lt;/a&gt;, although lawmakers have vowed to finish certification of the results of the 2020 presidential election as soon as they regain control of the building. At least one person has been shot, and a number of Capitol Police officers were injured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJ89vr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated at 5:23PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included new label language from Facebook on Trump video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGwLe1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated at 6:40PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated after the tweet’s deletion and video’s removal by Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump supporters breach Capitol in worst display of ‘petro-masculinity’ yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-ELECTION-PROTEST" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bQwK4SqSPACUAdkJPoupVE8pGjw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68629576/1230452869.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ringo Chiu / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AXz9eJ"&gt;The concept of “petro-masculinity” was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jburroughsa/status/1346874918454104064"&gt;on full display Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; as Trump supporters and extremists like the Proud Boys haphazardly parked vehicles on the National Mall in Washington, DC before breaking into the Capitol, causing an evacuation. The astounding images depict a collective act that is simultaneously wholly un-American and yet completely in line with the psychology of this country as it relates to car ownership, personal freedom, and tendencies toward authoritarianism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIPvIT"&gt;Petro-masculinity has lingered as a concept for years (&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/05/business/energy-environment/rolling-coal-in-diesel-trucks-to-rebel-and-provoke.html"&gt;think of the discourse around the “rolling coal”&lt;/a&gt; phenomenon), but it was codified in a 2018 paper by political scientist Cara Daggett called “&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0305829818775817"&gt;Petro-masculinity: Fossil Fuels and Authoritarian Desire&lt;/a&gt;.” In it, Daggett explains how “[a]ppreciating the historic relationship between fossil fuels and white patriarchal rule is helpful in terms of understanding the authoritarian desires and anxieties aroused by the Anthropocene.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="thMx4n"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;⁦&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NationalMallNPS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NationalMallNPS&lt;/a&gt; ⁦&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PoPville?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@PoPville&lt;/a&gt;⁩ this is a disgrace &lt;a href="https://t.co/MQ8S6FwBQx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/MQ8S6FwBQx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— John Anthony (@jburroughsa) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jburroughsa/status/1346874918454104064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y9J94v"&gt;“Petro-masculinity draws upon aspects of a traditionally hegemonic masculinity, but at the same time, its appearance in the American far-right today is better understood as a kind of hypermasculinity, which is a more ‘reactionary stance,’” Daggett writes. “It arises when agents of hegemonic masculinity feel threatened or undermined, thereby needing to inflate, exaggerate, or otherwise distort their traditional masculinity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfjxtB"&gt;Daggett’s paper is hard to shake when viewing the images taken Wednesday of the Jeeps, Broncos, Hummers, oversized SUVs, and other vehicles that were abandoned on the National Mall lawn by Trump supporters looking to disrupt the confirmation of Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory. Petro-masculinity has manifested many ways during the Trump presidency, like when his supporters participated in “&lt;a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-petro-masculinity-of-this-weekends-trump-highway-ra-1845550339"&gt;highway rallies&lt;/a&gt;” and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/05/us/Texas-boat-parade-trump.html"&gt;boat parades&lt;/a&gt;. But it has also often turned violent, like when &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/31/biden-harris-bus-texas-trump-supporters-highway"&gt;Trump supporters tried to run a Biden campaign bus off the road&lt;/a&gt; or how people keep &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/01/heather-heyers-mother-on-hate-in-the-us-were-not-going-to-hug-it-out-but-we-can-listen-to-each-other"&gt;driving vehicles into crowds of protesters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESKP0w"&gt;Wednesday’s display, however, feels like petro-masculinity taken to an entirely different level since the end goal of those who trampled the mall with their vehicles was to subvert democracy. Their behavior was so brazen that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1346898825491968000"&gt;even Donald Trump Jr. spoke out in protest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sbp3g"&gt;The scariest part about what happened on Wednesday is that more than one lawmaker is trying to further bolster the ability of Americans to wield their vehicles however they see fit. Proposals have been raised &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/gop-lawmakers-missouri-propose-bills-making-it-legal-hit-protesters-cars-1554280"&gt;in both Missouri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/florida/os-ne-desantis-protest-bill-opposition-20200923-ihsipkhwdncorouj4whycypss4-story.html"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; to make it legal to drive into protesters, in what could be seen as a celebration of sorts of petro-masculinity over the fundamental American rights of free speech and assembly.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Facebook, Twitch, and YouTube are handling live streams of the Capitol mob attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Trump Supporters Hold “Stop The Steal” Rally In DC Amid Ratification Of Presidential Election" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zbYAVQ6xBSGXBsLzVgckDnrWwFM=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68629570/1230454306.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Samuel Corum / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="udDCN2"&gt;A mob of President Donald Trump supporters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;stormed the US Capitol building&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon, and the event was live-streamed. On YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, and more, you could get a view of protesters gathered outside — and eventually &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; — of the US Capitol. In some cases, the streams were monetized through tipping features. In others, streamers encouraged viewers to donate to accounts on Patreon or GoFundMe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHONTI"&gt;The event presented a sudden and serious moderation challenge for YouTube and other platforms, particularly ones that allowed live streams. YouTube, Facebook, and other social media networks prepared for the 2020 elections in November by setting up policies around labeling and banning misinformation and calls for violence. As protests started this afternoon in Washington, DC, however, the platforms were once again asked to assess whether comments on and coverage of the protests were violating their policies in real time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IRpI8s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Commenters posted things like “coup time” and “time to take it back, USA”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N8fG8M"&gt;On YouTube, live streams of the mob illegally occupying the Capitol could be found by searching &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF2OTDQHxu0"&gt;“Stop the Steal”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8EZow4d1Ys"&gt;“Patriot Capitol’.’&lt;/a&gt; While the platform surfaced authoritative feeds from various news sources, including ABC and &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, it wasn’t difficult to find pro-coup channels that were carrying feeds from a variety of other platforms, including Facebook and Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNkfV0"&gt;Within those more radical YouTube feeds, chat rooms reacted live to what they were seeing. Commenters posted things like “coup time” and “time to take it back, USA.” Others expressed bewilderment over the images playing out in the Capitol as people climbed walls, pushed their way through the police presence, and tried to break down doors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSRt5O"&gt;Some streams asked for donations — which were made outside of YouTube, on platforms like PayPal. Monetization features like super chat and super stickers were seen on a couple of live streams viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and a reporter saw ads playing on an RT live stream.  YouTube’s rules say that videos and live streams must adhere to the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/policies/community-guidelines/#community-guidelines"&gt;site’s community guidelines&lt;/a&gt; in order to be monetized, and they state that videos inciting or encouraging violence and showing violent imagery are not allowed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VuyVCfPBilG6UMlD1FeBxRst0-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22218237/Screen_Shot_2021_01_06_at_3.43.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the “Super Chat” tips sent into a live stream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Jdxh3W"&gt;Teams at YouTube are “working to quickly remove livestreams and other content that violates our policies, including those against incitement to violence or regarding footage of graphic violence,” according to a spokesperson. Since the attack began, the site’s moderators have removed multiple streams that actively incite or encourage violence or show people carrying firearms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAg8S8"&gt;YouTube does allow certain videos to remain up if they have proper news context, but that’s often judged on a case-by-case basis. On a number of videos that contain terms like “Stop the Steal” or “Patriots Capitol” in the title, YouTube has also included an information box that states “the electoral college has confirmed Joe Biden as president-elect.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rsa6rX"&gt;“We will remain vigilant in the coming hours,” the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVqPZ2"&gt;Outside of live streams, YouTube seemed to surface content from authoritative sources, like &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;and NBC. However, searching YouTube for “Stop the Steal” streams using Google Chrome’s Incognito mode highlighted videos from RT and channels with names like “Agentsix1,” “The Truth,” and “Real News Live.” YouTube has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20992018/youtube-borderline-content-recommendation-algorithm-news-authoritative-sources"&gt;changed its search algorithm&lt;/a&gt; to try to prevent this kind of borderline content — videos that aren’t prohibited, but contain disturbing or harmful subject matter — from surfacing as top results on the platform. It is unclear how effective that measure is in practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRlS3k"&gt;Coverage of the event was harder to find on Twitch. Though the site is built around live video, its search features make it somewhat difficult to find live coverage of political events, so users largely have to browse through the site’s categories to find relevant live broadcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZCygnh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitch commenters responded in astonishment at what they were seeing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eTdnRP"&gt;Most streams on Twitch were from people commenting from afar. Hundreds of people tuned in to watch the streamer HayliNic talk about what she was seeing on CNN’s broadcast of the event at the Capitol, and thousands were tuned into a stream from Hutch, who was chatting over live footage from C-SPAN. The popular political streamer HasanAbi had around 100,000 people watching him talk about the event while flipping between news coverage and aggregated views of various streamers from the protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxpQw5"&gt;Direct streams from DC were less popular. DylanBurnsTV had just under 1,000 people watching his stream while he was standing away from the protests; elsewhere, close to 900 people watched TouringNews’ coverage from within a crowd. Commenters on these streams tended to express their astonishment at what they were seeing, shocked at the protesters’ attempt to stop the certification of the presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31hYgQ"&gt;Twitch said its moderation policies do not have exemptions for newsworthy content, so streams of the protests may still be removed if they violate existing policies around violence and threats. “We strongly condemn the violent protests at the Capitol today. Any content that incites or glorifies violence, or shows gore of any kind, is not allowed on Twitch,” a Twitch spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. They said the platform would “continue to monitor and remove any content that violates” its policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8wPCM"&gt;There didn’t appear to be any political labels or warning messages on Twitch streams pointing viewers to verified information, unlike platforms like YouTube and Twitter. Twitch has largely evaded the pressure faced by YouTube and other platforms in recent years, in part because its lengthy broadcasts can be harder to review and in part because the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20915580/twitch-moderation-communities-ceo-emmett-shear-twitchcon"&gt;seems to take a more aggressive stance on moderating speech&lt;/a&gt;, rather than attempting to be a platform for anything and everything. Even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307145/twitch-donald-trump-ban-campaign-account"&gt;President Trump was briefly banned&lt;/a&gt; in June for broadcasting “hateful” language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gpFFV3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The tone was decidedly different on pro-Trump social platforms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zSYA4k"&gt;Platforms used by the president soon found themselves grappling with another issue: a video from the president himself, in which he restated his lie that the election was stolen from him and told protesters “you have to go home now.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UL0KYT"&gt;Around 4:20PM ET, Trump posted the video to both Facebook and Twitter. Twitter labeled the tweet with a warning that his claims of fraud were disputed, and it deactivated most forms of engagement with the tweet “due to a risk of violence.” Around 6:30PM, Twitter removed the video completely saying it violated the platform’s rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfVEDF"&gt;Facebook initially added a far vaguer label that did not say Trump’s claims were wrong or disputed, allowing the post to quickly gain tens of thousands of shares, comments, and likes. Around an hour after it was posted, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217788/facebook-remove-trump-video-emergency-situation-mob-violence"&gt;Facebook removed the video entirely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AiuupJ"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump's video. We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.&lt;/p&gt;— Guy Rosen (@guyro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guyro/status/1346950532372393985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WKDeok"&gt;Facebook’s VP of integrity, Guy Rosen, called the moment an “emergency situation” and said the company believed the video “contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.” The video was also posted to YouTube, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation"&gt;which removed it&lt;/a&gt; under a policy banning misinformation around voter fraud impacting the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tweet-text"&gt;Alex Stamos, the former chief security officer of Facebook and an influential voice on platform policy issues, said on Twitter that it was time for the two platforms to “cut him off.”  “There are no legitimate equities left and labeling won’t do it,” he wrote. Facebook and Twitter have for years pushed back against pressure to ban Trump, though Twitter has been more aggressive about putting limits on his tweets since last May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MnWYJ1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There have been good arguments for private companies to not silence elected officials, but all those arguments are predicated on the protection of constitutional governance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter and Facebook have to cut him off. There are no legitimate equities left and labeling won't do it. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Nji6A4sJum"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Nji6A4sJum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1346932573235077121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lBwHih"&gt;On Facebook, it was easy to find footage from the protests. A stream from NewsNationNow, which was being carried by a number of local news stations, appeared to have more than 20,000 viewers across a number of channels it was being broadcast on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqzMiA"&gt;As the mob stormed the Capitol, Facebook and Instagram continued to allow searches for #StopTheSteal, and the posts were presented without warning labels. It was hard to find live videos through the hashtag on Facebook, which mostly surfaced older information. On Instagram, the hashtag was filled with screenshots of tweets presented alongside photos and videos of people rushing into the Capitol. One video appeared to show police officers pushing back protesters who tried to rush by them farther into the building. Instagram initially told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it was reviewing the hashtag; shortly before 6PM ET, the company said it had restricted the hashtag so that only top posts would show up and most new posts were not visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyjmWd"&gt;“The violent protests in the Capitol today are a disgrace,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. “We prohibit incitement and calls for violence on our platform. We are actively reviewing and removing any content that breaks these rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGQXQX"&gt;The tone was decidedly different on Parler — a right-wing Twitter clone — where users mostly posted in support of the protest. “They pushed patriots too far,” one wrote. “1776 HAS COMMENCED AGAIN!!!” wrote another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKDPT8"&gt;On TheDonald.win, a successor to the banned subreddit r/The_Donald, a forum thread was posted as a central location to watch and chat as “PATRIOTS STORM THE CAPITOL.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSHoKF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 6th, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This story has been updated with details on Facebook and Twitter’s responses to Trump’s video post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8U1fVL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 6th, 6PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Facebook and YouTube have both removed Trump’s video. Instagram has restricted the #stopthesteal hashtag. This story has been updated to include the new developments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M71QMj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 6th, 6:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Twitter has now removed Trump’s video as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US Capitol evacuated as pro-Trump mob storms building</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-ELECTION-TRUMP" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5RxilZuICBgc1zkfnMjlJcYenkk=/109x0:3891x2521/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68629295/1230453994.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K7QipC"&gt;Pro-Trump protesters have stormed the US Capitol building, effectively halting a vote to certify the results of the 2020 election. The Capitol is currently on lockdown, and lawmakers from both chambers have been evacuated as the mob has breached both congressional chambers and voting floors. Tear gas has reportedly been deployed in the rotunda in an effort to secure the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAUElK"&gt;At least one person was shot during the incident (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TaylerUSA/status/1346913549898149888"&gt;warning: graphic video&lt;/a&gt;) and news reports confirm that she later died from her injuries. Improvised explosive devices were also recovered from &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/06/us/electoral-vote/an-explosive-device-is-found-at-the-rnc-and-the-dnc-is-evacuated"&gt;both major party headquarters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Phil_Lewis_/status/1346924188930600964"&gt;from the grounds of the Capitol itself&lt;/a&gt;. One of the protesters who breached the Senate floor has been identified as a prominent promoter of the QAnon conspiracy &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/willsommer/status/1346913949468471302?s=20"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt; reporter Will Sommer&lt;/a&gt;, who covers the group closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="03ffi8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They’re in the chamber. One is up on the dais yelling “Trump won that election!” This is insane &lt;a href="https://t.co/p6CXhBDSFT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/p6CXhBDSFT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Igor Bobic (@igorbobic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/igorbobic/status/1346906369232920576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="DpIgIz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They’re shooting into the chamber. &lt;a href="https://t.co/l9owW7BAVt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/l9owW7BAVt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MEPFuller/status/1346905489561579532?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rac8Bb"&gt;More law enforcement officers were dispatched &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LeftwithTruth/status/1346913756882870277"&gt;to the building&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of the attack, and the District of Columbia national guard was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanLamothe/status/1346917938843029504"&gt;reportedly activated&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/byaaroncdavis/status/1346908166030766080"&gt;earlier reports&lt;/a&gt; that the Department of Defense had blocked requests for help. Officials reported that they had regained control of the building shortly before 6PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eS3ZdL"&gt;Protesters first gathered this week for an extended rally protesting efforts to certify the Electoral College tally for the 2020 presidential election. President Donald Trump spoke at the rally earlier today, encouraging attendees to resist congressional proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0w1LD"&gt;“All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical left Democrats which is what they are doing,” Trump told the crowd. “That’s what they’ve done and what they’re doing. We will never give up, we will never concede.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mBXx2w"&gt;After protesters stormed the Capitol, Trump tweeted out a more conciliatory message: “Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yWyYy"&gt;Aside from its political implications, the incident represents a catastrophic and unprecedented breach in congressional security. Typically, visitors to the US Capitol are extensively screened by Capitol Police for weapons and other potentially dangerous materials. The breakdown in security means none of the protesters have been through such screening, and it’s unclear whether any are armed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEkuNT"&gt;DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has declared a citywide curfew from 6PM Wednesday night until 6AM Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mint is getting new features for tracking subscriptions and managing transactions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oJ4lKhZMzXPymvupwGQylxgDOFg=/71x0:599x352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68629189/INT21_Mint_Mercury_Launch_Blog_Social.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Mint&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MvO0SY"&gt;Mint, the free personal finance app from Intuit, is &lt;a href="https://mint.intuit.com/blog/updates/the-latest-mint-features-are-here-to-help-you-gain-financial-empowerment/"&gt;receiving an update today&lt;/a&gt;, adding more automated features like subscription tracking and new “insights” to keep you informed where your money is spent, &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90591464/intuit-mint-new-version-and-alternatives?partner=rss&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rss+fastcompany&amp;amp;utm_content=rss"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast Company &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Mint’s new features may bring it more in line with the competition from banks and companies like Google that have been nipping at its heels with built-in budget tracking features and other services over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzOSko"&gt;Mint’s main function is tracking spending by automatically sorting transactions based on type. By connecting a checking or savings account, Mint can start combing through purchases to see how much is spent in categories like groceries, electronics, or gas. From there, you can create a budget by setting a limit for each category, and Mint can see when you go over or how much you have left to spend for the month. Mint’s automatic categorization isn’t perfect, but it does save time in comparison to manually labeling each transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/67PFmGNWlsZ2KgfbtHbXb0S490Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217810/i_1_intuit_mint_new_version_and_alternatives.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intuit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated Mint app for iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bwHmw6"&gt;The new features in today’s update (arriving first for the iOS app) bring elements of the web version of Mint over to mobile. In the updated Mint app, users will be able to batch edit labels for transactions and view monthly spending in comparison to the previous year. Mint is also gaining the ability to automatically track subscriptions and inform users when prices go up. Intuit is also starting to integrate TurboTax with Mint, beginning with tracking this year’s tax refund. Intuit hopes to allow Mint information to transfer back to TurboTax at some point in the future to make using the software to do taxes a bit easier, according to &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrPIme"&gt;These changes can seem minor, but keeping up with the features of other personal finance apps like Digit, online banks like Simple, and offerings from larger institutions like Chase or Wells Fargo is a big part of keeping Mint relevant. Competition has started coming from outside the worlds of finance and banking as well. Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21571806/google-pay-relaunch-money-payments-finances-deals-offers-banking-plex"&gt;recently revamped version of Google Pay&lt;/a&gt; combines the peer-to-peer payments and card wallet the app originally offered with a bunch of Mint-like features for tracking spending. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20756048/apple-card-availability-sign-up-cancel-apr-iphone-goldman-sachs"&gt;Apple offers tracking for spending&lt;/a&gt; for Apple Card owners in the Apple Wallet app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzIuaQ"&gt;The Mint update should hit iPhones today, with an Android release to come in “about a month.” If you’re curious about some other solid apps for budgeting, you can check out some of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s favorite picks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538137/budget-apps-mint-buxfer-ynab-google-sheets"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new app allows teachers to use their iPhone or iPad as an overhead camera on Zoom</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the app that shows it acting as an overhead camera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4PLvwcOTk0J0iTFrJEFy5eVDh-Y=/0x1733:1600x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68629107/iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABkAAAArwCAYAAAD8ZvemAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAJ8WlUWHRYTUw6Y29tLmFkb2Jl_2_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gD8eq4"&gt;Teachers who have found themselves holding class over Zoom have probably already figured out clever hacks to show their students documents, but there’s now an app designed specifically for that purpose (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/06/iphone-document-camera-overviewer-zoom"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Overviewer was made by developer Charlie Chapman, and it allows teachers (or anyone, really) to easily use their phone’s camera as a replacement for an overhead document viewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyB2Z3"&gt;If it’s been a minute since you were a student, or if your school didn’t have these overhead devices, they’re basically webcams pointing straight down that allow teachers to show students a printed document, book, hand drawing, or other piece of writing or image. It’s a useful ability to have, but many teachers are working from home because of COVID and may not have access to one like they would in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Top-down view of a printed book, shown in a Zoom call" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lOMkD7BgbF4qsARgKTu2WSOXNC0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217793/Screen_Shot_2021_01_06_at_9.24.06_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Participants in the Zoom call only see what your phone’s camera sees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wdoQAj"&gt;Overviewer works as a replacement by taking advantage of Zoom’s built-in screen sharing feature that &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201379235-Sharing-your-screen-iOS-with-the-Zoom-Desktop-Client"&gt;works with the iPhone when its connected to a computer&lt;/a&gt; with a Lightning cable, or wirelessly through AirPlay (at the moment, it doesn’t seem like Zoom offers this feature for Android users). It shows a feed from your phone’s camera on the screen, with nothing else getting in the way. The feature also offers the ability to turn your phone’s flashlight on if your lighting situation isn’t ideal, as well as the option to change which camera is being displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLQyQW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://charliemchapman.com/posts/2021/6/overviewer/"&gt;In a heartwarming blog post&lt;/a&gt; about how he developed the app for his wife, who works as a kindergarten teacher, Chapman explains how he saw his wife using iOS’s built-in camera app to do the same thing, and how she was frustrated by the lack of landscape support and all the buttons overlaid on-screen: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yr4Ppv"&gt;So being the dorky husband that I am, I quickly built an app that does nothing other than show what the phone camera sees with zero chrome, and properly rotates the whole app so that you can share it in landscape on zoom. This did the trick and she actually used it! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Y6IyY"&gt;It’s pretty tailor made for exactly my wife’s use case but I would think that would be a pretty common one for teachers to be in right now in our current virtual teaching world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3EdVoS"&gt;If you’re a teacher, or are thinking of some other use for the app, it’s &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1528900395"&gt;available for free on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth noting that if you’re using a Mac, Zoom will ask for permission to record your screen and have to be restarted in order to share your phone’s screen (this is because Zoom is just displaying your phone’s screen on your computer, and then capturing that window).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52K48v"&gt;For more information on how the app works, the developer has made a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fadOMMpQErg&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;how-to video&lt;/a&gt;, which you can watch below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IBH0TN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fadOMMpQErg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Get two years of PlayStation Plus for only $58 today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DVSQpAjx8f2Q4yAofLfOJirplqY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628804/vpavic_4261_20201023_0104.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kL1fDL"&gt;If you were gifted a PS5 over the holidays or still own a PS4 and need to renew your PlayStation Plus membership, you can snag two &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year PlayStation Plus subscriptions at Eneba&lt;/a&gt; for $58 when you enter the discount code &lt;strong&gt;2021PLUS&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout (while supplies last). Usually, one year of PlayStation Plus would set you back $60, so getting two one-year subscriptions for less than the normal retail price is a real bargain, and this promotion will likely sell out quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQj3JL"&gt;Ideally, this is great for a PS4 or PS5 user looking to stack up on PlayStation Plus subscriptions for the next two years, or if you want to gift one PlayStation Plus membership to a friend and keep the other one for yourself. If you don’t need more than one PlayStation Plus membership, Eneba has another promotion allowing you to buy &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one year for just $30&lt;/a&gt; with code &lt;strong&gt;JANDEALS. &lt;/strong&gt;Otherwise, it’s $31 without the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MQwTru"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WuHKu4"&gt;When testing out the deal, I found that the &lt;strong&gt;2021PLUS &lt;/strong&gt;discount code will only work if you have two PlayStation Plus one-year subscriptions in your cart. The codes are also region-locked, so you will need a US PlayStation Network account to redeem the membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCXwka"&gt;PlayStation Plus is a paid online subscription service that comes with a ton of perks for members, including occasional discounts during PlayStation Store sales and free games that usually switch up on a monthly cadence, among other things. A PlayStation Plus subscription is compatible with both the PS4 and PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yJ1Yx"&gt;Additionally, PS5 owners receive an additional incentive for having an active PlayStation Plus subscription: access to the PlayStation Plus Collection, a digital library of “generation-defining” first- and third-party games that were released on the PS4, such as &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; God of War&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
