    <title>Nvidia admits acquisition of British chip designer Arm may take longer than 18 months </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9uiX2A8dEyU_EDl-7AlX7m2NOjo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746239/acastro_180529_1777_nvidia_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W6hfNf"&gt;Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has admitted for the first time that the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"&gt;planned acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of British chip designer Arm may take longer than the initially-scheduled 18 months. The acquisition, which would bring together two of the most powerful chip companies in the world, is facing scrutiny from regulators in the US, UK, and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGuYme"&gt;“Our discussions with regulators are taking longer than initially thought, so it’s pushing out the timetable,” Huang &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3758929d-66f0-4095-94f3-ea62b92f9480"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s not one particular delay,” he added. “But we’re confident in the deal, we’re confident regulators should recognize the benefits of the acquisition.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CTdVwR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our discussions with regulators are taking longer than initially thought”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oC6Q3V"&gt;Huang was previously unwavering in his prediction that the acquisition would be completed by March next year. The agreement between Nvidia and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/5/12798302/softbank-arm-acquisition-complete"&gt;Arm’s current owner SoftBank&lt;/a&gt; gives the US chip designer until the end of 2022 to clear the purchase with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkjveQ"&gt;The opposition to the deal is varied and speaks to Arm’s global importance. In the UK, for example, regulators are investigating the purchase on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391744/nvidia-arm-acquisition-uk-competition-regulator-cma-investigation-national-security-grounds"&gt;national security grounds&lt;/a&gt;, but politicians have also decried the takeover as a blow to Britain’s tech industry and its sovereignty on the global stage. In the US, the FTC &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-12/google-microsoft-qualcomm-protest-nvidia-s-arm-acquisition?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;opened an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the acquisition after Google, Microsoft, and Qualcomm complained it would limit competition. And in China, control of the globally-critical chip industry is seen as an important geopolitical battleground with the US. Chinese regulators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/25/17614218/qualcomm-nxp-merger-fails-breakup-fee"&gt;previously nixed&lt;/a&gt; an attempt by American firm Qualcomm to buy Dutch manufacturer NXP Semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TS7505"&gt;Much of the scrutiny is due to Arm’s ubiquity and perceived neutrality in the global chip business. The company sells designs to a variety of firms including Apple, Amazon, and Samsung. And while its ownership by SoftBank was seen as unproblematic as the Japanese corporation does not compete directly with these companies, there are more potential conflicts under Nvidia’s ownership, especially as Arm’s chips are increasingly favored for PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAsVqp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jabra’s new true wireless earbuds are designed to help cope with hearing loss</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q3Al3wGm7_JzHZp89gvUBGIqP78=/0x0:4428x2952/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746217/Jabra_Enhance_Angle_4b_Dark_Grey_LB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Jabra Enhance Plus.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Jabra&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rlbo7i"&gt;Jabra’s Enhance Plus are a new pair of true wireless earbuds aimed at helping people who experience “mild-to-moderate” hearing loss. They’re meant as a half-step towards a more traditional hearing aid solution, for people who might not be ready to wear a device all day. The Enhance Plus will be released first in the US at the end of the year, and will be sold through licensed hearing care professionals at a price that’s yet to be announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caUSRy"&gt;Although Jabra is perhaps best known for its true wireless earbuds like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Elite 85T&lt;/a&gt;, its parent company GN Group has a long history in the hearing aid business. Now Jabra is also getting involved. It announced a new &lt;a href="https://www.gn.com/Newsroom/News/2021/June/GN-launches-high-quality-Jabra-Enhance-Pro-hearing-aids"&gt;hearing aid lineup in June&lt;/a&gt;, and last year it added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273578/jabra-elite-75t-customizable-controls-mysound-hearing-test-now-available"&gt;hearing test feature&lt;/a&gt; to its true wireless earbuds, to customize their sound to your hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7SMpSkNVM5-e3jVtR8WFbPs46SE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792040/Jabra_Enhance_Angle_7_Dark_Grey_LB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Jabra&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The earbuds in their charging case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="icvGdI"&gt;The Enhance Plus are designed to be discrete, and are half as small as Jabra’s Elite 75T earbuds. But despite this, they also offer a respectable 10 hours of battery life, or 30 hours total when used with the charging case. They use beamforming to isolate sounds and amplify what you’re listening to, and offer noise reduction and feedback suppression features to cut out unwanted background noise. There’s also a companion mobile app to tweak The Enhance Plus’s settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6eqez"&gt;Since they’ve got the form-factor of a pair of true wireless earbuds, the Enhance Plus can also be used like a traditional pair of headphones to stream music or make calls from a paired smartphone. They’re IP52 rated for dust and water resistance, and will be sold in gray and beige. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADJRcC"&gt;Recently, other headphone manufacturers have shown a similar interest in designing or tailoring their products towards people who experience hearing loss. Bose announced its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430485/bose-soundcontrol-hearing-aid-fda-cleared"&gt;hearing aid in May&lt;/a&gt;, while in June Apple announced a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522951/apple-airpods-find-my-hearing-accesibility-notification-wwdc"&gt;“Conversation Boost” software feature&lt;/a&gt; for its AirPods Pro, which is designed to amplify the sound of people speaking. And they’re unlikely to be the last, after hearing aid manufacturer Sonova recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424367/sonova-buys-sennheiser-consumer-business-headphones-soundbars"&gt;bought headphone manufacturer Sennheiser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo introduces true continuous zoom lens for smartphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/toE_dzxwC9P3Co72BH6oie-1zzs=/79x0:945x577/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746137/OPPO_Continuous_Optical_Zoom_2021.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DWxcjX"&gt;Oppo has held a “Future Imaging Technology Launch Event” online today to make some camera-related announcements, following the reveal of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608812/oppo-next-generation-under-screen-camera-tech-announced"&gt;“next-generation” under-display selfie camera&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7VVzV"&gt;Oppo is known for demonstrating camera tech in prototype form long before it hits the market. The company was the first to demonstrate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/1/14755916/oppo-5x-zoom-camera-prototype-hands-on-mwc-2017"&gt;periscope telephoto cameras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18759380/under-display-selfie-camera-first-oppo-announcement"&gt;under-display cameras&lt;/a&gt;, for example, both of which are increasingly common on high-end devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1fNJC898kmxEfv5pPpmBaudV1ks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792007/OPPO_Continuous_Optical_Zoom_2021.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EZNGtf"&gt;The first new announcement is a telephoto lens with continuous optical zoom. Unlike periscope telephoto lenses used today, the lens elements move throughout the 85-200mm-equivalent zoom range meaning that the images should be crisp at every focal length without the need for digital zoom, cropping, or artificial sharpening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9vdWh"&gt;Vivo announced a similar product for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/28/21157292/vivo-apex-2020-concept-phone-cameras-screen-specs"&gt;Apex 2020 concept phone&lt;/a&gt;, but the range was a lot more limited — roughly 130-195mm-equivalent. This Oppo module starts at 85mm, a common focal length for portrait headshots, which should make it a lot more versatile. Oppo points out that using one camera across more focal lengths ensures more consistent performance in terms of color and white balance, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFgrzy"&gt;Unfortunately, Oppo isn’t saying when it might ship this camera on a commercial device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iz6fs-jJ9tMine1rDM_KXWE74-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792004/OPPO_s_Five_axis_OIS_lens_shift.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u7Agmo"&gt;The next announcement is a five-axis optical image stabilization system that makes use of both lens-shift and sensor-shift techniques as well as movement data from the phone’s gyroscope. Lens shifting is used for more gradual stabilization, while sensor shift is applied in more dramatic situations, and includes the ability to roll the sensor as well as along the X and Y axes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNKRKd"&gt;Oppo says this allows for three times better stabilization than you can achieve with regular OIS camera modules, which is also what Vivo says about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326786/vivo-x50-pro-plus-gimbal-camera-global-india-release-price"&gt;gimbal-style systems it’s been shipping since last year&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the zoom lens, though, Oppo is confirming a release timeframe for the OIS system — it’ll start appearing in Oppo phones in the first quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fBwdFXdBMyMtwUj9nDFKlbQmzSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792003/Illustration_of_OPPO_s_next_generation_RGBW_Sensor_pixels.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WBVnIM"&gt;Oppo’s last major announcement is a new image sensor that uses an RGBW sub-pixel layout, adding extra white subpixels for what the company claims is a 60-percent increase in light sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sV5Kcx"&gt;Oppo acknowledges that earlier attempts at RGBW sensors had their limitations, but it thinks the new effort should make a big difference due to more advanced manufacturing processes and improved demosaicing algorithms. It’ll be available pretty soon, too — the company says it’ll appear in phones shipping in Q4 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NFTs, explained</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CUwmt6PC9yCHDThvasRp_NBDs7Q=/0x70:1252x905/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68904498/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.21.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/kitty/896775" target="_blank"&gt;Cryptokitties.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m3ofto"&gt;There’s nothing like an explosion of blockchain news to leave you thinking, “Um… what’s going on here?” That’s the feeling I’ve experienced while reading about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22308075/grimes-nft-6-million-sales-nifty-gateway-warnymph"&gt;Grimes getting millions of dollars for NFTs&lt;/a&gt; or about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287956/nyan-cat-crypto-art-foundation-nft-sale-chris-torres"&gt;Nyan Cat being sold as one&lt;/a&gt;. And by the time we all thought we sort of knew what the deal was, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316320/jack-dorsey-original-tweet-nft-cent-valuables"&gt;the founder of Twitter put an autographed tweet&lt;/a&gt; up for sale as an NFT. Now, months after we first published this explainer, we’re still seeing headlines about people paying &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/people-are-shelling-out-six-figures-for-nft-rocks-1847508926"&gt;house-money for clip art of rocks&lt;/a&gt; — and my mom still doesn’t really understand what an NFT is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vZyml"&gt;You might be wondering: what is an NFT, anyhow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qq4l9b"&gt;After literal hours of reading, I think I know. I also think I’m going to cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vM2Wj0"&gt;Okay, let’s start with the basics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="y3hj8i"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an NFT? What does NFT stand for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XAkRR1"&gt;Non-fungible token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lwjaI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That doesn’t make it any clearer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBCh6D"&gt;Right, sorry. “Non-fungible” more or less means that it’s unique and can’t be replaced with something else. For example, a bitcoin is fungible — trade one for another bitcoin, and you’ll have exactly the same thing. A one-of-a-kind trading card, however, is non-fungible. If you traded it for a different card, you’d have something completely different. You gave up a Squirtle, and got a 1909 T206 Honus Wagner, which &lt;em&gt;StadiumTalk&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.stadiumtalk.com/s/most-expensive-baseball-cards-985687df1bbe45c5"&gt;calls “the Mona Lisa of baseball cards.&lt;/a&gt;” (I’ll take their word for it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HudKGN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do NFTs work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbvoGM"&gt;At a very high level, most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, like bitcoin or dogecoin, but its blockchain also supports these NFTs, which store extra information that makes them work differently from, say, an ETH coin. It is worth noting that other blockchains can implement their own versions of NFTs. (&lt;a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/tron-introduces-nft-standard-trc-721"&gt;Some already have&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ifr4y9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s worth picking up at the NFT supermarket?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbHk7K"&gt;NFTs can really be anything digital (such as drawings, music, your brain downloaded and turned into an AI), but a lot of the current excitement is around using the tech to sell digital art. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vAcH3qsbkwApyVu4-Zl-AJ1hXFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341197/doge.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x3b3ee1931dc30c1957379fac9aba94d1c48a5405/576" target="_blank"&gt;NyanCat on OpenSea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dogecoin isn’t an NFT. But this GIF of a dogecoin is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Go0IlP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mean, like, people buying my good tweets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4V58lf"&gt;I don’t think anyone can stop you, but that’s not really what I meant. A lot of the conversation is about NFTs as &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/nfts-guide-nonfungible-tokens-cryptomedia-trend-ownership-internet/"&gt;an evolution of fine art collecting&lt;/a&gt;, only with digital art. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLI5c1"&gt;(Side note, when coming up with the line “buying my good tweets,” we were trying to think of something so silly that it wouldn’t be a real thing. So &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316320/jack-dorsey-original-tweet-nft-cent-valuables"&gt;the founder of Twitter sold one for just under $3 million&lt;/a&gt; shortly after we posted the article.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qaSIX4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do people really think this will become like art collecting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ig7cLB"&gt;I’m sure some people really hope so — like whoever paid almost $390,000 for a &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x948b3515d81034a3c16d5393c6c155946c93c103/1"&gt;50-second video by Grimes&lt;/a&gt; or the person who paid $6.6 million for &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0x12f28e2106ce8fd8464885b80ea865e98b465149/100010001"&gt;a video by Beeple&lt;/a&gt;. Actually, one of Beeple’s pieces &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;was auctioned at Christie’s&lt;/a&gt;, the famou—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q3dcQxqw8oMubtaqyVI6ZzIM37o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341206/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.31.26_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beeple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoink!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i77Dld"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorry, I was busy right-clicking on that Beeple video and downloading the same file the person paid millions of dollars for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNNHsj"&gt;Wow, rude. But yeah, that’s where it &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nfts-boom-collectors-shell-out-crypto/"&gt;gets a bit awkward&lt;/a&gt;. You can copy a digital file as many times as you want, including the art that’s included with an NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmQtyf"&gt;But NFTs are designed to give you something that can’t be copied: ownership of the work (though the artist can still retain the copyright and reproduction rights, just like with physical artwork). To put it in terms of physical art collecting: anyone can buy a Monet print. But only one person can own the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWoqGE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No shade to Beeple, but the video isn’t really a Monet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBUNfq"&gt;What do you think of &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0x4140783cc1ba30653a0777126b122931e233ba14/1300010027"&gt;the $3,600 Gucci Ghost&lt;/a&gt;? Also, you didn’t let me finish earlier. That image that Beeple was auctioning off at Christie’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;ended up selling for $69 million&lt;/a&gt;, which, by the way, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-monet-painting-auction-20140626-story.html"&gt;is $15 million more than Monet’s painting &lt;em&gt;Nymphéas&lt;/em&gt; sold for&lt;/a&gt; in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Trevor Andrew&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This last sold for $3,600, but the current owner is asking for $16,300.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lGn9Ci"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whoever got that Monet can actually appreciate it as a physical object. With digital art, a copy is literally as good as the original.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WyUKa"&gt;But the &lt;em&gt;flex &lt;/em&gt;of owning an original Beeple...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1G89vD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think I remember hearing that NFTs &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://protos.com/nft-market-bubble-popped-crypto-collectibles-are-over/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;are already over&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Didn’t the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://qz.com/2016058/the-nft-boom-is-over-for-now/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;boom go bust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m35F3s"&gt;But surely you’ve heard of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/technology/penguin-nft-club.html"&gt;penguin communities&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyZpi7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P...Penguin communities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YE7wyz"&gt;Right, so... people have &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Owners_Group"&gt;long built communities based on things they own&lt;/a&gt;, and now it’s happening with NFTs. One community that’s been &lt;a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/pudgy-penguins-pump-dump-or-nft-mainstay/"&gt;exceedingly popular&lt;/a&gt; revolves around a collection of NFTs called Pudgy Penguins, but it’s not the only community built up around the tokens. It could be argued that one of the earliest NFT projects, CryptoPunks, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/the-cult-of-cryptopunks/"&gt;has a community around it&lt;/a&gt;, and there are other animal-themed projects like &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/why-bored-ape-avatars-are-taking-over-twitter"&gt;the Bored Ape Yacht Club&lt;/a&gt; that have their own clique. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juDtL1"&gt;Of course, the communal activities depend on the community. For Pudgy Penguin or Bored Ape owners, it seems to involve &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/technology/penguin-nft-club.html"&gt;vibing and sharing memes on Discord&lt;/a&gt;, or complimenting each other on their Pudgy Penguin Twitter avatars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJgEli"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the point of NFTs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6d92bZ"&gt;That really depends on whether you’re an artist or a buyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dt7KYi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m an artist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ1eqE"&gt;First off: I’m proud of you. Way to go. You might be interested in NFTs because it gives you a way to sell work that there otherwise might not be much of a market for. If you come up with a really cool digital sticker idea, what are you going to do? Sell it on the iMessage App Store? No way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIsq2g"&gt;Also, NFTs have a feature that you can enable that will pay you a percentage every time &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/nft-art-boom-is-the-same-concept-as-the-photography-market?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;the NFT is sold or changes hands&lt;/a&gt;, making sure that if your work gets super popular and balloons in value, you’ll see some of that benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7oBax"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m a buyer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwjNxk"&gt;One of the obvious benefits of buying art is it lets you financially support artists you like, and that’s true with NFTs (which are way trendier than, like, Telegram stickers). Buying an NFT also usually gets you some basic usage rights, like being able to post the image online or set it as your profile picture. Plus, of course, there are bragging rights that you own the art, with a blockchain entry to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVWIC6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, I meant I’m a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;collector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYjdCo"&gt;Ah, okay, yes. NFTs can work &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/nft-art-boom-is-the-same-concept-as-the-photography-market?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;like any other speculative asset&lt;/a&gt;, where you buy it and hope that the value of it goes up one day, so you can sell it for a profit. I feel kind of dirty for talking about that, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuKmlZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So every NFT is unique?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91YTgt"&gt;In the boring, technical sense that every NFT is a unique token on the blockchain. But while it could be like a van Gogh, where there’s only one definitive actual version, it could also be like a trading card, where there’s 50 or hundreds of numbered copies of the same artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09JRP3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for what basically amounts to a trading card?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQVHLe"&gt;Well, that’s part of what makes NFTs so messy. Some people treat them like they’re the future of fine art collecting (read: as a playground for the mega-rich), and some people treat them like Pokémon cards (where they’re accessible to normal people but also a playground for the mega-rich). Speaking of Pokémon cards, Logan Paul just sold some NFTs relating to a million-dollar box of the—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1JJGI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please stop. I hate where this is going.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/laUmvyGGiD-HsDas7TBDZall_n4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341219/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.39.12_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Logan Paul&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ve activated my trap card (which sold for $17,000).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Mv0A8X"&gt;Yeah, he sold NFT video clips, which are just clips from a video you can watch on YouTube anytime you want, &lt;a href="https://shopnfts.net/"&gt;for up to $20,000&lt;/a&gt;. He also sold NFTs of a Logan Paul Pokémon card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gh63Tc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who paid $20,000 for a video clip of Logan Paul?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWkQs7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Calvinn_Hobbes/status/746227239755251712?s=20"&gt;A fool and their money are soon parted&lt;/a&gt;, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8ZNFb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It would be hilarious if Logan Paul decided to sell 50 more NFTs of the exact same video.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXPBux"&gt;Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda (who also sold some NFTs that included a song) &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/linkin-park-mike-shinoda-happy-endings-nft-interview"&gt;actually talked about that&lt;/a&gt;. It’s totally a thing someone could do if they were, in his words, “an opportunist crooked jerk.” I’m not saying that Logan Paul is that, just that you should be careful who you buy from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdZoRB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are NFTs mainstream now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ljp9xY"&gt;It depends on what you mean. If you’re asking if, say, my mom owns one, the answer is no. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6FeSYBN-r4HxZKK76nQF3XUayfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22791317/Screen_Shot_2021_08_18_at_3.38.15_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The response from my mom when I asked her about owning NFTs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="r3Mo40"&gt;But we have seen big brands and celebrities like &lt;a href="https://beincrypto.com/marvel-launches-marvel-mightys-nft-collection/"&gt;Marvel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.si.com/hockey/news/wayne-gretzky-launches-new-nft-collectibles"&gt;Wayne Gretzky&lt;/a&gt; launch their own NFTs, which seem to be aimed at more traditional collectors, rather than crypto-enthusiasts. While I don’t think I’d call NFTs “mainstream” in the way that smartphones are mainstream, or &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; is mainstream, they do seem to have, at least to some extent, shown some staying power even outside of the cryptosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWxHZd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what do The Youth think of them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BBlZ3"&gt;Ah yes, excellent question. We here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have an interest in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587391/next-gen-technology-youth-teen-culture"&gt;what the next generation is doing&lt;/a&gt;, and it certainly does seem like some of them have been experimenting with NFTs. An 18 year-old who goes by the name FEWOCiOUS says that his NFT drops have &lt;a href="https://fewocious.com/about/"&gt;netted over $17 million&lt;/a&gt; — though obviously most haven’t had the same success. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/14/style/teens-nft-art.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;talked to a few teens&lt;/a&gt; in the NFC space, and some said they used NFTs as a way to get used to working on a project with a team, or to just earn some spending money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="611ErY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I buy this article as an NFT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cw2A6d"&gt;No, but technically anything digital could be sold as an NFT (including articles from &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1984094/quartz-is-selling-the-first-ever-nft-news-article/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quartz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/technology/nft-column-blockchain.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, provided you have anywhere from $1,800 to $560,000). deadmau5 has sold digital animated stickers. William Shatner has sold &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/william-shatners-nft-collectibles-sell-out-at-warp-speed"&gt;Shatner-themed trading cards&lt;/a&gt; (one of which was apparently an X-ray of his teeth).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This one I like. Maybe not for $700, but...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e0DpEJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gross. Actually, could I buy someone’s teeth as an NFT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2y73FL"&gt;There have been some attempts at connecting NFTs to real-world objects, often as a sort of verification method. Nike has patented a method to &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/12/10/nike-blockchain-sneakers-cryptokick-patent/"&gt;verify sneakers’ authenticity using an NFT system, which it calls CryptoKicks&lt;/a&gt;. But so far, I haven’t found any teeth, no. I’m scared to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRUxvr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look? Where? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEbiIN"&gt;There are several marketplaces that have popped up around NFTs, which allow people to buy and sell. These include OpenSea, Rarible, and Grimes’ choice, Nifty Gateway, but there are plenty of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwUvnp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve heard there were kittens involved. Tell me about the kittens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zszcnd"&gt;NFTs really became technically possible when the Ethereum blockchain added support for them &lt;a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/"&gt;as part of a new standard&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, one of the first uses was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoKitties"&gt;a game called CryptoKitties&lt;/a&gt; that allowed users to trade and sell virtual kittens. Thank you, internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkghYZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love kittens&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgMnW6"&gt;Not as much as &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/cryptokitties-bought-a-digital-cat-for-172000/"&gt;the person who paid over $170,000 for one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uedrnj7kfMuTOKIghiRp4yUtLOk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341171/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.21.50_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/kitty/896775" target="_blank"&gt;Cryptokitties.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My face when I’m worth $170K.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yFaF1c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arrrrrggggg!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JD0ynI"&gt;Same. But in my opinion, the kittens show that one of the most interesting aspects of NFTs (for those of us not looking to create a digital dragon’s lair of art) is how they can be used in games. There are &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/26/the-deanbeat-how-non-fungible-tokens-nfts-will-change-games/"&gt;already games&lt;/a&gt; that let you have NFTs as items. One even sells virtual plots of land as NFTs. There could be opportunities for players to buy a unique in-game gun or helmet or whatever as an NFT, which would be a flex that most people could actually appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hsXGo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At least it’s not digital pet rocks... right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kk4a1a"&gt;In fact, there are people who are spending tens or &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6610bb0f50a4524aa3381fb186178fdf4e0e5a1fc9ec5172d78e8c53bed9fa04"&gt;hundreds of thousands of dollars&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/people-are-shelling-out-six-figures-for-nft-rocks-1847508926"&gt;NFT pet rocks&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href="https://etherrock.com"&gt;website for which&lt;/a&gt; says that the rocks serve no purpose other than being tradable and limited).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="uFnEOt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could I pull off a museum heist to steal NFTs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-wuFlpK8EGVxFIUYTKb0hFd3pBM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341161/robbery.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This image is not an NFT. Yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rBINrG"&gt;That depends. Part of the allure of blockchain is that it stores a record of each time a transaction takes place, making it harder to steal and flip than, say, a painting hanging in a museum. That said, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49177705"&gt;cryptocurrencies have been stolen before&lt;/a&gt;, so it really would depend on how the NFT is being stored and how much work a potential victim would be willing to put in to get their stuff back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAPTND"&gt;Note: Please don’t steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnhPUz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I be worried about digital art being around in 500 years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIQPdV"&gt;Probably. Bit rot is a real thing: image quality deteriorates, file formats can’t be opened anymore, websites go down, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227535/nyt-bitcoin-millions-forgot-passwords-digital-wallet"&gt;people forget the password to their wallets&lt;/a&gt;. But physical art in museums is also &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETAcIbzOTYs"&gt;shockingly fragile&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6zH8E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to maximize my blockchain use. Can I buy NFTs with cryptocurrencies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QU56ST"&gt;Yes. Probably. A lot of the marketplaces accept Ethereum. But technically, anyone can sell an NFT, and they could ask for whatever currency they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZmGbU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will trading my Logan Paul NFTs contribute to global warming and melt Greenland?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOtuLt"&gt;It’s definitely something to look out for. Since NFTs use the same blockchain technology as some energy-hungry cryptocurrencies, they also end up using a lot of electricity. There are people working &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/ethereum-plans-to-cut-its-absurd-energy-consumption-by-99-percent"&gt;on mitigating this issue&lt;/a&gt;, but so far, most NFTs are still tied to cryptocurrencies that generate a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. There have been a few cases where artists have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jacksfilms/status/1369070588136845313?s=20"&gt;decided to not sell&lt;/a&gt; NFTs or to cancel future drops &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nfts-hot-effect-earth-climate/"&gt;after hearing about the effects they could have on climate change&lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully, one of my colleagues has really dug into it, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;so you can read this piece to get a fuller picture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="23nZ0d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I build an underground art cave / bunker to store my NFTs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhQ69E"&gt;Well, like cryptocurrencies, NFTs are stored in digital wallets (though it is worth noting that the wallet does specifically have to be NFT-compatible). You could always put the wallet on a computer in an underground bunker, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9tfJn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I wanted to watch a TV show that’s somehow related to NFTs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbv9s7"&gt;Believe it or not, you have options! Steve Aoki &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/steve-aoki-has-secured-funding-to-pilot-his-nft-tv-show"&gt;is working on a show&lt;/a&gt; based on a character from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22322218/john-legere-buys-steve-aoki-nft"&gt;a previous NFT drop&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;em&gt;Dominion X&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://dominionxshow.com"&gt;show’s site&lt;/a&gt; says that it’ll be an episodic series launched on the blockchain (the first short video is &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x01Ba93514e5Eb642Ec63E95EF7787b0eDd403ADd/1"&gt;on OpenSea&lt;/a&gt;), and there are hundreds of NFTs already associated with the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBwHc0"&gt;There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/vitalik-buterin-joins-cast-of-stoner-cats-mila-kunis-new-animated-nft-show"&gt;a show called &lt;em&gt;Stoner Cats&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (yes, it’s about cats that get high, and yes it stars Mila Kunis, Chris Rock, and Jane Fonda), which uses NFTs as a sort of ticket system. Currently, there’s only one episode available, but a &lt;em&gt;Stoner Cat&lt;/em&gt; NFT (which, of course, is called a TOKEn) is required to watch it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTjAxP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you tired of typing “NFT”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNFTvl"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8lOzHF"&gt;
&lt;p id="RM05sp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 5th, 8:07PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added the news that Jack Dorsey was selling one of his tweets as an NFT because I originally made a joke and cannot believe it actually happened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEpRTA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 11th, 1:42PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added the news that Beeple’s piece sold for $69 million and added more information to the climate change section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaJIGS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 15th, 1:30PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added a link to our piece on the environmental impact of NFTs and updated some of the language to reflect some recent research. Also added a poem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOkS8P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 25th, 3:20PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added note about &lt;/em&gt;Quartz&lt;em&gt; and the &lt;/em&gt;NYT&lt;em&gt; selling articles as NFTs because once again it’s something that I made a joke about and then actually happened. Also updated the part about Jack Dorsey selling his tweet with the final price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIFZYQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 18th, 9:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added new questions and answers that have cropped up over the course of 2021, like “are NFTs dead,” “are there NFT-based TV shows,” and “are there clipart images of rocks being sold as NFTs?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Feiyu one-ups DJI by letting you stick its tiny self-balancing camera to anything you like</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dxc-ceH8hlz2HYTei0TZX0TFFCU=/0x0:1391x927/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69745436/feiyu_pocket_2s_main.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QAW9i5"&gt;Half a decade ago, dronemaker DJI realized its miniature aerial steadicams &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/9/9695822/dji-osmo-camera-gimbal-stabilizer-price-specs-review"&gt;might be handy to carry around on foot&lt;/a&gt; — but it’s not the only company monopolizing on the shrinking tech. Rival FeiyuTech now has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21524505/dji-osmo-pocket-2-price-release-date-features-4k-video-gimbal"&gt;DJI Pocket&lt;/a&gt; competitor that ups the ante by letting you detach the entire motorized gimbal, so you can stick a lightweight self-balancing camera to your car, helmet, wrist, or any magnetic surface up to three feet away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfL13p"&gt;It’s called the &lt;a href="https://www.feiyu-tech.com/feiyu-pocket-2s/"&gt;FeiyuTech Pocket 2S&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Ffeiyu-pocket-2s-the-ultimate-3-axis-gimbal-camera%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F18%2F22631560%2Ffeiyutech-pocket-2s-detachable-gimbal-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on crowdfunding site Indiegogo right now&lt;/a&gt; for $399, or a little less if you take advantage of its early bird discounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x1uRac"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ibYcACev79Y?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RQw43d"&gt;According to the company, the camera shoots up to 4K footage at 60 fps with a Sony IMX 317 sensor, and can do up to 3 hours of continuous recording at 1080p. While you only get a square video preview on the handle, you can sling a full view to a phone, and there’s a Micro HDMI port to plug into a monitor or TV. Charging and data transfer happens over USB-C, and there’s a built-in 1/4-inch tripod socket. Footage is stored on a UHS-1 microSD card, up to 512GB. &lt;a href="https://www.feiyu-tech.com/feiyu-pocket-2s/specs.html"&gt;More specs here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="gcuRUo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7u8Nsk"&gt;Judging by some of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22feiyu+pocket+2s%22"&gt;the early reviews on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, image quality may leave something to be desired, particularly when it comes to crispness and dynamic range. I wouldn’t expect Feiyu or DJI to stop selling their larger motorized gimbals &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21401564/dji-osmo-mobile-4-phone-gimbal-magnetic-announce-price-release-date"&gt;for phones&lt;/a&gt;, mirrorless cameras and DSLRs anytime soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OCjTQ"&gt;But it’s pretty slick to be able to just throw one of these detachable cameras atop a mount like a GoPro, or slap one atop a ferrous metal surface and instantly get stabilized footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dK5pfj"&gt;It’s a great way for these camera companies to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;compete with GoPro&lt;/a&gt;, for that matter, whose in-camera stabilization has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features"&gt;dramatically improving&lt;/a&gt; the last few years. And without any obvious tradeoffs beyond a visible coiled cable, I wouldn’t be surprised if DJI and others follow Feiyu’s lead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Netflix is finally adding support for spatial audio on iPhone and iPad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The AirPods Pro, the best wireless earbuds for people who use Apple products, pictured next to an iPhone 11 Pro Max and MacBook Pro." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XM_D44f9NbljV1x-qKqyoWDa8C0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69745027/cwelch_191031_3763_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nw3GOK"&gt;Netflix is beginning to roll out support for Apple’s spatial audio feature on iPhone and iPad, the streaming giant &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/18/netflix-spatial-audio-support-roll-out/"&gt;said to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. A Netflix spokesperson confirmed the rollout to &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;saying that the rollout begins Wednesday and that users should expect to see it over the next few days. You may have it already — some users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Airpodsmax/comments/p6oiss/spatial_audio_is_now_working_on_the_netflix_app/"&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; are reporting that it’s working for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUpUZQ"&gt;Apple’s spatial audio, which you can only take advantage of with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; on an iPhone or iPad, is designed to make you feel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;more immersed&lt;/a&gt; in what you’re listening to with an impressive surround sound effect. If you want to give spatial audio a shot and don’t have it on Netflix yet, you can try it out on other services like Apple TV Plus, Disney Plus, or HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Q7MQH"&gt;In the future, Apple is planning to add spatial audio &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523914/macos-tvos-spatial-audio-support-airpods-pro-max"&gt;to macOS and tvOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Paint redesign for Windows 11 includes a dark mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2T0M9LKgcUDV80vrOyvL70w8Oss=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69744803/Xsgxcy2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Paint design in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SKAG8c"&gt;Microsoft is redesigning its Paint app in Windows 11. The app will be updated with a new command bar that borrows most of the same options and tools as what exists in the ribbon interface for Paint on Windows 10. It’s the first major update to Paint in years, and it even includes a dark mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbhxsL"&gt;Microsoft’s head of Windows and devices, Panos Panay, teased the new Paint redesign on Twitter today. The teaser video includes a brief look at improvements to the font picker, brushes, and a dark mode for Paint. The tools look a lot more usable now, with a quick picker that shows all the different brushes and their effects. Microsoft’s font tool for Paint also floats now, with options for size, alignment, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hurlim"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here’s another &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Windows?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Windows&lt;/a&gt; 11 first look. This is the beautifully redesigned Paint app, coming soon to Windows Insiders. Can’t wait to see your creations! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Windows11?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Windows11&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WindowsInsiders?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WindowsInsiders&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/jiKyfqQFUV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jiKyfqQFUV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Panos Panay (@panos_panay) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/panos_panay/status/1428102755151847431?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tPGX7w"&gt;There doesn’t appear to be options for layers, but this is the first major update to Paint since it gained the ribbon interface. Microsoft had been planning to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/25/16024356/microsoft-paint-windows-store-app"&gt;remove Paint&lt;/a&gt; from Windows 10 at one point, before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512247/microsoft-paint-windows-10-app-comments"&gt;reversing course and keeping it as part of Windows&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, Microsoft has started removing 3D Paint from installations of Windows 10, a program that was designed to modernize and even replace the traditional Paint app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b57he7"&gt;It’s not clear exactly when Windows Insiders will be able to test out this new Paint design, but Panay says it will be available to test “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s delayed 2022 office return did not apply to these contractors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qMvIB01r7Mc7Dm08KGLzsyOVkZ4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69744783/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GW5bQR"&gt;Facebook announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22622282/facebook-office-return-delayed-2022-us"&gt;delay employees’ return to the office until 2022&lt;/a&gt; earlier in August, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/18/facebook-makes-some-contractors-come-into-offices-amid-delta-variant-spread.html?&amp;amp;amp;qsearchterm=facebook"&gt;but &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt; that some Facebook contractors employed by Accenture have been working in person since a week before. This might not be a surprise as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497789/facebook-content-moderators-accenture-return-office-coronavirus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that some of Accenture’s contractors in Texas were instructed to return to office work as early as October 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WvzyN"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the 2022 return to office plan applies to a majority of all full-time and contingent office employees in the US, regardless of if they’re employed by Facebook or a contracting firm: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9R12bn"&gt;“While the majority of full-time employees and contingent workers for Facebook continue working from home, some have returned to offices that have reopened at reduced capacities with strict health and safety standards in place. A person’s status as a full-time employee or a contingent worker does not factor into whether or not they can work from home due to the global pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VY73o1"&gt;What seems to determine whether an employee is able to keep working remotely is their role and responsibilities. In the case of the workers &lt;em&gt;CNBC &lt;/em&gt;spoke to, that included contractors generating data for Facebook’s machine learning model. These contractors were given two weeks to prepare for their return to the office on August 1st and were only allowed to continue working remotely if they could get a doctor’s note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VPUNuZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook says some jobs are more successful in person&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ViQS22"&gt;For contractors working in moderation, the main concern from Facebook and other platforms is that sensitive user content — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona"&gt;frequently traumatic imagery&lt;/a&gt; — can only be viewed on secured company machines to avoid privacy issues. Working on machine learning might not as easily fit that same logic, especially since &lt;em&gt;CNBC &lt;/em&gt;reports the contractors it spoke to have been working remotely for over a year, but security issues and ever-increasing pressure to improve moderation may have also been a concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLCs7i"&gt;When asked, Facebook was not able to share how many contractors are now working in-person. Both Facebook and Accenture claim they enforce strict COVID-19 protocols for employees in offices. Facebook mandates all employees to wear masks and in some cases &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598818/facebook-vaccine-requirement-us-office-employees"&gt;requires office employees to get vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; “depend[ing] on local conditions and regulations.” Those are both helpful in keeping employees safe, but still leaves some risk of workers passing along an infection to a more vulnerable family member, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598818/facebook-vaccine-requirement-us-office-employees"&gt;children not yet allowed to get vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="poE1Er"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFOoJp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsEh6z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ special edition Zephyrus G14 comes with its own DJ deck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition keyboard seen from above angled to the left." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r9K39qB4ndmZNzeimFKfeddqhow=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69741204/bfarsace_210817_4714_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can you spot the Alan Walker logo?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r2faU2"&gt;If there’s one company I trust to do a good job with utterly ridiculous computer ideas, it’s Asus. Last fall, the company worked with cyberpunky fashion designer Acronym to make possibly the weirdest-looking gaming laptop I’ve ever seen (the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21432977/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-acronym-amd-ryzen-9-4900hs-nvidia-rtx-2060"&gt;ZPHYRS G14 ACRNM&lt;/a&gt;). This year, it’s partnered with popular DJ Alan Walker to create a less avant-garde, more musical version of the same device. This is the Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition, a laptop for gamers, DJs, and (ideally) gamer DJs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gIVvhZ"&gt;The insides of this laptop are nothing ROG fans haven’t seen before. There’s only one configuration, selling for $1,999.99, which includes an AMD Ryzen 5900HS processor and a low-end GeForce RTX 3050 Ti graphics card, as well as a QHD 120Hz screen, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. So, just to be clear, this isn’t really a sensible purchase unless you’re an Alan Walker superfan, because &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202103AM300000011/A50184-ROG-Zephyrus-G14-AniMe-Matrix-Ultra-Slim-Gaming-Laptop%2C-14%E2%80%9D-120Hz-PANTONE-Validated-QHD-Display%2C-GeForce-RTX-3060%2C-AMD-Ryzen-9-5900HS%2C-32GB-DDR4%2C-1TB-SSD%2C-Wi-Fi-6%2C-Windows-10-Pro%2C-GA401QM-XS98Q-WH"&gt;that same price&lt;/a&gt; can get you a non-Walker G14 with a more powerful RTX 3060 GPU, as well as 32GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;

To its left is its box, with 11 DJ buttons and ROG X ALAN WALKER printed on the bottom." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c3_PYRkWK0ugBoz-mngQOTxcW0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788137/bfarsace_210817_4714_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yep, those buttons actually work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dx3nzO"&gt;Still, it’s a pretty cool device. The lid is laced with a reflective belt commanding passersby to “JOIN THE REPUBLIC” and “JOIN THE WALKERS.” Alan Walker’s logo — resembling an A superimposed over a W — is printed in various places, including the A and W keys as well as on the nameplate. There’s a diagonal line print on the touchpad meant to resemble music equalizer patterns, and there are splashes of bright blue — Walker’s favorite color — across the keyboard as well. It’s not an obnoxious aesthetic, like these special editions sometimes have — it looks more like a standard G14 with some colorful tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlXfGf"&gt;Walker says the design reflects the look he’d want his personal device to have. “They approached me and asked, what are your expectations for the laptop, what do you look for in a laptop if you were to pick one yourself?” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an interview. “It was a lot of back and forth — like, a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition on a couch, facing away from the camera, half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2iW5dnLAmRyPm_0JkAphCBV-FWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788134/bfarsace_210817_4714_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;JOIN THE REPUBLIC. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition on a couch seen from the front, open. The screen displays Alan Walker hovering on a red and blue background, conjuring lights of each color with his hands." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pybxRhdumQhEIof99XaMe6oL09A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788138/bfarsace_210817_4714_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;JOIN THE WALKERS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OJjKIG"&gt;The other cool thing is that the packaging this G14 comes in becomes a DJ deck when connected to the laptop via USB-C. It’s not the most high-tech affair — if you lift up the paper floor, you’ll see a nest of wires taped to the bottom of the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6FmJn"&gt;“That’s one of those crazy ideas where we ended up debating, would this be possible?” Walker said of the DJ box. “Asus is like ‘Yeah, cool, we can maybe think about something, figure something out,’ and then they came back with a box.” He added, “It’s so weird how it even works.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUYwYy"&gt;I expected this to be complicated to set up for a non-DJ like myself, but it was a breeze. Plug the box into the G14, and a preloaded software called ROG Remix opens automatically. You can play a song within that program, and then tweak it by pressing various buttons on the box. There are buttons for things like speed, start / stop, and a few basic effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The left palm rest of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OSZEWOkdWXPjCDZDmClvmddk7hE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788135/bfarsace_210817_4714_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Same old chips, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The right side of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DacaWjLE2f5r-JK31Tiw0YSKMCY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788136/bfarsace_210817_4714_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Same old ports as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GUvJmF"&gt;This was — caveating, again, that I’m not a DJ — a lot of fun. The buttons all worked, and the effects sounded very cool to my untrained ears. It seems like something you could easily use at a party, especially since the G14’s speakers are fantastic. The music was crackling a bit at the beginning, but that seemed to sort itself out after a few tracks. Mostly, I’m impressed that this is all coming out of a plastic box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ie7b9y"&gt;Walker agrees that his G14 is a better purchase for people like me than it would be for actual DJs. “It’s not necessarily the number-one gadget to get if you want to start with DJing, but it’s definitely a cool starting point,” says Walker. “I hope that people will use it to be creative and play around with music.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pljb8X"&gt;He does, however, expect that he’ll use the G14 on his next tour. “It’s got everything that I need, basically, to work and prepare for my shows,” Walker says. “I can easily foresee myself using it every day.” He says he might use it to plan his set lists prior to performances, and to work on the visuals as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1hqpo"&gt;He might also use it for some gaming in his spare time. “Lately I’ve been playing &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “Also some &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMlzZJ"&gt;The ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition is available for preorder now on &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202108AM130000001/A47070-ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-G14-Alan-Walker-Special-Edition-Gaming-Laptop%2C-14%E2%80%9D-120Hz-PANTONE-Validated-WQHD-Display%2C-GeForce-RTX-3050-Ti%2C-AMD-Ryzen-9-5900HS%2C-16GB-DDR4%2C-1TB-SSD%2C-Wi-Fi-6%2C-GA401QEC-K2064T"&gt;Asus’s website &lt;/a&gt;for $1,999.99, and will be available soon at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.ssense.com/en-us" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SSENSE&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Overwatch League’s 2021 regular season was full of drama amid an uncertain future</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gKdLCIUJfY5JcAnTz-UBgfcU7XM=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69744418/owl1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;With one more tournament and the playoffs to go, here’s an overview of the league’s fourth season&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="MsIbSm"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League wrapped up its fourth regular season last weekend amid ongoing uncertainty of the league’s future. The pandemic knee-capped the league’s pivot to live, in-person events, and the employee discrimination lawsuit filed against its parent company Activision Blizzard has seen nearly all of the OWL’s sponsors revoke or pause advertising. Now reports are circulating that the league may take an extended break once the playoffs conclude in September in order to ensure the start of the new season coincides with the release of the long-in-development&lt;em&gt; Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UtIat"&gt;But before we can contemplate what’s to come for the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League, let’s take a look at how this fourth regular season unfolded.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Overwatch" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_pFj58rrqZYdO5vb0YfLj52k8ww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2438706/Screen_Shot_2014-11-07_at_2.35.08_PM.0.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Blizzard&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IrpVl4"&gt;The good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F48ZKz"&gt;In season four, teams participated in four alliteratively named tournaments (May Melee, June Joust, Summer Showdown, and Countdown Cup) consisting of three weeks of qualifying matches, a knockout round, and a final, double elimination bracket. The top two teams in each region competed in a final tournament in which the participants received cash prizes and league points that will be used to determine seeding during the playoffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xR0azM"&gt;The tournaments were a welcome continuation from the previous year. Instead of regular season games existing as little more than filler for the higher stakes of the playoffs, the tournaments were a way to keep regular season play fresh and exciting. The introduction of league points created an additional level of competition complexity and produced some amusing shake-ups in the rankings. The Chengdu Hunters — the team in the Asia Division notorious for their unorthodox (and at times inconsistent) play style — rank higher than the defending champions San Francisco Shock despite having a slightly worse record. The Hunters have made appearances in two of the four tournaments earning them extra points, while San Francisco — the one-time gods of the league — never managed to escape the knockout rounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALKFTL"&gt;After dominating for two years straight, the Shock’s slight decline opened up opportunities for new teams to fill the space they left behind — namely the Dallas Fuel and my Shanghai Dragons. The Dragons had another amazing season earning two tournament wins, the top spot in the standings, and an automatic pass into the playoffs. Shanghai came so close to winning the 2020 season and this year they still look to be in top form. While there’s a chance for the Dragons to repeat their mistakes from 2020 (shout out to the Seoul Dynasty who stopped the Dragons from appearing in the Grand Finals last year) the only team their equal this year is the Dallas Fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNihbJ"&gt;If the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League were a scripted series, the Dallas Fuel would be the gifted kid who struggled a lot before finally coming into their own power. Some inspired roster additions and excellent coaching turned the Dallas Fuel from a team that, in three years, never obtained a positive win record to the easy favorite to win it all. For my money, the team’s main tank, Eui-Seok “Fearless” Lee, or their star damage player, Yeong-han “SP9RK1E” Kim, should be the top choices for league MVP. At the very least, Fearless should be a prime candidate for the Dennis Hawelka award (think OWL’s MWP or Most Wholesome Player) after &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/korean-overwatch-league-player-shares-his-experience-wi-1846655749"&gt;speaking out earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; about the discrimination he faced as a Korean living in America in the midsts of its pandemic-borne &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22359080/anti-asian-racism-attacks-surveillance-policing"&gt;anti-Asian hate wave&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9RftYz-O1l-eprXUGjwkrxpCSKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790656/owl23.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Blizzard&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch League teams in Asia were allowed to host homestands this year due to relaxed pandemic restrictions in Asia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WrNDwG"&gt;The bad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jglRGf"&gt;Dallas and Shanghai are the two teams at the top of the standings. But if there is a top, there must also be a bottom. During the inaugural season, the 12 teams played 40 regular season games and, against all odds, the Shanghai Dragons lost all 40 of them. For three years, they were the only team to ever have a winless season. And though they’ve more than redeemed themselves with tournament wins, playoff runs, an MVP, and a very good chance to win this year — the ignominy of being the only team with a winless season stuck to them like gum at the bottom of a Balenciaga sneaker (a favorite among OWL’s hypebeast players). Now the gum has passed on to a new team, sticking to the bottom of their shoes or, rather, their wings. This year, the Los Angeles Valiant became the second team to have a winless season, losing all 16 of their regular season games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6fuP6"&gt;The Valiant were a good team. In three years, they accumulated a decent record, a tournament win, two Dennis Hawekla award winners, and the dedication of a lot of fans. However, the Valiant’s owners, Immortals Gaming Club, decided, with the league’s approval, that the team would relocate from the North American division to the Asian division — moving the team from Los Angeles to China. Management was unable to secure Chinese visas for the team’s North American and Korean players and therefore had to release &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/esports/2021/01/29/overwatch-valiant-china-league/"&gt;the entire roster and coaching staff&lt;/a&gt;, replacing them with all-new Chinese talent. Fortunately, most of the released players did find new teams, but fans considered the Valiant’s winless 2021 season “karma” for the management’s decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOeqvb"&gt;The Valiant almost had company in the winless club. The London Spitfire and the Vancouver Titans ended their seasons at a single win apiece. It’s sad when former greats have crappy seasons. The London Spitfire won the inaugural season — an honor that should have gone to the New York Excelsior, the winningest team that year. And there was a time when the Vancouver Titans were the only team that could stand up to the league’s big, bad villains, the Shock. But roster changes and the stresses of the pandemic made it such that these teams barely managed to eke out a solitary win. If the script writers for 2022 are kind (if there even is a league in 2022), my fondest hope is for these teams to have the same kind of glow-up my Dragons had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sCAPxP"&gt;The ugly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Lkrpo8"&gt;The success of the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League is ultimately tied to the success of its parent company Activision Blizzard King and this year, success for ABK was difficult to come by. In March, a month before opening day, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334569/activision-blizzard-layoffs-esports-overwatch-call-of-duty-league-covid-pandemic"&gt;Activision Blizzard announced layoffs&lt;/a&gt; that affected its esports division that runs both the OWL and the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; League. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANxKT6"&gt;In April, Seoul Dynasty damage player and one of the most beloved figures in the league, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/chinese-overwatch-teams-threaten-boycott-of-korean-play-1846828529"&gt;came under fire&lt;/a&gt; for statements he made during a personal Twitch stream. Jong-ryeol “Saebyeolbe” Park expressed the frustration he felt as a Korean player trying to appeal to a Chinese audience. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TgU0uPzJ08EDxXbfcecKH-1dFPw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790671/sbb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Blizzard / Robert Paul&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jong-ryeol “Saebyeolbe” Park from his time on the New York Excelsior.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zcml1U"&gt;“I can’t say Taiwan and [Hong Kong]. At all. They [China] don’t recognize them as countries. I got into so much trouble for saying their names,” Park said in an English translation of his Korean stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8mPeN"&gt;“Make it make sense,” Park continued. “What are you talking about, ‘One China?’ So I objected to that and all the managers said, ‘If you want to earn Chinese money, you have to become a Chinese dog. So that’s what I’m doing right now. I can even say, ‘Thanks for subscribing’ in Chinese. Aren’t I good at Chinese?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhLwK4"&gt;Park’s seeming denial of China’s “One China” policy that does not recognize Taiwan and Hong Kong as their own independent entities but as a member of the Chinese state, and the notion that Park was pandering to Chinese fans, drew the ire of the league’s Chinese fans and teams. Each of the four teams based in China — three of which are nearly entirely composed of Korean players — issued statements on Chinese social media condemning Park’s words while also saying they would boycott any scrimmages or matches should he appear. Park later apologized and the Chinese teams issued statements saying they would “resume normal activities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoHnep"&gt;The incident is yet another example of Blizzard running afoul of Chinese nationalist sensibilities. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20940711/blizzard-hong-kong-controversy-gaming-protest-news-updates"&gt;Blizzard banned and later reinstated a &lt;em&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/em&gt; player&lt;/a&gt; after he expressed pro-Hong Kong views during a post-game interview. Though Park’s comments were made before the start of the season, he has not streamed nor has he appeared in a match since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gkmynv"&gt;In July, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;the state of California sued Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; for sexual harassment and discrimination taking place at the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; developer. Almost immediately after that announcement, league advertisers began to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/08/05/activision-blizzard-sponsors-overwatch/"&gt;withdraw or pause their sponsorships&lt;/a&gt;. In a broadcast that was dominated by commercials for IBM, T-Mobile, Cheez-Its, and Coca-Cola, only TeamSpeak remains. The league has never been candid about its finances. Team owners paid between $20 to $60 million dollars for a franchise slot and while individual teams can and have secured their own sponsorship deals, no one knows exactly how much revenue teams and the league generate. Homestands were supposed to provide regular income via ticket sales, but ever since the pandemic shut down live events, that avenue of income has been lost. Combine the loss of homestands with layoffs and the loss of key sponsors, and the league’s finances don’t look the healthiest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wcPMK4hUzNAbkBW69HD1YHVHu7U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790641/ow2.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cYlMvG"&gt;The future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FQmAdP"&gt;Departing staff and a rocky development cycle on &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; has cast uncertainty on OWL’s future. In April, Jeff Kaplan, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s creative director affectionately known to the league as “Papa Jeff,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394116/overwatch-director-jeff-kaplan-activision-blizzard-departure"&gt;left Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; with Aaron Keller taking over his role overseeing &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wW9rZ2"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.ggrecon.com/articles/report-overwatch-league-to-go-on-potential-year-long-hiatus-before-season-5-updated/"&gt;report from esports site &lt;em&gt;GGRecon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also claimed that the League might implement an extended off-season. Jon Spector, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League vice president, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Spex_J/status/1425489232911552518?s=20"&gt;refuted that claim&lt;/a&gt; saying in a tweet, “We have not set nor communicated dates about our 2022 season yet, but do not plan to take a ‘year-long hiatus’ in any scenario we are considering currently.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtZI2S"&gt;This alleged prolonged off-season would purportedly push Opening Day 2022 from the first half of the year into the later half in order to fall near the release of &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; — a game that still doesn’t have a release date three years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943766/blizzard-overwatch-2-sequel-announcement-blizzcon-2019"&gt;its debut at Blizzcon 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nx55Kb"&gt;Pinning the start of a season on the release of a new game is a little unorthodox in esports. The most popular esports on the planet — &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; — implement necessary changes via regular content and balance patches which don’t typically disrupt a season. The exceptions to this rule — &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; and the various sports games like &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Madden&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K&lt;/em&gt; — have yearly release cycles you could set your watch by, making season planning simple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQIx6l"&gt;We do know a little about how the new game will impact competitive play. The developers stated that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446374/overwatch-2-preview-five-player-multiplayer-new-maps-changes"&gt;team sizes will shrink from six to five and showcased the new competitive mode Push&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; team also teased new maps, new hero looks, and the anxiously awaited heroine, Sojourn — &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s first Black female hero. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KYT2Vz"&gt;Now what?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VHYXym"&gt;The fourth season of the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League isn’t yet over. This weekend concludes the last of the four tournaments, and I’m excited that neither the Dallas Fuel nor the Shanghai Dragons will participate. What I love about this year the most is its parity. The San Francisco Shock dominated seasons two and three. They won everything easily and made the seasons kinda boring. (Yes, Shanghai did, too. I’m biased, sue me.) This year, instead of the narrative being dominated by a scant handful of teams at the top, lots of different teams across both divisions had their chance to shine. Houston, Chengdu, Dallas, Atlanta, and the Los Angeles Gladiators all had moments of sheer brilliance combined with smaller but no less brilliant moments from weaker teams like Vancouver, Toronto, and London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sW0jEA"&gt;For the first time in two years, I’m confident the playoffs won’t be attended by kings of the Bay. Instead, my hope springs eternal that the Dragons, &lt;em&gt;my &lt;/em&gt;Dragons, will finally play in a Grand Finals match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymdJ8P"&gt;Every year a rivalry between two teams dominates the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League’s “storyline” and this year’s rivalry is between Shanghai and Dallas. They are the top teams in their respective divisions and met twice in tournament finals with each team claiming a victory over the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tgOQO"&gt;I have a standing appointment with my local tattoo shop. If the Dragons win an OWL championship, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/i-am-two-shanghai-dragons-wins-away-from-my-first-tatto-1845317426"&gt;I’ll get their logo emblazoned on my arm&lt;/a&gt; (yes, I am serious). If this league is indeed scripted, a Dallas / Shanghai Grand Final is what we’ll get and it’s a final fans deserve. And if this is the end for OWL — please, just let my team win its last game. &lt;/p&gt;
