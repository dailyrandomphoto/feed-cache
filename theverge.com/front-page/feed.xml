    <title>This ambitious smart ring hopes to one day monitor chronic illnesses</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Renders of four Movano Rings" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bNDHV5n5_O-AjPSfu20XWudMsT8=/75x0:2325x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70319577/Offset_Ad.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Movano Ring is a smart ring with medical ambitions&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Movano&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="23UKBW"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22789248/oura-ring-3-review-sleep-tracker-fitness-tracker"&gt;Oura Ring&lt;/a&gt; isn’t the only smart ring on the block anymore. For CES 2022, health tech company &lt;a href="https://movano.com/"&gt;Movano&lt;/a&gt; is announcing the Movano Ring, a wearable that aims to help people affordably monitor chronic illnesses and better understand their data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oe4p0F"&gt;The Movano Ring will measure all the basic metrics, including heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), sleep, respiration, temperature, blood oxygen levels, steps, and calories burned. However, instead of a raw data dump, Movano says it’ll distill how your metrics relate to each other “take a more proactive approach to mitigating the risks of chronic disease.” For example, the Movano app might tell you how your exercise habits impact your sleeping patterns or HRV over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ei3Xae"&gt;This isn’t surprising — more wearable makers are shifting away from steps and calories in favor of simplified scores and insights. The Oura Ring, Whoop, and Fitbit all use scores to contextualize sleep and recovery data but mostly focus on telling you whether to push yourself or take it easy on a given day. They’re also accompanied by graphs and lengthy descriptions that can, at times, be overwhelming. Movano says it wants its insights to be more actionable. So far, the app screenshots that Movano showed &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; don’t show anything groundbreaking, but the way the data is presented is more digestible than many trackers out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the Movano app describing how a user’s data shows that they sleep better on days they exercise" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVPl6LzTQlsCOBT2btO2DYxjFvM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120760/IndividualScreens3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Movano&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plenty of wearables offer similar data, but the way it’s presented here is much easier to digest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QFWf1a"&gt;There are a few other things that help the Movano Ring stand out. For starters, the device itself isn’t hideous and is impressively slim. The emphasis on a sleeker design was a deliberate choice, says Movano CEO Dr. John Mastrototaro, as the device was specifically designed for women of all ages. That’s notable in two ways. First, wearable tech has historically favored traditionally masculine styles and sizes. Smart rings like the Oura Ring and the now-defunct Motiv Ring have also tended to be on the chunkier side. That’s mainly because it’s hard to miniaturize sensors with current technology, but a side-effect is that they’re less suitable for petite hands. A truly slim and sleek smart ring would be a first. Second, only a handful of wearables companies take a women-first approach. Some have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-study-affirms-that-women-do-in-fact-have-cramps-d-1846431781"&gt;tried addressing the issue&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s still a &lt;a href="https://time.com/collection/davos-2020/5764698/gender-data-gap/"&gt;huge gender gap&lt;/a&gt; in medical data. (Fun fact: it wasn’t until 1993 that Congress &lt;a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/inclusion/women-and-minorities/guidelines.htm#:~:text=The%20NIH%20Revitalization%20Act%20of,and%20minorities%20in%20clinical%20research.&amp;amp;text=The%20statute%20includes%20a%20specific,and%2C%20in%20particular%20clinical%20trials."&gt;mandated women and minorities be included in clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FsywLv"&gt;But the big thing is that while most wearable companies sidestep questions about FDA approval, Movano is frank about its medical ambitions. According to Mastrototaro, while the first Movano Ring won’t have FDA clearances, the goal is to eventually get &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/consumers-medical-devices/learn-if-medical-device-has-been-cleared-fda-marketing"&gt;Class II designation&lt;/a&gt; and add medical features like non-invasive glucose monitoring and cuffless blood pressure in a “step-by-step” manner over time. To do that, the company is conducting clinical trials for its radio frequency-enabled tech and algorithms, as well as accuracy studies to gain FDA clearance for heart rate, SpO2, and respiratory rate monitoring. Non-invasive glucose monitoring and cuffless blood pressure are holy grails for wearable tech — and big names, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652120/apple-watch-blood-pressure-temperature-sleep-diabetes"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/fitbit-study-blood-pressure/"&gt;Fitbit&lt;/a&gt;, have been rumored to be working on these features for smartwatches. Bringing them to a smart ring would be an impressive achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Three copper Movano Rings stacked on top of each other" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bFQZ4-WnikwghhYL0thTljObn9M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121243/Stack_Copper.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Movano&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s miraculously not chunky — a big win for smart rings if this ever gets to market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kkV5iI"&gt;That said, consumer wearables promising medical features often end up in regulatory limbo. The Withings ScanWatch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21048522/withings-health-monitoring-scanwatch-ecg-afib-heart-sleep-apnea-blood-oxygen"&gt;made its debut&lt;/a&gt; at CES in January 2020, but it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22772984/withings-scanwatch-blood-oxygen-sleep-apnea-watch-fda"&gt;wasn’t until November 2021&lt;/a&gt; that it obtained the FDA clearance necessary to hit the US market. Its Move ECG smartwatch was announced even earlier but still has yet to receive clearance. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-first-smartwatch-to-read-your-blood-pressure-is-an-1833612732"&gt;Omron’s HeartGuide blood pressure smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; also took several years to clear. It often means companies end up choosing between making consumer wellness devices that lack medical credibility or niche medical devices that are inaccessible to the average person. However, Mastrototaro says Movano’s got a secret trump card: decades of regulatory experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niZwNi"&gt;“We’re taking the regulatory side of things very seriously,” Mastrototaro told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. He also pointed to his long history in developing medical devices, including the first continuous glucose monitor, as well as that of his staff. That experience, Mastrototaro says, gives Movano an edge in navigating the FDA’s notoriously opaque clearance process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4azG2"&gt;The Movano Ring won’t be available until the second half of 2022, and even then, it’ll be a beta version. We also don’t have any concrete details for pricing, though Mastrototaro says the company aims for it to be “one of the most affordable” on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGb5gZ"&gt;“We’re aiming for both a medical and consumer focus — the intersection of these two fields as opposed to one or the other. We want to have the look, feel, and affordability of a consumer device with the accuracy and reliability of a medical device,” says Mastrototaro. What Mastrototaro is describing is the holy grail of wearable tech. We’ll have to see if the Movano Ring ends up being another CES pipedream, but it’s certainly one of the more ambitious takes on smart rings that we’ve seen in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG Display shows off a versatile lineup of transparent OLED screens at CES 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PNYriOXOEEcwL03j23fxud8vjbo=/0x344:4968x3656/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70318789/lg_display_oled_shelf.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The OLED Shelf displaying a piece of art. | Photo by LG Display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TpdYwA"&gt;LG Display has come up with more uses for transparent screens with its innovative new concepts that will be on display at CES 2022: the OLED Shelf, Shopping Managing Showcase, Show Window, and Smart Window. The company is not to be confused with LG Electronics, as LG Display simply creates concepts that other companies can adopt and introduce to the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0g2SAL"&gt;Its OLED Shelf, visible at the top of this story, consists of two 55-inch transparent OLED displays mounted on top of one another, with a shelf at the very top. LG Display says it’s ideal for the living room, where it can display art, a TV show, or one on each of the two screens simultaneously. Always on Display Mode ensures that the screen can stay on all the time. If there was a piece of art on display, that image could stay put just like a painting, all while blending into the wall behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MOA40sMjzUR3F_O_O50uULPUzBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23127627/lg_display_oled_shelf.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another view of the OLED Shelf, with the opaque roll-down material visible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2a1JS8"&gt;There’s actually room for you to put an &lt;em&gt;actual &lt;/em&gt;painting behind the screens, too, which you’d be able to see when they’re off. LG’s also devised a motorized sheet of opaque material which rolls down like a projector screen to make their images more vibrant and less ethereal. (Images viewed on transparent screens can sometimes look ghostly.) The pedestal you see in the image above houses some of the electronics, and the screens take standard HDMI input.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MeCIKk9roNDbtaLfYu46Xn91KP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23126574/lg_display_shopping_managing_showcase.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by LG Display&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Shopping Managing Showcase highlights perfume.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kshY5v"&gt;While the OLED Shelf is built for the home, LG Display says its Shopping Managing Showcase is meant for “luxurious” department stores. A transparent OLED display is attached to a sleek wooden stand, and when placed in front of physical products, it looks like it could create a futuristic shopping experience. It adds an overlay to the items behind it, which means storeowners could add graphics that highlight certain parts of their products, or even use the display to provide funky visual effects. We saw a video where flowy graphics drew our eye to one of the perfume bottles in the display above, giving it a lustrous halo effect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RnW79D9WskNuChLLtOwci_HQKc8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23126581/lg_display_show_window.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by LG Display&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The LG Display Show Window could create unique window displays.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7z32Wp"&gt;LG Display also gave us a glimpse of its Show Window, another business-focused model that consists of four 55-inch transparent OLED displays that could be used to play up products in window displays — instead of window decals, stores could add digital text, which can easily be changed at any time. The company says versions of it are already on display at &lt;a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/global/2021/05/lg-display-x-musinsa-transparent-oled-trendiness/"&gt;the new Musinsa fashion store&lt;/a&gt; in Seoul, as well as art exhibitions &lt;a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/global/2021/12/a-hopeful-future-with-oled-art-at-the-smithsonian/"&gt;at The Smithsonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/global/2021/10/transparent-oled-lights-up-londons-art-scene/amp/"&gt;at 180 The Strand in London&lt;/a&gt;, inside some subway car windows in China and Japan, and &lt;a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/global/2021/08/bvlgari-colors-come-alive-through-oled/"&gt;a Bulgari fashion show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMQ0Io"&gt;The company also showed off its Smart Window, another transparent OLED screen that can be for video calls or presentations in the office, however, it didn’t provide any images of that display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EricDE"&gt;Since these transparent displays are just concepts, we probably won’t see many of them in the real world, but that doesn’t change the fact that they’re still pretty darn cool to look at — and LG Display says it’s ready to help customers produce some of them if they want. “If any of our customers want, we can provide [the OLED Shelf],” LG Display spokesperson Jean Lee tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying it’s ready for production. All of these displays consist of the same 55-inch 1080p transparent OLED panels with 40 percent transparency, which Lee says is on the company’s 8th generation display manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teuIkK"&gt;LG Display has been in the transparent display game for a while now, revealing its &lt;a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/global/2014/07/lg-display-unveils-18-inch-flexible-and-transparent-oled-panels/"&gt;first flexible and see-through screen in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently, it showed off a transparent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223774/lg-transparent-oled-tv-display-55-inch-smart-bed-ces-2021"&gt;TV screen mounted to the foot of a bed&lt;/a&gt;. But it doesn’t just dabble in transparent screens — the company is also showcasing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850959/lg-display-media-chair-virtual-ride-concepts-ces-2022"&gt;half-moon-shaped chair with a built-in OLED screen&lt;/a&gt; at CES this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2E5iA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 11:58 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added more details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly hires away Meta’s AR public relations head</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pF74kp-qt5CHXXQ-TkkLdBwnpvE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70318197/acastro_170731_1777_0004_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="th1dJ0"&gt;Apple has reportedly hired Andrea Schubert, Meta’s communications and public relations lead for its augmented reality (AR) products, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reporter Mark Gurman in his &lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt; newsletter. Schubert’s &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrearagni"&gt;LinkedIn page&lt;/a&gt; indicates that she’s been working for Meta for nearly six years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cMjdet"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Meta, with Oculus, has been the market leader in headsets, so such a hire makes sense as Apple nears its launch”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rValof"&gt;“Meta, with Oculus, has been the market leader in headsets, so such a hire makes sense as Apple nears its launch,” Gurman explains. On both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/28/22806233/black-friday-online-spending-decreased-first-time"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22810083/cyber-monday-spending-down-early-shopping"&gt;Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; this year, Meta’s Oculus Quest 2 was one of the top-selling products. Not to mention that Meta’s Oculus app &lt;a href="https://apptopia.com/store-insights/top-charts/itunes-connect/top-overall/united-states"&gt;topped the App Store&lt;/a&gt; in the US on Christmas Day, and became the number one free app on the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/top"&gt;Google Play store today&lt;/a&gt;, a potential sign that a significant amount of people received the headset as a gift this holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrmLwX"&gt;Rumors continue to swirl around Apple’s AR/VR headset, with Apple remaining tight-lipped about the product. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; previously reported that the headset could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;cost a whopping $3,000 and come with 8K displays&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22825675/apple-ar-headset-hand-tracking-controllers-kuo-report"&gt;3D sensors for hand tracking&lt;/a&gt;. The headset may also have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;rely on a connected iPhone or Mac&lt;/a&gt; for processor-heavy tasks. We might not have to wait too much longer for Apple to officially take the wraps off of the rumored headset, however. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts that the mixed-reality headset &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318239/apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022-analyst-kuo"&gt;could launch sometime in 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: The Northman, Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber, The Silent Sea, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E7H5T7svM9oLrk-Cy3O1k0INLnE=/336x0:1556x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70317886/northman2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Alexander Skarsgård is out for revenge in The Northman  | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMSdFM12hOw&amp;amp;ab_channel=FocusFeatures" target="_blank"&gt;Focus Features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XDD6bS"&gt;Hello and welcome to the final trailers roundup for 2021, I hope you have enjoyed reading (and watching) these roundups as much as I have enjoyed writing them. There were a lot of really good streaming shows and movies this year despite the persistence of the coronavirus that disrupted so much of our lives. Among my personal favorites were &lt;em&gt;Loki, Succession, Ted Lasso, The Beatles: Get Back, King Richard, and Y: The Last Man&lt;/em&gt; (pls someone pick up this show it was just getting started!). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4s8Pvh"&gt;This week’s list has Vikings, Hercule Poirot, and a look at the upcoming Showtime series about the early days of Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ov081F"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oMSdFM12hOw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VYoUCu"&gt;The Northman&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6MqYBM"&gt;Director Robert Eggers (&lt;em&gt;The Witch&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Lighthouse&lt;/em&gt;), said in an &lt;a href="https://ew.com/movies/trailers/alexander-skarsgard-the-northman-trailer-video/"&gt;interview with EW&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;The Northman&lt;/em&gt; was “by far the hardest thing” he’s done. These are not warm and fuzzy Vikings, let’s put it that way. As a child, Amleth, the heir to the Viking throne, witnesses his uncle Fjolnir murder his father. King Aurvandi, providing him with the mantra “I will avenge you, father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you, Fjolnir.” And side note, even though they all speak English, the Vikings (in the trailer at least) have what sound like appropriate Scandinavian accents. Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke, Björk, and Willem Dafoe star in &lt;em&gt;The Northman,&lt;/em&gt; which comes to theaters April 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hl9ZW1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c3srHCvDAFE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QnMIru"&gt;Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Sk2VUe"&gt;Based on the book of the same name by &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; journalist Mike Isaac, &lt;em&gt;Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber&lt;/em&gt;, is the story of how Travis Kalanick founded the ride-hailing startup that became the unicorn that every VC in Silicon Valley wanted in on (or at least, they did in the beginning). Kalanick was ultimately ousted from the CEO role of the company he founded, but not before a lot of drama, both in public and behind the scenes. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Uma Thurman, and Kyle Chandler star in &lt;em&gt;Super Pumped&lt;/em&gt;, which premieres on Showtime February 27th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fqwsud"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Af_Hj0MDBBQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oDTqIn"&gt;The Silent Sea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NVZ1VX"&gt;OK so this trailer isn’t&lt;em&gt; brand&lt;/em&gt; new but this series looks cool as hell. The Earth is a dried up husk, and a team of astronauts are heading to the Moon on a mission to retrieve an “important sample” from a research station. They crash land on the Moon and then discover all is not well at Balhae Station and the government (gasp) may have lied to them (plus, in what seems a nice homage to the &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; movies, their tracking device detects “bio-signals” approaching them). Gong Yoo, Bae Doona, and Lee Joon star in &lt;em&gt;The Silent Sea&lt;/em&gt;, which debuted its first episode on Netflix December 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q3SEwz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZRqB0JLizw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rdu8NN"&gt;Death on the Nile &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LXZKo3"&gt;Kenneth Branagh’s version of one of Agatha Christie’s best-known Hercule Poirot mysteries is one of the many theatrical releases that was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Poirot is aboard a ship on the Nile River, when a murder occurs and he has to determine who among the ship’s passengers is responsible. &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/12/death-on-the-nile-trailer-armie-hammer.html"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Vulture&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, Armie Hammer is still in &lt;em&gt;Death on the Nile&lt;/em&gt; (there’s a mere glimpse of him in this trailer), despite some &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/armie-hammer-scandal-death-on-the-nile-disney-1235065530/"&gt;apparent discussion within Disney&lt;/a&gt; of reshooting his scenes or removing him digitally after the actor was accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women. Gal Gadot, Annette Bening, Russell Brand, Ali Fazal, Dawn French, Tom Bateman, Rose Leslie, Emma Mackey, Sophie Okonedo, Jennifer Saunders, and Letitia Wright also star in &lt;em&gt;Death on the Nile&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters February 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xXt3W5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rt_UqUm38BI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WT3Z1s"&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dNGEOn"&gt;This trailer for this sequel to &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt; originally appeared after the end credits of &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt;, and takes place after the end of that movie. Strange warns that “the multiverse is a concept about which we know frighteningly little,” so of course the movie brings him deeper into the Marvel Cinematic Universe concept of alternate timelines. Wanda Maximoff, Wong, and Mordo return, and we meet America Chavez, one of the Young Avengers from the comics. Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, and  Xochitl Gomez star in &lt;em&gt;Doctor&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters May 6th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla owner blows up Model S instead of footing $22,600 repair bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qY14_97HFXtl50zv2sGh92dQvAM=/7x0:2140x1422/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70317450/tesla_model_s_dynamite.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A Tesla Model S strapped with dynamite. | Screenshot from Pommijätkät via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_9aVzf5fC4" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m64vjh"&gt;When faced with a repair bill that costs half of what you paid for your car, do you go through with the expensive repair, bring it to the junkyard, or sell it for parts? Finnish Tesla owner Tuomas Katainen decided to do something a little more extreme — but arguably a lot more satisfying — when faced with such a situation: he watched his car go up in flames, as noted in a report from &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/finnish-man-passes-on-paying-22-600-to-replace-his-tes-1848268874"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJ1Bx2"&gt;Katainen handed his 2013 Tesla Model S over to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr1cNqiNxK46w93zw9KfTLg"&gt;Pommijätkät&lt;/a&gt;, a group of explosion experts on YouTube who loves to make things go “boom,” after he was quoted $22,600 for a battery replacement. “Well when I bought that Tesla, the first 1,500km [932 miles] were nice,” Katainen recounted. “Then, error codes hit.” After Katainen brought his Tesla to a mechanic, he found out that the only way to fix the car would be to replace the entire battery pack, which would cost him at least 20,000€, or around $22,600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sfxczS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The group behind Pommijätkät strapped 66 pounds of dynamite to the car and parked it in an old quarry&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ydxxt"&gt;I think anyone would be pretty frustrated at that point, considering that the base price for a new 2013 Tesla Model S started at $57,400, later &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/2013-model-s-price-increase"&gt;increasing to $59,900&lt;/a&gt; when the car first came out. Even &lt;a href="https://www.carfax.com/Used-2013-Tesla-Model-S_z25929"&gt;a standard used model&lt;/a&gt; currently goes for around $30,000 at the lowest. That’s probably why Katainen picked up the Tesla from the shop and told the mechanic that he’s going to “explode the whole car away.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ISQBF"&gt;For context, these cars come with an eight-year (or up to 150,000 miles) &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/vehicle-warranty"&gt;battery and drive unit warranty&lt;/a&gt;, but the warranties on older models are starting to expire, revealing the potential cost behind a full battery replacement. In September, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/13/tesla-battery-pack-replacement-repair/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported on a Tesla owner in need of a battery replacement on a Model S that was no longer under warranty. As noted in the report, he was quoted $22,500 from Tesla, but ended up getting a repair for $5,000 from a third-party shop. Katainen’s quote was also from Tesla, and it’s unclear whether he had access to an alternative repair service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKwuNs"&gt;Either way, the group behind Pommijätkät strapped 30kg (66 pounds) of dynamite to the car and parked it in an old quarry in Jaala, Finland. Even Elon Musk was there — well, at least in spirit. A crash test dummy outfitted with a helmet, thick winter jacket, and a picture of Musk’s face was dropped in by helicopter and then stuffed in the driver’s seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1mmlC"&gt;Katainen triggers the explosion from inside a nearby bunker, and Tesla erupts in a ball of fire, with what seems like thousands of pieces scattering throughout the snowy landscape. The group picks up whatever was left of the car, which amounts to just a pile of scraps. When asked whether he’s ever had this much fun behind the wheel of a Tesla, Katainen replies, “No, never enjoyed this much with Tesla!”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>10 great apps for your new 2021 iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eLDblo8s8GGDnkC1e1JNDPjo02U=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70317437/RoundUpArt_iPhoneApps.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;New phone, new start  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="c7hvJS"&gt;So, you just unwrapped a shiny new iPhone this holiday season. A new year is around the corner. And while you could just migrate over all the same apps you’ve always used, now is also a good time to try something new. It doesn’t matter whether you’re rocking a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; or a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt; — here’s a list of some apps that are handy, fun, or just way better than whatever came pre-installed on your iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="A4rBKi"&gt;Spark Mail&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshots of Spark email app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KcqBa7jR-5Vz3ioJbNKNvb2hf38=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073892/IMG_2343_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Readdle Technologies&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spark isn’t the prettiest email client, but it gets a lot of things right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CgBYTi"&gt;Listen, Apple’s Mail app is fine. Gmail is marginally better. Microsoft Outlook is a classic for a reason. But Spark Mail is a simple, solid, and free option that packs in a lot of customizability. You have the option of toggling on smart notifications (no more notifications from that random service you signed up for six years ago) and integrating with services like Dropbox and OneDrive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zzEJRO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10910896" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="rzF6Nz"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Y52SSp"&gt;Todoist&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Todoist screenshots" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C4a2EiRJFx8Hm3WNekl8gxwHHg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073912/IMG_2345.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Doist&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Todoist lets you create lists for simple tasks and projects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PrbL7s"&gt;Sure, you could stick with Apple’s Reminders app, but there are way better options out there. Todoist is a good place to start — especially if you need something with a little more power than a bullet list in your Notes app or that sticky note you crammed in your pocket. It’s a flexible tool for everything from personal errands to work projects. It also works with a ton of third-party apps like Slack, Calendar, and Spark.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="er03MV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10910901" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="XMsYFL"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Z8CzwO"&gt;Planta&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshots of Planta app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WTUjnyuLlNaS6albAcSOBAUtYIU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073925/IMG_2347.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Stromming&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My plants only live because of Planta, honestly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hl6Cyp"&gt;If you have struggled to keep a plant alive, you are not alone. Who truly has the discipline to check soil moisture levels every day? While there are a lot of plant apps out there, Planta is the only one that’s helped me keep any of them alive — and, dare I say, thriving. It helps you determine which plants should go where in your home, tells you when to water and re-pot, and alerts you with temperature warnings for your outdoor babies. It can also ID that mystery plant your auntie gifted you. There’s a free version, as well as several other subscription options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NbDqN4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10910980" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="wWXCJv"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="OjdZA1"&gt;Strava&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screencaps of Strava app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v05oapaOd7OeM6-Qa_kjPkwmq6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073962/IMG_2349.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Strava&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strava has tons of data to keep the nerds happy, but is simple enough for beginners too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pK7qIR"&gt;If you want to be more active, few apps do it better than Strava. You don’t need a fitness tracker or smartwatch (though you can integrate many of the popular ones), and it supports a variety of activities, including staples like biking, running, and walking. There’s a ton of third-party integrations as well, making it easy to use as a hub for all your exercise goals. On top of challenges where you can earn discounts on fitness gear, there are also thoughtful personal safety features and lots of ways to measure your progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GOJWHH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10910992" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fUzL4q"&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Screencaps of YNAB mobile app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CTtHXf2AyIseHirs74Z4CJotSnA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073986/iPhone_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: YNAB&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YNAB is a little pricey, but is one of the best proactive budgeting tools out there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pMBBSg"&gt;The title says it all: You Need a Budget. If you really want to be proactive about how you’re spending and saving for the future, YNAB is hard to beat. The categories and methodology might seem a little daunting at first, but you can make it as complicated or simple as you need. It comes with two subscription options — $98.99 yearly or $14.99 monthly — that can feel a bit steep. However, in my several years of using it, I found that the app paid for itself within the first month. That said, there’s a 34-day free trial for you to see if it’s worth it for you. Otherwise, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mint-budget-expense-tracker/id300238550?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;amp;itscg=30200"&gt;Mint&lt;/a&gt; is another great and free option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3nMq03"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911011" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1qzwqO"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="lfK2d9"&gt;Libby&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screencap of Libby app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOqU3svW9iSXSDdHb2EEIjrh620=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073997/IMG_2360.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Libby is a must-have for bookworms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="paHY0B"&gt;Buying e-books adds up, especially if you’re a voracious bookworm. Libby lets you connect with your local library to borrow books, magazines, and audiobooks for free. You can read within the app itself or send your books to your Kindle. A nice perk: Libby automatically syncs across your devices, so it doesn’t matter which device you’re reading on. It also integrates with CarPlay and allows for offline reading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="foSqMb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911018" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TR8wCg"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="tkXLAc"&gt;Tody&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screencap of Tody app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Lm4VRAmyBugXwUv2Xn5QnogCW0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23074010/IMG_2354.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: LoopLoop&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tody helps save time by spreading out your cleaning tasks in more manageable chunks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4LL1aR"&gt;Do you know how often you’re supposed to sharpen your knives or oil your cutting boards? How about when to change your shower liner or flip the mattress? Tody is a handy customizable app that automatically notifies you when it’s time to clean what and when. You can organize chores by room, assign tasks to your family or housemates, and complete against Dusty, a dust gremlin, to keep things fun (and clean). For the neat freaks among us, it also helps you visualize how clean your home is — and settle arguments about who’s &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; doing most of the cleaning. It’s got a one-time fee of $6.99, but there are no further in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mN0kEU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911024" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8kV7CM"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="PjBQUK"&gt;1Password&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screencaps of 1Password" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5t3tDPHpXHRsvk9F7ZkJdvCGoU0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23074022/Categories___Light.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: AgileBits&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;1Password is one of several password managers you can download to keep your accounts safe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jCchV4"&gt;Password managers are security hygiene 101. Personally, I like 1Password because it also works with my Apple Watch and is compatible across multiple platforms. It works with Touch and FaceID, is easy to set up, and even securely saves your credit card info for online shopping. It’ll also alert you to which of your passwords aren’t great, and it’s simple to generate new ones on the fly. There isn’t a free version, unfortunately (you do get a 30-day trial), but there are plenty of other free password managers to choose from, such as &lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/"&gt;Bitwarden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dashlane.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dashlane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lastpass.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22824153%2Fiphone-best-apps-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;, and even the ones built into Safari / Google Chrome. Each has its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/24/15921282/best-password-manager-1password-lastpass-dashlane-how-to"&gt;advantages and disadvantages&lt;/a&gt; — but any password manager is better than none. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fHSLLu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911079" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="45lxz2"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="MoeEdv"&gt;Calm&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screencaps of Calm app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5VAOQQyeX6Y5ztqpiAW_q9-9HnA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23074037/IMG_2355.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Calm&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’re all stressed, but Calm has several helpful meditations. Who doesn’t want Idris Elba to lull them to sleep?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1Sjj1u"&gt;It’s been a stressful time for everybody. The nice thing about Calm is that it has meditations to suit your specific needs, like increased focus, reduced anxiety, or just daily topics to ruminate on. If mindfulness isn’t your cup of tea, Calm also has a number of sleep stories and music tracks. Sure, you already probably have YouTube and its dozens of free white noise videos, but sometimes it’s nice drifting away to Idris Elba reading you a bedtime story. &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/headspace-mindful-meditation/id493145008?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;amp;itscg=30200"&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt; is another popular option that’s geared more toward beginners if you just want to dip your toe into the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lzIh6U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911090" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="p3R3l7"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="EisKsl"&gt;Splitwise&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screencaps of Splitwise app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xlDrRw1ETDIOxuGSUZrXAW1Vg8Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073972/splitwise_ios_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Splitwise&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Splitwise makes it clear who owes who, and for what. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L0uTOu"&gt;Venmo is great and all, but it’s also nice to have a running record of all the moolah you owe your friends, family, and housemates. While there is a paid tier, the free version does everything you need it to, from automatically splitting bills, logging recurring expenses, and linking out to Venmo to pay those expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZNICwF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911096" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>9 great Android apps for your new 2021 Android device</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9tIzFxLcRqeqzntLE3sLvPCZWvw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70317351/RoundUpArt_AndroidApps.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A privacy-minded roundup of apps, including a self-care penguin&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="zj20b0"&gt;Congratulations on your new Android device! After going through all the legalese to set up your Google account and services (and probably doing the same with your phone manufacturer and carrier), you’re finally ready to make your phone or tablet your own. As you populate your email app with new emails and purge useless apps from your device, now is the time to install some better apps that will improve your life. Here are nine Android apps that made me happier and more organized, without being overly demanding of my user data or annoying with ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IOVFJu"&gt;ColorNote Notepad Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="ColorNote" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PL8r78rs9xiI0HgUZfZnZSYDmuQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097002/Screenshot_20211214_190728.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Notes&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ColorNote Notepad Notes &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="ColorNote app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Gg2F_00MemnHcWgmFtsuwdCTHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097012/Screenshot_20211214_191628.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ouxxfg"&gt;My home is full of post-it notes strategically placed on multiple surfaces: my desk, boxes, and even the cutting board. And they all serve different purposes: some are shopping lists, some are reminders to return an item, and some are just my to-do lists. The ColorNote app is basically a digital version of my sticky note addiction but organized into a single screen. You can create either a text note or a checklist and customize its color to help you differentiate one from another. The app has a calendar where you can note important dates, share individual notes with your friends and family, or even sync your notes across multiple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LESRm0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925165" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CLZbrU"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="smTWTg"&gt;Notebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Notebook app by Zoho Corporation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RQCampC59WZmgd2-S_QMwdouvx0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097020/Screenshot_20211214_192140.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Zoho&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Notebook app by Zoho Corporation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aAOCy1bTDCdgfLKUUFktjQeDTP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097181/Screenshot_20211214_202422.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YzSTKC"&gt;It’s handy to have a robust note-taking app on your phone: this way, you can jot down detailed notes, include relevant photos from your work meeting, and keep a journal, all on the same device. The free Notebook app from Zoho organizes your notes into digital notebooks with gorgeous digital covers and provides powerful tools to help you document anything and everything. You can embed multimedia elements like sketches, photos, and even audio files into your written notes to add context and can add as many pages as you need. Your data is stored locally, but you can sync your notebooks across multiple devices (including Windows, macOS, and iOS) if you have a Zoho account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="52mgxW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925177" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="K0JWXn"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wA7WOD"&gt;Finch: Self-Care Widget Pet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Finch, the self-care widget pet app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rUXraJAUk_s6MrfrLwKT7UfP3DY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097035/Screenshot_20211214_192518.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Finch Cares&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finch: Self-Care Widget Pet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Finch, the self-care widget pet app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dK8_QldNXYPrqLlWbhLsQahIbSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097039/Screenshot_20211214_192529.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qZkGk8"&gt;We’re coming up to year two of the pandemic, and everyone is feeling various degrees of isolation and exhaustion. Good thing Finch, the self-care pet penguin, is here to guide us to take better care of our mental health. He lives inside the app and prompts you to practice self-care each day: he’ll check in on your mood and will tell you to stretch and set goals periodically, which will earn energy points to help him on his adventures. There is plenty to do in the free version, but you can upgrade to Finch Plus for more self-care exercises; it costs $39.99 for a one-year subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qzcXfu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925188" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ptHhGb"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="24j74j"&gt;CBT Companion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="CBT Companion app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVs0vaMt518GYN0t5xkQbNEINoM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097053/Screenshot_20211214_193100.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Resiliens&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;CBT Companion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="CBT Companion app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s19WY7Qa3TtzIeL5pt0uDVcdzYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097057/Screenshot_20211214_193124.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dF31SE"&gt;If you rather track your mental wellness without the gamification of Finch, the CBT Companion app (Cognitive Behavior Therapy) is a more pragmatic alternative. It offers a safe (and free) space to document your thoughts and provide exercises to practice your CBT skills, whether you’re working with a clinician or not. You can also pay $9.99 per month or $49.99 every six months to access additional exercises and content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AP2SSp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925215" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="m7AIco"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rkexJR"&gt;AfterShip Package Tracker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="AfterShip app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yijL08huhxm26BDMfvpBVCFkyHs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097066/Screenshot_20211214_193709.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AfterShip Package Tracker &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="AfterShip app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iHW-6D_z2QR5UyNOF6U7O4L1ni0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097068/Screenshot_20211214_193654.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4TW1fw"&gt;Given how brazen porch pirates are these days, it’s more important than ever to know the delivery status of all the packages you’re expecting — whether they’re gifts for friends and family or groceries that need to be refrigerated as soon as possible. AfterShip lets you manually enter each package you’re expecting (rather than demand access to all your emails like other apps) — you just have to provide the tracking number and name the courier delivering the package, and the app can figure out the rest. It’ll show you where each package is on a map, as well as its current status (I usually have to tap on the name of the courier to see the latest update). This way, you’ll know when to expect a package to arrive, so you can grab it before a porch pirate can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vNxpQ2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925226" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Gema93"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DmvEz3"&gt;Discord&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Discord app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3KH_f7jl3ARHdrQeRtWOhO0jUcw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097093/Screenshot_20211214_194408.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Discord&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discord&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Discord app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_fp_QNMdeBEhlMikLvaAj6vGAhc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097089/Screenshot_20211214_194337.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o5r7Oq"&gt;Ever since Google announced that it will be shutting down Hangouts, a chat app that my parents know and love, I’ve been on the hunt for another easy-to-use up chat app. Discord, the platform beloved by gamers, might just be&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;one. First, I like that you only need to provide your email address to sign up for an account, and you can invite specific people to join your server or room. Within your own private space, you can chat with your friends and family using text or GIFs or have the option to start a video or voice call, whether they have the app or use the web interface. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kl4ZgI"&gt;I got so fed up with the algorithmically generated news on the Chrome web browser’s homepage that I started using the Firefox mobile browser on my phone instead. Like the desktop version, the mobile Firefox browser can block trackers and scripts such as social media trackers, cross-site cookie trackers, cryptominers, and fingerprinters. Without these sneaky little things following you around, you can just surf the web as usual, though some sites might break without being able to collect data on you. You can even customize your browser by changing it to Dark Mode or moving the search bar to the bottom of the screen to make it easier to use on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FszHNp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925291" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Paprika recipe manager app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aSY23A8WJoZNU8XLtZwe6D6_sCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097161/Screenshot_20211214_200759.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gnknpy"&gt;My current recipe management is a hot mess: I keep too many web browser tabs opened with recipes I want to find quickly, all on my phone. With Paprika, I can download the contents of my favorite recipes (as long as they’re available online and searchable by Google) and save the ingredients and instructions inside this little app. You can even tweak the recipe you import in case you have any tips or changes you’d like to make to the original. The app includes an editable grocery shopping list, pantry list, and menu, as well as a meal planning calendar to keep your kitchen organized. Although the free version only lets you store a maximum of 50 recipes, you can upgrade to the paid version that enables syncing between devices and storage of an unlimited number of recipes for $4.99.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weather &amp;amp; Widget - Weawow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Weawow widget customization options" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C2BRKhL_0hIItIRfxbMvQ7lc7BY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098768/Screenshot_20211215_113946.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eVsKXM"&gt;Ever since IBM bought The Weather Company and, with it, Weather Underground — a site I swore by but whose app experience has seen better days — I’ve been on the hunt for a new weather app that is similarly respectful of users’ privacy. The Weawow weather app is that unicorn. It asks you to enter your location rather than demand continuous access to all your GPS data, lets you opt out of sharing your location data with third parties, and doesn’t serve ads along with its forecasts. I appreciate that this app makes it easy to change the units of measurement for those of us who need to, has a swipe-friendly interface, and lets me add it as a widget to my home screen with lots of options for customization.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo Switch eShop is back online after experiencing outages on Christmas Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VzpD4irxwmSb-GQsbs6NLrk6eDU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70316387/jbareham_180301_2346_nintendo_switch_0084.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dTk58r"&gt;As kids and adults alike flocked to the Nintendo eShop, eager to spend the gift cards they found in their stockings, that excitement was quickly spoiled by an eShop error screen. The annual holiday surge brought down the Nintendo Switch eShop for some yet again, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-eshop-sees-big-issues-christmas-morning-under-1848270547"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Service was brought back around 4:30AM ET on December 26th, a whole 24 hours later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v1iyJN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are aware that players are experiencing errors accessing Nintendo eShop, and are working to address the issue as soon as possible. Thank you for your understanding, and please see our Network Status page for the latest updates.&lt;a href="https://t.co/KnM0g7z7jn"&gt;https://t.co/KnM0g7z7jn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1474802269275176970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4fS68u"&gt;During the outage, Nintendo sent out a tweet, noting that the company is “working to address the issue as soon as possible.” It also included a link to &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/network/en_na/network_status.jsp"&gt;Nintendo’s online service status page&lt;/a&gt;, where it displays updates about any current outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47rlrL"&gt;As noted on the status page, problems started to arise around 4AM ET on Christmas morning, and weren’t resolved until 24 hours later. The company didn’t offer any additional information on the outage, vaguely stating: “We are currently experiencing difficulties with our network services. Please try again later. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.” It later updated that statement to acknowledge that the store is back online.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9NPTB_M_mDBMlgTAu-ybVDcmocA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23125988/downdetector_nintendo_outage_switch.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Downdetector timeline showing that eShop outages peaked on Christmas morning.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1i2tM5"&gt;In a timeline of the outages shown on &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/nintendo-eshop/"&gt;Downdetector&lt;/a&gt;, it appears that issues peaked at around 9AM ET on Christmas morning, but then took a decline. I was able to successfully open the Nintendo Switch eShop, as well as download a couple of updates at around 4:30PM ET that night, a sign that things were starting to come back online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcPta8"&gt;The outage didn’t affect any other online activity, like playing games online. It just prevented players from buying and downloading any content from the eShop — which was probably a bummer for those who were looking to fill their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;new Switch&lt;/a&gt; with digital games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5tbhl"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-eshop-is-down-for-some-players-on-christmas"&gt;Nintendo eShop went down last year during Christmas&lt;/a&gt;, and the company didn’t fully restore service until the next day. &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-servers-overload-christmas-2021-switch-account"&gt;Nintendo even warned players&lt;/a&gt; that the eShop might become overloaded this holiday weekend, and advised them to create a Nintendo account &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the holidays, which isn’t really ideal if you wanted to gift the Switch to someone on Christmas Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkK1hM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Nintendo with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4GpCh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 26th, 2021 8:20AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to acknowledge that the Nintendo Switch eShop is back online as of 4:30AM ET on December 26th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned that the Death Star is the size of the Olympic Peninsula</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eWaVUFvu8j2iVlHqqRZasHmFvTk=/225x0:2256x1354/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70316043/Screen_Shot_2021_12_22_at_10.20.27_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Star for scale.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Park My Spaceship&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vs07GI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkmyspaceship.com/"&gt;Park My Spaceship&lt;/a&gt; is the simple, extremely amusing app I didn’t know I needed. It allows you to superimpose to-scale images of notable spacecraft from sci-fi shows and movies over Google Maps. That’s it. It’s great. You can check to see if Serenity would fit in your backyard or if the Millennium Falcon could land in your neighborhood park. It’s been around since 2018, but I first encountered it this week when &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CincinnatiPhil/status/1473411779766243328"&gt;@CincinnatiPhil TILearned about it&lt;/a&gt; and shared his discoveries on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsmkUJ"&gt;I set about placing ships around the greater Seattle area and found that the Millennium Falcon fits nicely in the fountain plaza in front of the Space Needle, which would look cool as hell. You can almost fit a Star Destroyer in Lake Union or park it on Harbor Island, a tiny landmass made entirely of dirt removed from early regrading projects dumped into Elliot Bay. (TIL in a TIL: A guy named &lt;a href="https://www.historylink.org/File/3631"&gt;Charles Butler and his 300 chickens&lt;/a&gt; used to live there.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yo1k-Ddi7iwvhHajLy1JXVufZCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121184/Screen_Shot_2021_12_22_at_10.11.44_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kiXYbB"&gt;You can also rotate your spaceship and press play to “fly” it across the map. I sent an X-Wing across the West Seattle bridge, which is &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/west-seattle-bridge-will-stay-closed-through-2020-and-2021/"&gt;the only way to use the West Seattle bridge&lt;/a&gt; at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2PUsb1Af-E-2n4GdnzcI-pf4-bQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121160/Dec_22_2021_10_25_15.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2EyRv8"&gt;The Death Star (mark one, that is) is on an entirely different scale. It dwarfs Seattle and Tacoma, but it just about covers the Olympic peninsula, stretching all the way from Kitsap county to Forks and the shores of the Pacific. That’s no moon, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2n-MUm145jv5cIfh-fyPgjCuFzU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121162/Screen_Shot_2021_12_22_at_10.53.05_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Santa taxis for takeoff at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVULH7"&gt;There are ships from &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;, and many other classics of the genre (I’m just partial to &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;), even real-life space ships. And then there’s that most beloved of all UFOs, Santa’s sleigh. Adorably, the screen filled with drifting snowflakes as I positioned Santa on the runway at Seatac for takeoff. I hope he made it back to the North Pole before omicron came to town.&lt;/p&gt;
