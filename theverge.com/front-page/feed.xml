    <title>God of War’s Kratos is now available in Fortnite</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ecGJ7g"&gt;After a not-so-subtle tease from Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22102623/god-of-wars-kratos-fortnite-skin-rumor-leak-playstation-5"&gt;on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; protagonist Kratos is &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/kratos-joins-the-hunt-in-fortnite-chapter-2-season-5?sessionInvalidated=true"&gt;now available&lt;/a&gt; as a purchasable skin in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Although Kratos is a Sony character, he’s not exclusive to PS4 or PS5 platforms — you’ll be able to buy the Kratos skin on any platform where &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; can be played, and players on all platforms will be able to see Kratos in-game, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-maker Epic Games tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9VWJA"&gt;We should note that there is one PlayStation-exclusive thing about Kratos, though — if you play a match as Kratos on PlayStation 5, you’ll unlock the Armored Kratos Style:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uNMMPY"&gt;For 2,200 V-Bucks, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; in-game currency, you get the Kratos skin, a glider, a Mimir back bling, and the Leviathan Axe pickaxe (which comes with an emote). You can also buy the skin and the back bling as a bundle for 1,500 V-Bucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BHotk"&gt;Sony and Epic Games put together &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1334648614791094274"&gt;a short trailer&lt;/a&gt; to help hype up Kratos’ debut:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YynUTW"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“The best hunters across all realities,” you say?

&lt;p id="7YVGLf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; newest season just launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, and it features hunters from different realities as collectible skins you can earn from the game’s seasonal battle pass (including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22028767/the-mandalorian-fortnite-perfect-character-season-5"&gt;the Mandalorian&lt;/a&gt; and his constant companion Grogu, aka Baby Yoda). Kratos is a fitting addition to the lineup, though he may not be the only video game crossover we see this season — rumors point to Microsoft icon Master Chief &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/3/22150252/fortnite-halo-infinite-master-chief-leak-microsoft-xbox"&gt;possibly joining the game&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Looking Glass Portrait is a cheaper holographic window to your smartphone photos and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_DqsrUPEy2IhKKX4J0uLCPZoe4w=/157x0:1267x740/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68452439/Screen_Shot_2020_12_03_at_10.54.38_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Looking Glass Factory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4PqgQl"&gt;Looking Glass Factory, a company that designs &lt;a href="https://lookingglassfactory.com/"&gt;personal holographic displays&lt;/a&gt;, just launched a Kickstarter for its new &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lookingglass/looking-glass-portrait/description"&gt;Looking Glass Portrait&lt;/a&gt;, a smaller, more affordable take on its previous light field display. The new Looking Glass can operate as a standalone device, and in a clever move, supports portrait mode photos from smartphones like the iPhone for creating simple holograms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="RlrXR6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0n5PjF"&gt;The Looking Glass Portrait displays holographic photos, videos and 3D models in a 58 degree viewing cone, which basically amounts to the experience of a 3D video or hologram, but viewable by multiple people without the need for special glasses. Holographic light field tech isn’t new, particularly in smaller sizes like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/8/16272838/red-hydrogen-one-holographic-display-leia"&gt;a cellphone screen&lt;/a&gt;. Where Looking Glass Portrait differs from other displays, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/15/21518679/sony-spacial-reality-display-hands-on-holographic-elf-sr1"&gt;Sony’s $3,000 Spatial Reality Display&lt;/a&gt;, is with a much lower price point of $349 (without promotional Kickstarter pricing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XY8Nbf"&gt;Looking Glass Factory says its specific display uses a proprietary combination of light field and volumetric display technologies, meaning the display is both refracting light through glass and projecting it to multiple parts of the screen simultaneously to trick your brain into seeing a 3D image. The Looking Glass Portrait projects 45 to 100 different “views” of 3D scenes to create its holograms, which is great for more detailed captures from light field photography, but for less detailed methods like an iPhone portrait, the results aren’t as impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v-GXU84QB5WwZY8k9c8PccFFRoM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142499/fc26246bd878e7789d04f42cc0d4345c_original.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of a camera rail enabling holographic capture with a normal camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1ihArr"&gt;The Looking Glass Portrait has a 7.9 inch display at an undisclosed resolution, with HDMI, USB-C, and 3.5 stereo audio jack ports for getting media on and off the device. It’s a more compact and streamlined design than the previous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/7/24/17607136/the-looking-glass-holographic-display-hologram-3d-image-kickstarter"&gt;$600 and $3,000 Looking Glass displays&lt;/a&gt; we covered in 2018, and notably vertically-oriented where the old model was horizontal. The display needs to be plugged in to a power source, but has a built-in Raspberry Pi 4 for standalone use. With the company’s Holographic Studio software you can also upload your own photos, videos and 3D models to the device. Outside of just photos and videos, the Portrait can also be connected to Microsoft’s Azure Kinect, Intel’s RealSense or a Leap Motion Controller for tinkering with slightly more interactive holograms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aeX2OZJ_n1MI-Q0ZLLq0o9ssOQ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141775/intreactive_looking_glass.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Looking Glass Factory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of an interactive hologram using the Leap Motion Controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bpuxQA"&gt;Looking Glass Factory makes the Portrait seem like a device for anyone. Depth mapped photos have only gotten easier to capture and the new lower price feels a lot more approachable for a non-enthusiast. But I have to wonder what using the device is like long-term. Much like trying to find 3D videos for a 3D TV, there’s no single source that’s consistently putting out holographic content. Maybe tossing up holograms of your kids is enough of a novelty, but with the cooler integrations that the Portrait allows, I’d want reassurance there’d be new content for it over time. Looking Glass Factory has cultivated a community &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/ZW87Y4m"&gt;on Discord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://forum.lookingglassfactory.com/"&gt;its forums&lt;/a&gt;, but how much content shared there will actually be of interest remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bt2bMX"&gt;The Looking Glass Portrait is &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lookingglass/looking-glass-portrait/description"&gt;available to back on Kickstarter today&lt;/a&gt;, December 3rd, for an Early Bird price of $199, with the display shifting to $249 for the remainder of the campaign tomorrow.  Early Bird orders are expected to be fulfilled in March 2021, with normal campaign orders following in April. The final retail price will be $349.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hackers are targeting the COVID-19 vaccine supply chain, IBM finds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/762wgZR1-UI5_IUsvrubIRn05aI=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68452340/akrales_160205_0929_A_0016.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amelia Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yykb4S"&gt;A global phishing campaign has been targeting organizations associated with the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines since September 2020, IBM security researchers say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcuJJT"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://securityintelligence.com/posts/ibm-uncovers-global-phishing-covid-19-vaccine-cold-chain/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, analysts Claire Zaboeva and Melissa Frydrych of IBM X-Force IRIS announced that the phishing campaign spans six regions: Germany, Italy, South Korea, Czech Republic, greater Europe, and Taiwan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLQMdT"&gt;The campaign appears to be focused on the “cold chain,” the segment of the vaccine supply chain that keeps doses cold during their storage and transportation. Some vaccines need to stay at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537171/temperature-sensors-covid-vaccine-cold-chain"&gt;extremely low temperatures&lt;/a&gt; in order to remain potent. Pfizer, for example, recommends that their COVID-19 vaccine be stored at negative 70 degrees Celsius (&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/11/17/935563377/why-does-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-need-to-be-kept-colder-than-antarctica"&gt;colder than winter in Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;). That poses a logistical challenge for the pharmaceutical company, which will need to transport millions upon millions of doses around the world at that temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmIPWo"&gt;The attacks focused on groups associated with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/27/12294726/gavi-alliance-vaccine-immunization-bill-gates-startup"&gt;Gavi,&lt;/a&gt; an international organization that promotes vaccine access and distribution. Specifically, it targeted organizations related to their Cold Chain Equipment Optimization Platform (CCEOP), which aims to distribute and improve technology that can keep vaccines at very cold temperatures. These included the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union, as well as “organizations within the energy, manufacturing, website creation and software and internet security solutions sectors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gG9G5Y"&gt;Per the blog post, the people behind the phishing operation sent emails to the organizations’ executives claiming to be an executive from CCEOP supplier Haier Biomedical. The emails, which purported to request quotations related to CCEOP, contained HTML attachments which asked for the opener’s credentials, which the actor could store and use to gain unauthorized access down the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zn35RQ"&gt;“We assess that the purpose of this COVID-19 phishing campaign may have been to harvest credentials, possibly to gain future unauthorized access to corporate networks and sensitive information relating to the COVID-19 vaccine distribution,” reads the blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84GreJ"&gt;It’s not yet clear who’s behind this campaign, but the researchers suspect a nation-state actor rather than a private individual or group. “Without a clear path to a cash-out, cyber criminals are unlikely to devote the time and resources required to execute such a calculated operation with so many interlinked and globally distributed targets,” the blog post reads. “Advanced insight into the purchase and movement of a vaccine that can impact life and the global economy is likely a high-value and high-priority nation-state target.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mYSyqo"&gt;IBM recommends that companies involved in COVID-19 vaccine storage and transport “be vigilant and remain on high alert during this time.” The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued an &lt;a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2020/12/03/ibm-releases-report-cyber-actors-targeting-covid-19-vaccine-supply"&gt;alert&lt;/a&gt; encouraging the organizations to review IBM’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISlahe"&gt;COVID-19 vaccine research and development has been a target of multiple cyberattacks this year. The US government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257341/us-government-coronavirus-vaccine-china-theft-spy-accuses-fbi-cisa"&gt;accused China&lt;/a&gt; of funding and operating hacking cells to steal vaccine research from the US and its allies in May, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332864/us-justice-department-li-xiaoyu-dong-jiazhi-chinese-state-hacking-charges-coronavirus"&gt;charged two Chinese hackers&lt;/a&gt; with stealing data from firms working on COVID-19 treatments and vaccines in July. US, UK, and Canadian authorities &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327021/russia-hackers-covid19-coronavirus-vaccine-attacks-uk-us-canada"&gt;denounced attacks from a group associated with Russian intelligence services&lt;/a&gt; on organizations involved in vaccine development this summer. In November, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/11/13/health-care-cyberattacks-covid-19-paris-peace-forum/"&gt;detected cyberattacks&lt;/a&gt; from nation-state actors in Russia and North Korea on companies with COVID-19 vaccines in various stages of clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tYeQd"&gt;Multiple companies have submitted COVID-19 vaccines for review to the Food and Drug Administration, including Pfizer / BioNTech and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726554/moderna-covid-vaccine-fda-pfizer-biontech"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;. The FDA’s vaccine advisory community will review the applications in mid-December; if the vaccines are authorized, distribution will begin shortly after. Moderna expects to have up to 20 million doses of its vaccine by the end of 2020, while Pfizer could provide up to 25 million.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Wristcam is a camera for your Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IuTbS44N7kROPw6hfrzfa3bvias=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68451810/WristcamRose_woLogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Wristcam&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZTlcrQ"&gt;A strap for an Apple Watch equipped with front- and rear-facing cameras is finally launching after nearly four years in development. The Wristcam has an 8-megapixel camera that can shoot 1080p video and take stills in 4K resolution and a 2-megapixel camera for selfies. The company says you’ll also be able to use it as a video walkie-talkie with real-time live-streaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5Zrfb"&gt;Those might be serviceable cameras, but they’re not likely to replace your iPhone camera. The company sent over a sample of images shot by the Wristcam, which are pretty decent, if a bit underwhelming in the details.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u4dDftbfwDX0_kSlVCBo3NQRkog=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142248/Shot_with_Wristcam___10.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mDfrgZ_xwQVPAlNyzG3bEmzh4eE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142409/Shot_with_Wristcam___5.jpg"&gt;

You can take images and video just by pressing a button on the band, and it will sync them to your iPhone automatically when you drop it on its magnetically attached charging cable at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vBcC7n"&gt;The device has 8GB of memory for photo and video storage. The camera connects with the Watch via &lt;a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/bluetooth-technology/radio-versions/"&gt;Bluetooth Low Energy&lt;/a&gt; (BLE) and with the iPhone via Bluetooth 4.2, 5.0, and Wi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wristcam comes with two cameras and works independently of the iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p id="ff2The"&gt;The Wristcam band weighs 23 grams, about &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Feshop.macsales.com%2Fblog%2F29063-spreadsheet-makes-sense-of-price-and-weight-of-all-apple-watch-combos%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DThe%2520Classic%2520Buckle%2520Apple%2520Watch%2Cas%2520much%2520at%2520125%2520grams.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F3%2F22150955%2Fapple-watch-camera-wristcam-crowdfunding#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;half the weight&lt;/a&gt; of the lightest Apple Watch, and comes in interchangeable colors, including noir, blanc, gray, rose, and sage. Both cameras have LEDs that light up when a photo or video is being shot, so it’s clear when the device is in photo-taking mode. It’s controlled by one multifunctional button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXrU6T"&gt;According to CEO Ari Roisman, the Wristcam can take up to 20 seconds to share a photo directly from the Watch over Bluetooth but will sync directly with a connected iPhone. The ability to share photos directly from the Watch won’t be available at launch but in a future update, Roisman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xw4SJDG3cJ2iWZXUQdeAtf2sj08=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142272/WristcamFinalHero_woLogo.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wristcam&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ljdyEn"&gt;Roisman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the company is focused on shipping units to customers who supported the original &lt;a href="https://support.getcmra.com/hc/en-us/articles/212770625-What-is-the-CMRA-Pre-order-Campaign-"&gt;crowdfunding campaign&lt;/a&gt;, which pre-sold 10,000 units. The lengthy delay stemmed from design challenges, Roisman said, but customers who have stuck with the company should receive their Wristcams by the holidays. Since it’s been four years, the company said it offered refunds to any of the original crowdfunders who wanted their money back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVZ5nw"&gt;The Wristcam is taking direct reservations from customers &lt;a href="https://www.wristcam.com/"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt; for $299. The first direct-to-customer units will ship in March 2021, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Podcasts now supports private RSS feeds so you can listen to the shows you pay to access</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YFPMbeQckkWcQe49mVMAz4Qhc0U=/0x0:820x547/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68451718/googlepodcasts_rss_feed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google Podcasts&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bzA9VP"&gt;Google Podcasts is finally getting a feature that’s already standard across most listening apps: private RSS feed support. The head of product for Google Podcasts, Zack Reneau-Wedeen, made the announcement &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZackRW/status/1334590407850696705"&gt;on Twitter today&lt;/a&gt; and shouted out some networks that are especially reliant on private feeds, including Patreon, Slate, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/29/18522031/redcircle-podcast-service-hosting-analytics-cross-promotion"&gt;Red Circle&lt;/a&gt;, and Supercast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jD29G"&gt;To access the feature, tap over to the activity tab in the bottom right-hand corner and slide over to the Subscriptions tab, then tap the plus symbol. You’ll then be prompted to add by RSS feed. You can see the entire process below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NDZOis"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Important milestone in our mission to help creators grow their audience and build sustainable businesses — in whichever ways work best for them!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Add your own RSS feed on Google Podcasts here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Koiqsx2Iex"&gt;https://t.co/Koiqsx2Iex&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/RzcVTrt1EB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RzcVTrt1EB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Gabe Bender (@GabeBender) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GabeBender/status/1334593474688126979?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EchEw2"&gt;This is a relatively standard feature that’s helped prop up the podcasting business for creators. On Patreon, for example, members often pay for access to a subscribers-only feed. To access that content, the creator sends them a private RSS feed they then can insert into their favorite listening app to retrieve the audio. It’s a useful thing to support both for creators and listeners, so it’s not surprising Google would build this in. In fact, it’s been a long time coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yodYi5"&gt;Still, not every app supports the feature, including, most notably, Spotify. But if Google Podcasts, and even Spotify, wants to become the places where people consume all of their audio, they have to support private RSS feeds, at least for the time being because it’s how creators get their shows out to fans while still getting paid.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leak left 243 million Brazilians’ medical records and personal info ripe for the picking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u-jwl-DP5TSKANdnUejLGLIBN7o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68451505/acastro_170621_1777_0006_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BEbABR"&gt;The personal information of more than 243 million Brazilians was potentially accessible for at least six months thanks to weakly encoded credentials kept in the source code of the Brazilian Ministry of Health’s website (&lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/data-of-243-million-brazilians-exposed-online-via-website-source-code/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The security issue was first reported by &lt;a href="https://saude.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,nova-falha-do-ministerio-da-saude-expoe-dados-pessoais-de-mais-de-200-milhoes,70003536340"&gt;Brazilian publication &lt;em&gt;Estadão&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6knfqU"&gt;The personal data of anyone who had registered with Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS), Brazil’s national health system, could be viewed. That data included people’s full names, addresses, and telephone numbers, reported &lt;em&gt;Estadão.&lt;/em&gt; The database also includes records of living and dead people as the population of Brazil was more than 211 million in 2019, &lt;a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=BR"&gt;according to The World Bank&lt;/a&gt;, which is about 32 million fewer people than the reported number of records that were potentially accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjAYPZ"&gt;The Ministry of Health’s website stored the encoded access credentials to the database of personal information in its source code, reports &lt;em&gt;Estadão&lt;/em&gt;. However, the login and password were encoded using Base64, a method that can be easily decoded. Given that you can look at any website’s source code with a keyboard shortcut or by accessing it in a menu, potentially anyone could have found these encrypted credentials and, if they were savvy enough, decoded them to then access the personal records of Brazilians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9qJJu"&gt;Health records can be &lt;a href="https://www.securelink.com/blog/healthcare-data-new-prize-hackers/"&gt;quite valuable&lt;/a&gt; on the black market given the amount of personal information they often include. If a bad actor knew of this vulnerability, it’s very possible they could have taken this data to use for their own nefarious purposes or to sell later. The Ministry of Health has corrected the problem, according to &lt;em&gt;Estadão&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Justice Department is suing Facebook for side-stepping visa rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Munich Security Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xbjoXY6CzUei_fdRTPNOsNA7ksI=/0x13:5064x3389/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68451375/1200868249.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sven Hoppe/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qckWVB"&gt;The Justice Department has &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-lawsuit-against-facebook-discriminating-against-us-workers"&gt;filed charges against Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly discriminating against US workers in its hiring practices. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142257/united_states_v._facebook_complaint_0.pdf"&gt;The complaint&lt;/a&gt;, filed on Thursday, alleges that the company maintained a separate job listing process for visa-eligible job postings, both limiting the visibility of the job listing online and insisting that job seekers submit their applications by mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqgLyU"&gt;According to the Justice Department, the result was a systematic effort to discourage US workers from applying for an entire class of jobs at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkYuhJ"&gt;“Facebook’s discriminatory recruitment and hiring practice is routine, ongoing, and widespread,” the complaint reads. “It discriminates against U.S. workers because of their immigration or citizenship status, and it harms them by limiting their ability to apply, to be considered, and to be hired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="khY3Q5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook’s discriminatory recruitment and hiring practice is routine, ongoing, and widespread”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YcoPQs"&gt;In simple terms, prosecutors believe Facebook was hiding job listings reserved for visa-bound workers that the company had already contacted and knew it wanted to hire. But in its rush to clear the lane for its preferred applicant, the company allegedly violated important labor rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t7tPFt"&gt;The Justice Department’s case focuses on permanent labor certifications at Facebook, which enable visa holders to work in the United States indefinitely (as opposed to guest worker visas like the H-1B that must be renewed every few years). US law &lt;a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs/permanent"&gt;requires an extensive process&lt;/a&gt; for permanent labor certification and approves applications only after a company attests that it could not find a qualified US worker for the position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21lqAe"&gt;But when a guest worker at Facebook expressed interest in a permanent position, the complaint alleges, “Facebook diverged from its normal recruiting protocols by not advertising the position on its external website, &lt;a href="http://Facebook.com/careers"&gt;Facebook.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;, by not accepting online applications, and by requiring interested applicants to apply to the position by mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyIhGe"&gt;In one particularly strange note, the complaint notes that visa-linked job openings were listed in the print version of the &lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; but not the paper’s website, even though the Chronicle offers free online listing for every ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MZMv2"&gt;Prosecutors say the double standard has been in place since at least the beginning of 2018 and has yet to be remedied. Facebook received more than 2,600 permanent labor certifications for its employees during the named period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqjikT"&gt;Reached for comment, Facebook said it was cooperating with the Department of Justice but disagreed with its findings. “Facebook has been cooperating with the DOJ in its review of this issue,” a representative said, “and while we dispute the allegations in the complaint, we cannot comment further on pending litigation.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is stepping up moderation against anti-Black hate speech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PbEyqbqTDfUku3NgAfdILf2MIF8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68451258/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i3me8N"&gt;Facebook has started weighting anti-Black hate speech on its platform as higher priority than hate speech directed at white people, men, and Americans in an effort to address the disproportionate effects such speech has on minority groups, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1id5x"&gt;The result is that Facebook’s automated moderation systems for detecting and taking action against hate speech should now more proactively scan the site for such racist content. Meanwhile, more innocuous forms of hate speech, like those directed at white people or men in general, are deemed lower priority and left alone unless a user reports them. Facebook has internally deemed this approach “WOW,” or “worst of the worst” for the types of behaviors it now wants to focus its resources on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2jJco"&gt;The effort is part of a new hate speech project within Facebook, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/03/facebook-hate-speech/"&gt;first reported earlier today by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that aims to address years of inaction regarding racial discrimination on the platform. Activists, civil rights advocates, and researchers of the platform have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/10/21318718/facebook-civil-rights-audit-critique-size-congress"&gt;long accused Facebook of abetting hate speech&lt;/a&gt; and operating a moderation system that doesn’t take into account real-world effects of bias and the way racism disproportionately affects minorities. Only in July of this year did Facebook say it would begin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21333405/facebook-instagram-racial-bias-equity-team-formed-ai-algorithms"&gt;studying racial bias in its algorithms&lt;/a&gt;, after executives spent years resisting doing so by forming new research-focused equity teams for its main app and Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jUJiKi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We know that hate speech targeted towards underrepresented groups can be the most harmful.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1wFhZt"&gt;Now, the company says it’s taking steps to ensure it moderates its platform to help the most vulnerable victims of hate speech and abuse — instead of treating the problem as one that affects everyone in equal measure. The new moderation changes aren’t just aimed at helping root out anti-Black hate speech, but also hate speech directed toward Muslims, Jewish people, and members of the LGBTQ+ community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSehH8"&gt;“We know that hate speech targeted towards underrepresented groups can be the most harmful, which is why we have focused our technology on finding the hate speech that users and experts tell us is the most serious,” says Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokesperson, in a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XorUEw"&gt;“Over the past year, we’ve also updated our policies to catch more implicit hate speech, such as content depicting Blackface, stereotypes about Jewish people controlling the world, and banned holocaust denial,” Aldous adds. “Thanks to significant investments in our technology we proactively detect 95 percent of the content we remove and we continue to improve how we enforce our rules as hate speech evolves over time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNrjmG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People are putting their routers in jail to protect themselves from harmless Wi-Fi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fN9xrBVL1WdSwlUcBkrP6l0ACq4=/0x71:1860x1311/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68451248/Screen_Shot_2020_12_03_at_3.37.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KDdXDD"&gt;Please do not put your internet router in a Faraday cage. Please do not put your internet router in a Faraday cage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZcUIg"&gt;If you’re reading this, as someone who uses the internet, this may seem obvious. A Faraday cage, after all, blocks electromagnetic radiation and signals from escaping. Putting one around your router would, by very similar physics, prevent those same radio waves that &lt;em&gt;carry your internet &lt;/em&gt;from reaching your devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OcnGxT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So apparently putting Faraday cages around routers has become a thing for the 5g conspiracy nuts and there are companies out there ready to cash in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My sides are in orbit. &lt;a href="https://t.co/mGcud5Kb70"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mGcud5Kb70&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;—  Ansgar Odinson  (@AnsgarTOdinson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnsgarTOdinson/status/1334015546979803137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OrIa5V"&gt;And yet, an entire cottage industry of con artists looking to make a quick buck by selling “router shields” that claim to fix the issue and protect you and your loved ones from your Wi-Fi has popped up this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqCjER"&gt;The grift is a clever one — the Faraday cages are being sold at fairly ridiculous prices for metal boxes (typically between $70 to $100 on Amazon), meaning that sellers are likely making a considerable profit here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlX4Y"&gt;And the products themselves, while based entirely in conspiracy, aren’t entirely lying, unless it’s about their claims that these boxes “should not at all affect signal range and internet speed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHANZk"&gt;Putting what effectively amounts to a Faraday cage around your router to block electromagnetic radiation will do exactly that. It’ll block almost all the signal from your router, as any number of the amusing Amazon reviewers complaining about degraded signal strength and internet speeds have learned:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FyhzMUhp7awMcJnOtlEYSwTRmJA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142174/Screen_Shot_2020_12_03_at_3.11.25_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B23LyZ"&gt;Equally ironic are reviews complaining that the shields aren’t working at all and that their internet is working just fine:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u2Gd58mEet420OGFklA2okf8b3w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142111/Screen_Shot_2020_12_03_at_9.21.00_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dwISc3"&gt;That’s likely due to poorly designed cages — some of them appear to simply be overpriced &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DecoBros-Cabinet-Basket-Organizer-Silver/dp/B00COC66A0/ref=sr_1_35?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=mesh+storage+container&amp;amp;qid=1607026454&amp;amp;sr=8-35&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;mesh storage boxes&lt;/a&gt;. (Also amusing are the sellers concerned about cheaper “counterfeit” copies of their shields, who have taken to boasting about their “original” designs or US origins to appeal to buyers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RsXCbx"&gt;The conspiracy has been going on for some time, with some Amazon listings that date back years, but catapulted to the spotlight this week after a viral tweet from Twitter user &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnsgarTOdinson/status/1334015546979803137"&gt;@AnsgarTOdinson&lt;/a&gt;. Recent (and equally nonsensical) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21276912/5g-conspiracy-theories-coronavirus-uk-telecoms-engineers-attacks-abuse"&gt;conspiracies about 5G cellular networks&lt;/a&gt; — which operate using similar swaths of the electromagnetic spectrum as Wi-Fi routers — also likely helped contribute to the spread of the conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vw6emr"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Everything you need to know about 5G|70098" data-volume-uuid="9c3b53f77" data-volume-id="70098" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-916" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BEEvbr"&gt;All of this is completely beside the point: routers &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; emit harmful electromagnetic radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKMaZ2"&gt;As we’ve written many times here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, nearly all wireless technology — be it AM / FM radio, cellphone networks for calling, LTE, 5G, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and even the IR remote you use to turn on your television — is based on transmitting and receiving signals broadcast on some part of the electromagnetic spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZJkkD"&gt;When we talk about “electromagnetic radiation,” we’re just describing a wave of photons traveling through space. Even light — what you use to see — is a form of electromagnetic radiation, and a harmless one at that (despite having a far higher frequency than any radio or microwaves used for cellular or internet). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="a7VksH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G coronavirus conspiracy theorists are endangering the workers who keep networks running","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21276912/5g-conspiracy-theories-coronavirus-uk-telecoms-engineers-attacks-abuse"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EWgoZe"&gt;Wi-Fi — and 5G internet and all those aforementioned forms of wireless communication — all are fundamentally similar in how they work and are a form of what’s called non-ionizing radiation. Non-ionizing means that it doesn’t have enough energy to move any electrons from atoms and degrade cells, which is the kind of danger that you probably think of when the word “radiation” comes to mind. But it’s just not physically possible for your internet router to do that, and your router is no more of a danger to you than a TV remote or your car’s radio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fN0lg5"&gt;Look, I get it. “Radiation” is a scary word, and the idea that your internet router is sending out invisible, harmful energy could be concerning, if it were remotely true. But fortunately, based on all the current scientific evidence (as described by the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/cell-phones/do-cell-phones-pose-health-hazard"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/cellular-phones.html"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;), that “danger” just isn’t there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SlgjwG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Does phone radiation give you cancer?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/18/16751954/phone-radiation-cancer-link-studies"},{"title":"Cellphone radiation poses no real harm to humans, new research says","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/2/16966578/cellphone-radiation-cancer-national-toxicology-program-study-rats-mice"},{"title":"Cellphone radiation may never stop scaring people, no matter what","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/5/17202600/cell-phone-radiation-cancer-national-toxicology-program-wireless-health-effect-fears"},{"title":"The FCC says 5G is safe, again","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20793813/5g-fcc-safe-airwaves-rf-emission-standards"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="udMlqB"&gt;Of course, there is a tragedy inherent in debunking this router conspiracy: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is a website, and anyone using one of these router shields may not be able to access the internet to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Developers can now sign up for Apple’s reduced 15 percent App Store cut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oWPPg9"&gt;Apple has opened enrollment in its new small business program that will allow eligible app developers to receive 15 percent more from App Store sales, the company &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6lyxewwp"&gt;announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Apple says “the vast majority of developers on the App Store who sell digital goods and services are eligible” and all developers need to do to qualify is complete the company’s enrollment form &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QG4Pw"&gt;Apple announced the new program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, marking a significant change in how the App Store is structured. Under the new terms of the program, eligible developers making under $1 million per year in App Store sales and in-app purchase revenue are eligible for the reduced commission rate of 15 percent for the following year. Apple typically takes 30 percent of all App Store revenue on digital items as per its longstanding policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpZWkP"&gt;Although Apple has never released specific figures regarding how much developers earn per year or how much the App Store grosses, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/apple-app-store-had-estimated-gross-sales-of-50-billion-in-2019.html#:~:text=Apple's%20App%20Store%20platform%20grossed,Store%20alone%20would%20be%20no."&gt;analysts estimate&lt;/a&gt; the App Store is responsible for more than $50 billion in sales in 2019, while analytics firm Sensor Tower estimates about 98 percent of developers are responsible for just 5 percent of that amount and would qualify for the new program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3WsDTM"&gt;Here, in Apple’s words, are the basics as outlined by &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/"&gt;its new FAQ&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uE8Opq"&gt;Existing developers who made up to 1 million USD in proceeds in 2020 for all their apps, as well as developers new to the App Store, can qualify for the program and the reduced commission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wcYOuQ"&gt;If a participating developer surpasses the 1 million USD threshold, the standard commission rate will apply for the remainder of the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t7MsLL"&gt;If a developer’s proceeds fall below the 1 million USD threshold in a future calendar year, they can re-qualify for the 15% commission the year after.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="p7ov6D"&gt;Developers must identify any Associated Developer Accounts to determine proceeds eligibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0swbGW"&gt;Apple has set a deadline of December 18th, 2020 at 10AM PT / 1PM ET for submitting enrollment, with a January 1st, 2021 start date for when the proceeds adjustment takes effect. The FAQ states that if a developer applies after the deadline, they must wait until 15 days after they are approved to see the reduced commission rates, and approval may not happen until well into spring of next year. If you’re a new developer with no proceeds, you can submit enrollment to the program and see the reduced App Store rate immediately upon approval if your app is then live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlqdsL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
