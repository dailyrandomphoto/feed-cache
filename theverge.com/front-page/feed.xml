    <title>How to shrink greenhouse gas emissions from your next flight</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nUJVnJ"&gt;One way jet-setters can cut down on climate pollution from aviation is to choose more fuel-efficient itineraries — if they can figure out which flights pollute least. A passenger on a more fuel-efficient itinerary might generate 63 percent &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; carbon dioxide pollution on average than a passenger traveling to and from the same locations on a less efficient itinerary, a &lt;a href="https://theicct.org/publications/itinerary-aviation-emissions-jul2021"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="eBchyQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cheaper flights tend to be more fuel-efficient&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wZwlCc"&gt;There’s even more good news for consumers concerned about climate change: cheaper flights tend to be more fuel-efficient and thus less polluting. Itineraries among the cheapest 25 percentile of plane fares actually cut passengers’ emissions by about 55 percent compared to the most polluting itineraries, the report found. It’s possible airlines are passing on savings from the fuel efficiency of newer or more densely packed planes to their customers, the report posits. Its findings are based on an analysis of estimated emissions from 20 popular domestic routes in the US in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Emissions per passenger on each analyzed route.&amp;amp;nbsp;" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r-njX4tH34zv4mTpHU5gx7-GnLA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22732755/image001__3_.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Source: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://theicct.org/publications/itinerary-aviation-emissions-jul2021" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variation in aviation emissions by itinerary: The case for emissions disclosure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IBqtp3"&gt;But for passengers to make informed decisions, airlines will need to divulge how much pollution each of their flights creates, and that information isn’t widely available yet. There’s a push from advocates to mandate that disclosure — kind of like policies in some places that require restaurants to tell customers how many calories are in each of their dishes. The researchers estimated emissions based on how much fuel was likely burned for each itinerary. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Xinyi Sola Zheng, one of the authors of the new report by the nonprofit International Council on Clean Transportation. Zheng shared some tips for finding the most efficient flight paths and other strategies for cleaning up skies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxl6XG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gHSqw0"&gt;More people are starting to fly again as pandemic restrictions loosen. What can they learn from your study about the emissions from their flights?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wSCMLr"&gt;If you are to look for lower-emitting flights without knowing the exact emissions, which is what this study is ultimately advocating for, you can follow some more general rules like flying direct and flying on a newer aircraft. Usually, when you have a layover, your routing is less efficient. You’re going on a slight detour or a big detour depending on where this layover is.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="npMMv4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When you have a layover, your routing is less efficient.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gvPN7J"&gt;You can usually see the type of aircraft that a specific flight uses when you book a flight nowadays. The newest would be like an A320neo and Boeing’s 787. That newest generation aircraft are, in most cases, more efficient and lower-emitting than other alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUPbCf"&gt;But as we discuss in the paper, that’s not always the case. So ideally, we still want the actual emissions data. Before that happens, consumers can try to rely on more generalized rules. And if they’re more flexible with their destination or if they’re going to somewhere that’s not too far, then maybe consider a trip using rail or car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LfvA7T"&gt;Paying to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/tips/questions-about-carbon-offsets-flights-answered/"&gt;offset emissions&lt;/a&gt; from flights seems to be popular with consumers and airlines now. How does choosing a more efficient flight compare to buying offsets?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YvrC01"&gt;There are almost no aviation sector offsets available. So whenever you’re paying for offsets for flights, you are paying for the emissions reductions happening in other sectors. Yes, they help reduce emissions in the grand scheme of things, but it’s not asking the aviation industry to claim its own pollution. They’re just ultimately outsourcing their problems to other industries if everyone just continues to fly and fly often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="DFLpXn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The quality of offsets and then the price of offsets all vary.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TxD7GQ"&gt;The quality of offsets and then the price of offsets all vary. Currently, the offset prices don’t really represent the actual social cost of carbon emissions. Some of the projects, they &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-climate-solution-actually-adding-millions-of-tons-of-co2-into-the-atmosphere"&gt;might not actually reduce emissions&lt;/a&gt;. It’s widely known in the environmental community that &lt;a href="https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work-deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/"&gt;offsets are pretty concerning in terms of their quality&lt;/a&gt;. For consumers, it is important to think about, like, if you’re already trying to reduce your carbon footprint — try to do it right. We should try to push for decarbonization within aviation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oE8XM"&gt;Trying to choose a lower-emitting itinerary, even if it costs a little bit more, I think that’s a little more real and more tangible choice to make if you’re trying to make an impact. And as the study already shows, normally, you can find a lower-emitting option without paying more or without paying a whole lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SgRs3j"&gt;There’s been a lot of focus on “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20872267/flight-shame-nyc-united-nations-climate-change-environmental-costs"&gt;flight shame&lt;/a&gt;,” holding individuals responsible for greenhouse gas emissions from their flights. But what about the airlines themselves? What responsibility do they have when it comes to their emissions? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="acyXSd"&gt;So I do think we’re seeing airlines and aircraft manufacturers increasingly recognizing the pressure from the public. That’s why we’re seeing a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137782/delta-carbon-neutral-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-change-airlines"&gt;announcements for net-zero&lt;/a&gt; greenhouse gas emissions targets and for investments in alternative fuels. Those are trends, but what I think is more important is the actual action that they take under these commitments. It is important for them to invest in technologies that are still in their early stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GZyqsM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“As the aircraft grows older, its fuel efficiency also deteriorates.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YFSU70"&gt;But at the same time, there is a lot of potential around fuel efficiency. Ideally, airlines should all think about their fleet renewal plans and try to retire older planes a little bit earlier and purchase some of the newer aircraft to refresh their fleet. As the aircraft grows older, its fuel efficiency also deteriorates. During COVID, especially last year because of the traffic downturn, a lot of airlines already saw an opportunity to restructure their fleets. They retired a lot of aircraft earlier because of reduced demand. That’s a good thing from the environmental perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T6r01O"&gt;And if airlines begin disclosing the emissions for their flights, what impact could that have?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aj2UoZ"&gt;We hope people will be more aware of their carbon emissions associated with flying. Ultimately, we’re hoping that the consumers are voting for lower-emitting flights and technologies with their dollars. One person’s choice is not going to affect the entire operation, but a lot of people’s choices will be a very big incentive to airlines. It comes down to consumer preferences as an incentive or an influencing force to the market so that there is a signal to airlines that there is demand for lower-emitting options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Obxrf"&gt;I think the airlines have more or less heard of the idea of emissions disclosure. Everyone’s sort of waiting to see if this is going to become a regulation or if at some point everyone is going to do it. This study is sort of a primer for showing what kind of information consumers would be getting if emissions disclosure becomes a real thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWmCSt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhhA4Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It sure looks like Google’s second-gen Pixel Buds are being discontinued in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MJDct29LOwIszLT-xiq7VTiBVE0=/0x0:1461x974/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69616248/msedge_g74lerYETh.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The buy button for the Pixel Buds has disappeared from the US store.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: store.google.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bYaEWn"&gt;We’re not saying they’ve been discontinued, but if you head over to Google’s online store in the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/magazine/pixel_buds_compare"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/ca/magazine/pixel_buds_compare"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll find that there doesn’t seem to be any option to buy its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21400695/google-pixel-buds-2-2020-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;second-generation true wireless Pixel Buds&lt;/a&gt;. Its more recent &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fgoogle-pixel-buds%2Fclearly-white%2Fp5085090%3Firclickid%3D30y0-83Z5xyLRMDwUx0Mo3EtUkBy9MU5H0cn3c0%26irgwc%3D1%26tmcampid%3D99%26s_afcid%3Daf_1236178&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F22%2F22588420%2Fgoogle-pixel-buds-2nd-second-generation-discontinued-us-canada" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel Buds A-Series&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_buds_a_series"&gt;still available&lt;/a&gt;, but the dedicated listing for the Pixel Buds themselves has disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J45kgU"&gt;Google won’t officially say whether the second-generation Pixel Buds are reaching the end of their life. What it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; confirm is that they’re “out of stock in the Google Store in the US and Canada at this time” and that it doesn’t have additional stock. “Some third-party retailers may still have inventory available and they remain on sale in other markets as inventory allows,” a spokesperson says. “As inventory allows” definitely makes it sound like the Buds are reaching the end of their life, but as I said, Google is refusing to say the word “discontinued.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rurLBK4d9RFpRgvaiPgRLg_kuRQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22732724/msedge_v42yyqa2ue.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: store.google.com&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The listing for the Pixel Buds no longer appears in the US Google Store’s navigation bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nHDcnm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/19/google-is-done-selling-2020s-premium-pixel-buds/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the buds are still available in Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Sure enough, on the UK Google Store &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds?hl=en-GB"&gt;the Pixel Buds are still available&lt;/a&gt;, though when it comes to third-party retailers, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fgoogle-pixel-buds%2Fclearly-white%2Fp5085090%3Firclickid%3D30y0-83Z5xyLRMDwUx0Mo3EtUkBy9MU5H0cn3c0%26irgwc%3D1%26tmcampid%3D99%26s_afcid%3Daf_1236178&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F22%2F22588420%2Fgoogle-pixel-buds-2nd-second-generation-discontinued-us-canada" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;John Lewis&lt;/a&gt; is listing them as unavailable with a note that it’s “unlikely to receive more stock of this item.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0WPMRL"&gt;Ultimately, those are a lot of signs that the second-gen Pixel Buds are on the way out after around a year of being on sale. But given their average battery life, and persistent reports of connection issues, we can’t say we’re too surprised to see them go. If you’re an existing owner, Google says you’ll “continue to receive ongoing feature support, software fixes, and critical security updates.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter’s new beta TweetDeck is so bad I’m ready to ragequit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xu-E7Rkel_rl5LLAis0y1l3KQFo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69615930/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6jA7NO"&gt;I counted: 31 tweets. That’s how many I could see in my traditional TweetDeck window the other day. But at that same moment, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585249/tweetdeck-redesign-twitter-column-deck"&gt;TweetDeck’s new preview&lt;/a&gt; only showed me 21 tweets — 38 percent less, and that’s with the narrowest columns and the smallest font available, just to be clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmT0vw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/8/2621703/twitter-tweetdeck-html5-app-mac-windows-browser"&gt;For over a decade&lt;/a&gt;, people have sworn by TweetDeck as the power user alternative to the original Twitter app, but what most people really mean is one specific thing:&lt;em&gt; it lets you see more tweets.&lt;/em&gt; TweetDeck lets you see more tweets without needing to scroll. It gives you an entire dashboard of tweets you can throw up on a monitor, unattended. The power of TweetDeck is that it’s &lt;em&gt;glanceable&lt;/em&gt;, a way to passively tap into a firehose of personal interests. That’s why it’s such a powerful tool for the world’s newsrooms, and a tool &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; uses daily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVr0UG"&gt;It’s also why I can’t comprehend how Twitter could have let this new version of TweetDeck into the world, even in beta form. I’m now worried Twitter has forgotten why we use TweetDeck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QjA6fr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10663574"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MtQ6bk"&gt;If you break it down, there are easily half a dozen little culprits, each maybe forgivable on its own:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="SpTCJ5"&gt;There’s a lot of wasted space around tweets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="I00FGf"&gt;Reply, retweet, and like buttons have been spaced out, and take up more room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="idLaFZ"&gt;TweetDeck’s left rail is wider, for no discernible reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JzhvaJ"&gt;Twitter lists inexplicably come with an “overview” at the top, one that leaves an ugly “show overview” button even if you minimize it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kAyYi8"&gt;Tweet previews inside of tweets (i.e. quote tweets) now take up far more vertical space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0XaWj1"&gt;Scroll bars are chunkier now, because they’re browser native unlike the previous custom bars — and on Chrome, they don’t seem to render properly in dark mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="vHtfUk"&gt;Together, these changes add up to a less glanceable TweetDeck, whether you’ve got it up on a dedicated portrait monitor (like me) or not. I’m frustrated my 16:10 monitor can no longer fit four full columns without changing my browser zoom, but it might honestly be worse in landscape: if you follow people who retweet a lot of things, you’ll be lucky to see four at a time in any given column before they slide out of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XFNilR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585249/tweetdeck-redesign-twitter-column-deck"&gt;When Twitter teased the new TweetDeck on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, the kneejerk reaction was that our precious columns might have been done away with for good, due to a teaser image that — to put it mildly — didn’t cater to TweetDeck’s power users. Hours later, Twitter realized its mistake, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TweetDeck/status/1417586151192416257"&gt;tweeting out&lt;/a&gt; “Don’t worry! Your favorite TweetDeck features aren’t going away,” suggesting that columns are alive and well. Twitter’s Eric Zuckerman, who helps the company partner with news publishers, even defended the design by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EricZuck/status/1417531258201063424/photo/1"&gt;tweeting a picture of his own&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YJg3gh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I've been using the new TweetDeck preview for 9 months. If you're a longtime user and thrown off by the image below, rest assured you can customize your columns to look and behave very much like the version you know and love. For example, here's mine: &lt;a href="https://t.co/i9bT1Mkfr8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/i9bT1Mkfr8&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/16dHgdVXAQ"&gt;https://t.co/16dHgdVXAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Zuckerman (@EricZuck) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EricZuck/status/1417531258201063424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZNFQR"&gt;And yet some of Zuckerman’s columns only let you see two large tweets at once. &lt;em&gt;Two&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDDHNr"&gt;The new TweetDeck has some silver linings. I’m happy Twitter’s bringing over its new composer and direct messages box from Twitter.com. It’s nice to have more fine-tuned control over images, for instance, and you might argue that the pop-up messages box saves you having to erect a dedicated column for them (though, for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s private news account, it’s just blocking part of our view). And while I could care less about being able to switch between “decks” filled with columns from a single Twitter account, a la virtual desktops, I’m sure some social media managers are excited.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QbaJFUdIUyDIs9jMoJAjyNSTI_k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22732484/1231_2021_07_21_1231_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new TweetDeck composer has reached parity with Twitter.com, and looks identical.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IL8ZyX"&gt;The new Notifications column is neat too, letting you easily see alerts for particular users and when your tweets have been liked and retweeted, instead of just seeing when you’ve been mentioned. That, plus columns for your own profile, Twitter’s explore tab, events, topics, moments and advanced Boolean search could make TweetDeck a complete alternative to Twitter, instead of occasionally making you swap between the two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYmk0w"&gt;But a few creature comforts aside, I’m not looking for TweetDeck to be more like Twitter.com. Vanilla Twitter already exists, and it’s only a click away. (Or at least, it was until TweetDeck Preview added its own TweetDeck.com URLs for individual tweets, yuck.) I picked TweetDeck because it was &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; efficient, just like I picked a number of third-party Twitter apps back when those were a thing, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/16/17699626/twitter-third-party-apps-streaming-api-deprecation"&gt;before Twitter rate-limited most of them to death&lt;/a&gt; and kept them from properly auto-refreshing tweets as they came in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfzn3j"&gt;Ironically, I’m having a little bit of trouble there with the TweetDeck Preview, too: if I step away from the new TweetDeck window for a while I find that the auto-refresh feature doesn’t always keep popping new tweets into my view. Twitter says TweetDeck currently tries to keep your current scroll position so you don’t lose track when more tweets come in, but that it wants feedback. (My feedback: make “don’t auto-scroll” a toggle.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zs2IkF"&gt;Twitter tells me it’s already seeing plenty of early feedback that tweet density is important to people, and that feedback is &lt;em&gt;the point&lt;/em&gt; of pushing this preview out into the world. The company wants to explore what it should actually include in the final version, and criticism like mine can help. Oh, and it’s especially important here &lt;em&gt;because Twitter’s expecting people to pay for this new version of TweetDeck&lt;/em&gt;. “With this test, we hope to gather feedback to explore what an enhanced version of TweetDeck could look like within Twitter’s subscription offerings later on,” writes a spokesperson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JYPLW"&gt;I sure hope so, because there aren’t an awful lot of things keeping me on Twitter these days except for TweetDeck’s efficiency, and this preview version is less efficient on practically every front. If Twitter blows up TweetDeck, I won’t just decline to pay — I’ll probably leave Twitter for good. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s new NUC comes with 11th gen CPUs and space for a full-size graphics card</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nlm0xpNmGuaLSD2qaIjNdOvZxpE=/0x0:900x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69615924/Beast_angle_right.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Intel NUC 11 Extreme.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Intel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y4lzAR"&gt;After teasing a new version of its miniature PC &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16716/intel-at-computex-2020-tiger-lakeu-refresh-mediatek-5g-solutions-nuc-11-extreme"&gt;back at Computex 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Intel’s new NUC 11 Extreme is now available to &lt;a href="https://simplynuc.com/beast-canyon/"&gt;preorder from SimplyNUC&lt;/a&gt;, with prices starting at $1,299. The machine, which is codenamed “Beast Canyon,” is listed with a three 11th gen Intel CPU options, and enough space for a 12-inch graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxWgpp"&gt;These three CPU options are a six-core Core i5-11400H, an eight-core Core i7-11700B, and an eight-core Core i9-11900KB. Intel has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the new CPU options will also be available as an upgrade for owners of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21234333/intel-nuc-9-extreme-mini-pc-ghost-canyon-gaming-review-price-specs-features"&gt;last year’s NUC 9 Extreme&lt;/a&gt;. However, it cautioned that “necessary design decisions” mean that front panel audio won’t be supported if you’re using a new CPU in the old chassis, and that PCIe Gen 4.0 is unlikely to be fully supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V3DXhL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GPUs up to 12-inches in size are supported&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hmhAZR"&gt;With a volume of around 8 liters, the NUC 11 Extreme is a little bigger than the 5-liter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21234333/intel-nuc-9-extreme-mini-pc-ghost-canyon-gaming-review-price-specs-features"&gt;NUC 9 Extreme&lt;/a&gt; from last year. But Intel has put that extra capacity to good use with enough space for graphics cards up to 12-inches in length. That’s up from a maximum of eight inches in the last model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfeUR5"&gt;A more powerful power supply (650W this year, up from 500W with the NUC 9 Extreme) also means the new model should be able to handle more power-intensive graphics cards. SimplyNUC specifically mentions that the computer can handle cards “with performance levels up to NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080” via its PCIe 4.0 x16 expansion slot, and the a &lt;a href="https://simplynuc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NUC11BTMi9-rev-1-0.pdf"&gt;spec sheet says&lt;/a&gt; graphics cards up to 350W are supported. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2F30-series%2Frtx-3080-3080ti%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F22%2F22588361%2Fintel-nuc-11-extreme-price-release-date-features-11th-gen-cpu-full-size-graphics-card" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;For reference&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia’s RTX 3080 draws 320W, while the 3080 Ti draws 350W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRRMej"&gt;Beyond CPUs, SimplyNUC is selling the machines equipped with 8GB of RAM as standard, but they can be configured with up to 64GB. 256GB of NVMe M.2 storage is included in SimplyNUC’s pricing, and there are four M.2 slots in total, &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-unchains-beast-canyon-nuc-to-disrupt-the-sff-market"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkZm8I"&gt;In terms of connectivity, the NUC 11 Extreme has six USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports on its rear, alongside Ethernet, HDMI 2.0, and two Thunderbolt 4 ports. There’s an additional two USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports on the front as well as an SDXC card slot. Naturally you’ll gain access to more display-out ports on its rear once you plug in a discrete graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9DYI4"&gt;The Core i5-11400H version of the NUC 11 Extreme sold by SimplyNUC starts at $1,299, with 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and integrated Intel graphics. Meanwhile, the Core i7-11700B model starts at $1,399, while the Core i9-11900KB is $1,599. The entry-level model is listed as shipping in December, but the i7 and i9 models ship earlier in September. Pricing or availability for the standalone CPUs as an upgrade for last year’s machine is yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Predictably, T-Mobile’s merger promises weren’t enough to make a carrier out of Dish</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c7Sxbus-lHW2cjZyGTaBgjHD3FA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69615817/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Sprint acquisition deal included too few requirements and put too much trust in a big corporation to do the right thing. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w4r1In"&gt;When T-Mobile acquired Sprint in April 2020, it brought our major wireless carrier choices from four down to three. Recognizing that this would indeed be a bad thing for US wireless customers (aka all of us), T-Mobile agreed to a set of conditions with the FCC’s blessing that would theoretically position Dish Network to fill the Sprint-shaped hole in our wireless landscape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZdDcv"&gt;In other words, one wireless competitor was allowed to reduce competition only if it agreed to help set up another competitor in its place. Sounds a little suspect, right? Surely a deal like that would include a lot of conditions, requirements, and oversight to make sure it would actually work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cq1jlv"&gt;But looking back, these were the major requirements imposed on T-Mobile to prop up Dish as a competitor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CfeG9G"&gt;Sell Sprint’s prepaid business, including Boost Mobile, to Dish within 120 days after the close of the merger, and maintain Boost’s competitiveness before the divestiture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rw0lgm"&gt;Provide Dish’s wireless customers with access to the T-Mobile network for at least six years through a wholesale MVNO agreement while Dish builds its own network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jgbqcS"&gt;Provide transition services for up to three years afterward to ensure Boost customers are transferred smoothly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kB3OaQ"&gt;Not do anything anti-competitive toward Boost, like throttling or limiting access to new network technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TLnpY1"&gt;Sell Sprint’s 800MHz spectrum to Dish three years after the closing of the merger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Z7SbSn"&gt;Give Dish the option to acquire old Sprint cell sites and retail stores that T-Mobile opts to  decommission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NM9THA"&gt;Provide Dish with reasonable advance notice of network transition plans that could affect Boost customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="eTekCm"&gt;What’s missing there is any definition of success. The burden for the success of the plan lay on Dish’s shoulders, not T-Mobile’s, with Dish being the one legally required to cover 70 percent of the US population with 5G by 2023 (or now &lt;a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20200914/5g/dish-officially-gets-more-time-to-build-out-its-licenses-and-only-5g-will-do"&gt;possibly 2025&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxOBcZ"&gt;Here we are roughly a year later and so far, T-Mobile appears to have technically done everything it said it would do for Dish by now. But is the scheme to prop up our fourth wireless carrier working? It sure doesn’t seem so. The fact that Dish has now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583799/dish-network-att-mvno-t-mobile-5g-4g"&gt;fled into the arms of AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; shows how insufficient T-Mobile’s support has been: instead of relying on the partner mandated by the $26 billion mega merger, Dish now has to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583799/dish-network-att-mvno-t-mobile-5g-4g"&gt;spend $5 billion on a competitor&lt;/a&gt; to get where it wants to go. While not the final proof, it’s the latest reminder that the deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22585761/dish-t-mobile-att-sprint-competition-editorial"&gt;was built on a shaky premise to start with&lt;/a&gt;, and regulators largely took it on faith &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962739/t-mobile-sprint-nextel-merger-prices-rural-coverage-promises"&gt;that big corporations would keep their promises&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LmnTgu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is the scheme to prop up our fourth wireless carrier working? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0G42tr"&gt;From the beginning, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20908539/t-mobile-sprint-merger-dish-network-failure-stopped-antitrust-experts-doj"&gt;critics of the merger deal&lt;/a&gt; suggested that it depended too much on T-Mobile and Dish doing the right thing and was so vague that it left the door open for funny business that could seriously hamper the effort to prop up Dish. The new T-Mobile wasted little time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429587/t-mobile-sprint-merge-jobs-promise-pandemic"&gt;breaking its promise of being “jobs-positive from day one”&lt;/a&gt; and it didn’t take long after the Boost sale for it to mess with Dish, too. In October 2020, T-Mobile told Dish it would be shutting down Sprint’s old CDMA network — which many of Dish’s Boost customers rely on — on January 1st, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4heND"&gt;T-Mobile says it went above and beyond its obligations set out in the merger deal, and that may be technically true: regulators only required six months’ notice, and the company gave 14. T-Mobile’s filings with the FCC related to the merger don’t state exactly when it anticipated shutting down the CDMA network, just that it wouldn’t do so before January 1st, 2021. But T-Mobile also publicly promised it would “&lt;a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/t-mobile-sprint-merger-doj-clearance"&gt;ensure continued and seamless operation of Boost Mobile&lt;/a&gt; […] following transition to Dish’s ownership,” and yet its CDMA shutdown is on an even more aggressive timeline than rivals AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2PuKA3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving Dish a bit more than a year’s notice of a major service upheaval for many of its new customers is bullshit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOqW8Y"&gt;Getting the word out to customers that they’ll need to buy a new device and acquiring enough phones for them takes time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T started notifying its customers&lt;/a&gt; of its February 2022 3G shutdown in July of last year, and as Dish has pointed out repeatedly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358628/verizon-3g-cdma-shutdown-date-2022"&gt;Verizon has delayed closing down its CDMA network&lt;/a&gt; by several years to give itself enough time to migrate customers still using 3G phones. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;a recent letter to the FCC&lt;/a&gt;, Dish also pointed to other statements T-Mobile made that led it to believe that it would have a three-year period to migrate customers off the old network. T-Mobile’s response to the partner it was supposed to prop up? It more or less says that &lt;a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10411042233063/Letter%20to%20Acting%20Chairwoman%20Rosenworcel%20-%20Final.pdf"&gt;Dish wasn’t paying close enough attention&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AwvJGB"&gt;Giving Dish a bit more than a year’s notice of a major service upheaval for many of its new customers is, to use the technical term, bullshit. (We’re not even counting the global health crisis and the chip shortage which might have made this task harder.) And while T-Mobile may be right when it claims to have played by the rules, it certainly qualifies as funny business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdYdnn"&gt;Clearly, the deal didn’t require enough from T-Mobile, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134278/sprint-tmobile-merger-court-ruling-opinion-decision-explainer-carriers-antitrust"&gt;relied too heavily on then-CEO John Legere and Dish’s Charlie Ergen seeming like pretty cool guys&lt;/a&gt; to the judge, Victor Marrero. Putting the onus on Dish to pay up if it missed its 2025 deadline predictably did nothing to encourage T-Mobile to play nice and help Dish along. Unless Dish can pull off something incredible, it looks like we’ll be living without that fourth major wireless carrier for a long time to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG adds mic and speakers to its air-purifying mask, launching next month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vimawNRvwZUeCHZVenzzDiRjQf0=/1x0:1000x666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69615788/LG_PuriCare_Wearable_03.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG claims the battery-powered, air-filtering mask is comfortable to wear for up to eight hours at a time.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9xdDyv"&gt;LG has announced an updated version of its high-tech, air-purifying face mask, the terribly-named &lt;a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/07/for-top-athletes-breathing-clean-pure-air-while-training-is-now-a-reality"&gt;LG PuriCare Wearable Air Purifier&lt;/a&gt;. The company hasn’t announced pricing or widespread availability, but says the PuriCare will launch in Thailand next month “with other markets to follow once approved by local regulators.” Between the ongoing pandemic and widespread air pollution, there’s reason to think there’ll be demand for products like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBZaqP"&gt;LG first announced the mask &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403762/lg-puricare-wearable-air-purifier-mask-coronavirus-filter"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, which uses replaceable air filters and built-in fans to filter the air. LG says the new version has a smaller and lighter motor, as well as built-in microphones and speakers that amplify the wearer’s voice. (Video of the original mask shows that it &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/NrokwBp1PZg?t=55"&gt;muffled speech&lt;/a&gt; quite effectively.) The latter technology, which LG is calling VoiceON, “automatically recognizes when users are talking and amplifies their voice through the built-in speaker.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYf31C"&gt;LG is not the first company to put this sort of voice-amplification tech in a face mask, with Razer’s Project Hazel mask (which is supposedly arriving in limited quantities later this year) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22524990/razer-hazel-mask-first-launch-early-fourth-quarter-2021-drops"&gt;offering a similar set-up&lt;/a&gt;. Razer’s mask also has LED lighting, so take that, LG.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hmbsYd2CtGHlOarXxNCbndOd32o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22732645/LG_PuriCare_Wearable_05.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OWMkEk"&gt;The new LG PuriCare mask weighs 94 grams, has a built in 1,000mAh battery, and recharges in two hours via USB. LG claims it’s comfortable enough to wear for up to eight hours at a time, but in my experience no mask is truly comfortable after a few hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IrAH1f"&gt;Notably, LG is not claiming the mask will protect against the novel coronavirus in any way, though it did hint that this was the case when it first announced the product. It’s true that some air purifying filters &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/can-hepa-air-purifiers-capture-coronavirus/"&gt;do catch particles&lt;/a&gt; the size of the virus that causes COVID-19, but without scientific studies on this particular product or more details about the sort of filters it uses, we can’t and shouldn’t make any claims for its efficacy in this regard. A mask is certainly better than no mask, though, and the best mask is one you’ll happily wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xjZ3V"&gt;Anyway, welcome to 2021: we’re doing spec updates on face masks now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California sues Activision Blizzard over a culture of ‘constant sexual harassment’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ggjl4_jNx8qO55EwH81kNTqg-OQ=/8x0:1091x722/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69615648/TFEVVVUBSZIU1515612314418.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nSokSS"&gt;California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) says that renowned game publishing studio Blizzard Entertainment, and its owner Activision Blizzard, have created a culture of “constant sexual harassment” and gender-based discrimination, in a new lawsuit filed Tuesday that claims top executives were aware and/or involved. And in the hours since the suit was revealed, numerous women have already stepped forward to corroborate the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i67Lzy"&gt;The details are so disturbing that we’re going to start with a &lt;strong&gt;trigger warning&lt;/strong&gt; right now. The idea that male employees held “cube crawls” is one of the &lt;em&gt;tamer&lt;/em&gt; allegations in the lawsuit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VX5f0G"&gt;Female employees almost universally confirmed that working for Defendants was akin to working in a frat house, which invariably involved male employees drinking and subjecting female employees to sexual harassment with no repercussion. “Cube crawls” in Defendants’ offices were common and male employees proudly came into work hungover. Similarly, male employees would play video games during work, engage in banter about their sexual encounters, talk openly about female bodies, and make numerous jokes about rape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1dC9U"&gt;As a product of this “frat boy” culture, women were subjected to numerous sexual comments and advances, groping and unwanted physical touching, and other forms of harassment. A female employee noted that random male employees would approach her on Defendants’ work site and comment on her breasts. Female employees working for the World of Warcraft team noted that male employees and supervisors would hit on them, make derogatory comments about rape, and otherwise engage in demeaning behavior. This behavior was known to supervisors and indeed encouraged by them, including a male supervisor openly encouraging a male subordinate to “buy” a prostitute to cure his bad mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TIpn1s"&gt;Blizzard president J. Allen Brack is specifically named as being aware of and enabling this sort of behavior, and an unnamed former Blizzard CTO “was observed by employees groping inebriated female employees at company events.” &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft &lt;/em&gt;senior creative director Alex Afrasiabi is also specifically named:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Ahnq1J"&gt;Alex Afrasiabi, the former Senior Creative Director of World of Warcraft at Blizzard Entertainment, was permitted to engage in blatant sexual harassment with little to no repercussions. During a company event (an annual convention called Blizz Con) Afrasiabi would hit on female employees, telling him he wanted to marry them, attempting to kiss them, and putting, his arms around them. This was in plain view of other male employees, including supervisors, who had to intervene and pull him off female employees. Afrasiabi was so known to engage in harassment of females that his suite was nicknamed the “Crosby Suite” after alleged rapist Bill Crosby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rjRG97"&gt;We’re assuming the DFEH meant Bill Cosby, but it’s not clear. A few even uglier things are described in the full complaint below, like how one employee committed suicide after extreme forms of sexual harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7IIHD"&gt;All of the alleged sexual harassment is on top of allegations of discrimination, such as refusals to promote women — “the manager commented that they could not risk promoting her as she might get pregnant and like being a mom,” one allegation reads — as well as pay discrimination and outright retaliation. Employees were allegedly “discouraged from complaining as human resource personnel were known to be close to alleged harassers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21014562-blizzard-activision-lawsuit-ca-dfeh/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="Blizzard-Activision-lawsuit-ca-dfeh (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NKN93T"&gt;Here is the full statement Activision Blizzard provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and other publications, which calls the lawsuit “irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State’s best businesses out of California”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tN7vUu"&gt;We value diversity and strive to foster a workplace that offers inclusivity for everyone. There is no place in our company or industry, or any industry, for sexual misconduct or harassment of any kind. We take every allegation seriously and investigate all claims. In cases related to misconduct, action was taken to address the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GASo0R"&gt;The DFEH includes distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard’s past. We have been extremely cooperative with the DFEH throughout their investigation, including providing them with extensive data and ample documentation, but they refused to inform us what issues they perceived. They were required by law to adequately investigate and to have good faith discussions with us to better understand and to resolve any claims or concerns before going to litigation, but they failed to do so. Instead, they rushed to file an inaccurate complaint, as we will demonstrate in court. We are sickened by the reprehensible conduct of the DFEH to drag into the complaint the tragic suicide of an employee whose passing has no bearing whatsoever on this case and with no regard for her grieving family. While we find this behavior to be disgraceful and unprofessional, it is unfortunately an example of how they have conducted themselves throughout the course of their investigation. It is this type of irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State’s best businesses out of California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkFYdH"&gt;The picture the DFEH paints is not the Blizzard workplace of today. Over the past several years and continuing since the initial investigation started, we’ve made significant changes to address company culture and reflect more diversity within our leadership teams. We’ve amplified internal programs and channels for employees to report violations, including the “ASK List” with a confidential integrity hotline, and introduced an Employee Relations team dedicated to investigating employee concerns. We have strengthened our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and combined our Employee Networks at a global level, to provide additional support. Employees must also undergo regular anti-harassment training and have done so for many years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N22ITk"&gt;We put tremendous effort in creating fair and rewarding compensation packages and policies that reflect our culture and business, and we strive to pay all employees fairly for equal or substantially similar work. We take a variety of proactive steps to ensure that pay is driven by non-discriminatory factors. For example, we reward and compensate employees based on their performance, and we conduct extensive anti-discrimination trainings including for those who are part of the compensation process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8Dbwi"&gt;We are confident in our ability to demonstrate our practices as an equal opportunity employer that fosters a supportive, diverse, and inclusive workplace for our people, and we are committed to continuing this effort in the years to come. It is a shame that the DFEH did not want to engage with us on what they thought they were seeing in their investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6eobm7"&gt;Since the lawsuit was revealed, at least five former Blizzard employees have come forward on social media to corroborate details like the “cube crawl,” or that they had to deal with sexual harassment, or that they saw it happen, or that they actually appeared anonymously in the suit. We’re not embedding or linking to their posts without permission, since we’re worried they might be targeted online, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFfGiP"&gt;The California DFEH was also involved with a major sexual harassment and discrimination suit against Riot Games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/2/20992317/riot-games-settlement-details-harassment-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;which initially landed at a settlement of just $10 million&lt;/a&gt; before the DFEH suggested it should be $400 million or more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33di5k"&gt;Ubisoft was embroiled in a huge sexual harassment scandal last year, one whose roots &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332534/ubisoft-serge-hascoet-harassment-sexism-racism-metoo"&gt;may go back a decade&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21499334/ubisoft-employees-workplace-misconduct-ceo-yves-guillemot-response"&gt;an October survey revealed&lt;/a&gt; that a full quarter of all Ubisoft employees said they’d seen or experienced sexual harassment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new MMO may be bricking Nvidia 3090s</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JzuIWXdVtldMzIB9BLXA_35-UIU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69614409/ss15.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;New World&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GnYnyY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 21st, 8:11PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: After we first published this story, Amazon provided the following statement confirming it is looking into two customer service reports related to 3090 failures due to &lt;/em&gt;New World&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="1rfkOr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have two customer service reports on this that we are following up on, and some reports of high GPU usage from forums, which is consistent with a graphically rich game. We do provide user select-able settings to reduce graphics, which correspondingly reduces GPU load, if the player desires.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="et5cyL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original story is below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="FpPszr"&gt;
&lt;p id="nH2qNe"&gt;The closed beta for Amazon Games’ new MMO &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; has been marred by reports that the game has bricked &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/comments/oobi56/did_the_new_world_beta_brick_your_gpu/"&gt;some players’ Nvidia RTX 3090 graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;. In a statement shared Wednesday, Amazon says that it has seen “no indication of widespread issues with 3090s,” but will be releasing a patch anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDKR3x"&gt;Here’s Amazon’s full statement shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5pww2Z"&gt;Hundreds of thousands of people played in the New World Closed Beta yesterday, with millions of total hours played. We’ve received a few reports of players using high-performance graphics cards experiencing hardware failure when playing New World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h89fbB"&gt;New World makes standard DirectX calls as provided by the Windows API. We have seen no indication of widespread issues with 3090s, either in the beta or during our many months of alpha testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgHz8f"&gt;The New World Closed Beta is safe to play. In order to further reassure players, we will implement a patch today that caps frames per second on our menu screen. We’re grateful for the support New World is receiving from players around the world, and will keep listening to their feedback throughout Beta and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="AILDrI"&gt;The language in Amazon’s statement doesn’t completely rule out that the game may be causing problems, though. In particular, the phrasing “no indication of &lt;em&gt;widespread&lt;/em&gt; issues” (emphasis ours) suggests there could be some issues, and since we don’t know how broadly or narrowly Amazon is defining “widespread,” we can’t be sure how many cards the company has determined may be affected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UByB4Q"&gt;Many of the bricked cards appear to be manufactured by EVGA, based on reports in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/comments/oobi56/did_the_new_world_beta_brick_your_gpu/"&gt;a thread on the &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; subreddit&lt;/a&gt;. And issues with EVGA cards may run earlier than the beta, as one player &lt;a href="https://forums.newworld.com/t/issues-with-evga-rtx-3090-ftw3-ultra/112757"&gt;on the &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; forums&lt;/a&gt; said they’ve had one EVGA card die on them during the game’s alpha and one die during this beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Lcw4S"&gt;EVGA didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment, but a company representative &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/amazons-new-world-bricking-rtx-3090-graphics-cards"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt; that&lt;/a&gt; “at the moment we are dealing with specific problems, if it is a problem really confirmed we will inform and inform you in our &lt;a href="https://forums.evga.com/EVGA-GeForce-RTX-30-Series-f113.aspx"&gt;EVGA forums&lt;/a&gt; on our website.” But if you’ve got a 3090 card of any kind, you might want to wait to play the game until Amazon’s patch is out just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SsE0w"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; closed beta runs through August 2nd. If you want to try it, you can pre-ordering the game to get an invite or sign up for an opportunity to get access via &lt;a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/tester-sign-up"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;. The game is set to release on August 31st &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285810/new-world-amazon-delay-august-2021-release-date"&gt;following numerous delays&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ghost of Tsushima’s dark new expansion has fuzzy cats to pet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1nuqyRoTP8e8ovV9HY3BLKftMOk=/0x46:3083x2101/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69614599/Screen_Shot_2021_07_21_at_4.06.42_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GOTY.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sucker Punch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bHwrZv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; will let you pet even more animals than you could in the original version of the game, developer Sucker Punch revealed Wednesday. When &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; first launched, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/1261029893271322629"&gt;you could only pet foxes&lt;/a&gt;, and a few months after release, Sucker Punch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1314317243107303424"&gt;added the ability to pet dogs&lt;/a&gt;, but in the new Iki Island expansion that’s part of &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;, we now know that you’ll be able to pet cats, deer, and monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEMeLT"&gt;All the animals look absolutely adorable and very deserving of pets. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1417899233932308484"&gt;Here’s one of the cats&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IJJmQn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Jin can find animal sanctuaries across Iki Island where he can play soothing melodies with his flute to tame various animals. Once they’ve been calmed, Jin can return to pet them as often as you’d like. Cats are just one example. &lt;a href="https://t.co/SZmnbi0yLK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SZmnbi0yLK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ghost of Tsushima   Director's Cut Out 8/20!

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SlnjVa"&gt;And here’s a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1417899698401124352"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1417900145346179073"&gt;monkey&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3XBM5s"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Monkeys also inhabit multiple sanctuaries, or can be found hanging around at some local hot springs. &lt;a href="https://t.co/nwYAAwXmvJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nwYAAwXmvJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ghost of Tsushima   Director's Cut Out 8/20!

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n3Dg5I"&gt;The very good animals weren’t the only things announced about &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday: Sucker Punch also released &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBrAlSKqdAE"&gt;a trailer&lt;/a&gt; showing some of the story players will experience in the Iki Island expansion. While the story seems grim, Sucker Punch’s Patrick Downs describes it as “a story of healing” &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/07/21/ghost-of-tsushima-journey-into-the-dark-secrets-of-iki-island/"&gt;in a post on the PlayStation Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Now Salesforce officially owns Slack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GkmEd0FonYYsuRBwDH_iVSMQ0Ps=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69614438/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4yOPsJ"&gt;Cloud computing giant Salesforce has &lt;a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/salesforce-completes-acquisition-of-slack"&gt;completed its acquisition of Slack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21719666/salesforce-slack-acquisition-purchase-announced"&gt;a $27.7 billion dollar deal&lt;/a&gt; that adds the messaging app to its suite of enterprise software without immediately changing Slack’s functionality, branding, or leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byea0z"&gt;Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a statement that “Together we’ll define the future of enterprise software, creating the digital HQ that enables every organization to deliver customer and employee success from anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xVKolp"&gt;While Slack &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/12/5991005/slack-is-killing-email-yes-really"&gt;hasn’t quite killed email&lt;/a&gt;, it has attracted notice from giants like Microsoft, the company that Slack co-founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield called “unhealthily preoccupied with killing us” in a conversation with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CdtuI5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield on competing with Microsoft, the future of work, and managing all those notifications ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21269875/slack-ceo-stewart-butterfield-interview-microsoft-remote-work-vergecast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="EIjMMu"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP1902792254&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E3iBbN"&gt;“In a different universe where Slack is incredibly successful over the next two years and 98 percent of knowledge workers use Slack, it does matter to Microsoft because the relative importance of email is hugely diminished,” Butterfield said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLigwa"&gt;Now Slack is going from an upstart independent challenger to a consolidated competitor on even footing. As Box CEO Aaron Levie &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150313/how-microsoft-crushed-slack-salesforce-acquisition"&gt;said to Casey Newton after the deal was announced&lt;/a&gt;, “The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage...they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXabol"&gt;Salesforce has referred to its employees as architects of a remote-friendly approach, and with Slack in its pocket, it will try to dominate as other companies move in that direction. To answer the question on what’s next, on August 17th, Butterfield and Salesforce COO Bret Taylor are &lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/events-master/digital-hq/?d=7013y000001zJ1JAAU"&gt;planning an event&lt;/a&gt; “to share more about how the two companies are creating a powerful platform for the digital-first, work anywhere world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gWzc8M"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You may have heard there would come a day when Slack became a part of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/salesforce?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@salesforce&lt;/a&gt;, and it turns out that day is today!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What does this mean? We’re still the Slack you know and love—just a little better.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ak8bKx8wRl"&gt;https://t.co/Ak8bKx8wRl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Slack (@SlackHQ) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/1417836740191076354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
