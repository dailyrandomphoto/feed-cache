    <title>Lime Prime is the scooter company’s new monthly subscription service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Daily Life In Budapest" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9atvOTJPCerUrQe5zvTZTPj0OVA=/0x0:4937x3291/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69349458/1227934486.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AFb70E"&gt;Lime is rolling out a new monthly subscription service for its electric scooters that’s called — no joke — Lime Prime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnnCZt"&gt;Lime typically charges a fixed rate to unlock a vehicle and then a per-minute fee to ride. For $5.99 a month, the company will waive that initial fee for Lime Prime subscribers. And in markets with no unlock fees, riders will receive 25 percent off the price of their ride. Subscribers will still pay the per-minute charge, but Lime says that someone who uses one of its scooters every day would save approximately $25 a month under the subscription plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sDck0f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This isn’t the first iteration of Lime’s subscription service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RmN0bl"&gt;There are other perks that come with a subscription. Lime Prime members can reserve any scooter or bike for up to 30 minutes at no cost, for example, compared to just 10 minutes for a standard user. And for a limited time, the company is offering the first month of its new plan for free as a promotion to entice new customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uwxIf"&gt;Subscriptions are fast becoming a way for scooter- and bike-sharing companies to lock in more customers in the hopes of boosting their revenue stream. And this isn’t the first iteration of Lime’s subscription service. In 2019 the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21025818/lime-limepass-weekly-subscription-electric-scooters-bicycles-rental-rideables-micromobility"&gt;launched Lime Pass&lt;/a&gt;, a weekly plan that also eliminated the unlock fee for subscribers. Prices varied for Lime Pass, but San Francisco subscribers, for example, were charged $4.99-a-week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FmKIoB4YEKP8KsNboe7BuKDgDSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22542933/Lime_Prime_2.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/21Vv7gxCfBnN2OIIFXNaBGn3NOg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22542932/Lime_Prime_1.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3WjoSF"&gt;Lime also isn’t the first scooter company to dabble in subscriptions. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523121/bird-electric-scooter-delivery-monthly-rental-sf-barcelona"&gt;Bird&lt;/a&gt; has been experimenting with its own plan for its shared electric scooters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20747817/bird-electric-scooter-monthly-rental-san-francisco-bike-app-review"&gt;with mixed results&lt;/a&gt;. Scooter manufacturer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21352552/unagi-electric-scooter-subscription-price-cities"&gt;Unagi has a plan&lt;/a&gt; available in several cities in the US. And electric bikes are jumping on the subscription bandwagon, too, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22279921/revel-ebike-subscription-nyc-price-specs"&gt;Revel in New York City&lt;/a&gt;, Dance in Berlin, and Swapfiets and VanMoof as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okzim3"&gt;Subscriptions have been a mixed bag for the auto industry. Ford walked away from its service last fall following low demand. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18050020/cadillacs-car-subscription-service-shutting-down"&gt;Cadillac shut down its service, Book, in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, only to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197772/cadillac-book-2-subscription-service-dealers"&gt;resurrect it&lt;/a&gt; several months later with fewer options. And BMW recently discontinued its own subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGjGKm"&gt;Other automakers have had some success. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/4/17199532/bmw-subscription-service-nashville"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/10/16455246/porsche-car-subscription-service-launch"&gt;Porsche&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/21/17888304/audi-subscription-service-monthly-fee-dallas"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/30/16720830/volvo-suv-subscription-plan-600-la-auto-show-2017"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143852/nissan-switch-subscription-service-price-model-vehicle"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/15/17464548/jaguar-land-rover-car-subscription-service-carpe-uk"&gt;Jaguar&lt;/a&gt; are still offering some variation of a subscription service. Even the big car rental companies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18652907/hertz-my-car-subscription-rental-terms-enterprise"&gt;Hertz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18514404/enterprise-car-subscription-service-rental"&gt;Enterprise&lt;/a&gt;, are getting in on the action. Most of these subscriptions are only available in specific cities and are still in the pilot phase.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clearview AI hit with sweeping legal complaints over controversial face scraping in Europe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YkGS7-19qM5py4VJwCi2B39Ok8o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69349431/acastro_210512_1777_deepfake_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TBV6I9"&gt;Privacy International (PI) and several other European privacy and digital rights organizations &lt;a href="https://privacyinternational.org/campaigns/get-out-our-face-clearview"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://privacyinternational.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/2021.05.27%20-%20Clearview%20AI%2C%20Inc.%20-%20Privacy%20International%20Complaint%20%28ICO%29%20%5BRedacted%5D_0.pdf"&gt;they’ve filed legal complaints&lt;/a&gt; against the controversial facial recognition company &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html?searchResultPosition=1"&gt;Clearview AI&lt;/a&gt;. The complaints filed in France, Austria, Greece, Italy, and the United Kingdom say that the company’s method of documenting and collecting data — including images of faces it automatically extracts from public websites — violates European privacy laws. New York-based Clearview claims to have built “the largest known database of 3+ billion facial images.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LvDsd"&gt;PI, NYOB, Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights, and Homo Digitalis all claim that Clearview’s data collection goes beyond what the average user would expect when using services like Instagram, LinkedIn, or YouTube. “Extracting our unique facial features or even sharing them with the police and other companies goes far beyond what we could ever expect as online users,” said PI legal officer Ioannis Kouvakas in a joint statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ewFcX0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Far beyond what we could ever expect as online users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aahFFj"&gt;Clearview AI uses an image scraper to automatically collect publicly available photos of faces across social media and other public websites to build out its biometric database. It then sells access to that database — and the ability to identify people — to law enforcement agencies and private companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvA2kF"&gt;The legality of Clearview AI’s approach to building its facial recognition service is the subject of a number of legal challenges globally. Authorities in the UK and Australia &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-09/australia-u-k-open-joint-investigation-into-clearview-ai"&gt;opened a privacy probe&lt;/a&gt; last year into the company’s data scraping techniques. In February, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266055/clearview-facial-recognition-illegal-mass-surveillance-canada-privacy"&gt;Canada’s privacy commissioners determined that&lt;/a&gt; Clearview’s face scraping is “illegal” and creates a system that “inflicts broad-based harm on all members of society, who find themselves continually in a police lineup.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOJquN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imy.se/globalassets/dokument/beslut/beslut-tillsyn-polismyndigheten-cvai.pdf"&gt;Swedish police were fined&lt;/a&gt; by the country’s data regulator for using Clearview’s offerings to “unlawfully” identify citizens. And &lt;a href="https://noyb.eu/en/clearview-ai-deemed-illegal-eu"&gt;in one case in Germany&lt;/a&gt;, the Hamburg Data Protection Agency ordered Clearview to delete the mathematical hash representing a user’s profile after he complained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2dkOT3"&gt;In the US, Clearview was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273388/aclu-clearview-ai-lawsuit-facial-recognition-database-illinois-biometric-laws"&gt;sued by the American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; in the state of Illinois in 2020 for violating the Illinois Biometric Privacy Act. The results of that lawsuit contributed to the company’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21251387/clearview-ai-law-enforcement-police-facial-recognition-illinois-privacy-law"&gt;stop selling its product to private US companies&lt;/a&gt;. Clearview also faced legal action in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21174613/clearview-ai-sued-vermont-attorney-general-facial-recognition-app-database"&gt;Vermont, New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-03-09/clearview-ai-lawsuit-privacy-violations"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mc2Q9"&gt;Privacy International say regulators have three months to respond to the complaints. In the meantime, you can request any data Clearview might have on you &lt;a href="https://clearview.ai/legal#data"&gt;via the email and forms provided on its site&lt;/a&gt; and ask that your face be omitted from client searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLRHnc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDrsZo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google makes it easier to transfer Gmail photos to Google Photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q07CPsKOb9vrqNJMSRbM1YwPgHk=/0x0:512x341/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69349421/UseSaveToPhotosOptionPreviewingImageInGmail.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Save to Photos option.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2R0dtE"&gt;Google is adding a new “Save to Photos” button to Gmail which you can press to automatically save an emailed image to Google Photos, the &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/05/save-photos-from-gmail-messages.html"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. It’s rolling out to personal Gmail users, Google Workspace, G Suite Basic, and G Suite Business customers over the next couple of weeks and will be available alongside the existing “Add to Drive” button. Unfortunately it only works on JPEGs for the time being. Sorry PNG stans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9Wui3"&gt;It’s a good time to be getting a more convenient way to add images to Google Photos, because the service’s storage options are getting a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424528/google-photos-storage-limit-date-15gb-cap-deadline"&gt;big overhaul on June 1st&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, the service’s unlimited storage for “high quality” photos will disappear and will be replaced with a 15GB cap. Importantly, any images uploaded before the change comes into force won’t count towards the new limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzZOqd"&gt;In other words, start smashing that “Save to Photos” button and make the most of your free uploads while they’re still available. Check out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451607/google-photos-high-quality-storage-saver-tool-free-space-blurry-screenshots"&gt;exhaustive explainer&lt;/a&gt; for a complete rundown of the changes coming to Google Photos next month, including how they apply to Pixel owners who got free Google Photos uploads as part of their purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s OLED Switch could come in September</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C6-kwfFZdgva84FPfm8faVrcoEg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69349128/acastro_190530_1777_switch_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrations by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GmFIg4"&gt;Nintendo could release its heavily rumored new version of the Switch in September or October, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-27/nintendo-plans-upgraded-switch-replacement-as-soon-as-september"&gt;report by Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. Manufacturing is reportedly planned to start as soon as July, and Bloomberg says the system may be announced before the E3 trade show, which kicks off in virtual form on June 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9o48tq"&gt;As Bloomberg notes, an announcement ahead of E3 would allow third-party publishers, as well as Nintendo itself, to show their games running on the new hardware. This version of the Switch is said to use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346041/oled-nintendo-switch-dlss-nvidia-chip-report"&gt;more powerful silicon from Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; that works with DLSS technology, allowing for 4K output to a TV. It also reportedly has a 7-inch OLED display sourced from Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sFJX1G"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How AI could make the new Nintendo Switch a powerhouse overnight","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22348095/nintendo-switch-nvidia-dlss-graphics-ai-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Us7UqY"&gt;Bloomberg says Nintendo’s suppliers are “confident” in their ability to fulfill the orders even though there’s a global shortage of chips and other components. “Production lines are better prepared for the potential component shake-up and the parts Nintendo is using are subject to less competition than those in its rivals’ more powerful consoles,” according to the report, though it still warns that “the company’s ability to meet consumer demand won’t be guaranteed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUE2kD"&gt;The current model of the Switch has been difficult to find in many regions throughout the past year, with increased demand during the pandemic exacerbated by challenges with the  supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Square Enix announces Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0EghJY8-F3JYEuzRXu6qeHlP_Jo=/0x1:800x534/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69349068/dq12.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KjUUaQ"&gt;Square Enix has announced the latest mainline entry in the &lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest&lt;/em&gt; series. &lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate &lt;/em&gt;was revealed on a livestream to celebrate the series’ 35th anniversary. Not much beyond the game’s logo and title was revealed, but series creator Yuji Horii hinted at some changes to the traditional turn-based battle system, and said Square Enix was aiming for a simultaneous worldwide release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yA3erY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest&lt;/em&gt; is the most popular RPG series in Japan. The last game, &lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age&lt;/em&gt;, was released for the PlayStation 4 and 3DS in its home market in 2017, though the original Western release only came to the PS4 and PC. An updated version, &lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest XI S&lt;/em&gt;, was released for the Nintendo Switch and later came to Xbox, PS4, PC, and Stadia. In total, Square Enix has shipped more than six million copies of &lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest XI&lt;/em&gt; worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lKbfqk57maaQomU2VScY1q7rkyc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22542702/IMG_0141.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MgbAT2"&gt;Square Enix also announced five more new &lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest&lt;/em&gt; titles during the broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6np4Pu"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest Treasures&lt;/em&gt;, a treasure-hunting RPG starring characters from &lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest XI&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lfUzTt"&gt;A remake of &lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest III&lt;/em&gt; in a similar “HD-2D” visual style to Square Enix’s &lt;em&gt;Octopath Traveler&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bFadxr"&gt;The next major expansion to &lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest X&lt;/em&gt;, the Japan-only MMO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DkR95B"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest X Offline&lt;/em&gt;, a top-down version of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; that doesn’t require an internet connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vubDtN"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest Keshikeshi&lt;/em&gt;, a mobile puzzle game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qPAqPP"&gt;That’s a lot of &lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest&lt;/em&gt; to be getting on with, although only &lt;em&gt;III&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Treasures&lt;/em&gt; are confirmed for a worldwide release at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="nXBbhE"&gt;Facebook won’t remove claims that COVID-19 was man-made anymore, according to &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/26/facebook-ban-covid-man-made-491053"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that cites a Facebook spokesperson. The company altered its policy because of a renewed focus on the origins of the virus, including an order from President Joe Biden to his intelligence agencies to investigate the so-called lab-leak hypothesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOBS6R"&gt;Facebook’s policy change was made “in consultation with public health experts,” that spokesperson told Politico. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21116500/facebook-instagram-coronavirus-misinformation-false-cures-prevention"&gt;The social network’s policy mandates&lt;/a&gt; that false claims and conspiracy theories about the virus be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pZENM1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company has been trying to stem the tide of misinformation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4T8Qy"&gt;Misinformation has often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/17/21223742/coronavirus-misinformation-facebook-who-news-feed-message-avaaz-report"&gt;circulated on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/22/7028983/fake-news-sites-are-using-facebook-to-spread-ebola-panic"&gt;during the Ebola crisis in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. The company is &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2021/03/23/tracing-misinformation-to-the-tech-ceo-hearing-794198"&gt;under pressure from lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; to clean up its act. Early in the pandemic, dangerous hoaxes — falsely suggesting that drinking bleach might cure the coronavirus, for instance — circulated widely on Facebook, and were shared thousands of times, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/coronavirus/"&gt;despite Facebook’s January 2020&lt;/a&gt; announcement that it would be applying its misinformation policies to posts about the coronavirus and its subsequent efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5POVS"&gt;Since then, Facebook has updated its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/230764881494641"&gt;list of statements that will be removed&lt;/a&gt; to include anti-vaccination propaganda as well. To try to stem the tide of misinformation, the company created &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187298/instagram-coronavirus-covid19-misinformation-notifications"&gt;notifications about where to get information&lt;/a&gt; about vaccines across its platforms. It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22177085/facebook-covid-19-misinformation-notifications"&gt;attempted to warn users&lt;/a&gt; if they’ve interacted with posts that were found to contain misinformation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MO1bm"&gt;Earlier today, &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/26/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-investigation-into-the-origins-of-covid-19/"&gt;Biden released a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying that the intelligence community believes that two scenarios are possible: that the virus started spreading when a human contacted an infected animal, or that the spread was the result of a lab accident. Most in the intelligence community believe there isn’t enough evidence to determine which scenario is more likely, according to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bK2PnT"&gt;The renewed interest and discussion of the “lab leak” theory has raised concerns about anti-Asian hate. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22393622/asian-hate-crime-reporting-community-group-statistics"&gt;Anti-Asian violence&lt;/a&gt; has risen since since the beginning of the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447553/anti-asian-american-hate-story-aapi-belong"&gt;fueled by former president Donald Trump’s use of terms&lt;/a&gt; such as “China virus” and “kung flu.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2GzBl"&gt;YouTube and Twitter did not immediately respond to request for comment on whether they would implement similar policy updates. Facebook also did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LeBron James may have just proved the unannounced Beats Studio Buds are real</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f_8v8cL4aa1hJ14i-4Xt45GtYoI=/0x2:780x522/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69348543/191152746_211492840634582_216780930635838230_n.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qz926I"&gt;Earlier this month, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440700/beats-studio-buds-leak-ios-tvos-design"&gt;unannounced pair of Beats wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, apparently called the Beats Studio Buds, showed up in beta releases of iOS and tvOS. While those betas were a good start, a flood of new leaks — including actual photos of mystery earbuds from superstar athlete LeBron James — suggest that they could be available very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGPjqk"&gt;Here’s what we already knew: on May 17th, people digging into the iOS and tvOS 14.6 betas found evidence of the new headphones, with perhaps the clearest look at them coming from animations in the OS shared by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; contributor Steve Moser (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1394361761571254272"&gt;he has a whole thread of them here&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rmle67"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Beats Studio Buds ‘charged’ &lt;a href="https://t.co/xTqj1vo8Mq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/xTqj1vo8Mq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Moser (@SteveMoser) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1394361883457724417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kQVHxT"&gt;This week, the Beats Studio Buds appeared under that name in &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/BCGA2513"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/BCGA2512"&gt;filings&lt;/a&gt;, a sign that the product has been cleared for sale in the US. Diagrams in &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/BCGA2513/Label/FCC-ID-Label-and-Location-5250626"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/BCGA2512/Label/FCC-ID-Label-and-Location-5250503"&gt;filings&lt;/a&gt; also give us a clear look at the shape of the buds from one specific angle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8-NOHOSoySTqmkx9jH255WMG1WM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22542107/Screen_Shot_2021_05_26_at_3.46.30_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://fccid.io/BCGA2513/Label/FCC-ID-Label-and-Location-5250626" target="_blank"&gt;fccid.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diagrams of the Beats Studio Buds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h2KMfh"&gt;Photos &lt;a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/apple-beats-studio-buds-live-images-leaked-design-revealed/"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;MySmartPrice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week show devices that have a very similar design to those FCC diagrams — though it looks like these new photos are just of the plastic casing for the earbuds. While &lt;em&gt;MySmartPrice&lt;/em&gt; said it “could not independently verify the authenticity of these images,” the design seems to match other leaks. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z76_kCoB_ZbwwUNH3t8BeUiMUTY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22542113/Apple_Beats_Studio_Buds.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/apple-beats-studio-buds-live-images-leaked-design-revealed/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MySmartPrice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This looks pretty similar to the design in the FCC filings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5E3RE0"&gt;Now, on Wednesday evening, we may have gotten our first look at the earbuds in the wild in the ears of LeBron James, who posted &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CPWWyKHhWr-/"&gt;new photos on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; where he is seemingly wearing the buds (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1397676604512407560"&gt;via &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/26/lebron-james-beats-studio-buds/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). At first glance, it’s hard to tell exactly what headphones he’s wearing, but if you look &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; closely, you can see a squared off ridge on the outside of the headphones that looks an awful lot like the headphones shown in the animation shared by Moser. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/amTKEe5QxV5NdIs9CyMIQt15Xt4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22542250/lebron_james.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CPWWyKHhWr-/" target="_blank"&gt;LeBron James on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That earbud sure looks like a Beats Studio Bud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S0Hwdy"&gt;LeBron surely knows what he’s doing. At this point, it seems like the Beats Studio Buds are the real deal and they could arrive at any moment. Now we just need Apple to announce them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can join Twitter’s Clubhouse-like Spaces rooms from a browser starting Wednesday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oEr1zsvOkaWfotJCU_-4_Kd8_uw=/0x14:1292x875/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69348418/E2WWJjqVkAM5hDk.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter Spaces on the web.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i9ENh9"&gt;You’ll be able to join Twitter’s Clubhouse-like Spaces from desktop and mobile web browsers starting Wednesday, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1397688581846568961"&gt;company announced&lt;/a&gt;, making the company’s social audio rooms much more widely accessible. Previously, you could only join Spaces from Twitter’s iOS and Android apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fpHPc"&gt;You can get a look at what a Spaces look like on the web in screenshots below, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1397692324830908417"&gt;from Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. The image on the left shows what you’ll see before joining a Space. The one on the right shows a Space off to the side so you can continue scrolling through Twitter while you listen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TgabEm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Spaces are making their way to Twitter for web! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now you can join a Space to listen in, test out the new transcription design, and set reminders to join a scheduled Space. &lt;a href="https://t.co/xFTEeAgM4x"&gt;https://t.co/xFTEeAgM4x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1397692324830908417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sh0AhO"&gt;Spaces on the web have a big caveat, though: you can join Spaces, but you can’t host them yourself just yet, a Twitter spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDqpXl"&gt;Twitter has been quickly opening up Spaces and adding features over the past several months to compete with the dedicated social audio app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380290/clubhouse-social-audio-twitter-facebook-platforms"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; and similar features from companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391551/facebook-audio-podcasts-clubhouse-competitor-spotify-live-rooms"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. Early in May, Twitter began rolling out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;the ability to host spaces on mobile&lt;/a&gt; to anyone with 600 or more followers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 will be profitable next month — and Uncharted 4 is coming to PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cDbizi2RovSW4ZMGGwFAZYcAunY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69348402/vpavic_4278_20201030_0247.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HMEua5"&gt;In February, Sony revealed &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/3/22264242/playstation-5-sales-loss-manufacturing-costs-msrp-sony"&gt;it was selling the PlayStation 5 at a loss&lt;/a&gt; — but that’s imminently about to change. The PS5 should hit break-even in June, and become profitable the very same month, according to &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/irday/pdf/2021/GNS_E.pdf"&gt;a presentation the company shared with investors (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; during its investor day today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLBKgh"&gt;Needless to say, that’s fast — happening before the company has even managed to catch up with demand, in the midst of a global chip shortage. (We bemoaned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/23/22434905/ps5-restock-best-buy-walmart-sony-playstation-5"&gt;the needless drama of buying a PS5&lt;/a&gt; just days ago!) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i_5D1mIG58KjUl--ihU90jlE6P8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22542156/breakeven_ps5.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jGYdCX"&gt;Mind you, this is for the standard PS5, the one where Sony has to supply a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray drive and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430240/how-much-will-sony-ps5-cost-xbox-series-x-s-editorial"&gt;pay as much as $8 per console in licensing fees&lt;/a&gt;, and charges you an extra $100 at retail. It’s not clear if Sony’s driveless PS5 Digital Edition is more or less profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qO6X7r"&gt;Profitability isn’t the only intriguing disclosure in Sony’s presentation, though. Buried in the filing is the &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; news that an incredible game is coming to PC — the previously PS4/PS5 exclusive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/5/11579498/uncharted-4-review-ps4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a blockbuster action game that we loved enough to write both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/5/11579498/uncharted-4-review-ps4"&gt;spoiler-free&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/14/11671134/uncharted-4-nathan-drake-goodbye-nostalgia-theme"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/20/11719308/uncharted-4-better-pacing-less-shooting"&gt;spoiler-iffic&lt;/a&gt; reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GVFAcwZm_yjRWIvs5zUdXt4cAFI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22542152/pc_uncharted_4.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NLPwZn"&gt;Sony had previously promised &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297091/days-gone-pc-playstation-games-ports-jim-ryan"&gt;more PlayStation exclusives would come to PC&lt;/a&gt;, and Sony’s presentation makes it clear why the company is interested. See that little “&lt;strong&gt;ROI 250%+&lt;/strong&gt;” note? If I’m reading it correctly, that means &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21363127/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-port-review-performance"&gt;the iffy PC port of &lt;em&gt;Horizon: Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; nonetheless managed to make &lt;em&gt;more than double the money &lt;/em&gt;that Sony invested in bringing it to gaming computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NeIHLH"&gt;It makes me wonder, very strongly, about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444039/ps5-playstation-5-final-fantasy-xvi-demons-souls-pc-announcement"&gt;the mysterious circumstances that surrounded Sony’s announcements of &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XVI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrgoBl"&gt;Oh, by the way: sure looks like Sony just confirmed that &lt;em&gt;God of War: Ragnarok &lt;/em&gt;is the official name of that upcoming game! Could be a mistake or a juxtaposition of two vaguely related logos, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cr6y8r"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Also genuinely surprising to see them maybe just confirm God of War: Ragnarok as the next game's official title?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After we've all spent so long calling it that, makes sense to lean in, I suppose! &lt;a href="https://t.co/7YYm6cngZ9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7YYm6cngZ9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jonathon Dornbush (@jmdornbush) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jmdornbush/status/1397690881285660677?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="VZTXuu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Epic wanted Sony’s PlayStation PC games to compete with Steam, documents show","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22424596/epic-games-store-sony-playstation-pc-games-steam-competition"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OM3YMY"&gt;Correction: Sony’s presentation today came from its Investor Day, not its Corporate Strategy Meeting. The Corporate Strategy Meeting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454377/sony-ai-playstation-game-agents-corp-document-presentation-2021-strategy"&gt;was yesterday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z1nYvF"&gt;Uber has finally recognized a union of its own drivers. Allow yourself that single moment of elation before we get to the rest of the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLi2lj"&gt;GMB trade union in the UK (it’s not really an acronym for anything, as it was shortened from General, Municipal, Boilermakers’ and Allied Trade Union some 40 years ago) managed to clinch union recognition from the jaws of the famously labor-hostile app company today. As &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported, “GMB will have access to drivers’ meeting hubs [...] It will also be able to represent drivers if they lose access to the Uber app, and it will meet quarterly with management to discuss driver issues and concerns.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPkGQS"&gt;It’s not clear whether this arrangement hews closer to traditional union representation as we envision it in the US, or if this more so resembles the Independent Drivers Guild — an outsized advocacy group in New York that meets with Uber and has been &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/new-yorks-rideshare-organizers-clash-amid-unprecedented-1834623838"&gt;widely criticized&lt;/a&gt; as a company union. Drivers won’t be automatically enrolled in the union as a result of working for Uber. That’s an arrangement we’d refer to as an “open shop” on this side of the Atlantic, and the company is almost assured to leverage it to its benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9Hjmg"&gt;Drivers in the UK &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/uber-is-reclassifying-uk-drivers-as-workers-heres-what-happens-next.html"&gt;recently won&lt;/a&gt; — via the courts — the right to be considered Uber “workers,” a category distinct from “employees” but which still confers basic employment benefits like minimum wage and a pension. However, that ruling did not apply to couriers on the Uber Eats food delivery side, nor does this new union agreement cover them. From the start then, this new agreement leaves an estimated 30,000 Uber laborers out in the cold. (We’ve reached out to GMB and Uber for additional details on that oversight.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dq13oz"&gt;GMB has undoubtedly made history here, but Uber’s track record gives onlookers every reason to doubt the efficacy of this new union. The company has a habit of threatening to pull out of locations that fail to provide the legal favoritism it has come to expect — &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-threatens-to-leave-quebec-over-driver-rules-1506453196"&gt;Quebec in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, for example. It has also been engaged in attempts to rewrite labor law in the US to suit its business interests, successfully &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551136/uber-prop-22-victory-national-q3-2020-earnings"&gt;overturning a California law&lt;/a&gt; via a ballot proposition during the 2020 election which cost the company — along with fellow travelers Lyft, DoorDash, and Postmates — an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291580/prop-22-instacart-doordash-uber-lyft-postmates-grubhub-price-hike"&gt;estimated $200 million&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, drivers in the state have reported their &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/16/uber-lyft-drivers-california-prop-22"&gt;wages falling&lt;/a&gt; even further. (Uber is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/labor-gig-companies-are-said-to-be-near-bargaining-deal-in-n-y"&gt;attempting&lt;/a&gt; a similar legal maneuver in New York currently.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tuTjxc"&gt;Further compounding matters, one of the parties which helped win worker status for UK drivers — the App Drivers &amp;amp; Couriers Union — refused to sign on to a similar deal for recognition, claiming &lt;a href="https://www.adcu.org.uk/news-posts/uber-gmb-union"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that it believes “closer trade union engagement with Uber management is always a welcome development but there is good reason for workers and their unions to be cautious.” The group cited Uber’s continued hostility toward workers, in and out of court, in the UK and in the US. “For us compliance with legal minimums should be the point of departure for any union agreement with Uber,” the ADCU wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YaMshQ"&gt;Still, a win is a win. “This ground-breaking deal between GMB and Uber could be the first step to a fairer working life for millions of people,” the delightfully named GMB national officer Mick Rix noted in identical press releases sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by both the union and Uber, “We now call on all other operators to follow suit.” &lt;/p&gt;
