    <title>MatPat looks at YouTube’s biggest changes over the last decade — and what lies ahead</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cvXGQanwptuwOgOzAzx9tzscYMQ=/360x0:4248x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68992875/MatPat_headshot.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An interview with one of gaming’s longest-standing personalities&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="MYWjNx"&gt;Matthew &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GameTheorists/videos"&gt;“MatPat”&lt;/a&gt; Patrick was on YouTube for two years before he hit publish on the first entry in the series that changed his life — and YouTube culture as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNJwRl"&gt;“Game Theory,” a series that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Med6Z8-9g"&gt;examines the ins and outs&lt;/a&gt; of popular video game franchises like &lt;em&gt;Five Nights at Freddy’s &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, premiered on April 18th, 2011. The channel quickly found an audience of gaming enthusiasts and industry developers who wanted to learn the secrets behind why certain games became such a hit. YouTubers also looked to him as a model, as Patrick successfully helped to pilot an entire genre of videos, using tricks he had learned while working behind the scenes at a multichannel network (an older YouTube model that has slowly faded away).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSlhGp"&gt;Throughout the years, MatPat’s channel became a go-to open secret for new YouTube creators and game developers. He was one of the first creators to explain why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20996849/minecraft-youtube-rewind-fortnite-grand-theft-auto-roblox-biggest-games-views"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;was so successful on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, for example. By 2017, he became a leading figure within the community, fighting on behalf of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18287318/youtube-logan-paul-pewdiepie-demonetization-adpocalypse-premium-influencers-creators"&gt;YouTubers during the “adpocalypse.”&lt;/a&gt; He even went on to host an interview &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ap6PTQUMf4"&gt;session with YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki&lt;/a&gt; about creator issues.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJyfMQ"&gt;In 2014,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Patrick expanded “Game Theory” into a franchise &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/FilmTheorists"&gt;with “Film Theory,”&lt;/a&gt; and “Food Theory” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHYoe8kQ-7Gn9ASOlmI0k6Q"&gt;followed just last year&lt;/a&gt;. His videos routinely pick up millions of views, and he employs a full team to help with editing and creating new episodes. Alongside his wife and channel partner Stephanie, the two are also exploring more charity live streams for causes close to their hearts. In December 2020, one of their charity streams &lt;a href="https://www.stjude.org/media-resources/news-releases/2020-fundraising-news/game-theory-raises-3-million-on-youtube.html"&gt;raised more than $3 million&lt;/a&gt; for St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMi2nN"&gt;With the 10th anniversary of Game Theory approaching, Patrick sat down with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;for an interview about what’s changed on YouTube over the last decade and what’s next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iy4waT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wqb5zi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X9BNqktRdLo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="9hmIxS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first question, which is maybe a big one, but in these last 10 years, what’s the biggest thing that has changed? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unqf8s"&gt;Oh, well! [&lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;] It’s pretty massive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNtZVL"&gt;I think the biggest stuff is the idea of being a YouTuber, and being a creator, has fundamentally shaped so much of entertainment, of being a storyteller — of the world ecosystem, in a lot of cases. The idea that anyone with a phone in their hand can not just create something but find an audience somewhere in the millions or tens of millions, and ultimately build a business off of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ys1gbR"&gt;That democratization of entertainment is huge because now you’re giving voice to people who never would have had a platform. You’re giving rise to stories like the Dream SMP, which no television producer in their right mind would ever think to greenlight or understand why it could be so popular — and yet, it’s the biggest thing happening on YouTube right now. That sort of fostering of creativity, that explosion of being able to tell your own story is really exciting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsCcAT"&gt;You see those ripple effects happening, too. In the way that the lead shows, especially during COVID, had to film at home and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21179793/coronavirus-late-night-fallon-colbert-wwe-morning-shows-the-view-sports-premier-league-nba-mlb"&gt;become vloggers in their own right&lt;/a&gt;. Gaming has permeated the sports world in a way that 10 years ago would have never existed. Even the evolution of live content, as celebrities kind of tried to try to find their own audiences outside of their individual projects... they’re following the models that YouTubers and digital creators have been pioneering over the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMImnV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You inspired a lot of people to kind of figure out a way to do those types of videos [theories and in-depth explainers] that are really influential and informative. When did you start noticing, like, “Ah, this thing I created is taking off to the point that people want to replicate it?” Imitation is the biggest form of flattery. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2A2nQ"&gt;We were one of the early video essay formats. From the YouTube creator standpoint, I think it was probably about three years into us doing the show that I first started to really take note that other people were attempting the format. I &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce3"&gt;think it was VSauce3&lt;/a&gt;, the pop culture science channel, which was massive at the time. I remember thinking, “Oh, that’s my format. And they’re doing it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nVqCUa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That democratization of entertainment is huge because now you’re giving voice to people who never would have had a platform”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ow5n5r"&gt;That was also the first time that I got really scared. We were still in relatively early days, still finding our audience, and here’s this massive channel that is doing roughly the thing that we’ve been doing for the past three years — hopefully they don’t run us out or whatever. But what we came to learn very quickly was there’s an audience that is big enough for everyone, and everyone kind of tackles that theorizing format in their own unique voice, which is really exciting. You now have a community of theorists all applying their logic in different ways and can create complimentary content, as opposed to content that cannibalizes each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="130T7c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a different version of 2021, if Game Theory didn’t exist, if someone were to come to you and say, “I have this idea for this channel I want to do,” would that be able to find an audience today? Is there room for Game Theory today or is that something that had to happen at the moment it did?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NV3pE0"&gt;It sounds a little bit defeatist, but I think it had to kind of happen when it did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Az1BYZ"&gt;The nature of theorizing does not work well with the modern ecosystem of digital video. Having thoughtful analytical pieces that take a week to put together like our videos doesn’t run with the speed that the internet runs with at this point. Doing this sort of research piece, it’s just hard to do. And you see that too even with educational channels in the space, right? The channels that have been able to survive in 2020 / 2021 are the established ones: the VSauces of the world, the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/physicswoman"&gt;Physics Girls of the world&lt;/a&gt;. These channels that can afford to have a little bit of a delay between their uploads because their audience is already there. That affords them the time to do the research, to do the scripting, to make sure that their facts are correct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pzhhZP"&gt;If you’re looking to kind of get some sort of accelerated growth on the platform, that requires a faster cadence of uploads or being able to more closely ride trends. A single creator, doing all the steps on their own, would really struggle to do all of it in the time it takes to be competitive in that landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KfFf69N4dKdcN4h1ihadq9g9HfA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22380163/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_11.52.33_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N98AHi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the future of gaming videos? Is it more Dream SMP stuff? Or is there a place where people can still do let’s plays and all that with games when YouTube is trying to figure out how to keep advertising going and keep the children’s privacy law COPPA in mind? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CKq3VD"&gt;Gaming is stronger than it’s ever been. In 2020, gaming was one of the few fields that didn’t just sustain itself but thrived as more people found gaming to fill in the gaps that the disappearance of reality kind of left in its wake. A lot of people had these gaps in their schedules, gaps in social calendars, and gaming was able to kind of fill those holes. People were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200972/college-students-graduation-minecraft-coronavirus-school-closures"&gt;having graduations in &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, people were going to the museum in &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;. Gaming kind of exploded in the last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mviDZx"&gt;I think Dream SMP is definitely one route. It’s not just gaming, it’s narrative storytelling through the lens of gaming. You’re starting to see more people kind of adopt that Machinima idea of, “Hey, here’s a world in which I can treat this not as a game, but as a platform.” &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is doing it a lot of ways to where they have the creative block where you can create whatever you want. That’s really cool. Game developers are recognizing that the game doesn’t end when a player beats it or when the match ends, but it can become an ecosystem, a platform of its own to foster the creativity of its players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="499XjQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; has always had that. That’s one of the reasons why &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; has had such staying power. You’re seeing other gaming companies recognizing this and trying to build in that direction. I can see that being the direction of where gaming content moves from here. It’s less about sitting down on the couch and playing through this narrative story time together, and more sitting down on the couch and creating a world together using the tools of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ge1Dg6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you feel like the term “YouTuber” now comes with more authority and more respect than it did in 2011? From your perspective, as someone who is an entrepreneur as well as a creator, how have those conversations changed with industry people that you meet when you say, “I’m on YouTube, I’m a YouTuber?&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6J1rCA"&gt;I think, for a long time, there was this kind of an attempt to educate traditional media about that exact issue. That being a YouTuber wasn’t a dirty word, right? There is a specific connotation attached to that, like a certain tier of creator — an upper tier of creator who is delivering this interesting content. But I think a lot of times, myself included, we got frustrated that a lot of times those conversations tended to fall on deaf ears. The learning process was slower than we hoped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dl3Lwl"&gt;Nowadays, in 2021, it’s one of those things where there’s a division of people who get it and people who don’t. Rather than trying to prove credibility to the people who don’t, the industry is just moving forward. You either get it or you don’t. This is where there is still a division in the ecosystem, people who still don’t respect it or who still kind of look down on the title of YouTuber. But the need to kind of prove that legitimacy has kind of faded away. There’s enough critical movement in the ecosystem, in the traditional space, in the brand space, that it’s like I will find the people who understand me and respect me and move forward with them. If you don’t hop on the train, well, you’re just gonna get left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoWt6e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I often think about not just how much has changed since 2011, but things that I miss from that era. There was a moment of true experimentation for an online video platform. I miss that. There are other things that I don’t miss. It was chaotic, and not always in a good way. Is there anything that you miss about that specific era? And is there anything from that specific era of YouTube that has kind of gone away that you’re happy about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWQjJV"&gt;In the early days of digital video, and in the early days of Game Theory, it was the Wild West. You were able to kind of produce videos on any game, any topic, and there wasn’t a pressure for that upload to perform or there wasn’t an expectation of earning money off of it. You did get a lot of really interesting, really off-the-wall experimental videos that were true expressions of a person’s creativity and you saw stuff unlike anything you would see elsewhere online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TUpkE"&gt;The window of what is acceptable to put on YouTube has really narrowed. You have regulations on one side dictating what isn’t kids’ content, you have rampant demonetization dictating what can or can’t be said or shown in a particular video. There is a certain level of polish that modern YouTube kind of expects of videos for them to kind of get a decent amount of traction on the platform. You lose a lot of the rawness — the bad cameras, the wonky editing, the YouTube slideshows of yesteryear — because the platform does have a standard of quality now that it’s looking to show to audiences around the world. And I understand why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mmCyoi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In the early days of digital video, and in the early days of Game Theory, it was the Wild West”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZSCsI"&gt;But something does get lost for small creators who are still using this as a platform to kind of find their voice, find their audience. I definitely miss that. I miss that idea of community, that idea of anything goes, that idea of chaos. It’s a double-edged sword. As we talked about before, what it means to be a YouTuber is less stigmatized, there is a group of people who understand it. So the ability to build a business on YouTube on one hand is kind of a bummer because it’s no longer one person in the Wild West. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Tyot3"&gt;Now at the very least, I have stability. We’re going on 10 years, and I think for the first five of them, we operated under the motto that this bubble could burst at that moment. The algorithm could shift, advertisers could leave, YouTube could get shut down. Now, YouTube, the ecosystem, how it’s perceived in the world has evolved in such a way that this is a more stable place to build a business. Advertisers come and go, and you will have your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18231561/youtube-child-exploitation-predators-controversy-creators-adpocalypse"&gt;occasional adpocalypse&lt;/a&gt;, but the system has matured in such a way that paranoia of always having to look over your shoulder has started to ebb away a little bit, and you’re able to focus on running your own race and making the stuff that you are able to produce as best as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQR54O"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is something that you’ve seen go around, assumptions that people make, that people actually get wrong?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihJBcA"&gt;There’s a stigma that comes with anyone who’s kind of built out their team and has been public about it. The idea of, “Oh, this isn’t your channel anymore because you have an editor and a researcher, or you have someone who helps you upload the videos.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VSrCWY"&gt;What’s exciting to me is that it allows us to do what we love to do at a larger scale and actually stay relevant in 2021 with the kind of faster pace that YouTube expects at this point. Not only that, but also employ like-minded individuals who also are creative and have something that they want to say, or who are theorists like me, who have their own properties that they want to talk about. What a lot of people see is, “Oh, you became corporate” or we became a business. Yeah, we became a business, but that doesn’t lose the core of the creativity that brought us here in the first place. In fact, it’s enabled us to empower other creatives like ourselves to find employment doing the stuff that they love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAG4r3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, last question, and it might be a little tougher. What’s next for you? Is there a future beyond YouTube?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sxv0sb"&gt;We just launched Food Theory, and that’s been a lot of fun. That’s been really creatively refreshing for us. You can theorize about things that don’t just exist in the pop culture lexicon, you can theorize about anything in your day-to-day life. We have some thoughts as to what else you can theorize about, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see that one fill in at some point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QY7cwe"&gt;Our main focus now is doing exactly what we talked about: being an influencer of influencers where we are trying to advocate to YouTube on behalf of creators’ rights and needs. We’re trying to find solutions for channels that are having trouble with monetization, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963459/youtube-google-coppa-ftc-fine-settlement-youtubers-new-rules"&gt;having trouble with COPPA&lt;/a&gt; or things like that to try and help them be able to find the stability that we’ve been able to find. Finding business solutions and creator solutions that work for this kind of next generation of creators. We’ve been really working behind the scenes to make those tools available to creators so that way they can grow their own businesses faster and not have to make mistakes that we made along the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="s8PwKS"&gt;The last thing is our charitable work. At the end of last year, we had the amazing ability to raise $3 million for St. Jude along with the help of 50 of our favorite creators across various platforms. We see the importance of using the platform that we’ve been given, that we’re lucky enough to have built over the years, for good. If we can kind of pay it forward and pass along that goodwill and serve as an ambassador for worthwhile causes in order to inspire the next generation of creators to make good use of the fortunate position they’ve been given, that’s great as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UYEt0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBTx5Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gamescom plans ‘hybrid’ event for summer, focusing on superfans (but ignoring superspreaders)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="“Debatt(l)e Royale 2020 - Die Politikarena Auf Der Gamescom” In Berlin" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hfMMh2ysBYlvxXiGUcO-F2JcfIk=/0x0:5057x3371/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68992849/1228242898.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nHCmZJ"&gt;Video game fair Gamescom is planning to hold a “hybrid event” combining in-person and digital activities later this summer, despite uncertainty surrounding the ongoing pandemic and the risk the trade show could turn into a “superspreader” event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gC9Vtl"&gt;Like many big events that involve hundreds of thousands of people flying in from all over the world to breathe the same air for days at a time, Gamescom decided to cancel its 2020 show and instead held a series of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402923/gamescom-2020-opening-night-live-news-trailers-fall-guys-star-wars-cod"&gt;virtual spectacles&lt;/a&gt;. This year, though, organizers want gamers and industry insiders to return to the show floor, albeit in reduced numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5rxb7T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We will hereby be placing a focus on the superfans”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wbsS4X"&gt;“In late summer, we are striving to make an on-site Gamescom event possible for the gaming fans again at last,” said Felix Falk, managing director of the German Games Industry Association, which co-organizes Gamescom, in a &lt;a href="https://www.gamescom.global/press-creator/press-releases/press-releases-of-gamescom/?fairnumber=0480&amp;amp;fairyear=2021&amp;amp;pressrelease=1&amp;amp;language=EN%20(US)&amp;amp;abbreviation=EN%20(GB)&amp;amp;datei=pm_0480_2021_1_EN%20(US).xml?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=8786&amp;amp;utm_term=foto_announcement_hybrid_20210318&amp;amp;utm_content=0480_20_BW_Core_tw_int"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We will hereby be placing a focus on the superfans and the on-site testing of the latest games this year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lrtxY"&gt;As proof of the event’s safety, organizers are promoting their adherence to so-called “&lt;a href="https://www.gamescom.global/for-visitors/on-site/re-start-koelnmesse/"&gt;#B-SAFE4business&lt;/a&gt;” guidelines outlined by Koelnmesse, the exhibition center in Cologne, Germany where Gamescom is usually held. According to Koelnmess, safety measures include mandatory face masks (except at seating areas for eating and drinking), contact-free navigation through doors, reduced visitor numbers (so attendees can maintain at least 1.5-meter distances from one another at all times), and “sufficient ventilation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0t5efc"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://static-koelnmesse.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/cloudfront/gamescom/redaktionell/gamescom/downloads/pdf/aussteller/gamescom_pitch_deck.pdf"&gt;pitch deck&lt;/a&gt; for the event suggests it will take place between August 23rd and 29th, five months from now. And although it’s impossible to predict what the global COVID-19 situation will be at that point, that uncertainty is definitely not in the organizers’ favor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRxaTx"&gt;Just this week, German officials &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bfeeaff9-0d7e-4f3a-bc31-329a3ad5e53f"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; of an “exponential” growth in infections, attributed in part to the spread of the new B.1.1.7 variant. And while Germany still plans to offer every citizen a COVID-19 vaccination &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-germany-target/germany-sticks-to-summer-vaccination-target-document-idUSKBN2BB18B?il=0"&gt;by summer&lt;/a&gt;, there have already been unforeseen obstacles to this goal like the recent suspension of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/16/chaos-in-germany-and-italy-after-suspension-of-oxford-vaccine"&gt;the Oxford / AstraZeneca COVID vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSot9G"&gt;Even if Germany does have the pandemic under control by August, the wisdom of inviting attendees from around the world to share air in a single location is dubious to say the least. It’s been proven that such big gatherings can become superspreader events. A single biotech conference in the US last February is thought to have led to some &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/world/superspreading-boston-biotech-conference-in-february-is-linked-to-1-9-percent-of-all-us-cases.html"&gt;300,000 new cases&lt;/a&gt;, for example. And even small events which test all attendees &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/13/1018374/peter-diamandis-covid-superspreader-a360-conference/"&gt;have led to new cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIqU1R"&gt;Gamescom, though, isn’t the only organization determined to return to “normal” in 2021. Mobile conference MWC is also currently scheduled to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;go ahead in June&lt;/a&gt;, even though &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/mwc-will-take-place-in-person-in-barcelona-but-ericsson-sony-nokia-facebook-wont-be-there/"&gt;numerous firms&lt;/a&gt; — including Sony, Nokia, Ericsson, and Facebook —  have said they won’t attend due to safety concerns. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to find out if you’re getting the third stimulus payment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="(Flickr) American money" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uc1TxMuTgjVGvbShTUaGZHovxG4=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68990053/4603130687_d0a0862bc4_b.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KcmCg7"&gt;It’s always nice to anticipate an influx of cash, especially if things have been a bit tight lately. &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/text"&gt;The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021&lt;/a&gt;, which was signed into law on March 11th, 2021, includes Economic Impact Payments in the amount of $1,400 or less, depending on your reported income. In fact, as of Wednesday, March 17th, you may have already gotten yours; that was when the first payments began hitting bank accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7YYiA"&gt;So if you’ve been using direct deposit to pay your federal taxes (or get your tax refunds), then check your bank account. If you don’t use direct deposit and you qualify for a payment, you should get either a check or a prepaid Economic Impact Payment (EIP) card in the mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ge43Id"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haven’t seen anything yet and want to find out your status? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ce2mLR"&gt;The best way to find out where your payment is (and if one is coming) is via the IRS’s &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment"&gt;“Get My Payment”&lt;/a&gt; tool, which will tell you whether you’re eligible and, if so, when you will see the payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SqeZU8"&gt;If you use the tool and are getting a “Payment Status Not Available” message, then, according to the IRS, this means “either we have not processed your payment yet, we do not have enough information to issue you a payment or you are not eligible for a payment.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The IRS “Get My Payment” tool may help you find out where your stimulus payment is." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mt8li06Cr5U-Go1nC1luIkFgMqw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22380970/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_4.23.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The IRS’s “Get My Payment” tool may help you find out where your stimulus payment is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JiZSWk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you know if you’re eligible?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUOCib"&gt;It’s complicated. Whether you get a payment can depend on what your adjusted gross income (AGI) was, based on your 2020 taxes (if you’ve already filed) or your 2019 taxes (if you haven’t). The AGI is basically the amount you earned that year minus such things as contributions to a retirement account, and it can usually be found on line 8b of your 1040 tax form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uplt1"&gt;If you are an individual and your AGI was below $75,000, you qualify. If your AGI was at least $75,000 but below $80,000, you will get a portion of the $1,400. But if your AGI was $80,000 or higher, you’re completely out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BBmu8"&gt;This changes, of course, if you’re the head of a household (in which case, you get $1,400 if you make below $112,500 and nothing if you make $120,000 or more) or a married couple who files jointly (in which case, you get the $1,400 if the AGI is below $150,000 and nothing if it’s at least $160,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHzb5z"&gt;There are a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nolo.com%2Flegal-encyclopedia%2Fhow-much-will-my-covid-19-stimulus-check-be-and-am-i-eligible.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22338569%2Fcovid-stimulus-payment-check-track-irs-economic-impact" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;variety of calculators available online&lt;/a&gt; that can tell you how much you can expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="awkZ5O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to file and pay your 2020 taxes online ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22225419/file-taxes-pay-online-how-to-irs-us"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1YkeEQ"&gt;Speaking of calculators, your AGI isn’t the only factor being taken into consideration. There are other considerations as well. Among them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FMBESH"&gt;Non-citizens don’t get payment, although there are &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/personal-finance/non-us-citizens-third-stimulus-check/"&gt;a number of exceptions&lt;/a&gt;. You are eligible if you are: a non-citizen with a social security number, a lawful permanent resident (in other words, what is sometimes called a “green card” holder), &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/substantial-presence-test"&gt;a qualifying “resident alien”&lt;/a&gt;, a member of a program such as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), or have Temporary Protected Status (TPS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="23W0DY"&gt;If you don’t file taxes, you should be okay — unless you also didn’t file last year and didn’t get a check, in which case, it might be a good idea to file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="a8l0rm"&gt;Adult dependents in a household (such as college students or elderly parents) will qualify for payments as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="nWT3Ie"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit-frequently-asked-questions"&gt;IRS has a FAQ&lt;/a&gt; that should answer most (if not all) of your questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xY5OrE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if you never got your first or second stimulus payments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pHsCDN"&gt;If you were eligible for one or both of the first two stimulus payments but never received it, it’s too late now to actually get paid. You will have to apply for a &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit"&gt;Recovery Rebate Credit on your 2020 taxes&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not as good as getting a direct payment, but at least you’ll recover some of what you would have paid in taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kxSeV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 19th, 8:50AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on March 18th, 2021, and has been updated to clarify which non-citizens can receive the stimulus payment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a brief respite in a post-Thanos world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QLrT1ybgPb6uSSczuP0KUaeuIfg=/234x0:2766x1688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68992444/mackie_fatws.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dl85xz"&gt;For the vast majority of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/21591343/falcon-winter-soldier-premiere-date-disney-plus-sebastian-stan-anthony-mackie-august"&gt;Bucky Barnes’&lt;/a&gt; 106 years on Earth, his life has consisted of running from fight to fight without a second to sit down and simply exist. Now, Bucky Barnes is faced with a new reality he doesn’t know how to navigate — what happens after the knuckles are bandaged and the bad guy is dead? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2g462"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/705882/9358?sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Marvel Cinematic Universe&lt;/a&gt; spent 11 years building up to its climactic battle between Earth’s mightiest heroes (and a couple of pals from space) and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/4/17319992/thanos-plan-avengers-infinity-war-historical-precedent-science-malthus"&gt;Mad Titan, Thanos&lt;/a&gt;. There were some hiccups along the way — Ultron nearly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/22/8464479/avengers-age-of-ultron-review"&gt;destroyed the world&lt;/a&gt;, countless other villains like Loki, Red Skull, and all of Hydra tried to kill the Avengers a few times — but everything boiled down to Thanos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6C58r"&gt;He’s no longer a threat (in this universe, anyway). Millions of people are back on Earth after being snapped from existence. The world is trying to move on from the last five years. New regulations are being drawn up in government, banks are trying to figure out how to help people with finances after five years of being away, but superheroes are stuck in a moment of suspension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opqviX"&gt;The next big thing is around the corner — it always is — but for now, Marvel Studios is using its new television universe on Disney Plus to take a step back and let its heroes decompress as they try to figure out their place in a strange, new world. &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;, which debuts today,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is a perfect example. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oR_2jAsXiWQOaAA060O_pq-BT54=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22379903/sam_bucky.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hVCO1X"&gt;[&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re reading a write-up of a new Marvel show, you know what lies ahead. Here’s your warning for minor spoilers that appear in the first episode.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUs4JY"&gt;At the outset of the show, Captain America is gone, and his two best friends are navigating a world without him. Sam Wilson (Falcon) has rejoined the Air Force and is trying to stop terrorists from gaining power. Bucky Barnes (Winter Soldier) is undergoing therapy, living as a normal civilian in New York City for the first time since before he left to fight in World War II. Both are trying to acclimatize to their new lives, dealing with stuff they didn’t have to when the world was on the brink of extinction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xquiv"&gt;In one instance, Sam is trying to help his sister in Louisiana get a loan for the houseboat they grew up in but is now getting too expensive to keep up. In between pitiful requests for selfies from an Avenger-fanboy banker, the duo are consistently told they don’t have enough income for the bank to issue a loan. Confused, said banker repeatedly asks how Sam earned an income when he was part of the world’s most famous superhero group (“did Stark pay you when he was around?”) and how he could possibly be so broke all things considered. Even if Sam disappeared for five years (hence, no recent income), that just makes him like half the world’s population who also disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zbwqxj"&gt;It’s a wonderful scene. &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier &lt;/em&gt;shines best when it’s putting forth questions people have kicked around in the back of their minds or in conversations with friends for more than a decade. How do the Avengers get paid? What do they do on their time off? Do they go on dates with non-Avengers? Do they pick up part-time jobs when the world doesn’t need saving? &lt;em&gt;How do the Avengers live when there’s nothing to avenge&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfsVc0"&gt;It’s a big part of what makes comic books fun week after week, month after month. The intimate lives of superheroes when the masks are removed and the high-tech gear is taken off is just as important as the extensive CGI fight sequences. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315094/wandavision-finale-marvel-mcu-scarlet-witch-doctor-strange-captain"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, those are the small moments between Wanda and Vision in what &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;have been their post-Thanos life. If &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167550/hawkeye-premiere-date-marvel-disney-plus-jeremy-renner-hailee-steinfeld-wandavision"&gt;Marvel’s upcoming &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye &lt;/em&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; finds its inspiration in Matt Fraction’s beloved &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye &lt;/em&gt;comic, it’s rooftop barbecues, sipping coffee in the morning, and looking for new cars to buy. In &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;, it’s Sam helping his nephews catch fish on the dock or Bucky trying online dating. Hell, Bucky in therapy is something ripped right out of Tumblr; that’s a compliment. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TLV7wuUZ4PDkB-gz32po0J0bBzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22379905/sam_cap_shield.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0xWcLO"&gt;Everyone is trying to figure out their identity just months after half the world’s population returned, and they’re trying to do it with undeniable legacies hanging over their heads. Without Steve Rogers (Captain America) and Tony Stark (Iron Man), two of the country’s greatest heroes are gone and a hole is left in their place. Sam doesn’t want to become the new Captain America. Bucky, aside from processing the guilt and trauma he received after his years of operating as the Winter Soldier, is being monitored by the government. The world might need a new Captain America to feel safe, but replacing Steve Rogers isn’t as simple as pointing to a new guy and saying “you’re it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWVE8S"&gt;Well, not to Sam. By the end of the episode, the government introduces a new Captain America (most &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-us-agent-wyatt-russell-john-walker-falcon-and-winter-soldier-explained"&gt;likely John Walker&lt;/a&gt;, who becomes US Agent and has his own colorful history). While the government tries to find a replacement for Steve Rogers back home, Sam is preparing to take on a new threat, one that will require Bucky’s help. Without a Steve or a Tony set to lead the charge, it’s up to them to stop whatever threat comes their way — even if that means putting the trials and tribulations of day-to-day life on hold. As Bucky tells his therapist, he’s never known life without running from battle to battle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoSgRb"&gt;It’s here that &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier &lt;/em&gt;has all the elements of a typical MCU movie. The pilot opens with a 10-minute action sequence (including the appearance of a &lt;em&gt;Winter Soldier &lt;/em&gt;favorite) and sets up the kind of mission-based action movie that Marvel fans love. It looks good, feels expensive, and teases a much more traditional MCU experience. Whereas &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;screamed experimental and abstract (in comparison to the greater MCU-at-large), &lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier &lt;/em&gt;can nestle perfectly in between every &lt;em&gt;Captain America &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Avengers &lt;/em&gt;installment. There are big fights, bigger explosions, and the promise of more bad guys. I mean, the episode opens with &lt;a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tv/486409-the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-brings-back-georges-st-pierre-as-batroc"&gt;Falcon fighting Batroc.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqZ9iC"&gt;There’s no question things are about to get explosive for the boys again. But it’s the quieter moments — Bucky trying to have a date with a girl at a bar without taking his gloves off because he doesn’t want to flash his metal arm, or Sam goofing around with his nephews — that make &lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier &lt;/em&gt;feel special. We’ve spent so long as fans getting to know the big-name superheroes that now feels like a perfect instance to get to know characters we didn’t get enough time with over the last decade: Wanda, Vision, Bucky, Sam, Clint Barton (Hawkeye). In fanfiction, one of the most popular settings is the Avengers crew living together in &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/26/22250482/wandavision-sitcom-coffee-shop-au"&gt;Avengers (nee Stark) Tower&lt;/a&gt;. People want to imagine their favorite superheroes going about their days just like anyone else. I love Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes just as much as I love stories about Falcon and Winter Soldier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRfq8c"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier &lt;/em&gt;winds up being Bucky and Sam palling around and figuring out who they are outside of battle — in between big fight sequences, of course — I’ll be happy. After all, we adore the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZD_EyT2FYc"&gt;party scene in &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Age of Ultron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for a reason. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Anti-capitalist’ Verkada hacker charged by US government with attacks on dozens of companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xEae8tdDJfnXPrC34ZZQysBsxK0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68992350/acastro_180109_1777_0002_v3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gBHzmA"&gt;A Swiss computer hacker named Till Kottmann has been &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/swiss-hacker-indicted-conspiracy-wire-fraud-and-aggravated-identity-theft"&gt;charged&lt;/a&gt; by the US government with multiple accounts of wire fraud, conspiracy, and identity theft. The indictment accuses Kottmann and co-conspirators of hacking “dozens of companies and government entities,” and posting private data and source code belonging to more than 100 firms online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujRUfZ"&gt;The 21-year-old Kottmann, who uses they / them pronouns and is better known as Tillie, was most recently connected to the security breach of US firm Verkada, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22322122/verkada-hack-150000-security-cameras-tesla-factory-cloudflare-jails-hospitals"&gt;exposed footage&lt;/a&gt; from more than 150,000 of the companies’ surveillance cameras. But the charges filed this week date back to 2019, with Kottmann and associates accused of targeting online code repositories (known as “gits”) belonging to major private and public sector entities, ripping their contents and sharing them to a website they founded and maintained named &lt;a href="http://git.rip/"&gt;git.rip&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k1p39y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Kottmann is linked to data breaches from Microsoft, Intel, Nissan, and more&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ub3zxp"&gt;Git.rip has since been seized by the FBI, but &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/verkada-hacker-charged-in-the-us-for-hacking-more-than-100-companies/"&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; shared code and data belonging to numerous companies including Microsoft, Intel, Nissan, Nintendo, Disney, AMD, Qualcomm, Motorola, Adobe, Lenovo, Roblox, and many others (though no firms are explicitly named in the indictment). The exact nature of this data varied in each case. A rip of hundreds of code repositories maintained by German automaker Daimler AG &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mercedes-benz-onboard-logic-unit-olu-source-code-leaks-online/"&gt;contained the source code&lt;/a&gt; for valuable smart car components, for example, while a breach of Nintendo’s systems (which Kottmann &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/uk/news/companies-source-code-leak"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; did not originate from them directly but which they reshared through a Telegram channel) offered gamers rare insight into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21347074/nintendo-gigaleak-controversy-history-preservation-archives"&gt;unreleased features from old games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJormt"&gt;In interviews &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mercedes-benz-onboard-logic-unit-olu-source-code-leaks-online/"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/source-code-from-dozens-of-companies-leaked-online/"&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/nissan-source-code-leaked-online-after-git-repo-misconfiguration/"&gt;breaches&lt;/a&gt;, Kottmann noted repeatedly that the data they found was usually exposed by companies’ own poor security standards. “I often just hunt for interesting GitLab instances, mostly with just simple Google dorks, when I’m bored, and I keep being amazed by how little thought seems to go into the security settings,” Kottmann &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mercedes-benz-onboard-logic-unit-olu-source-code-leaks-online/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in May 2020. (“Google dorks” or “Google dorking” &lt;a href="https://exposingtheinvisible.org/guides/google-dorking/"&gt;refers&lt;/a&gt; to the use of advanced search strings to find vulnerabilities on public servers using Google.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s6K9JC"&gt;In the case of the Verkada breach, Kottmann and their associates &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/hackers-expose-tesla-jails-in-breach-of-150-000-security-cams?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; found “super admin” credentials that gave them unfettered access to the company’s systems that were “publicly exposed on the internet.” These logins allowed the hackers to look through the live feeds of more than 150,000 internet-connected cameras. These cameras were installed in various facilities including prisons, hospitals, warehouses, and Tesla factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04Nbwo"&gt;Kottmann said they were motivated by a hacktivist spirit: wanting to expose the poor security work of corporations before malicious actors could cause greater damage. Kottmann &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/source-code-from-dozens-of-companies-leaked-online/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;BleedingComputer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;last June that they didn’t always contact companies before exposing their data, but that they attempted to prevent direct harm. “I try to do my best to prevent any major things resulting directly from my releases,” they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZIuMzH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Kottmann said they were motivated by an anti-capitalist ideology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7QtLyT"&gt;After the Verkada breach, Kottmann &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/hackers-expose-tesla-jails-in-breach-of-150-000-security-cams?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; their reasons for hacking were “lots of curiosity, fighting for freedom of information and against intellectual property, a huge dose of anti-capitalism, a hint of anarchism — and it’s also just too much fun not to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrfNh2"&gt;The US government, not surprisingly, takes a dimmer view of these activities. “Stealing credentials and data, and publishing source code and proprietary and sensitive information on the web is not protected speech — it is theft and fraud,” Acting U.S. Attorney Tessa M. Gorman said in a &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/swiss-hacker-indicted-conspiracy-wire-fraud-and-aggravated-identity-theft"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. “These actions can increase vulnerabilities for everyone from large corporations to individual consumers. Wrapping oneself in an allegedly altruistic motive does not remove the criminal stench from such intrusion, theft, and fraud.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLbw3n"&gt;The indictment includes as evidence, numerous tweets and messages sent by Kottmann using handles including @deletescape and @antiproprietary. These include a tweet sent on May 17, 2020 saying “i love helping companies open source their code;” messages to an unnamed associate soliciting “access to any confidential info, documents, binaries or source code;” and tweets sent on October 21 in which Kottmann said that “stealing and releasing” corporate data was “the morally correct thing to do.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HVWDCt"&gt;Kottmann is currently located in Lucerne, Switzerland, where their premises were recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328344/tillie-kottmann-hacker-raid-switzerland-verkada-cameras"&gt;raided by Swiss authorities&lt;/a&gt; and their devices seized. Whether or not they will be extradited to the US is unclear. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-19/verkada-hacker-charged-with-wire-fraud-identity-theft-in-u-s?"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Kottmann has retained the services of Zurich lawyer Marcel Bosonnet, who previously &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/switzerland-could-grant-edward-snowden-asylum-if-he-testifies-against-nsa-9718462.html"&gt;represented&lt;/a&gt; Edward Snowden. The charges against Kottmann carry up to 20 year prison sentences. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NFL significantly expands streaming deals as Amazon nabs Thursday Night exclusive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NFL: FEB 07 Super Bowl LV - Chiefs v Buccaneers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jJsVesxcwJoAa-nX_ZLkbGCJcOw=/0x0:4800x3200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68992237/1231052043.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Bowl LV was the most-streamed NFL game ever.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cliff Welch/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QNNUMS"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/NFL-COMPLETES-LONG-TERM-MEDIA-DISTRIBUTION-AGREEMENTS-PROVIDING-FANS-GREATER-ACCESS-TO-NFL-GAMES-THAN-EVER-BEFORE.aspx"&gt;NFL has signed&lt;/a&gt; long-term television and digital media rights agreements that greatly expand availability to a variety of streaming platforms. Notably, Amazon has scored exclusive rights to Thursday Night Football in the first ever all-digital package. The deal begins with the 2023 season and extends through 2033.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bOA6L"&gt;“NFL games are the most watched live programming in the United States, and this unprecedented Thursday Night Football package gives tens of millions of new and existing Prime members exclusive access to must-watch live football on Prime Video,” said Mike Hopkins, SVP of Prime Video and Amazon Studios in a press release announcing the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jTAmP"&gt;The ten-year deal is rumored to cost Amazon about $1 billion per year, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/nfl-media-rights-deal-2023-2033-amazon-gets-exclusive-thursday-night.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;’s sources&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon has been the NFL’s streaming media partner since 2017, streaming games on its Prime Video and Twitch platforms. Amazon Prime memberships cost $119 per year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OM7ZCi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rumored to cost Amazon about $1 billion per year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O1Sv5R"&gt;The NFL has also expanded its digital distribution deals to include ESPN Plus, Paramount Plus, Peacock, and Fox Digital platforms in order to augment broadcasts on CBS, Fox, NBC, and ESPN/ABC. The move should help the NFL reach a younger audience after viewership fell seven percent in the pandemic-stricken 2021 season. CBS’s AFC games will now also stream on Paramount Plus, Fox’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21184294/fox-tubi-acquisition-streaming-wars-news-sports-xumi-comcast-pluto-viacomcbs"&gt;Tubi service&lt;/a&gt; will stream NFC games, and Peacock will stream Sunday Night Football. All games that appear on ABC and ESPN will also stream on ESPN Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSmiCb"&gt;“These new media deals will provide our fans even greater access to the games they love. We’re proud to grow our partnerships with the most innovative media companies in the market,” said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRp7PJ"&gt;Beyond digital, the NFL says it remains committed to showing games for free on over-the-air broadcast television, signing new, 11-year deals with CBS, Fox, NBC, and ESPN / ABC that run through 2033. The major broadcast and cable TV packages for Sunday afternoon games, Sunday Night Football, and Monday Night Football are staying with the same networks. CBS, FOX, and NBC will each televise three Super Bowls through 2033 while ESPN/ABC will now carry two. The 2021 Super Bowl was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274255/super-bowl-55-2021-most-streamed-nfl-game-record"&gt;most-streamed NFL game ever&lt;/a&gt;, but also the least watched overall in more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHuHL7"&gt;In total, the NFL’s new media deals are thought to be worth over $100 billion, making it the most valuable media deal for any US sports league, according to &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfWRFQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inexplicably, YouTube says extremely racist Steven Crowder video isn’t hate speech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hJh317FmJaD6VnJbs6fRqG6_8ps=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68991001/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_4.38.41_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Steven Crowder’s YouTube channel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZMiIyo"&gt;YouTube removed an extremely racist video from conservative commentator Steven Crowder &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336028/youtube-steven-crowder-racist-video-removed-covid-misinformation-policies"&gt;this week&lt;/a&gt;, citing violations of the platform’s COVID-19 misinformation policy — not its hate speech policy — as the reason for the removal. Inexplicably, though, the video did not violate the company’s hate speech policies at all, &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/youtube-explains-why-a-racist-video-didnt-violate-its-hate-speech-rules-3d74befde097"&gt;the company told &lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, despite Crowder and his co-hosts making numerous racist comments about Black farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5i4jZ"&gt;“Our hate speech policy prohibits content promoting hatred against groups based on their race,” a YouTube spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt;. “While offensive, this video from the Steven Crowder channel does not violate this policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y2R1pw"&gt;If you were curious, here is &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801939?hl=en"&gt;YouTube’s full hate speech policy&lt;/a&gt;. And if you want to hear the offensive comments from Crowder’s show, &lt;em&gt;Media Matters&lt;/em&gt; clipped them in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JasonSCampbell/status/1371856007203336194"&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt;. I will warn you that they are awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bGsF9f"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On YouTube, Steven Crowder and his co-hosts go on a wildly racist tirade against Black farmers. &lt;a href="https://t.co/dbnKNN2Lch"&gt;https://t.co/dbnKNN2Lch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/iUsm2hjknb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iUsm2hjknb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Campbell (@JasonSCampbell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JasonSCampbell/status/1371856007203336194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uQNDpd"&gt;This means YouTube has a ridiculously high bar for hate speech, as &lt;em&gt;OneZero’s&lt;/em&gt; Will Oremus points out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="e864"&gt;You’re free to mock, caricature, and belittle people based on their race, just as long as you don’t come right out and say you literally hate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2TH1sT"&gt;While you could argue that YouTube’s just enforcing the policies it has, not the policies you might want, remember that YouTube has the ability to change those policies whenever it likes. That’s what it did &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/our-ongoing-work-to-tackle-hate"&gt;nearly two years ago in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, updating its hate speech policy “by specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities” including race and gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fUiQU"&gt;That &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;mean that hate speech doesn’t have to rise to the level of “promoting hatred” (the language YouTube used to &lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt;) to result in a policy violation, or to stop promoting Crowder as a YouTube Partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27XT0F"&gt;Speaking of which, YouTube &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; said in that 2019 post that it would take action on hate speech that comes “right up to the line” as well, warning that “Channels that repeatedly brush up against our hate speech policies will be suspended from the YouTube Partner program.” In 2020, after Crowder’s YouTube Partner status was originally reinstated, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365601/youtube-steven-crowder-monetization-reinstated-harassment-carlos-maza"&gt;YouTube told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it would “take appropriate action” if there were more violations on his channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BMPCr"&gt;What will it take now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hUzYUt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"YouTube decides that homophobic harassment does not violate its policies","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18653088/youtube-steven-crowder-carlos-maza-harassment-bullying-enforcement-verdict"},{"title":"YouTube will let Steven Crowder run ads after year-long suspension for harassment","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365601/youtube-steven-crowder-monetization-reinstated-harassment-carlos-maza"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Cricut completely unravels subscription plans that would limit its crafting machines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M_tYVaTbfkX-oO2gb_frNm5DCzQ=/298x0:3850x2368/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68990913/Screen_Shot_2021_03_15_at_11.39.19_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Cricut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="31mCVT"&gt;Cricut has announced &lt;a href="https://inspiration.cricut.com/dear-cricut-community-from-ashish-arora-ceo/"&gt;in a new blog post&lt;/a&gt; that its automated cutting and printing craft machine will no longer require a subscription for unlimited uploads next year. The company took a step back when it announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334798/cricut-postpones-subscription-unlimited-uploads"&gt;it would postpone the change&lt;/a&gt; until 2022. But now Cricut CEO Ashish Arora is reversing the company’s plans entirely, guaranteeing Cricut machines will work how they’ve always worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DghOpX"&gt;“We’ve made the decision to reverse our previously shared plans. Right now, every member can upload an unlimited number of images and patterns to Design Space for free, and we have no intention to change this policy. This is true whether you’re a current Cricut member or are thinking about joining the Cricut family before or after December 31, 2021,” Arora writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdeAxv"&gt;Limits on uploads to Cricut’s required Design Space app were a contentious issue for regular Cricut crafters. While Design Space can work as separate creation software, many users prefer to create their art in other applications and bring them into Design Space to finalize them, before their Cricut cuts them out of paper, fabric and other materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9yaDX"&gt;In Cricut’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332212/cricut-crafting-machine-design-space-upload-limit"&gt;controversial plan&lt;/a&gt;, the company offered 20 Design Space uploads per month for free, and locked unlimited uploads behind a paid Cricut Access subscription. The move did not go over well with users, who were not only used to having unlimited uploads for free, but also wanted to avoid additional costs, or being forced to use Design Space for the entirety of their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxW241"&gt;Cricut’s original response seemed to satisfy a lot of its customers, but now the company has gone a step further and made its subscription plan what it started out as, an add-on, rather than a requirement for normal use.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is working on a version of Instagram for kids under 13</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JlTaBeWU5zGNFfskedMaZcYo6uo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68990588/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fgxoSP"&gt;Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri confirms that a version of the popular photo sharing app for children under 13 is in the works, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-instagram-for-children-under-13"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The Facebook-owned company knows a lot of kids want to use Instagram, Mosseri said, but there isn’t a “detailed plan yet,” according to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nTYa6R"&gt;“But part of the solution is to create a version of Instagram for young people or kids where parents have transparency or control,” Mosseri told &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s one of the things we’re exploring.” Instagram’s current policy bars children under 13 from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ytrhwa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Kids are increasingly asking their parents if they can join apps that help them keep up with their friends. A version of Instagram where parents have control, like we did w/ Messenger Kids, is something we’re exploring. We’ll share more down the road.&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Mosseri   (@mosseri) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1372691059348631555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sWBT7H"&gt;“Increasingly kids are asking their parents if they can join apps that help them keep up with their friends,” Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Right now there aren’t many options for parents, so we’re working on building additional products — like we did with Messenger Kids — that are suitable for kids, managed by parents. We’re exploring bringing a parent-controlled experience to Instagram to help kids keep up with their friends, discover new hobbies and interests, and more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe7pue"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; obtained a message from an internal messaging board where Instagram vice president of product Vishal Shah said a “youth pillar” project has been identified as a priority by the company. Its Community Product Group will focus on privacy and safety issues “to ensure the safest possible experience for teens,” Shah wrote in the post. Mosseri would oversee the project along with vice president Pavni Diwanji, who oversaw YouTube Kids while she was at Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b0aUmA"&gt;Instagram &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/continuing-to-make-instagram-safer-for-the-youngest-members-of-our-community"&gt;published a blog post&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week describing its work to make the platform safe for its youngest users, but made no mention of a new version for kids under 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uL8Geb"&gt;Targeting online products at children under 13 is fraught not only with concerns about privacy, but legal issues as well. In September 2019, the Federal Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20848949/google-ftc-youtube-child-privacy-violations-fine-170-milliion-coppa-ads"&gt;fined Google $170 million&lt;/a&gt; for tracking the viewing histories of children to serve ads to them on YouTube, a violation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). TikTok precursor Musical.ly was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/27/18243312/tiktok-ftc-fine-musically-children-coppa-age-gate"&gt;fined $5.7 million&lt;/a&gt; for violating COPPA in February of 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfgWHq"&gt;Facebook launched an ad-free version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/4/16725494/facebook-messenger-kids-app-launch-ios-iphone-preview"&gt;Messenger chat platform for kids in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, intended for kids between the ages of 6 and 12. Children’s health advocates criticized it as harmful for kids and &lt;a href="https://commercialfreechildhood.org/wp-content/uploads/archive/devel-generate/gaw/FBMessengerKids.pdf"&gt;urged CEO Mark Zuckerberg to discontinue&lt;/a&gt; it. Then in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20706250/facebook-messenger-kids-bug-chat-app-unauthorized-adults"&gt;2019, a bug in Messenger Kids&lt;/a&gt; allowed children to join groups with strangers, leaving thousands of kids in chats with unauthorized users. Facebook quietly closed those unauthorized chats, which it said affected “a small number” of users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ifrpk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 18th, 7:46PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added tweet from Adam Mosseri.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus CEO announces there will be a third, less-expensive phone called the OnePlus 9R</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UbXIal"&gt;A third phone in the upcoming OnePlus 9 series has been confirmed by the company’s CEO, in &lt;a href="https://www.news18.com/news/tech/exclusive-oneplus-9r-signals-return-of-the-flagship-killer-gaming-credentials-and-made-for-india-3547673.html"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;News18&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/18/oneplus-ceo-confirms-affordably-priced-oneplus-9r-coming-to-india/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The announcement, which is coming just five days before the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334396/oneplus-9-march-23rd-event-rumor-announcement-roundup-smartwatch-cameras"&gt;OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro are set to be fully revealed&lt;/a&gt;, confirms rumors that OnePlus would also be announcing a less expensive phone in addition to its new flagships. So far, though, the phone is only confirmed to be coming to India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJZe5R"&gt;In the interview, OnePlus CEO Pete Lau says that the company wants “to go even further” than it did with the OnePlus Nord, in regards to the included tech and design. Depending on how closely you follow OnePlus, you may remember the Nord as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;mid-range phone that was available in Europe and India&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;as a budget phone released in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Which part of the price-to-performance spectrum OnePlus is targeting isn’t clear yet, though some of Lau’s comments indicate that it may be closer to the mid-range end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MPEI7P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We expect gaming phones to be specced out with the latest and greatest&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YngCTR"&gt;He says the phone will feature 5G, and talks &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; about gaming in relation to the 9R, saying that the company wants the phone to provide “fast and smooth experiences” for “heavy gameplay.” The “smooth experiences” and “smooth scrolling” references suggest that, like with its recent budget phones, OnePlus will probably include a 90Hz or faster display. As for the gaming focus, that may be more of a marketing focus than a hardware one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPfgl2"&gt;The 9R &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-lite-snapdragon-865-will-launch-alongside-oneplus-9-9-pro"&gt;is rumored to have a Snapdragon 865&lt;/a&gt;, a processor from last year — where usually we expect gaming phones to be specced out with the latest and greatest chips. For example, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;ROG Phone 5&lt;/a&gt; has the Snapdragon 888, up to 18GB of RAM, and a 144Hz screen. None of that is exactly cost-friendly, so perhaps OnePlus’s claims that it’ll be for heavy gamers should be taken with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84HkgV"&gt;The rest of the interview is light on concrete details, with Lau not talking about pricing or availability outside of India, but it does give an idea of what OnePlus is thinking about for the 9R. With the event just around the corner, it may not long before we find out for sure.
