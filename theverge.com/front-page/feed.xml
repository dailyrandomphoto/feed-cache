    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A3RZmg"&gt;This pandemic has taken millions of lives around the world — and researchers are realizing that the true death toll may be much higher than the official numbers we see every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5X84z"&gt;As of May 3rd, the death toll in the US officially stood at 574,043, but a &lt;a href="http://www.healthdata.org/news-release/covid-19-has-caused-69-million-deaths-globally-more-double-what-official-reports-show"&gt;new analysis&lt;/a&gt; published this week by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) estimates that the actual toll is 905,289. IHME is a health research center based at the University of Washington that specializes in measuring global health on a population level. Its new analysis estimates that the global death toll due to COVID-19 stands at 6.93 million, not 3.24 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="m0kDR0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WHRbCn"&gt;The key word here is “estimate.” The researchers looked at countries around the world that reported deaths on a weekly or monthly basis. They compared that with COVID-19 testing data and many other variables to build a computer model that could estimate the death toll from COVID-19, taking into account that people died of other causes. Using that method, they found that almost every country was undercounting their deaths due to the pandemic and that their actual death tolls were much higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHQMsK"&gt;That lines up with other analyses from around the world that have found that some areas are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/10/world/europe/covid-russia-death.html"&gt;drastically&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/non-stop-cremations-cast-doubt-indias-counting-covid-dead-2021-04-19/"&gt;undercounting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-covid-19-death-toll-is-even-worse-than-it-looks-11610636840"&gt;their COVID dead&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s also important to note that not everyone agrees with the shockingly high numbers found in the new analysis. Other studies into excess deaths have found much lower totals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XFpVd"&gt;“Their estimate of excess deaths is enormous and inconsistent with our research and others,” Steven Woolf &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/05/06/994287048/new-study-estimates-more-than-900-000-people-have-died-of-covid-19-in-u-s"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;NPR’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;s Becky Sullivan&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Woolf led a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778361?resultClick=1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that found that excess deaths in the US were around 20 percent higher than they should have been. “There are a lot of assumptions and educated guesses built into their model.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaOvvS"&gt;The problem isn’t unique to deaths. Back in April 2020, Nicole Wetsman wrote about how it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241402/infection-count-coronavirus-cases-survellience-flu-hospital-sewage-data"&gt;impossible for us to track every case of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. That’s still true. Public health officials can only track the people who notice symptoms or seek out treatment or testing. And that’s in places where treatments or testing is available, which isn’t the case everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYc4HE"&gt;It’s always hard to count every case and even every death in any large outbreak, much less a pandemic. People aren’t perfect record-keepers, even when it comes to life and death. Often, our records come down to what the person writing thought was important — and whether they happened to record that information in a way that future generations could understand. Historians are still arguing over the death toll for the Black Plague, which killed &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21539483/covid-19-black-death-plagues-in-history"&gt;anywhere from 25 million to 200 million people&lt;/a&gt;, depending on who you ask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmRIxU"&gt;Things got a little better last century when we were wrestling with the 1918 flu. The US did keep tabs on deaths throughout the states — well, most of them. Mortality statistics in 1918 were only gathered for 31 “registration” states that represented about 75 percent of the population at the time, &lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20210329.51293/full/"&gt;according to a fascinating blog&lt;/a&gt; in Health Affairs. To get the estimated death toll, they took the death tolls in the registration states and just added 25 percent to the total. But the population in those registration states wasn’t exactly the same as the population of the rest of the country. People in registration states were more likely to be white and live in urban areas than people living in non-registration states. 1918’s estimate was certainly better than the information that we have for the Black Plague, but it’s not a full picture of that death toll either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0O9rml"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tracking a slow-rolling disaster like a pandemic is brutally hard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aRfnR1"&gt;Today, we gather a lot more data, but we’re still not perfect. That’s why it’s taking models to estimate the still-growing toll of the pandemic. Not everyone who dies gets tested for COVID, and in some parts of the world, testing and treatments remain inconsistent. Even the dead we know about slip through the cracks. In New York, refrigerated trucks are &lt;a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/missing-them/2021/5/6/22423844/new-york-covid-victims-still-in-trucks-on-brooklyn-pier"&gt;still being used to hold people&lt;/a&gt; who have died of COVID as they await burial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1XIeb"&gt;Tracking a slow-rolling disaster like a pandemic is brutally hard. It means looking at the names and birthdates and death dates and adding all those lives together into a faceless number too big for our brains to wrestle with. It can feel easier to push it away and wrestle with the things we can control instead and just let the numbers pile up uncounted, shoved in a cold truck on a pier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0JdrC"&gt;But ignoring the costs and accepting our statistical shortcomings won’t help us in the long run. A more accurate accounting of our dead might help people understand more about how this disease can overtake our defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2ZdFT"&gt;“We need to better understand the impact of COVID across the globe so that countries can understand the trajectory of the pandemic and figure out where to deploy additional resources, like testing supplies and vaccines to stop the spread,” epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/05/06/994287048/new-study-estimates-more-than-900-000-people-have-died-of-covid-19-in-u-s"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbBnU6"&gt;Maybe — just maybe — we can learn from our mistakes — or at the very least, maybe we can stop making the same ones over and over. &lt;/p&gt;

But experts are also bracing for a new set of problems that may hit when the pandemic ends. (Andrew Joseph / &lt;em&gt;STAT&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberattack prompts shutdown of major fuel pipeline in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Colonial Pipeline victim of cyberattack" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7GCiphbs72gAypOxY1fi7GvdHbY=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69256608/608064478.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Colonial Pipeline says it was victim of cyberattack | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rquAdU"&gt;One of the largest pipelines in the US has been taken offline by its operator following a cyberattack. First &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/08/us/cyberattack-colonial-pipeline.html"&gt;reported by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Colonial Pipeline, which carries 45 percent of the fuel supplies for the eastern US, &lt;a href="https://www.colpipe.com/news/press-releases/media-statement-colonial-pipeline-system-disruption"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; late Friday that it took “certain systems offline to contain the threat, which has temporarily halted all pipeline operations and affected some of our IT systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O3mR5y"&gt;The pipeline is 5,500 miles long and carries jet fuel and refined gasoline from the Gulf Coast to New York, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, transporting some 2.5 million barrels daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8I1mb4"&gt;It’s not yet clear whether the attack targeted Colonial’s industrial control systems, or if there was ransomware or malware involved. Alpharetta, Georgia-based Colonial said it had engaged a “leading third-party cybersecurity firm to investigate the nature and scope of the incident, and has contacted law enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="PiagIw"&gt;Colonial Pipeline is taking steps to understand and resolve this issue. At this time, our primary focus is the safe and efficient restoration of our service and our efforts to return to normal operation. This process is already underway, and we are working diligently to address this matter and to minimize disruption to our customers and those who rely on Colonial Pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8zrUZh"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that it was unlikely that the shutdown would cause immediate disruption to consumers, since most of the fuel goes into storage tanks, and the US has seen a reduction in energy use due to the pandemic. How long the pipeline may remain shut down was still unclear Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6E9b5u"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why even the studios behind bestselling games shut down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Press Reset by Jason Schreier cover" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/By0jtHNIJIlneSQjAY929i3yY2Y=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69256439/pressresetcover.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Ruin and recovery in the video game industry&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="bpwn9O"&gt;In March 2013, Irrational Games released &lt;em&gt;BioShock Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, the third game in the bestselling &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt; shooter series. It should have been a triumphant moment — early reviews were strong, the game shipped millions of copies, and the developers started work on an expansion called &lt;em&gt;Burial At Sea&lt;/em&gt;. But less than a year later, studio head Ken Levine called employees into the kitchen for an all-hands meeting. He told them that Irrational — the team behind one of the last decade’s most acclaimed and successful series, just weeks from releasing its final chapter — was shutting down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="fR7Pd1"&gt;Irrational is one of several studios featured in &lt;em&gt;Press Reset: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry. Press Reset&lt;/em&gt; is the second book from Jason Schreier, a &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; journalist known for his detailed inside looks at studios like &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-rockstar-games-culture-of-crunch-1829936466"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption&lt;/em&gt; developer Rockstar&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a loosely connected postmortem of teams that worked on everything from ambitious roleplaying games to widely loathed freemium titles — often bleak but also intriguing, hopeful, and sometimes darkly funny. In an interview before the book’s release, I spoke with Schreier about how a volatile industry can move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="bioshock infinite" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DADfjssQbHhVbZ9JEX67fQxWQfY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/2404983/bioshock-infinite.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SpNsC7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfHI7R"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you see as the biggest common thread between why the studios in your book closed and the biggest differences between them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkcYXT"&gt;The biggest thread is always money in some way or another. It’s always like: “We ran out of money,” or “We don’t think that this is going to lead to enough money,” or “This is not going to lead to enough growth,” or “We need this money for something else.” It all comes back to just the flaws of unregulated late-stage capitalism and the issues that causes and the insatiable need for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6br2qg"&gt;A lot of times, that’s oversimplifying it, though. One of the things that I found over the course of reporting for this book was that layoffs and studio shutdowns can happen for all sorts of reasons. Some of them are logical. Some of them are not so logical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LGeP2O"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of the practices don’t just seem exploitative; they seem really counterproductive. Like studios that will staff up a whole expert first-person shooter team, and then abruptly change direction for the game and hire a new team, and then switch back again and have lost all of the people that they managed to collect before. Are there rational reasons for that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ap5WJ"&gt;I was thinking about this a lot last night because last night was the NFL draft, and I’m a big fan. But one of the things that is so infuriating about the NFL and a lot of sports organizations is that the people making the decisions, the general managers and the head coaches, are on very short leashes. They know that if they underperform for two or three years in a row, they will get fired. It’s not in their best interests to be like, “Okay, what will this move now mean for our team five years from now, 10 years from now? Will it leave us screwed because we spent all our money on these players and they’re not actually very good, or will set us up in a position to succeed because we have all these extra draft picks?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wwc9fY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have this messed-up system where people are rewarded for thinking short-term”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zsh5as"&gt;And I feel like the video game industry is very, very similar. Because you have these executives — some of whom might have the freedom to think about like, “Okay, what is the company like five years, 10 years from now?” But a lot of them have to think about their next fiscal quarter, especially these publicly traded companies where there’s not a lot of patience from shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNCYxy"&gt;If you’re not delivering on growth — and exponential growth — every single quarter, every single year, then you are seen as a failure to shareholders. It’s difficult, if not impossible, for the people making the decision to think in terms of, what is the studio’s roadmap going to look like 10 years from now? We have this messed-up system where people are rewarded for thinking short-term, even if it damages everybody in the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCou4H"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About half the book traces the genealogy of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Shock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and the people who worked on things related to it like &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BioShock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Did that just happen as you followed leads, or do you think there’s something distinctly noteworthy about that lineage? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYTyvq"&gt;First of all, I think that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersive_sim"&gt;immersive sims&lt;/a&gt;, because they’re critically acclaimed but tend to not sell exceptionally well, they tend to be tied to some of these big studio shutdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPApOu"&gt;But also, my first book was structured in a way where you could pick up any chapter in the book and read it and get a lot out of it without having to read the rest. For &lt;em&gt;Press Reset&lt;/em&gt;, I wanted it to feel more like one ongoing narrative. And one of the things I wanted to do there was look at a company like [&lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt; developer] Irrational and then trace back the lineage there with [&lt;em&gt;System Shock&lt;/em&gt; producer] Warren Spector and then also look at some of the people who came out of that, and then look over to the side to [&lt;em&gt;BioShock 2&lt;/em&gt; developer] 2K Marin. I wanted this to feel like more of an overarching story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9lf8o"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/getdizzzy/status/636198494093606912"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a tweet I like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; about how everyone who worked on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BioShock &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;went on to make their own &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BioShock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfisJB"&gt;I was pretty surprised at how much success in the indie sphere came out of the ashes of Irrational and 2K Marin. So many cool indie games can just be traced back to that same lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KXZdHX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The gaming community as a whole can be really draining”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m8Axky"&gt;And really, it all, I think, traces back to Warren Spector, who I think is a really fascinating person. I think he would want to give credit to other people as well, which is totally fair — like Doug Church and Paul Neurath and some of the other folks from that era. But a lot of people were inspired by his philosophy, which is very much the game-making philosophy of putting the tools in the player’s hands rather than the designer’s, which I think is has been incredibly influential on all sorts of games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qh7okB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the chapter about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper_(2014_video_game)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dungeon Keeper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, you allude to fans telling the developers to kill themselves in this incredibly matter-of-fact aside — like, “Yeah, that’s how the games industry works.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qkptb8"&gt;I hope people pick up on that being as wry as it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="furh4z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What role do you think gaming fandom plays in the trajectory of the games industry? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3R2qbQ"&gt;I think mostly negative. But I think that also one of the interesting things about that chapter is that, toward the end, the folks who went on to make &lt;em&gt;Enter the Gungeon&lt;/em&gt; after &lt;em&gt;Dungeon Keeper&lt;/em&gt; found that they had their own Reddit community, and they were kind of wincing, bracing themselves for it, only to find that it was only positive responses and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SM8Jpx"&gt;But yeah, I think that the gaming community as a whole can be really draining for a lot of people. I think if you actually talk to a lot of game developers behind the scenes, a lot of them are very scared and exhausted by their audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfB2So"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the same time, one of the themes of the book is that ongoing games that involve creating some kind of relationship with an audience are one path forward for developers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ckYmA"&gt;There are a lot of people doing really cool things in that space. Like you think of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and other big moneymakers. But in the book, I talk about &lt;em&gt;The Blackout Club&lt;/em&gt;, which I think is a really cool example of how game developers are doing creative stuff in that space — it’s essentially online interactive theater, which is wild to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rotqOC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There are ways to cultivate an audience of chill people”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H2Hs81"&gt;I think when you do something like that, and you know it’s not going to be super big, there are ways to cultivate an audience of chill people and not have to deal with the shitheads that often show up when you’re dealing with bigger-scale things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1VDic"&gt;This is a thought that’s just occurring to me now, so it’s a little bit half-baked. But I think that one of the problems with internet communities is because they have no max limit, once they hit a certain size, they’re always going to bring in just shitty people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZqVCf"&gt;If you were an online game developer and you were to be able to say, like, “I just want 20,000 people to buy my game and that’s it. I don’t want more than that. I don’t want to be a millionaire. I just want to have a bunch of good people who get what we’re trying to do,” then that might lead to something cool. But then you get into what I was talking about earlier, with this need for constant growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kf3Zuf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think the pandemic has shifted the industry in a meaningful way — especially with remote work since one of the problems for a lot of the people in the book is that they have to move to a specific city for a studio and then they’re locked in there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gv0Oz9"&gt;Yes — yes, yes, yes. I finished up most of my book probably a week before it started. And to see now, after a year and a half, that people actually have been able to be productive from home remotely — to make that potentially an option moving forward would really just change everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpnkMH"&gt;Because what I’ve been told is that that’s the worst part. Is not only not getting to see your friends again or having to look for a new job, but knowing that you might have to move 3,000 miles for your next job. That uproots your life. You might have to pull your kids out of school. You might just say, “Hey, I’m not going to do this. So I guess I’ll just have to leave the video game industry entirely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7StmeV"&gt;A lot of the burnout that I explored and talked about in the book is the result of that. And I think if game companies said, “You know what, actually we’re going to be a lot more accepting of remote work. We’re going to hire people from anywhere. It doesn’t matter where,” I think it would really just change everything and create a more healthy, sustainable environment for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="nY9Zzp"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Press Reset: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;will be released on May 11th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE Blade 11 Prime review: wireless charging for under $200</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re already invested in a wireless charging lifestyle, the Blade 11 Prime is a budget phone to match it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="FhlERh"&gt;The ZTE Blade 11 Prime offers one standout feature in a field of largely similar sub-$200 phones: wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCrkxr"&gt;In the smartphone trickle-down economy, wireless charging is basically guaranteed on any flagship-level phone, but it’s still hit-and-miss among midrange phones and all but absent from the budget class. You’re much more likely to find a really big battery on a sub-$200 phone than wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvbdFz"&gt;Outside of that feature, the $192 Blade 11 Prime’s specs are much the same as competing models like the Galaxy A12 and Moto G Play. Like those models, it offers a 6.5-inch 720p LCD, though it includes a little more RAM (4GB compared to 3GB) and a little less battery capacity (4,000mAh compared to 5,000mAh).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4iWF3f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10488560"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tNoWZ2"&gt;Choosing a phone that’s priced under $500 means you need to pick your priorities carefully, and that’s even more true of a $200 phone. If wireless charging is your chosen priority, then I have good news: the ZTE Blade 11 Prime is the budget-priced phone for you. If it’s not a major priority and more of a nice-to-have item, then I’d suggest looking elsewhere. You won’t do a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; better on any individual feature, like a better screen or camera, but you can do a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H7aGzfYqtO3jDkBBbJVlrwVscPs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499384/DSC00618.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Blade 11 Prime supports the Qi wireless charging standard at 5W.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZXqSGm"&gt;ZTE Blade 11 Prime screen, battery, and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0RE5qQ"&gt;The Blade 11 Prime is on the bigger side with a 6.5-inch display. Its 720p resolution is stretched a little thin here, and you’ll notice certain images looking a little pixelated if you look closely. The screen gets nice and bright, but its auto-brightness setting kept bringing the level down a little too dim for my liking. I also noticed faint repeating vertical lines on dark parts of the screen indicative of a low-quality panel — not a huge distraction but visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCGzys"&gt;It doesn’t have the biggest battery in its class, but the Blade 11’s battery performance is generally good anyway. I got about two days of light, mostly Wi-Fi use on a single charge. Spending a full day out and about on LTE would drain the battery faster, but most people could expect to get through at least a full day of heavy use before needing to charge up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lA0FtC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Blade 11 Prime’s marquee feature, wireless charging, works well if a little slowly&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="84Tx3H"&gt;The Blade 11 Prime’s marquee feature, wireless charging, works well if a little slowly; the phone supports Qi charging at 5W. Taking it from 50 percent to a full charge took almost exactly two hours, during which the phone got warm but not worryingly so. As long as you don’t expect incredible speeds, wireless charging is a convenient option on the Blade 11 Prime, particularly if you’re the type of person who charges your phone overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFG6iS"&gt;We don’t expect dazzling processing speed from a $200 phone, but the ZTE Blade 11 Prime falls a little short even considering its price. It uses a MediaTek MT6762 Helio P22 chipset with a relatively healthy 4GB of RAM, but this combination struggles with even light tasks like scrolling through Instagram or Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XvFtlB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There was significant stuttering and hesitation just browsing my usual social media timelines&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SSJlfT"&gt;Apps open quickly enough, but there was significant stuttering and hesitation just browsing my usual social media timelines or scrolling through the home screen app drawer. Some slowness is expected in this price bracket, but I didn’t see as much consistent stuttering using the Motorola Moto G Play recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyYQzw"&gt;The ZTE Blade 11 Prime ships with Android 11, which is nice — some of its slightly less recent competitors are still on 10 waiting for an update. ZTE says there’s no plan to offer any additional Android OS upgrades, only that it will offer security patches as needed. That’s not too surprising given the phone’s price point; the Blade 11 Prime just isn’t built for longevity past a couple of years of use. There’s also 64GB of built-in storage, which isn’t a lot. If you don’t download too many apps or store too many photos on your device, you’ll be able to get by, otherwise adding a microSD card for additional storage to your purchase is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZCrwittUPuG9PycMvyuvK3xxNJ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499278/ajohnson_20210503_4571_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Camera hardware is modest: on the rear panel, you’ll find a 16-megapixel main and 8-megapixel ultrawide camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LNR8HQ"&gt;ZTE Blade 11 Prime camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3ytKxp"&gt;The rear camera system on the Blade 11 Prime includes a 16-megapixel main camera and an 8-megapixel ultrawide, plus a 2-megapixel depth sensor. It’s a basic setup, and it does fine in good lighting conditions. It’s a little more prone to clipping very bright spots in photos than other systems I’ve used recently, but it does a nice job overall with exposures of high-contrast scenes. In moderate indoor lighting, some detail-smoothing noise reduction is visible, and low-light photos look smeary even at the reduced image sizes used for social sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hslgFB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10488604"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QZ7zW0"&gt;As for the other cameras, they’re just fine. The ultrawide doesn’t handle high-contrast scenes as well as the main camera, with some noticeable noise appearing in shadows. There’s also a short delay after pressing the shutter button before you can take another photo that isn’t present when using the main camera. The selfie camera thankfully avoids over-smoothing faces, and photos look good as long as there’s plenty of available light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wIM3M88y4fLAFcJpaUPhyJED2Gc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499279/ajohnson_20210503_4571_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you aren’t already a wireless charging devotee, it would be best to look elsewhere in the budget phone class.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="GHIFo6"&gt;If your budget is strict and wireless charging is a must-have, then the ZTE Blade 11 Prime is the right phone for you. But if you can make do without wireless charging, I’d strongly encourage you to look elsewhere. Iffy performance with basic tasks will be more of an inconvenience in the long run than having to plug in your phone every night to charge it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BrrNaH"&gt;This year’s Motorola Moto G Power would be a worthwhile alternative if you can spend a little more; you’ll get a faster processor and better battery life, though you should definitely plan on buying a microSD card to supplement its meager 32GB of storage. The G Play is a good alternative, too, even with a processor that’s a bit slower than the G Power’s.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TiVo’s first Android TV dongle also appears to be its last</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Ja3j4Nh2Tm67PIsOBbj4HcjZFA=/0x1:1043x696/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69255798/streamer_horizontal_media_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aZMaKW"&gt;Last May, TiVo attempted to muscle in on Roku and Amazon with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250348/tivo-stream-4k-release-date-news-features-streaming-dongle-hdmi"&gt;an HDMI streaming dongle of its own&lt;/a&gt; — the $70 TiVo Stream 4K, which traded in the company’s traditional live TV + DVR functionality for the likes of Sling TV, Netflix, HBO and YouTube. It now appears that attempt was so unsuccessful, the company’s planning to abandon its Android TV dongle efforts entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koXBuF"&gt;Xperi Holdings CEO Jon Kirchner explained &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4424831-xperi-holding-corporation-xper-ceo-jon-kirchner-on-q1-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript"&gt;in an earnings call&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://zatznotfunny.com/2021-05/tivo-to-leave-android-tv/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zatz Not Funny&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that it no longer feels it can compete using Android TV — the company likes to think its differentiator is a content guide that surfaces and lets you search for shows and movies across a variety of apps, but now that Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494298/chromecast-google-tv-preview-android-features"&gt;already baked something like that&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21492549/google-tv-app-play-movies-name-change-chromecast"&gt;its new “Google TV” layer on top of Android TV&lt;/a&gt; and sells it for just $50, TiVo doesn’t see much of a future there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7YtJV"&gt;Here’s Kirchner, as transcribed by &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4424831-xperi-holding-corporation-xper-ceo-jon-kirchner-on-q1-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seeking Alpha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5HMQqr"&gt;Sure, so originally as we approached the combination, we have done a lot of planning around kind of a three phase approach, starting with the Stream 4K product, which is a dongle that attaches to TVs, moving into an embedded application, where we’ll be let’s say the preferred user interface choice on a broader platform but originally around the notion that it would live on top of Android TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLEPg7"&gt;And then thirdly, going all the way into a much deeper embedded solution, embedded OS where we’re a bigger provider, where we’re really the sole primary interface for the broader content search and discovery and engagement. What has changed is last fall, Google came out and said that they intend to go beyond their core OS level offering and really get into the UX business, and in so doing it eclipses one’s ability to I think reasonably be an alternative that might otherwise live on their lower level platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1JSvzh"&gt;Instead, says Kirchner, he wants to embed TiVo smarts directly in TVs — a strategy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220330/roku-tv-number-one-smart-os-us-canada-2020"&gt;that’s worked pretty dang well for Roku&lt;/a&gt;, and where Amazon has been competing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/20/18693634/amazon-fire-tv-dolby-vision-toshiba-announced-features"&gt;with Fire TV Edition sets&lt;/a&gt; for a few years, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7n7xu"&gt;Here’s the thing, though: while the Stream 4K was well-reviewed, &lt;em&gt;it wasn’t the user interface&lt;/em&gt; that reviewers liked. Some of its most glowing reviews called it &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/tivo-stream-4k"&gt;cluttered&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/tivo-stream-4k-review/"&gt;confusing&lt;/a&gt; compared to the competition, and most concluded that it was just fine compared to slicker offerings from Roku and Amazon at or under that price. TiVo dropped the starting price of the Stream 4K &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250348/tivo-stream-4k-release-date-news-features-streaming-dongle-hdmi"&gt;to $50 at launch&lt;/a&gt;, and reduced it to $39 in December after Google’s $50 Chromecast had arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ceNcBP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best streaming device to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="brQpR3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is using Itch.io’s ‘offensive and sexualized’ games as a cudgel against Epic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tT0Hd1dfQt_ZVA89FAixcczFMnY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69255493/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CCK048"&gt;Shortly before the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, Epic Games made an interesting announcement: it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22395997/epic-games-store-pc-apps-windows-store-brave-discord-itch"&gt;offer the indie game storefront Itch.io&lt;/a&gt; as an app on its own Epic Games Store. The &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; publisher was going to trial with the aim of making Apple offer competing app stores on its iPhone and iPad, so the move showed that Epic was willing to open up its own store in the same way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvW3Gj"&gt;On the fifth day of court, however, Apple tried to turn Itch.io into a liability — by telling Epic Games Store general manager Steven Allison about “so-called adult games” that were “so offensive we cannot speak about them here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0dcRl"&gt;Itch.io is one of relatively few non-game apps on the Epic Games Store, along with software like the Brave browser. It’s also, as we’ve previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/29/18118217/itchio-steam-leaf-corcoran-pc-games-indie"&gt;described it at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “small and weird.” (Granted, it’s not &lt;em&gt;quite &lt;/em&gt;as small as Epic seems to think; CEO Tim Sweeney said it had “at least hundreds” of games, while the real number is &lt;a href="https://itch.io/blog/108659/there-are-200000-games-on-itchio-heres-how-to-find-your-new-favorite"&gt;upwards of 200,000&lt;/a&gt;.) Epic hasn’t reviewed all these games, and Apple noted that its standards are different from the Epic Games Store’s. The list includes, per Apple’s attorney, a game called &lt;em&gt;Sisterly Lust &lt;/em&gt;that includes “a list of fetishes which include many words that are not appropriate for us to speak in federal courts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Rln4m"&gt;Apple is notoriously wary of sexual or even debatably offensive content in its App Store. Until mid-2016, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/16/3879194/apple-app-store-guidelines-tell-game-developers-to-avoid-serious-themes"&gt;it told game developers&lt;/a&gt; that “if you want to criticize a religion, write a book. If you want to describe sex, write a book or a song, or create a medical app.” Epic is suing for the right to sideload alternative app stores like the Epic Games Store onto iOS. Today, Apple essentially warned Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers that this would mean forcing Apple to indirectly allow a sexualized visual novel about incest (I’d call it a game, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425774/epic-apple-roblox-fortnite-store-game-trial-day-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; witnesses&lt;/a&gt; have offered several conflicting definitions of that) onto the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYA5QQ"&gt;That’s probably not great for Epic. Judge Rogers seemed to take the concern seriously, asking Allison to explain whether Apple was correct. Allison demurred, although he later pushed back on Apple’s veiled suggestion that Epic kick Itch.io off the Epic Games Store. “Itch.io is an incredible community for developers that we support fully,” Allison said, “they have an open platform, and therefore have different moderation standards than the Epic Games Store.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OEfE3p"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;guys, Apple's lawyers just called. They said we need to turn off ALL the games   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Games Are Now ILLEGAL&lt;/p&gt;— itch.io (@itchio) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/itchio/status/1390782877416054794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kHsFvU"&gt;But regardless of what happens in court, Itch.io is an independent entity with little direct stake in the trial, and its users are largely indie game designers who are often skeptical of both Epic and Apple. (It’s got a lot of content that’s not safe for work, but it’s also by far the easiest place to publish experimental interactive media. It’s where I post my own small text-based games, and there’s a thriving indie tabletop role-playing game community, among other genres.) Some people were upset at Apple going after a platform that’s particularly favored by queer developers offering depictions of sexuality you won’t find in big-budget games. Others simply found it very, very funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hngVg"&gt;Soon after the exchange, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/itchio/status/1390782877416054794"&gt;Itch.io’s Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt; jokingly claimed that Apple’s lawyers called and said to “turn off ALL the games,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/itchio/status/1390788835991113730"&gt;then said&lt;/a&gt; Itch.io was renaming its “sensitive content” filter to “Unspeakable Games.” As I write this, one Itch.io user has announced a game jam called the &lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/the-unspeakable-jam"&gt;“Unspeakable Jam”&lt;/a&gt; that will run until June 12th; all entries must follow Apple executive &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1390417956308459531"&gt;Trystan Kosmynka’s instruction&lt;/a&gt; that “games have a beginning and end; there’s challenges in place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mMro5"&gt;In the interest of offering the clearest possible context for this exchange, I went back and transcribed the entire portion of testimony involving Itch.io’s unspeakable games, just to make sure it was as over-the-top as I remembered. Reader, it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Ts6xbc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; On April 22nd of this year, Epic Games Store added the Itch.io app to its store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89qtkG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve Allison, Epic Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ezCyp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; You’re aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijeffL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison:&lt;/strong&gt; I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v7NmoF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney: &lt;/strong&gt;And you’re aware that Itch.io is a third-party app store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nXnzc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison: &lt;/strong&gt;I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyUFoj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney: &lt;/strong&gt;And the court has also heard that Itch.io was added without reviewing all the games. You’re aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEjxet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2VrCF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney: &lt;/strong&gt;And are you aware, sir, that Itch.io includes so-called adult games, such as a game called &lt;em&gt;Sisterly Lust&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZngZV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison: &lt;/strong&gt;I am not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oqlv8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney: &lt;/strong&gt;You may not be aware then, but the description of that game includes a list of fetishes which include many words that are not appropriate for us to speak in federal courts. Are you aware of that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHsHcj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison: &lt;/strong&gt;I am not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQbsJ8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney: &lt;/strong&gt;And the list goes on. There are many games on Itch.io, I won’t even read the names out loud, but they are both offensive and sexualized. You are not aware of that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64kwmj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison: &lt;/strong&gt;Itch.io is an app store that is not the Epic Games Store. Itch is distributing Itch.io games. Epic is only distributing the App Store Itch.io.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOFA9Z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney: &lt;/strong&gt;And Itch.io is now available as an app on the Epic Games Store, correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSosfg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ftpv05"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney: &lt;/strong&gt;And those apps on Itch.io have not gone through any review process whatsoever. Correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrtBgm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison: &lt;/strong&gt;They are subject to whatever process Itch.io puts in front of their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bk2toZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney: &lt;/strong&gt;Right. So Epic Games, you’re sure, is on the hook for whatever process Itch.io puts in place to review these games that are so offensive we cannot speak about them here, correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68FnwN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison: &lt;/strong&gt;I disagree with that statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOwb2U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judge Rogers:&lt;/strong&gt; So can you or can you not access those apps through your app store?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNK2ax"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison: &lt;/strong&gt;You cannot access those apps through the Epic Games Store, no. You can access those apps through their application, which that is what we are downloading: Itch.io, which is an app store. [Users] have their own account with them, and you use their store and are subject to their end user agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDXFZs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judge Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;So if I have a phone and your app store was on that phone, that other store could be downloaded which has all of this offensive material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqWNLu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison: &lt;/strong&gt;Not on your phone. The app could be downloaded onto your PC and you could access their app on your PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRNHf9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judge Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;But that’s what you want to do on a phone too. That’s what I understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtmmE6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison: &lt;/strong&gt;I don’t know that we would want to do that with Itch.io [on a phone].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGrVlT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judge Rogers:&lt;/strong&gt; But you’re doing it now, so I could access it on my PC, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yN5aLd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7leXtM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judge Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;And this lawsuit’s about your ability to do it on your phone, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsVqSM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGwlB2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney: &lt;/strong&gt;And just so we’re clear, sir, you can go to Epic Games Store, click Itch.io, and download the offensive games. Are you aware of that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvMnvK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison: &lt;/strong&gt;You can go to the Epic Game Store launcher, and you can launch Itch.io, which takes you out of the Epic Games Store and launches their application. You are then subject to their user agreement and you are in the Itch.io ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmyDlQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney: &lt;/strong&gt;And you said to the court just a second ago that you wouldn’t want to do that with Itch.io, you wouldn’t want to put Itch.io on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rW037U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison: &lt;/strong&gt;I don’t know that we would or we wouldn’t. I don’t even know that it’s available as a mobile application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pr8QyY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney: &lt;/strong&gt;Because the reason that you said that to the court is because you’re recognizing that this is offensive and sexualized conduct that can be accessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rsQgH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison: &lt;/strong&gt;I disagree with that statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tOLriT"&gt;(After digressions into some other topics, Apple’s attorney returned to the question.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DVkDL6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney: &lt;/strong&gt;Now that you know there are offensive and sexualized apps on Itch.io, as the head of the Epic Games Store, do you plan to do anything about that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q7F9Pa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison: &lt;/strong&gt;I don’t have an answer for you. I will dig in when we get back. But I don’t have an answer for you. I’m not sure. These apps were on Itch.io, not the Epic Games Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrsqBU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney: &lt;/strong&gt;Epic has been been advertising putting these apps in the store. Mr. Sweeney put up a tweet about Itch.io, and now you seem to be distancing yourself from Itch.io because you realized there are apps in there that you have not reviewed and cannot stand by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5InhB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison: &lt;/strong&gt;I disagree with what you’re saying. Itch.io is an incredible community for developers that we support fully, they have an open platform, and therefore have different moderation standards than the Epic Games Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYBFr7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney: &lt;/strong&gt;I was just wondering, sir, if you support fully the offensive and sexualized content that is available there when people go to the Epic Games Store and download Itch.io.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FekTV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison: &lt;/strong&gt;I don’t support sexualized content of any sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>In Epic v Apple, everybody is losing at the game of defining games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v6rP_07pLVGQ8lJPWdgw6kegrhc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69255433/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Is Roblox a game or not?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="gtxVrE"&gt;If you have ever wanted to see a bunch of mumbly nerds struggle to define what constitutes a “game,” well, is &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; the trial for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pAOnA"&gt;What is the difference between an “app” and a “game?” This sounds like a stoner question but instead occupied a fair amount of the morning in Epic v. Apple. Roblox, explained Apple’s marketing manager Trystan Kosmynka, was an app. See, games have a beginning, an end, and challenges. “There’s experiences within Roblox that we did not look at as a game,” Kosmynka said. We did establish that Minecraft is a game, though, so that’s nice for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="This screenshot of the App Store clearly shows that Roblox is classified as a “game” — despite what Kosmynka testified." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLdCxWBQjWfGbbE5HTUm8p4fD6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499994/Screen_Shot_2021_05_07_at_5.30.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A screenshot of Roblox on the Apple App Store, as of May 7 at 8PM ET&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7a5dp9"&gt;Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers did not understand this distinction and neither did I. But here’s the problem for Apple: if Roblox &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a game, then it’s fairly easy for Epic to compare Fortnite to it. Also, looking up Roblox in the App Store after Kosmynka testified, it is categorized as a “game.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYDWHr"&gt;Roblox is free, with in-app purchases. Since apparently no one can define what a game is, I can’t tell whether it’s fair to say that Roblox is a platform with games on it, but it sure looks that way when I log on. Scrolling through, there are a number of small squares where I can join a game, and each appears to have different rules. (The app calls these “worlds.”) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar2T1j"&gt;And when Kosmynka doesn’t get the category on Roblox right, well. That’s an own goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6ZQypK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’ve always looked at Fortnite as a game.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky1rqQ"&gt;Anyway, Kosmynka noticeably shrank when Epic’s Lauren Moskowitz began asking questions on the redirect. Were Snapchat’s bunny ear filters games? What about TikTok challenges? (The manner in which this question was asked convinced me that I was possibly the only person in the room on TikTok.) Things got worse for Kosmynka during a speed-run of questions. Had he used Fortnite? Yes. Had he attended a concert there? No. “Fortnite is a virtual world where you build a character, correct?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UImbUr"&gt;“I wouldn’t refer to Fortnite as a world. I’ve always looked at Fortnite as a game,” Kosmynka replied. Had he done Battle Royale? Yes. Party Royale? No. Creative mode? No. He knew that Fortnite held concerts but didn’t know it streamed movies. In the context of “What is a game,” it made Kosmynka sound like he didn’t know what he was talking about. It was a tense, and rather devastating, line of questioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAE7pG"&gt;At one point, Judge Gonzalez Rogers said she didn’t understand why Minecraft was a game and Roblox was not. (Again, per the App Store: Roblox is &lt;em&gt;absolutely &lt;/em&gt;a game.) She asked Kosmynka for an industry definition for a game. Turns out, there isn’t one — although, my colleague Adi Robertson notes, game developers and academics will happily talk you under the table about magic circles, meaningful choices, and the works of Johan Huizinga if you ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nresF0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It seemed like Epic was attempting to establish that Apple is inconsistent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ep3QIM"&gt;Later, Matthew Weissinger, VP of marketing at Epic Games, explained that Fortnite is a metaverse. “It’s one of the remarkable things about Fortnite, we’re building this thing called the metaverse, a social place,” he murmured softly. (All of the men we heard from today would benefit greatly from elocution lessons.) “One of the ways I’ve tried to explain it is, think about all of us in lockdown, and how we try to stay socially connected. Some of the most meaningful experiences I’ve had were logging into Zoom and we had our friends and parents and we celebrate grandpa’s birthday.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLXukC"&gt;We also discover that Roblox has a “battle royale” mode, just like Fortnite. Honestly the question to me now is not &lt;em&gt;Is Roblox a game&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em&gt;Is Roblox a metaverse.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvpt6q"&gt;Throughout this line of questioning, it seemed like Epic was attempting to establish that Apple is inconsistent — and passing the buck. Kosmynka testified that developers get to pick what category they belong to, not Apple, making his Roblox digression even weirder. The Roblox thing made Apple look slipshod, and the further testimony about the App Store review didn’t help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lRdIg"&gt;The process behind App Store review is unbelievably boring unless you are a developer who is trying to pass review. We went through it in &lt;em&gt;exhaustive&lt;/em&gt; detail. Apple gets 100,000 app store submissions per week, Kosmynka testified. But only 500 people actually do the “human review” — a lot of the rest of the work is automated. It’s impossible to judge how good an automated process is by listening to someone describe it in abstract in the courtroom. Kosmynka seemed confident when he was being questioned by Apple’s attorney, but when Epic got a crack at him, his voice got softer and softer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="v132mG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“One of the problems with limiting competition is that you don’t get innovation.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f5EWrL"&gt;We heard about apps Apple had mistakenly allowed on the store: ones that carried malicious ad fraud code, apps that copycatted Headspace, a “school shooting game,” a game of shooting cannons at protestors, several inappropriate apps (the funniest of which was “Ganja Farm: Weed Empire”) and more. In emails, Kosmynka said, “We are making critical errors.” In reference to the school-shooting game, Kosmynka said he was “dumbfounded at how this could be missed.” These specifics were more damning than the abstract walk-through of the app review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4jSsK"&gt;At one point, Judge Gonzalez Rogers wondered if anyone was doing better than Apple at app store moderation. Kosmynka punted on this answer. “One of the problems with limiting competition is that you don’t get innovation,” said Judge Gonzalez Rogers. “One of my concerns is that if you aren’t letting parties compete on these topics, things won’t improve.” She then asked if Apple hired third party reviewers. It does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1Ij7k"&gt;There is an implicit contrast here — the Epic Games Store. Steve Allison, VP and General Manager of the Epic Game Store, testified that there have been no known instances of malware or pirated content on the Epic Game Store, though there has been some fraud. It was hard not to notice the contrast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmwA1Y"&gt;Apple’s lawyer, who did not introduce herself, took us through an excruciating narration of the Epic Games website as part of her intensely chaotic cross-examination of Allison. I understand that a lot of things need to be narrated for the court record, but this was silly. We determined that there were a lot of games in the Epic Games Store. We also determined that there were 25 games in the “top 20” games section, which felt kind of bitchy. The first non-game app, Spotify, came to the store in December 2020. Fine, but this didn’t seem to make Epic look bad? Or at least, not the way she’d been hoping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QxHyvr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Are you aware that itch.io includes so-called adult games such as a game called “Sisterly Lust?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="413UDZ"&gt;She lingered on the store-within-a-store on Epic Game Store: Itch.io,a store for indie games that Epic added to its store in April. You can download itch.io’s store from Epic. “Are you aware that itch.io includes so-called adult games such as a game called “Sisterly Lust?” Apple’s lawyer asked. Some of the games on itch.io are “so offensive we cannot speak about them here,” she sniffed. This was a more successful line of argument — it essentially explained why Apple didn’t want stores within its own store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoXImk"&gt;Of course, the big contrast between the Apple App Store and the Epic Game Store was economic. The 30/70 split that Epic finds so objectionable began with retail — you used to have to buy games at Wal-Mart or GameStop or something, when they were physically packaged, Allison said quietly. As retailers moved away from PC games in favor of console games, Valve created Steam, which mimicked the 30/70 split from traditional retail — but it was viewed as an improvement among developers, since they didn’t have to pay for discs and packaging and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wPd2d"&gt;That is, until Minecraft self-published, in Allison’s telling. Then someone taking 30 percent looked steep. In 2018, Epic launched the Epic Games Store, which took only a 12 percent cut. (In order to assuage developers who might fear losing revenue from Steam when they took exclusive deals with Epic, Epic agreed to pay them a minimum guarantee.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJ7DDu"&gt;Significantly, developers don’t have to use the Epic in-app payment system — they can use their own, meaning that Epic can theoretically get &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; money on in-app purchases. Wizards of the Coast, the publisher of Magic the Gathering Arena, and Ubisoft, with multiple titles, use their own payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="8GFI1t"&gt;Still, I find myself returning to the question that began the day: What is a game? It’s shocking to me that so many people who specialize in apps and games can’t really answer this question. But I guess in some sense, you could imagine the trial is one — it’s got a beginning, a middle, and an end. Lots of money at stake. A winner and a loser. Plus, when the verdict is appealed — as it almost inevitably will be — we’ll get a sequel. Sure, Epic played well today, but you need more than one good turn to win.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia has figured out a way to ditch the fancy gamepad for TV play</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U1EoUjfzMAjkBj7ch_OKQiN27A8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69255222/akrales_191113_3779_0309.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pj1JKE"&gt;Today, there’s only one official way to play Google’s Stadia game streaming service on your 4K TV — the last-gen Chromecast Ultra, connected to the company’s proprietary Stadia Controller over Wi-Fi. That’s because Google hasn’t yet brought Stadia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;to the new-and-improved $50 Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;, and its predecessor didn’t support Bluetooth, meaning the only way to pair a controller was to loop through Google’s servers in the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCsHaY"&gt;But Google now has a workaround,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/07/stadia-3-15-phone-tv-controller/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a new “bridge mode” hidden in the latest version of the Stadia app on Android that should let you send controller signals from your phone — letting you play Stadia with your phone’s touchscreen, or even connect another gamepad to your phone. You’ll be able to use your phone to change your TV’s volume, too, according to text snippets buried in the APK. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VVwaDo"&gt;The original Stadia Controller has been something of a thorn in the company’s side ever since Stadia launched on November 19th, 2019, so it wouldn’t be surprising if Google decides to move on. It took many months for buyers to be able to use Google’s wireless controller wirelessly with anything &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; the Chromecast Ultra — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248769/google-stadia-controller-wireless-computers-desktop-laptop"&gt;desktop web browsers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308374/google-stadia-controller-wireless-android-mobile-support"&gt;Android phones&lt;/a&gt; weren’t supported at first, meaning you had to physically plug in a USB-C cable. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497850/google-stadia-controller-usb-c-support"&gt;USB-C audio took a while too&lt;/a&gt;, and Bluetooth audio via the controller still has yet to materialize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDLIXv"&gt;Thankfully, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21215395/google-stadia-controller-how-to-pair-bluetooth-support-ps4-xbox-consoles"&gt;third-party controller support was quite robust&lt;/a&gt; on those other platforms, letting you easily sync a PlayStation or Xbox gamepad to play, and it’s unlikely you’ll even need this new Bridge Mode to play Stadia on the 2020 Chromecast whenever it arrives; the new Chromecast &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;support Bluetooth game controllers. Judging by a few Steam Link and GeForce Now sessions with my 8BitDo gamepad, Bluetooth gamepad support may work just fine. &lt;/p&gt;

Apparently, Google had to pay tens of millions of dollars to publishers like Ubisoft, per game, just to get games ported to Stadia.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram’s head apologizes for bug that deleted activists’ stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xl6UwwaCyRqIXfZfQwPNa0cU-i0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69254588/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YQFHcq"&gt;Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1390764512521768960?s=20"&gt;has tweeted an apology&lt;/a&gt; about a bug that deleted users’ story posts on Thursday. The timing was unfortunate for activists trying to raise awareness about missing Indigenous women, with organizations Red Dress and National Day of Awareness of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG, abbreviated by some as MMIWG2S to include two-spirit people) &lt;a href="https://indiancountrytoday.com/news/mmiwg-movement-erased-online"&gt;questioning whether their posts&lt;/a&gt; had somehow been erased deliberately. According to Instagram, however, the bug affected stories, archives, and highlights of Instagram users across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lD8DCx"&gt;Mosseri and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/InstagramComms/status/1390376354332487681"&gt;Instagram’s statement&lt;/a&gt; about the deletions say this isn’t the case and that the stories were not removed because of anything content-related. He specifically addressed the Indigenous people’s concerns. “This day is incredibly important to raise awareness of this critical issue and support our Indigenous community on Instagram,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1390764511808737283?s=20"&gt;Mosseri tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “We apologize to all those who felt like they could not bring attention to these incredibly important causes, and many others around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QClRa0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Many people thought we were removing their content because of what they posted or what hashtag they used, but this bug wasn’t related to the content itself, but rather a widespread issue that has now been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Mosseri   (@mosseri) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1390764510378532864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y1naSV"&gt;The issue of &lt;a href="https://indiancountrytoday.com/news/known-and-not-forgotten"&gt;the high rates of violence against Indigenous people&lt;/a&gt; — especially women, girls, and two-spirit people — isn’t one that often gets a spotlight outside of reservations, so spreading awareness is especially important, activists say. &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/instagram-stories-vanish-mmiwg-red-dress-day-1.6017113?cmp=rss"&gt;Speaking to CBC News&lt;/a&gt; about the importance of days like May 5th, community organizer Kakeka Thundersky said that “[e]veryone’s just stuck at home on their phone, unable to gather and able to go to the rallies, unable to talk to face to face with people,” making online platforms like Instagram a key tool for activists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikA81A"&gt;Emily Henderson, an Inuk arts and culture writer, said that “[t]he digital space in general is really, really important right now just for maintaining community connections or connections.” &lt;/p&gt;
