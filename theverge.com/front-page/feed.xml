    <title>‘Misogynistic’ Apple hire is out hours after employees call for investigation </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xIq2dM"&gt;Antonio García Martínez is no longer working at Apple hours after employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook"&gt;circulated a petition&lt;/a&gt; calling for an investigation into his hiring. Martínez, a former Facebook product manager on the ad targeting team, authored a controversial book about Silicon Valley where he expressed misogynistic views on women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpSEnr"&gt;“We are deeply concerned about the recent hiring of Antonio García Martínez,” employees wrote in the petition. “His misogynistic statements in his autobiography — such as ‘&lt;em&gt;Most women in the Bay Area are soft and weak, cosseted and naive despite their claims of worldliness, and generally full of shit’&lt;/em&gt; (further quoted below this letter) — directly oppose Apple’s commitment to Inclusion &amp;amp; Diversity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ob9PmH"&gt;More than 2,000 employees signed the petition before it was published in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0Yuvq"&gt;Shortly after the petition began circulating internally at Apple, Martínez’s Slack account was deactivated. The ad platforms team was called into an emergency meeting where it was confirmed Martínez would no longer be working at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BROfl5"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Apple spokesperson said: “At Apple, we have always strived to create an inclusive, welcoming workplace where everyone is respected and accepted. Behavior that demeans or discriminates against people for who they are has no place here.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A security researcher found Wi-Fi vulnerabilities that have existed since the beginning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RPtM0vZbDOp9YHsdxLKiSn9_uJI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69278259/acastro__171016_1777_0001_v1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrator by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v6vzxE"&gt;The security researcher who discovered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/16/16484824/krack-wifi-encryption-bug-vulnerability-install-patch"&gt;the Krack Wi-Fi vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; has discovered &lt;a href="https://www.fragattacks.com"&gt;a slew of other flaws&lt;/a&gt; with the wireless protocol most of us use to power our online lives (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/update-windows-and-lots-of-other-stuff-asap-fragatta-1846878065"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The vulnerabilities relate to how Wi-Fi handles large chunks of data, with some being related to the Wi-Fi standard itself, and some being related to how it’s implemented by device manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niXbxn"&gt;The researcher, Mathy Vanhoef, calls the collection of vulnerabilities “FragAttacks,” with the name being a mashup of “fragmentation” and “aggregation.” He also says the vulnerabilities could be exploited by hackers, allowing them to intercept sensitive data, or show users fake websites, even if they’re using Wi-Fi networks secured with WPA2 or even WPA3. They could also theoretically exploit other devices on your home network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHAxZE"&gt;There are twelve different attack vectors that fall under the classification, which all work in different ways. One exploits routers accepting plaintext during handshakes, one exploits routers caching data in certain types of networks, etc. If you want to read all the technical details on how exactly they work, you can check &lt;a href="https://www.fragattacks.com"&gt;out Vanhoef’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2bhedN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://therecord.media/wifi-devices-going-back-to-1997-vulnerable-to-new-frag-attacks/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Vanhoef informed the WiFi Alliance about the vulnerabilities that were baked-in to the way Wi-Fi works so they could be corrected before he disclosed them to the public. Vanhoef says that he’s not aware of the vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. While he points out in a video that some of the vulnerabilities aren’t particularly easy to exploit, he says others would be “trivial” to take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bya4EV"&gt;Vanhoef points out that some of the flaws can be exploited on networks using the WEP security protocol, indicating that they’ve been around since Wi-Fi was first implemented in 1997 (though if you’re still using WEP, these attacks should be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/8/5982701/cat-hacking-hack-wifi-war-kitteh"&gt;the least of your concerns&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e6khGt"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/88YZ4061tYw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lVXfsh"&gt;Vanhoef says that the flaws are wide-spread, affecting many devices, meaning that there’s a lot of updating to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWh3TC"&gt;The thing about updating Wi-Fi infrastructure is that it’s always a pain. For example, before writing this article I went to check if my router had any updates, and realized that I had forgotten my login information (and I suspect I won’t be alone in that experience). There’s also devices that are just plain old, whose manufacturers are either gone or not releasing patches anymore. If you can, though, you should keep an eye on your router manufacturer’s website for any updates that are rolling out, especially if they’re &lt;a href="https://github.com/vanhoefm/fragattacks/blob/master/ADVISORIES.md"&gt;in the advisory list&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxmjCe"&gt;Some vendors have already released patches for some of their products, including: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="D5wlA2"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="N6Qt4h"&gt;As for anything else you need to do, &lt;a href="https://www.fragattacks.com/#notpatched"&gt;Vanhoef recommends&lt;/a&gt; the usual steps: keep your computers updated, use strong, unique passwords, don’t visit shady sites, and make sure you’re using HTTPS as often as possible. Other than that, it’s mostly being thankful that you’re not in charge of widespread IT infrastructure (my deepest condolences if you, in fact, are).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel is using machine learning to make GTA V look incredibly, unsettlingly realistic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emTW_3Rw8JYa2vxj1HeRA_9OVak=/80x0:871x527/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69278039/Screen_Shot_2021_05_12_at_1.20.41_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M1MlZc"&gt;One of the more impressive aspects of &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V is&lt;/em&gt; how closely the game’s San Andreas approximates real-life Los Angeles and Southern California, but &lt;a href="https://intel-isl.github.io/PhotorealismEnhancement/"&gt;a new machine learning project&lt;/a&gt; from Intel Labs called “Enhancing Photorealism Enhancement” might take that realism in a unsettlingly photorealistic direction (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/grand-theft-auto-looks-frighteningly-photorealistic-wit-1846878938"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZUYTs"&gt;Putting the game through the processes researchers Stephan R. Richter, Hassan Abu Alhaija, and Vladlen Kolten created produces a surprising result: a visual look that has unmistakable similarities to the kinds of photos you might casually take through the smudged front window of your car. You have to see it in motion to really appreciate it, but the combination of slightly washed-out lighting, smoother pavement, and believably reflective cars just sells the fact you’re looking out at the real street from a real dashboard, even if it’s all virtual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vDjXxN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P1IcaBn3ej0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jPRV7m"&gt;The Intel researchers suggest some of that photorealism comes from the datasets they fed their neural network. The group offers a more in-depth and thorough explanation for how image enhancement actually works &lt;a href="http://vladlen.info/papers/EPE.pdf"&gt;in their paper (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, but as I understand it, the &lt;a href="https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/"&gt;Cityscapes Dataset&lt;/a&gt; that was used — built largely from photographs of German streets — filled in a lot of the detail. It’s dimmer and from a different angle, but it almost captures what I imagine a smoother, more interactive version of scrolling through Google Maps’ Street View could be like. It doesn’t entirely behave like it’s real, but it looks very much like it’s built from real things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDONKS"&gt;The researchers say their enhancements go beyond what other photorealistic conversion processes are capable of by also integrating geometric information from &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt; itself. Those “G-buffers,” as the researchers call them, can include data like the distance between objects in the game and the camera, and the quality of textures, like the glossiness of cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jas7OU"&gt;While you might not see an official “photorealism update” roll out to &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt; tomorrow, you may have already played a game or watched a video that’s benefited from another kind of machine learning — AI upscaling. The process of using machine learning smarts to blow up graphics to higher resolutions doesn’t show up everywhere, but has been featured in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features"&gt;Nvidia’s Shield TV&lt;/a&gt; and in several different mod projects focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/18/18311287/ai-upscaling-algorithms-video-games-mods-modding-esrgan-gigapixel"&gt;upgrading the graphics of older games&lt;/a&gt;. In those cases a neural network is making predictions to fill in missing pixels of detail from a lower resolution game, movie, or TV show to reach those higher resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqBew2"&gt;Photorealism probably shouldn’t be the only graphical goal for video games to have (artistry aside, it looks kind of creepy), but this Intel Labs project does show there’s probably as much room to grow on the software side of things as there is in the raw GPU power of new consoles and gaming PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The child safety problem on platforms is worse than we knew</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iZOvMOi3lWzUvPfEA8dAqoxnBlg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69278003/acastro_180329_1777__brains_science_0001_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="B0obHy"&gt;Millions of young children are using platforms years before they turn 13 — and their presence could put many of them in danger. An &lt;a href="https://www.thorn.org/thorn-research-minors-perspectives-on-disclosing-reporting-and-blocking/"&gt;alarming new study&lt;/a&gt; has found that minors in the US often receive abuse, harassment, or sexual solicitation from adults on tech platforms. For the most part, though, children say they are not informing parents or other trusted adults about these interactions — and are instead turning for support for tech platforms, whose limited blocking and reporting tools have failed to address the threats they face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AzAr2"&gt;The report from &lt;a href="https://www.thorn.org/"&gt;Thorn&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit organization that builds technology to defend children from sexual abuse, identifies a disturbing gap in efforts by Snap, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and others to keep children safe. Officially, children are not supposed to use most apps before they turn 13 without adult supervision. In practice, though, the majority of American children are using apps anyway. And even when they block and report bullies and predators, the majority of children say that they are quickly re-contacted by the same bad actors — either via new accounts or separate social platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FIGDVE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We need to lean into what kids are doing, and beef up the support mechanisms so they’re not putting the onus on the child”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M7yHTA"&gt;Among the report’s key findings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ocl902"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Children are using major platforms in large numbers long before they turn 13&lt;/strong&gt;: 45 percent of children ages 9-12 say they use Facebook daily; 40 percent use Instagram; 40 percent use Snapchat; 41 percent use TikTok; and 78 percent use YouTube.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sPdbj9"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Children report having online sexual interactions at high rates — both with their peers and people they believe to adults&lt;/strong&gt;: 25 percent of kids 9-17 reported having had a sexually explicit interaction with someone they thought was 18 or older, compared to 23 percent of participants that had a similar experience with someone they believed to be a minor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wCNZuY"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Children are more than twice as likely to use platform blocking and reporting tools than they are to tell parents and other caregivers about what happened&lt;/strong&gt;: 83 percent of 9- to 17-year-olds who reported having an online sexual interaction reacted with reporting, blocking, or muting the offender, while only 37 percent said they told a parent, trusted adult, or peer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8LG1jo"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The majority of children who block or report other users say those same users quickly find them again online&lt;/strong&gt;: More than half of children who blocked someone said they were contacted again by the same person again, either through a new account or a different platform. This was true both for people children knew in real life (54 percent) and people they had only met online (51 percent).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="VEguY3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children who identify as LGBTQ+ experience all of these harms at higher rates than their non-LGBTQ+ peers&lt;/strong&gt;: 57 percent of youth who identify as LGBTQ+ said they have had potentially harmful experiences online, compared to 46 percent of non-LGBTQ+ youth. They also had online sexual interactions at much higher rates than their peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="KDeKOf"&gt;
&lt;div id="UAaOio"&gt;
&lt;iframe title="Potentially harmful online experiences by platform" aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-SCdPL" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SCdPL/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&amp;&amp;(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="dBYQab"&gt;
&lt;p id="jV4LRx"&gt;Thorn’s research comes at a time when regulators are examining platforms’ child safety efforts with increasing scrutiny. In a March hearing, US lawmakers &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/facebook-google-ceos-blasted-in-congress-over-apps-for-kids"&gt;criticized Facebook and Google for the potential effect their apps could have on children&lt;/a&gt;. And this week, 44 attorneys general wrote a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/attorneys-general-ask-facebook-to-abandon-instagram-for-kids-plans.html"&gt;urging him to abandon a plan to create a version of Instagram for children&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUBQW9"&gt;The Thorn report could trigger heightened scrutiny of the way young children use platforms, and the relatively few protections that tech companies have currently put in place to protect them or offer them support. It could also push the industry to collaborate on cross-platform solutions between Facebook, Google, Snap and others that Thorn says are needed to fully address the threats children face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1m3jr"&gt;Taken together, the findings suggest that platforms, parents, and governments need to work harder to understand how children are using technology from the time they are in elementary school, and develop new solutions to protect them as they explore online spaces and express themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMEhr9"&gt;“Platforms have to be better at designing experiences,” said Julie Cordua, Thorn’s CEO, in an interview. “Adults need to create safe spaces for kids to have conversations … And then on the government and policy side, lawmakers need to understand kids’ online experiences at this level of detail. You’ve got to dive into the details and understand the experiences of youth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVgjBY"&gt;Data on these subjects is difficult to collect for several reasons, many of them obvious: the topics involved are extremely sensitive, and much of the best information is held within the private companies running the platform. To do its work, Thorn had 1,000 children ages 9 to 17 fill out a 20-minute online survey with their parents’ consent. The survey was conducted from October 25 to November 11, and the margin of sampling error is +/- 3.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgFNig"&gt;The findings of the survey tell multiple stories about the current relationship between children and technology. The most pressing one may be that because young children are not supposed to use platforms, companies often do not build safety tools with them in mind. The result is a generation of children, some of them still in elementary school, attempting to navigate blocking and reporting tools that were designed for older teens and adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wS9opp"&gt; “Kids see platforms as a first line of engagement,” Cordua said. “We need to lean into what kids are doing, and beef up the support mechanisms so they’re not putting the onus on the child. Put the onus on the platform that’s building the experience and make it safe for all.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title="Platform usage habits: At least once a day" aria-label="table" id="datawrapper-chart-JHB6E" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JHB6E/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="681"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&amp;&amp;(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="gunkZ7"&gt;
&lt;p id="D8ibqQ"&gt;An obvious thing platforms can do is to rewrite the language they employ for user reports to more accurately reflect the harms taking place there. Thorn found that 22 percent of minors who attempted to report that their nudes had been leaked didn’t feel like platform reporting systems permitted them to report it. In Silicon Valley terms, it’s a user experience problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7IBlz"&gt;“While minors say they are confident in their ability to use platform reporting tools to address their concerns, when given a series of commonly available options from reporting menus, many indicated that none of the options fit the situation,” the Thorn report says. “Nearly a quarter said they ‘don’t feel like any of these choices fit the situation’ of being solicited for (self-generated nudes) by someone they believe to be an adult (23 percent) or someone they believe to be under 18 (24 percent).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rNPwc8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;platform reporting tools can feel like fire alarms that have had their wires cut&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hp51A6"&gt;Thorn has other ideas for what platforms in particular should do here. For example, they could invest more heavily in age verification. Even if you accept that kids will always find ways into online spaces meant for adults, the sheer numbers can be surprising. Thorn found that 27 percent of 9- to 12-year-old boys have used a dating app; most dating apps require users to be at least 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnV9OV"&gt;Platforms could integrate crisis support phone numbers into messaging apps to help kids find resources when they have experienced abuse. They could share block lists with each other to help identify predators, though this would raise privacy and civil rights concerns. And they could invest more heavily in ban evasion so that predators and bullies can’t easily create alternate accounts after they are blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P93nD4"&gt;In their current state, Cordua told me, platform reporting tools can feel like fire alarms that have had their wires cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6IayyC"&gt;“The good thing is, kids want to use these tools,” she said. “Now we need to make sure they work. This is an opportunity for us to ensure that if they pull that fire alarm, people respond.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MZ6D4"&gt;Too often, though, no one does. One in three minors who have reported an issue said the platform took more than a week to respond, and 22 percent said they had made a report that was never resolved. “This is a critical window during which the child remains vulnerable to continued victimization,” the report authors say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2G5VB"&gt;The Thorn report found children on every platform where it looked. But some stood out for the frequency with which children reported experiencing harm. The platforms with the highest number of minors reported potential harm were Snapchat (26 percent), Instagram (26 percent), YouTube (19 percent), TikTok (18 percent), and Messenger (18 percent). The platforms where the most minors said they had an online sexual interaction were Snapchat (16 percent), Instagram (16 percent), Messenger (11 percent), and Facebook (10 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZipPU"&gt;I shared Thorn’s findings with these platforms and asked them to respond. Here’s what they told me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="v81nrq"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Snap&lt;/strong&gt;: “We really appreciate the extensive findings and related recommendations in Thorn’s research. The prevalence of unwanted sexual contact is horrific, and this study will help inform our ongoing efforts to combat these behaviors on Snapchat. In recent months, we have been increasing our in-app education and support tools for Snapchatters, working to revamp our in-app reporting tools, putting in place additional protections for minors, and expanding resources for parents. After reviewing this research, we are making additional changes to make us be even more responsive to the issues raised by the report.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EawlCS"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Facebook and Instagram&lt;/strong&gt;: “We appreciate Thorn’s research and value our collaboration with them. We’ve made meaningful progress on these issues, including restricting Direct Messages between teens and adults they don’t follow on Instagram, helping teens avoid unwanted chats with adults, making it harder for adults to search for teens, improving reporting features, and updating our child safety policies to include more violating content for removal. However, Thorn’s research, while good, stopped far short of the global view on this issue when they excluded Apple’s iMessage, which is used heavily by teens, is preloaded on every iPhone, and is bigger than Messenger and Instagram Direct combined.” (Thorn responded to the swipe at Apple by saying it focused on social platforms because that is where many of these inappropriate relationships begin — typically they migrate to messaging apps from elsewhere.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Jexte5"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;YouTube&lt;/strong&gt;: “YouTube doesn’t&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801999?hl=en"&gt; allow&lt;/a&gt; content that endangers the emotional and physical well-being of minors and we have strict&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802268?hl=en"&gt; harassment policies&lt;/a&gt; prohibiting cyberbullying or content that threatens individuals in any way. Additionally, because YouTube has never been for people under 13, we created&lt;a href="https://youtube.com/kids/?gclid=COuXyszeh-MCFR6TxQIdcU4IGA"&gt; YouTube Kids&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 and recently announced a&lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supervised-experiences-for-families-on-youtube/"&gt; supervised account option&lt;/a&gt; for parents who have decided their tweens or teens are ready to explore YouTube.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pzS08C"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;TikTok: &lt;/strong&gt;“Protecting minors is vitally important, and TikTok has taken industry-leading steps to promote a safe and age-appropriate experience for teens. These include setting accounts ages 13-15 to private by default, restricting direct messaging for younger teens, and committing to publish information regarding removals of suspected underage accounts in our Transparency Reports.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="S3NmI3"&gt;While platforms have implemented a variety of partial solutions to the issue of underage access and the harms that can follow, there remains a lack of industry-wide standards or collaboration on solutions. Meanwhile, parents and lawmakers seem largely ignorant of the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otiRpv"&gt;For too long, tech companies have been able to set aside problems related to the presence of children on their platforms simply by saying that kids are not allowed there, and that the companies work hard to remove them. The Thorn report illustrates the degree to which harms remain on the platform in spite of, and even partially because of, this stance. To truly protect children, they will need to take decisive and more coordinated action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="1glNBB"&gt;“Let’s deal with the reality that kids are in these spaces, and re-create it as a safe space,” Cordua said. “When you build for the weakest link, or you build for the most vulnerable, you improve what you’re building for every single person.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden signs executive order aiming to prevent future cybersecurity disasters</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks On COVID-19 Response And Ongoing Vaccination Program" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KWpJlF-KkRDcoGst8DpyHnZQbho=/0x0:7836x5224/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69277996/1317679747.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XJfGZM"&gt;President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday implementing new policies aimed to improve national cybersecurity. The executive order comes in the wake of a number of recent cybersecurity catastrophes, such as last week’s ransomware attack that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;took down the Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, the Microsoft Exchange server vulnerabilities that may have affected north of 60,000 organizations, and the SolarWinds hack that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288961/solarwinds-hack-100-companies-9-federal-agencies"&gt;compromised nine federal agencies&lt;/a&gt; late last year — each of which were specifically namedropped by the White House in a fact sheet accompanying the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDglsS"&gt;The executive order outlines a number of initiatives, including reducing barriers to information sharing between the government and the private sector, mandating the deployment of multi-factor authentication in the federal government, establishing a Cybersecurity Safety Review Board modeled after the National Transportation Safety Board, and creating a standardized playbook for responding to “cyber incidents.” You can read more about all of the initiatives &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/12/fact-sheet-president-signs-executive-order-charting-new-course-to-improve-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-protect-federal-government-networks/"&gt;in the White House’s fact sheet here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MvPrJ"&gt;In the past few months, we’ve seen example after example of major IT systems breaking down, whether they allowed for a huge effort like the email server hack from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316189/microsoft-exchange-server-security-exploit-china-attack-30000-organizations"&gt;state-sponsored Chinese hacking group Hafnium&lt;/a&gt; (the White House promised a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319934/microsoft-hafnium-hack-exchange-server-email-flaw-white-house"&gt;whole of government response&lt;/a&gt;” to that one), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719056/baltimore-county-public-schools-cancel-class-bcps-ransomware-hack"&gt;a ransomware attack that forced public schools to cancel classes&lt;/a&gt;, or even a pair of breakdowns that appear to have allowed workers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368476/kansas-man-tamper-water-supply-remote-ellsworth-wyatt-travnichek"&gt;remote into their local water supply&lt;/a&gt; and mess things up. The policies outlined in Wednesday’s executive order could create critical infrastructure to help prevent future cybersecurity disasters — or, at the very least, better limit any potential fallout.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Target will stop selling Pokémon cards in stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Target Store Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dE8d_UQKJ2qTeB_-j81lZG4-6ao=/0x0:3966x2644/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69277978/1231463209.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CihKXR"&gt;Target has decided that it’s had enough: the company &lt;a href="https://bleedingcool.com/games/target-stores-to-halt-sales-of-all-trading-cards-from-may-14th-forward/"&gt;has officially confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Bleeding Cool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that it will halt the sales of Pokémon cards throughout the US, starting Friday, May 14th. The retailer cities “an abundance of caution” for the safety of both guests and store employees and notes that it will still be selling the cards on its site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnevIz"&gt;Currently, Pokémon cards (and other trading cards) are having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22413108/pokemon-trading-card-collectors-overwhelm-grading-collecting-rating"&gt;a moment&lt;/a&gt;: people have swamped card grading companies, hoping to get a rating that makes their cards more valuable, and The Pokémon Company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276738/pokemon-trading-card-game-printing-short-supply-high-demand"&gt;has been rushing&lt;/a&gt; to print enough cards to meet the demand. It seems that all the big numbers around the truly rare original cards have caused a lot of excitement around new cards as well. But Target isn’t feeling the hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHMz8C"&gt;It’s hard to blame the retailer, as the situation around the trading cards seems wildly out of control. People have &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22417628/pokemon-cards-cereal-general-mills-lucky-charms-cinnamon-toast-crunch-walmart-resell-scalpers"&gt;reportedly been opening cereal boxes in stores&lt;/a&gt; to steal the included Pokémon cards out of them. And someone in Japan even &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/man-arrested-after-failed-pokemon-card-heist-no-team-rocket-members-involved/"&gt;climbed down a rope&lt;/a&gt; to steal almost $9,000 worth of the cardboard cards designed for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EoUuD6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The situation around the trading cards seems wildly out of control&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aY07s0"&gt;Target has recently started limiting how many packs customers are allowed to purchase, and has &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kv9dd/target-is-prepared-to-call-the-cops-on-frantic-pokemon-card-hunters"&gt;even threatened to get law enforcement involved&lt;/a&gt; if it found people camping out by its stores for them. There was also an incident at one of the stores where &lt;a href="https://www.fox6now.com/news/fight-over-trading-cards-outside-brookfield-target"&gt;someone pulled a gun during a fight&lt;/a&gt; about sports cards — which could explain why the halt also applies to MLB, NFL, and NBA cards as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxBzrY"&gt;Before Target’s official statement, some people had seen signs announcing the new policy in the aisles of their local stores, signs which have &lt;a href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/target-is-no-longer-selling-pokemon-cards-amid-scalper-crisis-1572507/"&gt;apparently been showing up all over the US&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dMKSV9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So, I guess Pokémon, MLB, NFL, and NBA trading cards are no longer going to be sold at Target stores starting this Friday. &lt;a href="https://t.co/pUzbQ9Esey"&gt;pic.twitter.com/pUzbQ9Esey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alan Johnson (@TheAlanJohnson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheAlanJohnson/status/1392549620975169537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Tesla stops taking Bitcoin for vehicle purchases, citing environmental harm</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Model S redesign" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CsOCQN3L7qHWhIWyYQQzxMq5sjM=/8x0:2774x1844/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69277531/Screen_Shot_2021_01_27_at_6.50.29_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ks3xo1"&gt;Tesla has stopped accepting bitcoin as payment for its cars out of concern that it will contribute to greater consumption of fossil fuels, according to a statement CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday. Tesla had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22347905/tesla-bitcoin-payment-us-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;only just started accepting bitcoin in late March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1f88w"&gt;Musk also said that Tesla will no longer sell any more of the $1.5 billion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272103/tesla-bitcoin-investment-1-5-billion-cryptocurrency-payments"&gt;stash of bitcoin it purchased earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla sold some of that bitcoin in the first quarter of 2021, which wound up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404198/tesla-q1-results-earnings-profit-model-s-x-y-3-bitcoin-delay"&gt;helping pad the company’s quarterly profit figures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bzCfVo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tesla’s $1.5 billion bitcoin purchase clashes with its environmental aspirations","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275243/teslas-bitcoin-purchase-clashes-climate-change-mission"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="desXD6"&gt;Tesla says it would resume accepting bitcoin (and would consider selling more of it) once the process of mining bitcoin “transitions to more sustainable energy,” according to the statement. The company is also “looking at other cryptocurrencies that use &amp;lt;1% of Bitcoin’s energy/transaction.” As of this writing, Tesla’s website &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/bitcoin"&gt;indicates it will still accept Bitcoin for transactions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPkUTI"&gt;“Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment,” Musk’s statement reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Yk2Cnt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tesla &amp;amp; Bitcoin &lt;a href="https://t.co/YSswJmVZhP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YSswJmVZhP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8bWDq2"&gt;Bitcoin uses up as much electricity annually &lt;a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption"&gt;as the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, according to one estimate. All that energy comes with a huge carbon footprint. And there’s no simple fix because the blockchain that the cryptocurrency is built on is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275243/teslas-bitcoin-purchase-clashes-climate-change-mission"&gt;purposely energy inefficient&lt;/a&gt;. That clashes with Tesla’s mission to “accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rs7m5"&gt;Musk has also hyped another cryptocurrency, Dogecoin, which Tesla has not invested in. Musk has called Dogecoin, which was invented as a joke to satirize bitcoin, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1113009339743100929"&gt;his favorite cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; and “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357241340313141249"&gt;the people’s crypto.&lt;/a&gt;” The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22427006/dogecoin-crashing-elon-musk-snl-host"&gt;cryptocurrency’s worth plunged&lt;/a&gt; after Musk called it a “hustle” on &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;. Bitcoin’s value has similarly plunged about 4 percent after today’s Musk tweet, to $52,593.46 at 6:21PM ET from $54,829.14 at 6:06PM, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin"&gt;according to Coindesk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Proposed bill aims to toss a new wrench in NASA’s Moon lander plan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Capitol Supermoon" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gagkqdDBzNnCrxzf23vRh87hNMU=/0x0:3412x2275/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69277397/1232549177.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Bill Clark / CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IwqPXh"&gt;A senior lawmaker proposed a controversial piece of legislation on Wednesday that directs NASA to pick a second company to build the agency’s next Moon landers — in addition to Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which was awarded a $2.9 billion NASA contract to build a lander earlier this year. The bill hasn’t passed the full Senate yet, but it marks a new front in an ongoing effort to overturn or rejig NASA’s decision. It also sets up the first political challenge for NASA’s new administrator, former Sen. Bill Nelson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uo9bBE"&gt;NASA’s choice of SpaceX last month to build the agency’s first lunar lander since 1972 spawned a wave of opposition from some lawmakers and the two losing companies in the running: Jeff Bezos’ space firm Blue Origin and Dynetics. Those companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;lodged formal protests&lt;/a&gt; against NASA’s decision, triggering a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412771/nasa-spacex-hls-moon-lander-blue-origin-protest"&gt;procedural pause&lt;/a&gt; on SpaceX’s new contract. Among other things, the protests maintain that NASA should have picked two firms instead of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PH6VL8"&gt;Amid a lobbying effort from Blue Origin, those calls have found their way into a NASA authorization bill, proposed as an amendment to the Endless Frontier Act by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA), chair of the Senate Commerce Committee overseeing NASA. Cantwell represents Blue Origin’s home state of Washington. Under Cantwell’s language, NASA would be required to reopen the competition within 30 days and allow it to use $10 billion of its budget to pick a second lunar lander provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUy5LG"&gt;Before choosing SpaceX, NASA had been expected to pick two companies, a strategy that guaranteed a backup in case one lander fell behind. But the agency went only with SpaceX — its bid was half of Blue Origin’s — after funding shortfalls from Congress. “It was in NASA’s best interest, along with the budget that was there, for us to award to one,” NASA’s human spaceflight chief, Kathy Lueders, who led the decision to pick SpaceX, said last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FakHVp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s not as simple as picking the next in line”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B74QFI"&gt;Simply adding another company to build NASA’s Moon lander, as proposed in Cantwell’s amendment, could run afoul of the existing agreements with SpaceX, agency officials say. “It’s not as simple as picking the next in line,” says one person familiar with the process, speaking anonymously to chat frankly about legal matters. Going through the long and protracted process of picking another company would also endanger NASA’s rush to get to the Moon by 2024, agency staff say. (Blue Origin argues the opposite: that not picking a second company risks the 2024 goal.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SacRC1"&gt;NASA declined to comment on the bill, citing the ongoing litigation from Blue Origin and Dynetics’ protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0qxI5"&gt;Blue Origin argues NASA &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; simply add another company, and it’s well within the agency’s ability to do so legally. That’s because, company employees say, SpaceX’s award falls under a kind of research and development category of government contracting that would permit another player to join, unlike more legally rigid contract programs for routine transportation services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81mB0W"&gt;It’s unclear what specific legal jargon could (or could not) permit NASA to pick another company to develop a lunar lander alongside SpaceX. But Cantwell’s proposed amendment aims to assert a straightforward solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ItUkMM"&gt;SpaceX’s $2.9 billion award is for two flights to the Moon using Starship, the company’s fully reusable rocket system that’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421845/spacex-starship-sn15-successful-landing"&gt;under development&lt;/a&gt; in Texas. The first mission would require Starship to make an uncrewed lunar landing, followed by another landing carrying astronauts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony has 25 PS5 games in the works, including characters you’ve never seen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QN0P5FyLOycnDPt6h4cqbClUSy4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69277035/vpavic_4278_20201030_0206.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZAwl3E"&gt;Sony is apparently looking to release more than 25 PlayStation 5 games under its PlayStation Studios brand. And “nearly half” of them will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be sequels or spinoffs, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/playstation-5-six-months-later/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;’s interview&lt;/a&gt; with PlayStation Studio lead (and former Guerrilla Games managing director) Hermen Hulst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDbbQx"&gt;That could theoretically be a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;more games than the four first-party Sony titles we already know about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="KH3YLT"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West &lt;/em&gt;(2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nBm5rq"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;(June 2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lRbRTm"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;God of War: Ragnarok &lt;/em&gt;(2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CGFjhA"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7 &lt;/em&gt;(2022)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="LfviKv"&gt;Twenty-one additional games could be a huge shot in the arm for the PS5, especially considering how slowly exclusives are trickling out; &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297059/gran-turismo-7-ps5-playstation-5-release-date-delay-2022"&gt;already slipped to next year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWHJXb"&gt;Sony also may not be completely on the hook for producing all of the games that are unaccounted for, though. The PlayStation Studios branding is a bit murky. When it was first announced, Eric Lempel, the head of global marketing at Sony Interactive Entertainment, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-05-12-sony-unveils-playstation-studios-brand-to-launch-alongside-ps5"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;GamesIndustry.biz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the branding “doesn’t mean that we outright own the developer, but it just means we brought it up as a first-party. In a lot of cases we don’t own the developer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Va1NEh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In a lot of cases we don’t own the developer.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rQhFr0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; specifically name-drops indie games from outside studios partnered with Sony, including the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Kena: Bridge of Spirits&lt;/em&gt;, and a game from Haven Studios. It’s unclear whether those and similar titles will be counted toward the more-than-25 figure. Sony didn’t immediately respond to a request for clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugebbq"&gt;Also, if Haven Studios doesn’t sound familiar, it’s because it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334101/jade-raymond-haven-game-studio-playstation"&gt;just formed in March&lt;/a&gt; when noted industry figure Jade Raymond left Google when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;shut down its in-house Stadia development studios&lt;/a&gt;. That speaks to the idea that we many not be seeing some of these games for quite a while. Hulst did mention that some of the games would be small, however, likely taking less development time. That, along with the fact that many of the games won’t be part of existing franchises, is exciting for non-AAA aficionados like myself and could help relieve worries that it’ll take a decade for all these games to come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dPoyZN"&gt;And while the games may not all be first-party games, that’s not necessarily a bad thing: &lt;em&gt;Returnal &lt;/em&gt;was a PlayStation Studios game made by an outside developer, and it’s an example of an original game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;that’s received a lot of praise&lt;/a&gt; since its release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oj1Vuy"&gt;It’s also worth noting that these games won’t necessarily be exclusive to the PS5. &lt;em&gt;MLB: The Show 21 &lt;/em&gt;is a PlayStation Studios game that’s available on Xbox, and &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn &lt;/em&gt;has gotten &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21363127/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-port-review-performance"&gt;a (somewhat troubled) PC port&lt;/a&gt;. Sony has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297091/days-gone-pc-playstation-games-ports-jim-ryan"&gt;said it’s interested&lt;/a&gt; in bringing more of its games to the PC in the future. There are also, of course, games that will come out for PS4 as well as PS5: we know that &lt;em&gt;Forbidden West &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-forbidden-west/"&gt;will be released on the older PlayStation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5emVeY"&gt;Even with all the caveats, it’s exciting to hear that Sony is working on a slate of games for the PS5, likely far beyond what we’ve already heard about. With Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407195/sony-ps5-sales-numbers-q4-2020-earnings"&gt;latest earnings report&lt;/a&gt; indicating that it’s sold 7.8 million PS5s, there are a lot of customers who will be looking for experiences that justify the cost of the PS5, and it seems like Sony is trying to make sure it’s got its bases covered. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees circulate petition demanding investigation into ‘misogynistic’ new hire</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jBojf7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 12, 9:36pm ET:&lt;/strong&gt; Apple has confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433437/apple-hire-antonio-garcia-martinez-out-petition-investigation"&gt;Antonio García Martínez is no longer with the company.&lt;/a&gt; The original story is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="68Mi9m"&gt;
&lt;p id="CwfNSW"&gt;A group of Apple employees has written a petition asking for an investigation into the hiring of Antonio García Martínez — a former Facebook product manager and author of the book &lt;em&gt;Chaos Monkeys.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2D4443"&gt;In the petition, the employees expressed concern about García Martínez’s views on women and people of color. His hiring “calls into question parts of our system of inclusion at Apple, including hiring panels, background checks, and our process to ensure our existing culture of inclusion is strong enough to withstand individuals who don’t share our inclusive values,” they write. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ob9PmH"&gt;More than 2,000 employees signed the letter prior to its publication in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAagkL"&gt;García Martínez, who has &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/author/antonio-garcia-martinez/"&gt;also written for &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was the product manager for Facebook’s ad targeting team from 2011 to 2013. Most of the things the Apple employees have expressed concern about come from &lt;em&gt;Chaos Monkeys&lt;/em&gt; itself. (The book is dedicated to “all my enemies.”) The autobiography traces García Martínez going from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. García Martínez has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/8/9/12415696/antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-recode-decode-podcast-transcript"&gt;described the book&lt;/a&gt; as “total Hunter S. Thompson/Gonzo mode.” The employees, in the petition, view it differently: they say it’s racist and sexist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NDEfjB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s so exhausting being a woman in tech; sitting opposite men who think because of my gender, I am soft and weak and generally full of shit”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0fs9Ja"&gt;One screenshot from the book that has been circulating on Twitter calls women in the Bay area “soft and weak, cosseted and naive despite their claims of worldliness, and generally full of shit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7Fqto"&gt;“It’s so exhausting being a woman in tech; sitting opposite men who think because of my gender, I am soft and weak and generally full of shit,” wrote an Apple employee on Twitter, drawing attention to the quote. “It’s not even worth it to say I have worked relentlessly for every accomplishment I have.” The tweet also contained a screenshot of the passage in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qnioq"&gt;Silicon Valley has consistently had a white, male workforce. There are some in the Valley, such as notorious ex-Googler James Damore, who suggest this is because women and people of color &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16153740/tech-diversity-problem-science-history-explainer-inequality"&gt;lack the innate qualities needed to succeed in tech&lt;/a&gt;. But wave after wave of sex discrimination lawsuits tell a different story: that underrepresented groups have been &lt;em&gt;prevented&lt;/em&gt; from succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGKFPT"&gt;At Apple, women make up 40 percent of the workforce but only 23 percent of the research and development teams, according to the company’s most recent diversity report. Half of the workforce is white, and 27 percent is Asian. “Across Apple, we’ve strengthened our long-standing commitment to making our company more inclusive and the world more just,” reads the header on the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/diversity/"&gt;website containing the report&lt;/a&gt;. “Where every great idea can be heard. And everybody belongs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRBLvn"&gt;Here’s the full text of the letter, which began circulating today (emphasis theirs): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="cuSgMh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10496899"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7sD6yz"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
