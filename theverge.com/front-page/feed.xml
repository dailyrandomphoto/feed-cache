    <title>Honor announces the Magic V, its first foldable smartphone</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honor’s new foldable, the Magic V.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Honor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vRv9FC"&gt;Former Huawei sub-brand Honor has just announced its first foldable smartphone, the Honor Magic V. It uses a similar folding form factor to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold devices, combining a large internal folding display with a smaller external display that can be used while the device is folded. Today is the foldable’s Chinese launch, where its price starts at ¥9,999 (around $1,569) for its 256GB storage model. It will go on open sale on January 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puGB6W"&gt;The Magic V’s flagship feature, its internal folding screen, measures 7.9 inches from corner to corner, has a resolution of 2272 x 1984 with a refresh rate of 90Hz, and an aspect ratio of 10:9. That’s slightly bigger than Samsung’s Z Fold 3, whose internal screen is 7.6 inches with a resolution of 2208 x 1768. Honor says the Magic V’s internal screen is like using two 21:9 screens side by side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWMekK"&gt;The Magic V’s external screen is also slightly larger than the Z Fold 3 at 6.45 inches (compared to 6.2 for Samsung), with a resolution of 2560 x 1080, a 120Hz refresh rate, and a 21:9 aspect ratio. Honor says this will help make the device more usable when you don’t want to unfold it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pqAqKnxfPipygOI4i1AW1A6XFeo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23158005/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_12.32.15_PM.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M4iOVM251Pj5YM_WPRwb-g8SZHc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23158009/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_12.29.52_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Honor&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honor’s foldable, folded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jym1Eh"&gt;When folded, the Magic V measures 72.7mm wide, 14.3mm thick, and has a height of 160.4mm, and when unfolded it expands to 141.1mm wide and is 6.7mm thick. That’s slightly wider than Samsung’s latest Z Fold, while being slightly thinner overall when folded. Honor’s foldable is slightly heavier, however. It’s available in three colors: orange, silver, and black, and Honor CEO George Zhao says it should survive being folded and unfolded 200,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hr0esu"&gt;Internally, the Magic V is running Qualcomm’s latest chipset, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, which is paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB or 512GB of storage. It’s got a 4,750mAh battery that can be charged at up to 66W, which gives you a 50 percent charge in 15 minutes. It’s 5G compatible and is running Honor’s Magic UI 6.0 software on top of Android 12, which supports the display of multiple app windows at the same time, Honor says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNoWvQ"&gt;In terms of cameras, Honor has included a trio of 50-megapixel sensors on the rear of the foldable, which include a main sensor, an ultrawide camera, and something Honor is calling a “spectrum enhanced camera.” We’ve followed up with the company for details on what exactly this third camera does. The Magic V has a pair of 42-megapixel selfie cameras, one embedded in the outer display, and one embedded in the inner folding screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NjOIA"&gt;Honor joins an increasingly long list of companies that have either announced or have started to sell foldable smartphones. Most recently, we saw Oppo announce its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837149/oppo-find-n-hands-on-announcement-specs-price"&gt;Find N&lt;/a&gt; late last year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;Honor’s former parent company Huawei&lt;/a&gt; also have foldable devices of their own. We’ve followed up with Honor to find out if, or when, the Magic V might see a global release. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked images show new Surface Go 3 matte black option</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z2BjSvoPFGwidlP2k4pS6OK7dsM=/477x0:3000x1682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70369170/surfacego3black.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jjsCrw"&gt;Microsoft appears to be readying a matte black version of the Surface Go 3. Leaked images from Aggiornamenti Lumia &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ALumia_Italia"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; show the 10.5-inch Surface Go 3 with a new matte black finish. The device looks identical to the Surface Go 3 otherwise, and the marketing images could suggest a launch is imminent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTwhXs"&gt;Microsoft first launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684608/microsoft-surface-go-3-processor-specs-price-features"&gt;Surface Go 3 in September&lt;/a&gt;, with new Intel processor options. The Surface Go 3 can be configured with an Intel Pentium Gold 6500Y or Core i3-10100Y, upgrades over the Surface Go 2, which launched with a Pentium Gold 4425Y or a Core m3 chip. Little else changed with the Surface Go 3 over the previous model, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aJABD6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/q10SpNcK5o"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q10SpNcK5o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Aggiornamenti Lumia (@ALumia_Italia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ALumia_Italia/status/1480474084253343747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3Txnxm"&gt;LTE versions of the Surface Go 3 are expected to arrive very soon, as Microsoft originally promised in September that these models would appear “in the coming months.” A matte black version could complement the launch of LTE versions of the Surface Go 3, alongside what’s expected to be a bumper year for Surface. Microsoft is set to celebrate 10 years of Surface with multiple product refreshes throughout 2022, according to sources familiar with the company’s plans.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says Apple ‘should not benefit from bullying’ created by iMessage lock-in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/56-uL5spppOk5I9TkLl66qtqb0Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70368827/akrales_181218_2952_0084.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s Messages app distinguishes between iOS users (in blue) and Android users (in green). &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yY1j6X"&gt;Google has accused Apple of benefiting from bullying as part of a deliberate strategy to make Android users into second-class citizens on the iPhone-maker’s iMessage service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvJ9pO"&gt;Apple’s messaging service includes a number of iOS-exclusive features, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17506010/apple-ios-12-imessage-how-to-make-memoji"&gt;Memoji&lt;/a&gt;, and famously turns texts from Android users green instead of the iOS-native blue. This has turned iMessage into a status symbol among US teens, creating peer pressure for young people to buy iPhones and sometimes leading to the ostracization of Android users. Showing up in a group chat as a green bubble has become, for some, a social faux pas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lL5hng"&gt;A recent report in &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apples-imessage-is-winning-teens-dread-the-green-text-bubble-11641618009"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; highlighted this dynamic and prompted a response from both the Android team and Google’s head of Android, Hiroshi Lockheimer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvidSI"&gt;“iMessage should not benefit from bullying. Texting should bring us together, and the solution exists. Let’s fix this as one industry,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Android/status/1479875457667448837"&gt;tweeted the official Android account&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgwqNp"&gt;Lockheimer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1479865157753147395"&gt;was more strident&lt;/a&gt;: “Apple’s iMessage lock-in is a documented strategy. Using peer pressure and bullying as a way to sell products is disingenuous for a company that has humanity and equity as a core part of its marketing. The standards exist today to fix this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aWzMmN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple says making iMessage available on Android would “hurt us more than help us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MtlNIi"&gt;Although Apple’s iMessage strategy has long been apparent, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;internal emails sent by company executives&lt;/a&gt; that were surfaced during the recent Epic Games trial confirmed the conscious importance of this strategy. Apple did consider making iMessage available on Android to attract more users, but concluded that doing so would “hurt us more than help us” (in the words of Apple exec Phil Schiller). As another executive, Craig Federighi, put it: “iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gWXGj"&gt;Google’s intervention here is not purely altruistic, of course: the company would benefit hugely from Apple making iMessage available on Android. Google has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715696/svp-android-invitation-apple-rcs-texting-iphone"&gt;recently been pushing&lt;/a&gt; for the iPhone-maker to support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/17/18681573/google-rcs-chat-android-texting-carriers-imessage-encryption"&gt;next-generation texting standard RCS&lt;/a&gt;, which is intended to replace SMS and has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584443/verizon-android-messages-rcs"&gt;gathered support&lt;/a&gt; from major US carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBsMkZ"&gt;Google is also not well-placed to criticize other companies messaging strategies. As &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; editor Ron Amadeo &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ronamadeo/status/1480025128763371523"&gt;noted on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, the search giant is notoriously dysfunctional when it comes to messaging, and has launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22538240/google-chat-allo-hangouts-talk-messaging-mess-timeline"&gt;13 separate messaging apps&lt;/a&gt; since iMessage came out in 2011 (most of which have failed).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Display’s new QD-OLED panel can hit 1,000 nits brightness for improved HDR  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hLJiwmoDm-sW6HjMgUMkdFWNVbY=/0x0:750x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70368754/3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Display’s new panels combine a self-emissive layer with quantum dots.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung Display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WSdRDT"&gt;Key specs for Samsung Display’s new QD-OLED TVs have been revealed by third-party certification company SGS, the &lt;a href="http://global.samsungdisplay.com/29275/"&gt;South Korean display manufacturer has announced&lt;/a&gt;. According to SGS the new panels are capable of hitting a brightness of 1,000 nits, and can display over 90 percent of the BT.2020 color space, which both represent substantial improvements over current OLED TVs on the market, otherwise known as WOLEDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rqH9E"&gt;The figures are in line with those that were put out by YouTube channel &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Piteu5gyKq0"&gt;LinusTechTips (LTT) last week&lt;/a&gt;, in a video that was sponsored by Samsung Display. So it’s notable that these relatively impressive specs have now been validated by an independent certification company, albeit only partially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="zo0wfU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10961963"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bTKGmQ"&gt;LinusTechTip’s video compares the QD-OLED’s specs with LG’s G1 OLED, which was its flagship from last year and has an OLED Evo panel. According to LTT, Samsung Display’s QD-OLED hit almost 200 nits in fullscreen brightness, rising to 1000 nits over a 10 percent patch, and 1500 nits over a 3 percent portion of the screen (in general, the less of an OLEDs screen it has to illuminate, the brighter it can get). In contrast, &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/lg/g1-oled"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rtings&lt;/em&gt; review of the LG G1&lt;/a&gt; has it hitting a maximum peak of 167 nits in fullscreen brightness, 827 nits on a 10 percent window, and 846 on a 2 percent window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4iBQ2"&gt;The new QD-OLED panels also reportedly have an impressively wide color gamut compared to the G1. While Samsung’s new panel can reportedly display over 90 percent of the BT.2020 color space, and 120 percent of the DCI-P3 color space according to SGS, &lt;em&gt;Rtings&lt;/em&gt; reports the G1 can only display around three quarters of the BT.2020 space, and around 100 percent of DCI-P3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZmSubN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Piteu5gyKq0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eBxG5S"&gt;Importantly, Samsung Display’s new panel appears to achieve this without sacrificing the existing benefits of OLED displays. These include pure blacks where no light is being emitted at all, not to mention excellent viewing angles compared to typical LCD TVs. In fact, SGS says the viewing angles of Samsung Display’s QD-OLEDs are even better than existing OLEDs, maintaining 80 percent of luminance when viewed from a 60-degree angle compared to 53 percent for a conventional OLED. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SU32Xy"&gt;An important caveat is that all of these comparisons were made with LG’s 2021 flagship, which is due to be superseded this year when it releases a new lineup of OLED TVs. LG Display also has a new generation of OLED panels of its own, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/29/22858131/lg-oled-ex-technology-improved-brightness-accuracy-ces-2022"&gt;dubbed OLED EX&lt;/a&gt;, which it says offer increased brightness levels of up to 30 percent. Whether that’s enough to remain competitive with Samsung’s new panels remains to be seen.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zO0V3M"&gt;We’ll still have to wait for consumer TVs to actually make it to market using both panels before we can be completely sure of these readings, but it’s looking like an impressive set of results for Samsung Display’s latest technology. And Samsung’s display arm produces panels for a variety of companies, so it won’t just be Samsung’s own TVs that benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0Nc5p"&gt;The question still remains when, exactly, Samsung Display’s new panels will actually go on sale. Interestingly the first QD-OLED TV to be announced wasn’t from Samsung Electronics, but was instead &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865220/sony-a95k-qd-oled-qdoled-4k-tv-announced-features-explainer"&gt;from Sony&lt;/a&gt; which said its Bravia XR A95K will use a QD-OLED panel from Samsung Display. Alienware also has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855531/alienware-curved-34-inch-qd-oled-samsung-gaming-monitor-specs"&gt;QD-OLED computer monitor&lt;/a&gt; in the works. When Samsung Electronics will eventually release a QD-OLED TV of its own is anyone’s guess.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s ‘Full Self-Driving’ beta has an ‘assertive’ driving mode that ‘may perform rolling stops’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D6mTSVY6rtQdU0seZMGDs0A6Tc8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70367881/tesla_model_y_3605.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0oCQK5"&gt;Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta lets you choose from three driving “profiles” that dictate how the car will react to certain situations on the road. Each mode, “Chill,” “Average,” and “Assertive,” varies in terms of aggressiveness (and potentially safety). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqDOXI"&gt;The feature was included in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tesla_raj/status/1452152897798426625"&gt;October 2021 version 10.3 update&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/24/22743628/elon-musk-tesla-fsd-beta-10-3-rollback-issues-phantom-fcw"&gt;was pulled two days after&lt;/a&gt; it started rolling out due to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1451907229796417542?s=20"&gt;an issue with left turns at traffic lights&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1452576223620747266"&gt;issued version 10.3.1&lt;/a&gt; one day later, which still includes FSD profiles, as shown on the release notes posted on &lt;a href="https://www.notateslaapp.com/software-updates/version/2021.36.5.3/release-notes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not a Tesla App&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Based on these notes, FSD profiles are described as a way “to control behaviors like rolling stops, speed-based lane changes, following distance and yellow light headway.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rPcUL9"&gt;A separate image posted to Twitter gives us a more detailed glimpse at what this actually means. In the description beneath the “Assertive” option, Tesla notes the vehicle will “have a smaller follow distance” and “perform more frequent speed lane changes.” The vehicle will also “not exit passing lanes” and “may perform rolling stops,” and it’s not entirely clear whether this means cars won’t come to a full stop at stop signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QPhnXk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1jL6YpmJvGg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="45Dv1M"&gt;A YouTube video shows all three modes in action, and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/1jL6YpmJvGg?t=713"&gt;towards the end&lt;/a&gt;, it shows how Tesla describes each FSD profile. In “Chill” mode, the vehicle will “have a larger follow distance and perform fewer speed lane changes,” while “Average” mode means the car “will have a medium follow distance and may perform rolling stops.” That said, it’s a bit hard to distinguish the difference between these modes from this video alone, as it doesn’t test out the vehicle’s behavior in heavy traffic or harsh weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReQITV"&gt;It’s hard to tell just how much these FSD profiles change the way the vehicle drives, and if they push the limits of safety, especially when traveling in the rain or snow. If the descriptions of these profiles are accurate, this means that a Tesla in “Assertive” mode may follow cars more closely, come to rolling stops, and swap lanes more frequently — behaviors that tend to be more dangerous no matter the car you’re in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I81FKG"&gt;It’s important to note that Tesla’s FSD feature doesn’t make the car completely autonomous — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20929529/tesla-full-self-driving-release-2019-beta"&gt;a “feature complete” version&lt;/a&gt; would ideally let users drive to and from work without intervention. Tesla’s controversial FSD beta was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;rolled out to more users last September&lt;/a&gt; based on a “Safety Score” system that prioritizes drivers with safer driving habits, something that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682272/ntsb-official-tesla-safety-elon-musk-full-self-driving"&gt;the National Transportation Safety Board cautioned against&lt;/a&gt;. In November, what appears to be the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778135/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-crash-fsd-california"&gt;first-ever crash involving Tesla’s FSD mode&lt;/a&gt; left a Tesla severely damaged.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Open source developer corrupts widely-used libraries, affecting tons of projects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0UNSo89UblGTRoWWMuxrpZMXbUk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70367266/acastro_180109_1777_0001_v1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q4MEWC"&gt;A developer appears to have purposefully corrupted a pair of open-source libraries on GitHub and software registry npm — “&lt;a href="https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/"&gt;faker.js&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://github.com/Marak/colors.js"&gt;colors.js&lt;/a&gt;” — that thousands of users depend on, rendering any project that contains these libraries useless, as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dev-corrupts-npm-libs-colors-and-faker-breaking-thousands-of-apps/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While it looks like color.js has been updated to a working version, faker.js still appears to be affected, but the issue can be worked around by downgrading to a previous version (5.5.3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BvfLXO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The sabotaged versions cause applications to infinitely output strange letters and symbols&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BLApeO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt; found that the developer of these two libraries, Marak Squires, introduced a malignant commit (a file revision on GitHub) to colors.js that adds “&lt;a href="https://github.com/Marak/colors.js/commit/074a0f8ed0c31c35d13d28632bd8a049ff136fb6"&gt;a new American flag module&lt;/a&gt;,” as well as rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker"&gt;version 6.6.6&lt;/a&gt; of faker.js, triggering the same destructive turn of events. The sabotaged versions cause applications to infinitely output strange letters and symbols, beginning with three lines of text that read “LIBERTY LIBERTY LIBERTY.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYB5FT"&gt;Even more curiously, the faker.js Readme file has also been changed to “What really happened with Aaron Swartz?” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/22/3898584/aaron-swartz-profile-memory-to-myth"&gt;Swartz was a prominent developer who helped establish&lt;/a&gt; Creative Commons, RSS, and Reddit. In 2011, Swartz was charged for stealing documents from the academic database JSTOR with the purpose of making them free to access, and later committed suicide in 2013. Squires’ mention of Swartz could potentially refer to conspiracy theories surrounding his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jO06ri"&gt;As pointed out by &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/18323"&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/workshopper/javascripting/issues/327"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/oclif/oclif/issues/786"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; — including some working with Amazon’s Cloud Development Kit — turned to GitHub’s bug tracking system to voice their concerns about the issue. And since &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker"&gt;faker.js&lt;/a&gt; sees nearly 2.5 million weekly downloads on npm, and &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors"&gt;color.js&lt;/a&gt; gets about 22.4 million downloads per week, the effects of the corruption are likely far-reaching. For context, faker.js generates fake data for demos, color.js adds colors to javascript consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmlUfL"&gt;In response to the problem, &lt;a href="https://github.com/Marak/colors.js/issues/285"&gt;Squires posted an update&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub to address the “zalgo issue,” which refers to the glitchy text that the corrupt files produce. “It’s come to our attention that there is a zalgo bug in the v1.4.44-liberty-2 release of colors,” Squires writes in a presumably sarcastic way. “Please know we are working right now to fix the situation and will have a resolution shortly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nOHwVN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;NPM has reverted to a previous version of the faker.js package and Github has suspended my access to all public and private projects. I have 100s of projects. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AaronSwartz?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AaronSwartz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/zFddwn631S"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zFddwn631S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— marak   (@marak) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marak/status/1479200803948830724?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XCbBHo"&gt;Two days after pushing the corrupt update to faker.js, Squires later sent out a tweet noting he’s been suspended from GitHub, despite storing hundreds of projects on the site. Judging by the changelog on both faker.js and colors.js, however, it looks like his suspension has already been lifted. Squires introduced the faker.js commit on January 4th, got banned on January 6th, and didn’t introduce the “liberty” version of colors.js until January 7th. It’s unclear whether Squires’ account has been banned again. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to GitHub with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zz56Dg"&gt;The story doesn’t end there, though. &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt; dug up one of &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210704022108/https://github.com/Marak/faker.js/issues/1046"&gt;Squires’ posts on GitHub from November 2020&lt;/a&gt;, in which he declares he no longer wants to do free work. “Respectfully, I am no longer going to support Fortune 500s (and other smaller sized companies) with my free work,” he says. “Take this as an opportunity to send me a six figure yearly contract or fork the project and have someone else work on it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZ9ncy"&gt;Squires’ bold move draws attention to the moral — and financial — dilemma of open-source development, which was likely the goal of his actions. A massive number of websites, software, and apps rely on open-source developers to create essential tools and components — all for free. It’s the same issue that results in unpaid developers working tirelessly to fix the security issues in their open-source software, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/8/5594266/how-heartbleed-broke-the-internet"&gt;Heartbleed scare in 2014&lt;/a&gt; that affected OpenSSL and the more recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828303/log4j-library-vulnerability-log4shell-zero-day-exploit"&gt;Log4Shell vulnerability found in log4j&lt;/a&gt; that left volunteers scrambling to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Victims of $200 million hack of BitMart crypto exchange still waiting to get their money back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nrw6u83S1hzgldBbgxfnTMmqBeo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70366519/acastro_170621_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JOF1Hz"&gt;Cryptocurrency exchange BitMart promised a full reimbursement to the victims of the platform-wide $200 million hack, but some users still haven’t gotten their money back, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/07/cryptocurrency-theft-bitmart-still-owes-victims-of-200-million-hack.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Hackers &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/05/hackers-take-196-million-from-crypto-exchange-bitmart-in-large-breach.html"&gt;made off with a variety of tokens on December 4th&lt;/a&gt; after using a stolen privacy key to gain access to one of BitMart’s hot wallets, otherwise known as a crypto wallet that’s connected to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2At94"&gt;Shortly after the incident, &lt;a href="https://support.bmx.fund/hc/en-us/articles/4411998987419-BitMart-Security-Breach-Update"&gt;BitMart announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would use its own funding “to cover the incident and compensate affected users.” However, as &lt;em&gt;CNBC &lt;/em&gt;reports, there are still several frustrated users who have yet to see their funds returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTgPrS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;’s report details the experience of an Iranian refugee who says he stored $53,000 worth of SafeMoon on BitMart, $40,000 of which is from a loan. The outlet also got in touch with a Kansas-based investor who has $35,000 in limbo — he claims that he and 6,800 other investors may file a class-action lawsuit against BitMart if nothing’s done to resolve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0WZJv2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;WE AINT SLOWING DOWN   KEEP TWEETING &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WENBITMART?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WENBITMART&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— SAFEMOON SQUAD (@SAFEMOONSQUAD) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SAFEMOONSQUAD/status/1478393134602149891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 4, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ut2uWp"&gt;Of all the tokens stolen in the BitMart hack, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1467310381073047552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1467310381073047552%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fbitmart-hacked-for-200m-following-ethereum-binance-smart-chain-exploit"&gt;data from blockchain security company, PeckShield&lt;/a&gt;, shows that SafeMoon was hit hardest. As pointed out by &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;, SafeMoon holders are fighting back on Twitter, and have been flooding the site with the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WenBitMart"&gt;#WenBitMart&lt;/a&gt; hashtag to demand the return of their funds. This may be the only way users feel they can call attention to the issue, as &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; reports some users are met with vague responses when contacting BitMart to check on the status of their lost funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SV27NX"&gt;It remains unclear just how BitMart plans on reimbursing all affected users. &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; notes that while the exchange could buy back all of the tokens lost, it may be doing so when those tokens are at a much higher value. Other users question whether BitMart will be using some form of insurance to pay users back. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to BitMart with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox shuts down Chinese mobile app to work on a new version</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration Roblox logo seen displayed on a..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YKb-evzGcrJDIU6tk8luPu5WFy0=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70364749/1232033982.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hvajok"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; shut down the Chinese version of its iOS and Android app, also known as &lt;em&gt;LuoBuLeSi&lt;/em&gt;, just five months after its release in China, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/roblox-transition-china-luobulesi-tencent/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The app, which was rolled out as a test in &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/apps-social/article/3112379/us-gaming-platform-roblox-licensed-release-china-company-plans-go"&gt;partnership with Chinese game company Tencent&lt;/a&gt;, will be rebuilt and potentially re-released in the country at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D04Q1J"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; was officially taken off app stores on December 8th of last year, as announced on a translated version of &lt;a href="https://roblox.qq.com/web202106/news-detail.shtml?newsid=15359110"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; China’s website&lt;/a&gt;. The post thanks players for testing out the app, and says that developers will “continue to optimize the product.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NuKUQh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A number of important transitory actions are necessary” as devs rebuild the app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pWGOfn"&gt;“Last year, we launched &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; China also known as &lt;em&gt;LuoBuLeSi&lt;/em&gt; with a vision to build an immersive virtual universe of 3D experiences in China that we have been testing and iterating on along the way,” &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; spokesperson James Kay said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It is critical that we now make the necessary investments, including investments in our data architecture, in order to realize our long-term vision for &lt;em&gt;LuoBuLeSi&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BTCh2b"&gt;As for why the &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; app was removed, Kay told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “a number of important transitory actions are necessary” as the platform prepares to build another version of the app. Kay also didn’t share any additional details about when the new version will be released, noting that the company will make the information public when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZehvBs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;’s brief debut in China hasn’t been free of challenges — the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8542ddf7-0962-4019-9450-10f2ec7b9d07"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that the platform appeared to struggle against Chinese competitors, like the &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3130476/tiktok-owner-bytedance-boosts-investment-roblox-video-game"&gt;similar ByteDance-owned Reworld&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from that, &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; encountered an even bigger challenge: China itself. &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; notes that &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; was subject to China’s regulatory standards, despite marketing itself as an educational game, resulting in the censorship of some of its features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9DM3Ia"&gt;The shutdown of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; China, albeit temporary, marks the sudden cessation of yet another popular game in the country. In November, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22758154/china-fortnite-shut-down-november"&gt;Epic Games closed out a test of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in China without much of an explanation, despite the game having heavy modifications to comply with China’s strict content rules. Even more surprising, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/25/22853520/steam-global-china-banned"&gt;global version of Steam appears to be banned in China&lt;/a&gt; as of late December, perhaps to replace the service with the much more limited Chinese version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKlSTx"&gt;Ahead of all these gaming-related shutdowns, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22648107/china-curbs-gaming-addiction-3-hours-each-week-spiritual-opium"&gt;Chinese regulators compared video games to “spiritual opium”&lt;/a&gt; and began limiting kids’ screen time to just three hours per week. This is in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-50315960"&gt;a curfew that prohibits children from gaming&lt;/a&gt; between 10PM and 8AM, which is supposed to fight video game addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="8YJChP"&gt;With AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon set to bring their 5G expansion live on January 19th, &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statements-5g"&gt;the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has chosen&lt;/a&gt; 50 airports (&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/2022-01/50%20Airports%20with%205G%20Buffer.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) that will have buffer zones to help prevent flight disruptions (via &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-faa-details-50-airports-that-will-have-5g-buffer-zones-2022-01-08/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/faa-selects-airports-for-5g-buffer-zones-11641609361"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Safety regulators picked airports based on location, traffic volume, and the likelihood of low visibility — all factors that may increase cancelations, delays, and diversions as both carriers roll out 5G C-band service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOd3oM"&gt;As pointed out by the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, notably busy airports like Chicago O’Hare, Orlando International, Los Angeles International, and Dallas / Fort Worth International are included on the list, along with airports in locations that are often impacted by foggy conditions, such as Seattle / Tacoma International and San Francisco International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e2kesa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon will turn off 5G transmitters at buffer zones for six months&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4QT6vg"&gt;The FAA notes that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have agreed to turn off their 5G transmitters at these specific buffer zones for six months, which should “minimize potential 5G interference with sensitive aircraft instruments used in low-visibility landings.” Some airports — including major hubs like Hartsfield / Jackson International and Denver International — didn’t make the list, either because they aren’t in locations where 5G C-Band deployment will take place, or they can’t permit low-visibility landings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cX0Ttp"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have been itching to deploy their improved 5G service ever since they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;spent a combined $70 billion last year&lt;/a&gt; on securing chunks of the C-band spectrum, which should provide a middle ground in terms of 5G speed and coverage — something that both carriers’ 5G service is currently lacking. The two currently offer 5G service using super fast high-band millimeter wave technology that only covers small areas, as well as the low-band spectrum, which provides a lot of coverage with slow service akin to 4G LTE. T-Mobile already offers mid-band 5G service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746708/att-5g-plus-expansion-tmobile"&gt;but it isn’t in the C-band range&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BZJsj"&gt;Both Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T were originally set to switch on their 5G expansions on December 5th, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;air safety fears delayed the launch&lt;/a&gt; twice. The carriers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863964/faa-fcc-verizon-att-c-band-5g-airports-proposal-rejected"&gt;ended up rejecting the FAA’s request&lt;/a&gt; to delay the rollout until January 5th but later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;came to an agreement&lt;/a&gt; to turn on service on January 19th, giving the FAA additional time to account for potential flight disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="0vJExP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-webb-telescope-reaches-major-milestone-as-mirror-unfolds"&gt;The James Webb Telescope (JWST) has finished unfolding&lt;/a&gt; its primary mirror, ending a series of major deployments that took place over the span of two weeks. All of those deployments needed to go perfectly in order for the massive space telescope, which was decades in the making, to function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fVe4b"&gt;The JWST has two primary mirror panels on either side that it will use to collect infrared light from the distant Universe. Each of them consists of three gold-plated hexagonal mirrors. Today, the rightmost wing was successfully unfurled, just one day after &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/01/07/first-of-two-primary-mirror-wings-unfolds/"&gt;the leftmost wing was deployed&lt;/a&gt;. Now that both sides have been locked into place, this completes the array of 18 mirrors that makes up the 21-foot-wide JWST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Mx89W4"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Congratulations, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAWebb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NASAWebb&lt;/a&gt;! You are fully deployed!  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stay tuned over the coming months as the space telescope reaches its destination of Lagrange point 2 and prepares to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UnfoldTheUniverse?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#UnfoldTheUniverse&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="https://t.co/qg6jmVRCsH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qg6jmVRCsH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA (@NASA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1479880428878245901?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J2gL7H"&gt;The JWST &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/25/22850167/james-webb-space-telescope-jwst-launch-mission-success"&gt;launched into space&lt;/a&gt; on Christmas Day, and since the full-size mirror was too large to fit on a rocket, scientists designed it in a way that allows its components to fold, something that has never been done before. Once the JWST reached space, it began the precarious unfolding process. Earlier this week, the spacecraft pulled off its most complex hurdle: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22857571/nasa-jwst-space-telescope-sunshield-deployment-success"&gt;the deployment of a sunshield&lt;/a&gt; JWST uses to block light from the Sun and keep its instruments cold. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22816310/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-jwst-deployment-sequence"&gt;JWST now in its final form&lt;/a&gt;, scientists will have to toy with the mirrors a bit more to ensure that they’re aligned, as well as continue to calibrate its instruments to get it ready to reveal the Universe’s secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5rohz"&gt;In about two more weeks, the JWST will reach its final destination in deep space. We’re going to have to wait until summer to get some of the first images from the JWST, but it will likely be worth the wait.&lt;/p&gt;
