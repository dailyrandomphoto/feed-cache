    <title>You can now play every classic Halo on Xbox with a mouse and keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bcS1qO22j6FZ5NpU9KWWK9NXLLc=/0x0:1917x1278/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69090966/halo_mcc_update.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hJJp18"&gt;Today, you can fire up an Xbox game console and play &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; with a mouse and keyboard. It’s hard to believe I’m writing those words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yT8wDK"&gt;Five years ago, I asked a small room of first-party Xbox devs how they felt about supporting mouse and keyboard (now that their boss Phil Spencer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/623516307137269760"&gt;had confirmed they were on the way&lt;/a&gt;), but they were seriously skeptical. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18095086/xbox-one-keyboard-mouse-support-november-update-release"&gt;It took two more years&lt;/a&gt; for the Xbox One to get even a handful of keyboard and mouse titles in a November 2018 update. Even though games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20873038/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-cross-play-beta-how-it-works-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;COD: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280358/fortnite-aim-assist-sypherpk-tfue-shooters-epic-games-fairness"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have paved the way for controller parity, the industry is still understandably wary about mixing console and keyboard players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2q9OS"&gt;But now, keyboard and mouse is a native part of &lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection &lt;/em&gt;(including &lt;em&gt;Halo CE, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo 3: ODST, Halo: Reach&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;a href="https://support.halowaypoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059503311"&gt;as of a new April 2021 patch&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s not alone: every Xbox that can play the game will let you adjust your field of view, crosshairs, and bind controls across multiple inputs, like any good competitive PC-grade shooter should. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wkvmJb09LYPnoAYlrXSp7Z3Zvn8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427494/chrome_ov27dewket.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="glu1nG"&gt;Not only does that mean parity with PC, it might actually make the Xbox version of &lt;em&gt;Halo: MCC &lt;/em&gt;preferable for some. As my colleague Tom Warren points out, it’s easier to avoid cheaters in console games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gw2HfB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;seeing mouse and keyboard support in Halo on Xbox makes me wish Destiny 2 had this. I’d switch immediately from PC, which is full of hackers, aimbots, and other exploits that ruin the PvP experience&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1379852440263143424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vQ2iAt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.halowaypoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059503311"&gt;The full patch notes &lt;/a&gt;also mention new accessibility options, a new “Escalation Slayer” game variant, a new map for &lt;em&gt;Halo 3&lt;/em&gt;, and that you can easily set your in-game chat and audio devices separately now on PC. And, of course, there’s a new season of content dubbed “Raven”. &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/mcc-season-6-raven-has-landed"&gt;More info on that here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wbr4fA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ImP5qjZQKNM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d3siwE"&gt;Me, I’ve played &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; with a mouse and keyboard almost since the beginning. The first copy I owned &lt;a href="https://www.gearboxsoftware.com/press_release/halo-pc-goes-gold/"&gt;was the Gearbox port for PC&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been a long-time favorite at LAN parties. Ah, do I miss LAN parties.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s speckled G15 brings high-end AMD Ryzen processors to value-minded gamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dell G15 Ryzen Edition" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IlncbVhgpTl5ELQw8owsn-rw1cs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088327/g15lineup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Budget-friendly gaming laptops are looking better than ever&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WfNhlU"&gt;Alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22131848"&gt;Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition&lt;/a&gt;, Dell is also launching a more affordable 15-inch Dell G15 Ryzen Edition gaming laptop. It’s for people who still want to experience AMD’s fast Ryzen 5000 H-series processors, along with an Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics chip, but for less. If the M15 R5’s $1,793.98 starting price is too high, the G15’s $899.99 entry-level configuration might be a more reasonable price point for you to jump in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1czH6"&gt;The G15’s speckled design might look familiar to you. That’s because Dell actually launched the Intel-based version of this model already, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319292/dell-g15-gaming-laptop-2021-announced-china-paint-speckles-specs"&gt;but in China first&lt;/a&gt;. This new Ryzen-based laptop is landing first in China as well, on April 30th, followed by a May 4th release elsewhere around the globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dw7cHg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s an Intel version, too, but it’s running last-gen chips&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FRKvJz"&gt;The starting configuration of the G15 Ryzen Edition will be fairly barebones in terms of RAM and storage, shipping with 8GB of 3,200MHz DDR4 RAM, and 256GB of NVMe M.2 capacity. It packs plenty of power otherwise for a $900 laptop, with a Ryzen 5 5600H hexa-core processor and an Nvidia RTX 3060 with 6GB of VRAM. In case you want something more powerful, the CPU be tweaked up to the Ryzen 7 5800H octa-core CPU, RAM can be added (either through Dell or by opening the laptop yourself), and you can configure it with up to 2TB of solid-state storage. The more powerful processor can also come with a bigger six-cell 86Wh battery, though you’ll get a three-cell 56Wh pack at the $900 mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJfDip"&gt;At launch, the G15 can also be configured with a 120Hz refresh rate FHD panel at a fairly standard 250 nits of brightness, or a brighter 300-nit screen with a faster 165Hz refresh rate. Dell says a 360Hz refresh rate screen will be available later in the spring. Dell says the new G15 has adopted an “Alienware-inspired” thermal design to keep it running efficiently, and it certainly looks the part. It’ll come in at least two speckled colors at launch, a green and a grey. Later this year, an all-black model will be available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dell G15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eDa_LwrJ4rKWAvkVlxxAn-aydXM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422232/g15ryzenlede.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G15 takes some cues from Alienware’s M15 series of much pricier gaming laptops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dbdemy"&gt;This laptop ships by default with non-backlit, spill-resistant keyboard, but there are some upgrades you can make here. The first step up adds orange backlighting beneath the entire keyboard and emphasizes WASD. If orange doesn’t do it for you, there’s a four-zone RGB backlit keyboard that you can customize for a more colorful presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wb4zdQ"&gt;If the Ryzen Edition G15 is anything like last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;G5 15 SE&lt;/a&gt; in terms of performance, I’m excited to test it out. Assuming that it does, even the lower-end model should be reasonably powerful for people trying to stretch their dollar as far as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAhgPX"&gt;If you really want the Intel version, Dell says a variant of it will launch in the US on April 13th for $799.99, but it’ll feature a last-gen 10th Gen Intel processor. Dell included this bit of information practically as a footnote, to give you an idea of how much emphasis it’s putting behind Ryzen this time around. The starting model features a Core i5-10200H quad-core CPU with Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1650 graphics chip. Upgrading can net you the vastly more powerful Core i7-10870H octa-core CPU with the RTX 3060, and you can get Thunderbolt ports. Dell didn’t share the price for the high-end Intel model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Znvuns"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Alienware lowered the starting price of its M15 R5 from $2,229.99 to $1,793.98, so I changed the price mentioned in the opening paragraph to reflect this update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alienware’s M15 R5 is its first AMD-based gaming laptop in over a decade</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-UH-XwL5q9IIRfdfYs7u7uamLjY=/0x0:2160x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088309/alienwarem15r5lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RcZ5Tu"&gt;Alienware has announced the latest revision to its flagship gaming laptop lineup, the 15-inch Alienware M15 R5. It’ll start shipping on April 20th in the US, costing $1,793.98 to start. The company is going big with its messaging that it’ll host AMD’s fast Ryzen 5000 H-series processors (up to the octa-core Ryzen 9 5900HX) and up to Nvidia’s RTX 3070 graphics chip. Dell says this is the first Alienware laptop since 2007 to feature an AMD processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GG4Xam"&gt;In case you haven’t noticed, AMD’s processors have been on a tear in the past year, delivering great performance without compromising on efficiency when you aren’t gaming. This is just the latest company to join along the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus&lt;/a&gt;, Lenovo, and even Dell with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;G5 15 SE&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few. AMD-touting laptops are already among some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptops you can buy&lt;/a&gt;. Yet Alienware is possibly the most well-known gaming brand to go AMD yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="q0sGxs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Big boost clocks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SV1J9c"&gt;The base configuration of the M15 R5 has the octa-core Ryzen 7 5800H processor and Nvidia’s RTX 3060. You can upgrade to the Ryzen 9 5900HX octa-core processor and the RTX 3070. Both the RTX 3060 and 3070 have a total graphics power level of 115W with 10W of extra boost available for up to 125W of maximum graphics power. Interestingly, the 3060 has a higher base and boost clock (base: 1,387MHz, boost: 1,702MHz) than the 3070 option does (base: 1,110MHz, boost: 1,560MHz). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1JWLj"&gt;Either way, these are some of the highest clock speeds we’ve seen yet in a reasonably thin 2021 gaming laptop. Alienware is pushing the boost clocks nearly all the way to the ceiling, and it’s great that it’s transparent about these power specs, since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;Nvidia now requires that manufacturers share it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dfMrwvr3yTE2o6ne4aOc9aiYSo8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425146/m15r5tilt.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ryzen Edition will ship in this silver configuration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vycfFh"&gt;Speaking of dimensions, the R5 is thicker and heavier than the previous R4 generation. The base configuration weighs 5.34 pounds (up to 5.93 pounds, depending on the components inside). The R4’s base configuration weighed 4.65 pounds, for comparison. The R5 is 19.25mm thick at its front (up to 22.85mm thick near the hinge), 272.5mm deep, and 356mm wide. Each configuration will ship with an 86Wh battery, like what shipped in the M15 R4 and R3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPCP0y"&gt;Screen-wise, the R5 can be configured with a range of high-refresh-rate displays. The base FHD screen has a 3ms response time screen with a 165Hz refresh rate, and your options for upgrading are either a dimmer 300-nit 1080p panel with a faster 360Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and only 100 percent sRGB color coverage, or a brighter 400-nit QHD screen that has a 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, 100 percent DCI-P3 color gamut, plus G-Sync, which should deliver the smoothest experience even if your framerate dips. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u8ZNx3elRaRztqbZyTWPlgJOUXg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22421558/m15r5inpost.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M15 R5 looks similar to the previous two generations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6X0UV"&gt;If you want to output to a separate display, the laptop’s HDMI 2.1 port means it can display up to 120 frames per second at 4K resolution if your monitor (or TV) supports it. This laptop also features an 2.5Gbps Ethernet port, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, one USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, one USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port, and a headphone jack. There’s no Thunderbolt port, but that Intel technology might find its way into an Intel-based version later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIr2w0"&gt;Dell says this is the first Alienware laptop to feature fast 3,200MHz DDR4 RAM, and it’s also user-configurable with two SO-DIMM slots. This is a move in the right direction, as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21459895/alienware-m15-r3-gaming-laptop-review-intel-rtx-nvidia-15-inch"&gt;M15 R3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/alienware-m15-r4-review"&gt;R4&lt;/a&gt; both had their RAM soldered onto the board, making it impossible to upgrade after you bought it. There are two M.2 slots inside so you can upgrade storage post-purchase, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oic6c0"&gt;The company says the laptop’s paint has been engineered for “increased stain-resistance and premium surface feel.” This model can be configured to feature Cherry’s Ultra-Low Profile mechanical switches. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22333684/alienware-m15-m17-gaming-laptops-cherry-mx-ultra-low-mechanical-keyboard-switches-price"&gt;Dell announced this keyboard collaboration for the M15 R4&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll be available as a $150 add-on for this new model, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwEDy5"&gt;If you’re looking for a more budget-friendly gaming laptop with a new Ryzen 5000 H-series processor, check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22132051"&gt;Dell’s $899 G15 that was also just announced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xB8ree"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Following the announcement, Alienware changed the starting price of the M15 R5 to $1,793.98, down from $2,229.99. A spokesperson confirmed that there’s no difference in terms of specs with the starting model, the price was simply reduced.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new AR toy fulfills the childhood dream of digging a hole to the other side of the Earth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H9OOrkiNb6fyGZc9q6romuVW8pc=/0x193:1748x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69090916/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_11.15.28_AM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CWU5oY"&gt;If you’ve ever wondered where you’d end up if you were to transport directly to the other side of the Earth, Google now has a browser-based AR toy that lets you find out. &lt;a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/floom"&gt;It calls the site Floom&lt;/a&gt;, and the experience is pretty simple: you point your phone’s camera at the ground, tap the little tornado object, and it will show you a hole to the other side of the Earth. Then you can open that location in Google Earth to take a look around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeUpqr"&gt;Testing it out was kind of a joy, and I have discovered that, depending on where I am in my house (and how I have my phone angled), I'm directly above either the Middle East, New Zealand, or the Antarctic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="3rfepy"&gt;Floom is just one of the experiments that &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-ar-vr/webxr-experiments/"&gt;Google announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that rely on WebXR, which can &lt;a href="https://immersiveweb.dev"&gt;create AR or VR experiences that work in webpages&lt;/a&gt;. The others include &lt;a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/measureup"&gt;a virtual measuring tool&lt;/a&gt; and a tool that lets you &lt;a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/sodar"&gt;visualize what six-foot social distancing looks like in your current environment&lt;/a&gt;. Google also has an upcoming app that will let you turn your photos library into an AR gallery. At the moment, Floom can only be used with Chrome on Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CBzUn"&gt;These WebXR experiments are the first experience I’ve had with the tech, and it’s reasonably impressive for something that’s running in a phone’s web browser. Google’s experiments have always been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/12/15/22176785/google-blob-opera-machine-learning-singing-christmas-carols"&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt;, but this is the first one that lets me fulfill a childhood dream: digging a tunnel to the other side of the globe. Now all Google needs to add is a visualization that makes it seem like you’re flying through the Earth’s core.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Buy’s new Beta program promises concierge tech support for $200 a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Buy 86th street new york (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fkGrQbKpU5Wso2jY3Jw19FMhOds=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69090832/best-buy-logo-stock1_2040.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PYg7mt"&gt;Best Buy is &lt;a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/best-buy-piloting-paid-membership-program-in-select-markets/"&gt;piloting a new paid membership service&lt;/a&gt; that would provide exclusive perks, including concierge-style tech support and exclusive pricing. The subscription service, which will cost $200 a year or $180 if you have a Best Buy credit card, bears similarities with Amazon’s Prime subscription as Best Buy looks to expand its services outside the sale of consumer tech products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSerTM"&gt;The new membership, called &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fdni%2Fbest-buy-membership%2Fpcmcat1607119147723.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1607119147723&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy Beta&lt;/a&gt;, grants members access to a slew of benefits, including free standard shipping, unlimited Geek Squad technical support, exclusive member pricing, and a 60-day extended return window. Best Buy confirmed that Beta members will also have 24/7 access to a concierge team, which they can contact by phone, email, chat, or through the Best Buy mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2SbxKGStBpleTLD9SbsH0CkoSjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427348/BestBuyBeta_FINAL_scaled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Best Buy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here are a few perks included with the Best Buy membership program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="otWRHQ"&gt;Best Buy already has a $200 membership program called &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fservices%2Ftotal-tech-support%2Fpcmcat1494357892646.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1494357892646&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Total Tech Support&lt;/a&gt; that provides similar services, but it will be unavailable in the pilot markets. In fact, based on how similar both services are, there’s a possibility that Best Buy will discontinue Total Tech Support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WynMIs"&gt;Best Buy is not the first retail giant to roll out a service to compete with Amazon Prime. Last September, Walmart released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21409944/walmart-free-delivery-subscription-service-walmart-compete-amazon-prime"&gt;its own subscription service&lt;/a&gt; for $98 a year, offering minimal benefits such as free delivery on orders over $35 and fuel discounts at select gas stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRHzi6"&gt;Best Buy is piloting the new Beta membership in three states: Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Oklahoma, but the retailer says it plans to expand the annual subscription to select stores in Minnesota, North Carolina, and Tennessee sometime this month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix brings parental guilt to the world of superheroes with the first Jupiter’s Legacy trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PsCPunXg9BWHtWekkI5IBh2o7_Y=/315x0:1052x491/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69090401/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_9.24.13_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KwShBS"&gt;Netflix just showed off the first fruits of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/17/17581978/netflix-nx-social-media-sci-fi-fantasy-mark-millar"&gt;its deal&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Wanted&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Kick-Ass&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; a&lt;/em&gt;nd &lt;em&gt;Kingsman: The Secret Service &lt;/em&gt;co&lt;em&gt;-&lt;/em&gt;creator Mark Millar. &lt;em&gt;Jupiter’s Legacy&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1379781007272906752?s=20"&gt;a new live-action TV series&lt;/a&gt; based on Millar’s comics of the same name, which seems to be setting up an intergenerational conflict between a team of superheroes and their potentially less heroic children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuREUu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jupiter’s Legacy&lt;/em&gt; is an original concept from Millar, but it does seem to be playing on some classic superhero imagery. (Note Josh Duhamel’s The Utopian pulling a tractor by hand in what could only be described as a classic Superman move.) The main thrust, though, is the tension between an older generation’s pulpier idea of superheroics and a younger generation who might be more interested in the fame that comes along with it. In Netflix’s words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OzOcmW"&gt;They’re the first generation of superheroes. But as they pass the torch to their children, tensions are rising — and the old rules no longer apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="GcvmwU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TY3IAqm-gpE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X3Ulsa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jupiter’s Legacy&lt;/em&gt; is just the first of several planned Netflix projects from Millar, the result of the streamer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/7/16106574/netflix-comic-book-publisher-millarworld-first-acquisition-kick-ass-kingsman"&gt;purchasing his publishing house Millarworld &lt;/a&gt;in 2017. Along with &lt;em&gt;Jupiter’s Legacy&lt;/em&gt;, Netflix also plans to debut other Millar originals covering everything from &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BlVq-33DgPm/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"&gt;space bounty hunters to Spanish-language telenovelas&lt;/a&gt;. With this Millar series, Netflix seems poised to carry on the recent trend of &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/22364450/superdads-the-boys-invincible-superman-and-lois"&gt;daddy issues in superhero stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iwm9bB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jupiter’s Legacy &lt;/em&gt;is set to premiere on May 7th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Humble Bundle’s latest offer packs in over $150 worth of VR games for $15</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Job Simulator" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HXWvgZdgRG3lGMWf0lWhJjCnX5c=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69090327/job-simulator-htc-vive-adi-robertson-1.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Job Simulator, HTC Vive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yRZzjR"&gt;Humble Bundle has launched its latest bundle of games that collects proceeds and sends them to a charity of your choosing. &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/spring-into-vr-bundle?partner=VoxMedia"&gt;This one’s full of nothing but VR titles&lt;/a&gt;, and the minimum contribution required to get everything in the bundle is just $15. Of course, since it’s for charity, spend more if you feel compelled to. The bundle contains the following games, all of which are redeemable on Steam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qVyD9y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderlands 2 VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="exIXJx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Job Simulator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O4DlSk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sairento VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IrOCET"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Bridge Crew&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="s1MEuE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surgeon Simulator: Experience Reality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QpvZ4N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swords of Gurrah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="APjjZg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Espire VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VoNmmA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detached&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="hsNtVD"&gt;These games will work on wired headsets that support Steam VR, which includes the Valve Index, Oculus Rift S, HTC’s Vive, and more. There’s an easy way to get these games running if you have a wireless Oculus Quest or Quest 2 headset. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218827/oculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to"&gt;Just follow our guide on how you can play PC VR games&lt;/a&gt; like the ones above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMDVui"&gt;This bundle will be available until Wednesday, April 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1m2fj7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 2:20PM ET April 7th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Humble Bundle doesn’t include the game Arizona Sunshine in the offer, as it originally suggested it would, so I removed it from the post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The French army is testing Boston Dynamics’ robot dog Spot in combat scenarios</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H2KMwgQmLrvVXRBt_Zs-SUYANG4=/0x2:4096x2733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69090257/EySrwjgWYAQMtCC.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spot was apparently being tested for reconaissance. | Image: Saint-Cyr Coëtquidan / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/SaintCyrCoet" target="_blank"&gt;@SaintCyrCoet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KrYpy6"&gt;Spot, the quadruped robot built by US firm Boston Dynamics, has appeared alongside soldiers during military exercises carried out by the French army. The robot was apparently being used for reconnaissance during a two-day training exercise, but the deployment raises questions about how and where Boston Dynamics’ machines will be used in future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8obyY"&gt;Pictures of the exercises were &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SaintCyrCoet/status/1379457690020294665"&gt;shared on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; by France’s foremost military school, the École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr. It described the tests as “raising students’ awareness of the challenges of tomorrow,” which include the “robotization of the battlefield.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBZnks"&gt;A &lt;a href="http://lignesdedefense.blogs.ouest-france.fr/archive/2021/03/31/quand-emia-part-au-combat-avec-des-robots-terrestres-22012.html"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by French newspaper &lt;em&gt;Ouest-France &lt;/em&gt;offers more detail, saying that Spot was one of a number of robots being tested by students from France’s École Militaire Interarmes (Combined Arms School), with the intention of assessing the usefulness of robots on future battlefields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrRfTy"&gt;Boston Dynamics’ vice president of business development Michael Perry told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the robot had been supplied by a European distributor, Shark Robotics, and that the US firm had not been notified in advance about its use. “We’re learning about it as you are,” says Perry. “We’re not clear on the exact scope of this engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VO5Stn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;"Quand l'EMIA part au combat avec des robots terrestres"&lt;a href="https://t.co/q6MNhCdr5C"&gt;https://t.co/q6MNhCdr5C&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/CTHDpI1Lun"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CTHDpI1Lun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Saint-Cyr Coëtquidan (@SaintCyrCoet) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SaintCyrCoet/status/1377313223045746692?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cXP7LR"&gt;During the two-day deployment, &lt;em&gt;Ouest-France &lt;/em&gt;says soldiers ran a number of scenarios, including an offensive action capturing a crossroads, defensive actions during night and day, and an urban combat test. Each scenario was performed using just humans and then using humans and robots together to see what difference the machines made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KonYpT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“During the urban combat phase where we weren’t using robots, I died.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eVFKup"&gt;Sources quoted in the article say that the robots slowed down operations but helped keep troops safe. “During the urban combat phase where we weren’t using robots, I died. But I didn’t die when we had the robot do a recce first,” one soldier is quoted as saying. They added that one problem was Spot’s battery life: it apparently ran out of juice during an exercise and had to be carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6XDON"&gt;It’s not clear what role Spot was playing (neither Shark Robotics nor the École de Saint-Cyr had replied to requests for comment at the time of writing), but &lt;em&gt;Ouest-France&lt;/em&gt; suggests it was being used for reconnaissance. The 70lb Spot (31kg) is equipped with cameras and can be remote controlled, with its four legs allowing it to navigate terrain that would challenge wheeled or treaded robots. To date, it’s been used to remotely survey a number of environments, from construction sites to factories and underground mines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nM2gGE"&gt;In addition to Spot, other machines being tested by the French military included &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1182409418567063"&gt;OPTIO-X20&lt;/a&gt;, a remote-controlled vehicle with tank treads and auto cannon built by Estonian firm Milrem Robotics; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelanieRovery/status/1377194883136552962"&gt;ULTRO&lt;/a&gt;, a wheeled “robot mule” made for carrying equipment built by French state military firm Nexter; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sharkrobotics/status/1115541272306094080"&gt;Barakuda&lt;/a&gt;, a multipurpose wheeled drone that can provide mobile cover to soldiers with attached armored plating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tw6O7E"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="ro" dir="ltr"&gt;Boston Dynamics quadruped UGV Spot and Shark Robotics electric Barakuda UGV participate in exercises at the French military research school Centre de recherche des écoles de &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SaintCyrCoet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SaintCyrCoet&lt;/a&gt; (CREC)&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ugv?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ugv&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/unmanned?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#unmanned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/unmannedvehicles?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#unmannedvehicles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/robotics?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#robotics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/military?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#military&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/research?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#research&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/training?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#training&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/france?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#france&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/1WCASPmdA4"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1WCASPmdA4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Melanie Rovery (@MelanieRovery) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelanieRovery/status/1379720473416720385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5J6kDb"&gt;Spot’s appearance on simulated battlefields raises questions about where the robot will be deployed in future. Boston Dynamics has a long history of developing robots for the US army, but as it’s moved into commercial markets it’s distanced itself from military connections. Spot is still being tested by a number of US police forces, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299140/nypd-boston-dynamics-spot-robot-dog"&gt;including by the NYPD&lt;/a&gt;, but Boston Dynamics has always stressed that its machines will never be armed. “We unequivocally do not want any customer using the robot to harm people,” says Perry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fhA6p"&gt;Spot’s &lt;a href="https://www.bostondynamics.com/sites/default/files/inline-files/spot-terms-and-conditions-of-sale.pdf"&gt;terms and conditions&lt;/a&gt; forbid it from being used “to harm or intimidate any person or animal, as a weapon, or to enable any weapon,” and it’s possible to argue that a robot helping to scout buildings for soldiers is not technically harming or intimidating anyone. But if that recon is the prelude to a military engagement it seems like a flimsy distinction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iint80"&gt;Boston Dynamics’ Perry told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company had clear policies forbidding suppliers or customers from weaponizing the robot, but that the firm is “still evaluating” whether or not to ban non-weaponized deployments by military customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ywakBQ"&gt;“We think that the military, to the extent that they do use robotics to take people out of harm’s way, we think that’s a perfectly valid use of the technology,” says Perry. “With this forward-deployment model that you’re discussing, it’s something we need to better understand to determine whether or not it’s actively being used to harm people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2OwSI"&gt;Despite worries from researchers and advocates, militaries around the world are increasingly pushing robots &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/oct/15/dangerous-rise-of-military-ai-drone-swarm-autonomous-weapons"&gt;onto the battlefield&lt;/a&gt;. Remotely operated drones have been the most significant deployment to date, but other use cases — including robots that can scout, survey, and patrol — are also being tested. Robotic quadrupeds similar to Spot built by rival firm Ghost Robotics are currently being &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/07/robit-dogs-patrol-tyndall/"&gt;tested by the US Air Force&lt;/a&gt; as replacements for stationary surveillance cameras. If robots prove reliable as roaming CCTV, it’s only a matter of time before those capabilities are introduced to active combat zones.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Fertilizer’s messy legacy spreads far beyond the disaster at Piney Point&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="doubcm"&gt;Fearing a 20-foot “tidal wave” of contaminated wastewater breaking free from a giant industrial waste pile, Florida officials told hundreds of residents to evacuate their homes in Manatee County over Easter weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zN4jbj"&gt;Since then, authorities have furiously drained more than a 170 million gallons of wastewater to alleviate the pressure that might have otherwise overwhelmed containment walls. The most dangerous water (which picked up contaminants as it leaked through the breach) was trucked away to be processed — but the rest has been intentionally drained into Tampa Bay, where it could cause more problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zVqAKm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Disasters that can be traced back to the area’s legacy of mining phosphate rock&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xXczhj"&gt;It’s a string of potential disasters that can be traced back to the &lt;a href="https://thecounter.org/earth-day-mosaic-phosphate-fertilizer-louisiana-mississippi/"&gt;area’s legacy of mining&lt;/a&gt; phosphate rock, which the agricultural industry relies on for fertilizer. The crisis is unfolding at the former Piney Point phosphate plant, where phosphate was mined and then turned into fertilizer for decades until the site was abandoned in 2001. What’s left in its wake are three towering phosphogypsum “stacks” — flat-topped hills of &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/radtown/radioactive-material-fertilizer-production"&gt;radioactive industrial waste&lt;/a&gt; with wastewater ponds at the center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vYqvW"&gt;This isn’t the first time phosphogypsum stacks have suddenly released slurries of water and waste — and it probably won’t be the last. Another crisis like the one at Piney Point could easily happen again unless we rethink the way we grow our food, some environmental advocates say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KmTEcK"&gt;“The damage that occurs from just producing fertilizer — not even using it, but just producing fertilizer — is profound,” says Rachael Curran, an environmental attorney in Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bfWTFV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A big mess&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="fTpGyW"&gt;Florida supplies a &lt;a href="https://fipr.floridapoly.edu/about-us/phosphate-primer/phosphate-and-how-florida-was-formed.php"&gt;quarter of the world’s phosphate&lt;/a&gt; and 80 percent of all the phosphate used in the US. Most of it goes into fertilizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lO3DiM"&gt;But before it can be used to help crops grow, the phosphate goes through a chemical process that leaves behind a big mess. Once phosphate ore is dug up, sulfuric acid dissolves it into a “slurry.” The stuff used in fertilizer is separated out from the slurry, leaving behind phosphogypsum as a byproduct. For every ton of desirable phosphoric acid produced for fertilizer, more than &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/radiation/tenorm-fertilizer-and-fertilizer-production-wastes"&gt;five tons of phosphogypsum waste remains&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1HI0z"&gt;Phosphogypsum has been used as a construction material in other countries, like China, which produces &lt;a href="https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/agriculture-investing/phosphate-investing/top-phosphate-countries-by-production/"&gt;the most phosphate&lt;/a&gt; in the world (the US ranks third). But in the US, the Environmental Protection Agency banned using the material in construction in 1989 because of its radioactivity, albeit at relatively low levels. (Phosphate ore contains some uranium, thorium, and radium.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGmR2d"&gt;Last year, the EPA &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-approves-use-phosphogypsum-road-construction"&gt;gave the greenlight&lt;/a&gt; to use phosphogypsum with low levels of radioactivity to build roads (it followed a landslide of environmental rollbacks under the Trump administration). But Curran still worries about that — instead of piling the risk all in one place, she worries, that’s just spreading it around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkq5AI"&gt;Since it isn’t typically used for anything, the phosphate industry pumps its leftover “slurry” into phosphogypsum stacks. Water pools on the top while solids settle and are used to form the containment walls. These “stacks” grow into mountains over time — with some reaching nearly as tall as a 20-story building and as wide as 600 football fields. There are more than two dozen phosphogypsum stacks strewn across Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="83HW02"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These giants are vulnerable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="svZ84c"&gt;These giants are vulnerable. Much of Florida is built on porous rock, which makes it susceptible to sinkholes. In &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/29/495936718/giant-sinkhole-at-florida-plant-leaks-polluted-water-into-state-aquifer"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;, one opened up underneath a 120-foot tall phosphogypsum stack, sending contaminated water and waste into a major drinking water aquifer. Another sinkhole did something similar to another stack in &lt;a href="https://www.tampabay.com/archive/1995/07/18/the-hole-under-the-mountain/"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;. And in &lt;a href="https://www.theledger.com/article/LK/20071209/News/608133314/LL"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;, the wall of another stack collapsed and sent more than 50 million gallons of contaminated water into the Alafia River. Piney Point itself spilled 170 million gallons of wastewater when the lining of its stacks ripped in &lt;a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/article/LK/20130903/News/605206452/SH"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lNrkTZ"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sinkhole beneath gypsum stack drains 215 mill gal contaminated water from phosphate plant into Fl aquifer. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TB_Times?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TB_Times&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/RdJuyY22fU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RdJuyY22fU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— jim damaske (@DamaskeJim) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DamaskeJim/status/777011954867056640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 17, 2016&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wslQJ3"&gt;Luckily, there’s little risk that the waste from Piney Point will reach the aquifer and affect drinking water this time, officials say — although they’ve provided bottled water to affected residents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCvyHq"&gt;The slight radioactivity of wastewater in phosphogypsum stacks isn’t likely to cause major problems for wildlife or people, according to Matt Pasek, a geoscience professor at the University of South Florida. “It won’t kill you to get splashed with it,” Pasek says. “But it’s not something you would want to swim in or drink.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rmfsuY"&gt;Still, there are other problems at Piney Point. The stacks are the highest point in the area, which is one reason why a cascade of wastewater from the site threatened to wipe out homes this week. Officials decided that the potential “tidal wave” posed a greater threat than letting water drain into Tampa Bay. But environmentalists and people in the fishing industry are worried that the wastewater, laced with nitrogen and phosphorous, could trigger harmful algae blooms that use up much of the oxygen in the water, choking local marine life. &lt;/p&gt;

Officials are now pumping water out of the reservoir to prevent a "catastrophic" collapse. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PineyPoint?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PineyPoint&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/U7T0Sb4Xlc"&gt;https://t.co/U7T0Sb4Xlc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/a1DIuau8Pq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/a1DIuau8Pq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— CBS News (@CBSNews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/1379207187482996736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hnb9hP"&gt;Florida lawmakers have &lt;a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Media/PressReleases/show/3949#:~:text=The%20amendment%20will%20add%20Senator,22%20budget%20later%20this%20month."&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; spending $200 million on “the complete cleanup and closure” of Piney Point. The state senate will consider the budget amendment today. “When it’s all said and done, those stacks will be emptied and sealed. So I’m thrilled about that,” Manatee County Commission Chair Vanessa Baugh &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=679851752723106&amp;amp;ref=watch_permalink"&gt;said during a briefing &lt;/a&gt;on Piney Point yesterday. The county board of commissioners authorized the use of a deep injection well to store the remaining wastewater from Piney Point once it’s been treated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqT4IV"&gt;Curran still worries that those actions won’t prevent another phosphogypsum stack collapse or leak in the state. Heavier rainfall and more intense storms as a result of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/06/climate/florida-ponds-toxic-waste.html?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=120059140&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_6S5pTAgNolvrS1xF0ogG8w29tj1ZXcIftqJCiPi_KjLefg0Vt4ADccdXYgpfuSGvC53kfz0_pR_OEZmdjvlcRRROcCdDScaqRfL33RsQXp2h1-iM&amp;amp;utm_content=120059140&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;climate change are putting already vulnerable stacks in an even more precarious&lt;/a&gt; situation, she adds. A 2004 hurricane caused another breach at another stack that spilled 65 million gallons of wastewater into Tampa Bay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azLe8q"&gt;“There is no safe way to manage these stacks, that’s been made clear so the solution is really to stop generating the waste in the first place,” says Curran. “That ultimately means we need to change the way we grow food.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OyV0cg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new landscape? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sncGE4"&gt;Changing our agricultural system is a tall order. Phosphate is, after all, a building block for life. It forms the “&lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Phosphate-Backbone"&gt;backbone&lt;/a&gt;” of DNA strands. Phosphorous is one of the three primary nutrients plants need to grow, along with potassium and nitrogen. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Mosaic Co. dragline carves out phosphate matrix in Tampa, Florida, US, on Friday, Dec. 2nd, 2011. Mosaic Co. is the world’s largest producer of phosphate and second-largest producer of potash — two crop nutrients which are primary ingredients in producing fertilizer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="flz9pU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fipr.floridapoly.edu/about-us/phosphate-primer/history-of-phosphate-fertilizer-production.php"&gt;After World War II&lt;/a&gt; devastated agriculture and industry across much of Europe and Asia, demand for these nutrients in fertilizer grew (there were also &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/food/2013/04/history-nitrogen-fertilizer-ammonium-nitrate/"&gt;nitrate factories&lt;/a&gt; readily available that had previously been used to make munitions). Fertilizers increased crop yields as the population of Earth grew, and they became an integral part of industrialized agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PxyvJ"&gt;“Phosphate is not a sort of vanity mining industry, something that you want for jewelry or things like that,” says Pasek. Because of its important role in agriculture, Pasek says an end to phosphate mining “is not feasible, let’s put it that way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nSQDWs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A growing movement toward “regenerative” farming&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pt1Lgj"&gt;Some farmers, however, are putting that to the test. They’re doing things differently by returning to some of the ways farming was done before there were industrial fertilizers. There’s a growing movement toward so-called “regenerative” farming. Instead of applying fertilizer and tilling soil — breaking it up — between cash crops, they’re planting other crops that replenish nutrients in the soil. &lt;a href="https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj2010.0095"&gt;Radishes&lt;/a&gt;, for example, have been shown to increase phosphorus in soil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBekLH"&gt;“There are a lot of farmers out there that have completely done away with synthetic fertilizer, and are doing fine,” says Rick Haney, a soil scientist with the USDA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5y59N6"&gt;Even if it’s too soon to throw out synthetic fertilizers altogether, there are opportunities to use a lot less of it. Some &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/farmers-are-facing-a-phosphorus-crisis-the-solution-starts-with-soil"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; are trying to tap into the legacy of phosphate fertilizers that’s already trapped in soil. Sometimes phosphorus reacts with other minerals in soil to form compounds that modern crops have a harder time soaking up. Farmers traditionally solved this dilemma by turning to more phosphate fertilizer. As an alternative, crops can be bred to become better at making use of those trapped nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aow0AW"&gt;And while phosphorus might be a building block for life, phosphate rock used to make synthetic fertilizer is a finite resource that &lt;a href="https://fipr.floridapoly.edu/about-us/phosphate-primer/how-long-will-florida-phosphate-mining-go-on.php"&gt;could one day be depleted&lt;/a&gt;. That’s adding to the growing momentum for regenerative farming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPE3ql"&gt;“In 20 years it’s going to be a very different farming system. I think that we’re going to have to move in that direction because it just makes more sense,” says Haney. “Why would you work against nature when you can work with it?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6c4cE"&gt;But changing people’s mindset when it comes to fertilizer is still slow-going. “It’s like trying to turn the Titanic with a tugboat,” Haney says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcKpfo"&gt;In the meantime, residents like those evacuated down the hill from Piney Point will keep shouldering the risks posed by industrial fertilizers. Mountainous piles of waste from phosphate mining will keep growing because no one really knows what else to do with it except put it into piles or bury it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GpRZ0b"&gt;People who evacuated were allowed to return to their homes last night. The risk of an imminent catastrophic phosphogypsum stack collapse has passed, at least for now. The stacks still loom in the distance, dominating the landscape.   &lt;/p&gt;

Now, any hardware manufacturer can add software-side support for Apple’s localized network to track missing items — so long as they play by Apple’s Made for iPhone (MFi) accessory rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3KKTk"&gt;The first wave of items that can now be tracked starting today include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof’s S3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22162936/vanmoof-x3-long-term-review"&gt;X3 e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219529/belkin-magsafe-dock-charging-wireless-ces-2021-earbuds"&gt;Belkin’s SoundForm Freedom True Wireless Earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, and the Chipolo One Spot tracking tag — all of which can now rely on Apple’s crowdsourced Bluetooth network (which encompasses millions of iPhones, iPads, and Macs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oBlSj"&gt;Users will be able to add those devices to the updated Find My app starting today and can track them through that app much in the same way that they’d track any missing Apple product. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRWl47qcc_MooRKhCYbIzv0ePy8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427260/Apple_find_my_network_now_offers_new_third_party_finding_experiences_chipolo_040721_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chipolo’s Find My-compatible One Spot tracker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HAu2KR"&gt;Apple says that third-party devices looking to add support will have to apply through the company’s MFi program for authorized accessories and “adhere to all the privacy protections of the Find My network that Apple customers rely on.” Approved products will sport a new “Works with Apple Find My” badge to let customers know that they’re compatible with Apple’s network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oc3g2t"&gt;Additionally, Apple announced that it’d be offering a chipset specification for third-party hardware companies to integrate with the Ultra-Wideband systems in Apple’s more recent phones for even more precise tracking in the future. Apple has also long been rumored to be working on its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21529927/apple-airtags-location-tracker-find-my-accessory-patent-applications-posture"&gt;AirTags product&lt;/a&gt;, which would offer similar UWB-based tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
