    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EMp8N7"&gt;Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the holidays may have come and gone, but there are still some great discounts available on Apple’s AirPods. In fact, we’ve actually been seeing some deals that are even better than they were during the recent shopping holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SziSp1"&gt;Since Apple launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt; in October and unveiled its new AirPods lineup, we’ve seen the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level model drop from $159 to $129. Even better, we’ve seen many retailers starting to heavily discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We’ve even recently seen some significant discounts on the third-gen AirPods, despite how recently they launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on each model, including the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Si36Ca"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"},{"title":"Which AirPods should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFDHZw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10742787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best entry-level &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; (second-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eg29V6"&gt;Once $159, Apple recently lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — to $129. It only sells the model with a wired charging case, however, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. Despite their age, we found these easy-to-use earbuds offer great wireless performance and reliable battery life, making them a great pick if you can live without a wireless charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtXs0h"&gt;Although we’ve recently seen Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods drop to $90 — their lowest price to date — the second-gen earbuds are currently only on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1155135/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-2nd-generation%2F-%2FA-84852693"&gt;Target for $114.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is just $15 less than their typical asking price. They’re also &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/619717/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F604342441&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=66025&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A66025&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; right now, where you can pick them up for $119.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;AirPods (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d2yjBK"&gt;The newest pair of wireless earbuds support Apple’s MagSafe technology. The short stems yield a more subtle design, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiPrKN"&gt;Deals were once hard to come by on the third-gen model, but we finally started seeing some significant deals starting around Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Sadly, like the second-gen AirPods, they’re currently only available for slightly less than MSRP. At the moment, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling them for $169.98&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1230713/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals010422&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-true-wireless-bluetooth-headphones-3rd-generation%2F-%2FA-77603772"&gt;Target for $169.99&lt;/a&gt;, roughly $10 shy of their full retail price and a far cry from their all-time low of $139.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q2OXRZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iewbkw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S8o5q4"&gt;We think Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; an iPhone owner can buy, regardless of the price. They have better sound quality than the models above, offer active noise cancellation, and come with a wireless charging case. The earbuds also support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;Apple’s spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content, and come with swappable silicone tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM8uVd"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi"&gt;recently launched a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case that supports Apple’s MagSafe technology, just like the third-gen AirPods. These retail for $249, but you can buy them right now for $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/612734/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro-with-MagSafe-Charging-Case%2F975690481&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $199.99 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro-with-magsafe%2F-%2FA-77603773&amp;amp;subid1=Verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not nearly as low as the $159 price we saw this model drop to during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it’s still more than $50 off what you’d pay if you were to purchase the earbuds directly from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ri3jYY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AirPods Pro 2 may come with lossless audio support and a charging case that makes sound","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863442/airpods-pro-2-lossless-audio-charging-case-sound"},{"title":"Apple selling new AirPods Pro coinciding with the Year of the Tiger in certain markets","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22864887/apple-new-airpods-pro-year-of-the-tiger"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="THtgJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and a wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max were discounted to $429 at Amazon during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, prices have since increased. Still, the Max are currently selling for $479 in most colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1610234-REG%2Fapple_mgyj3am_a_airpods_max_silver.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $70. You can also &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?Ntt=airpods+max"&gt;reserve them in green at Micro Center for $429.99&lt;/a&gt;, one of their best prices to date, though they’re only available for in-store pickup in select states.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s videoconferencing monitor has a 4K webcam, USB-C hub, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UHhroWBBZDKjDoLhfyV2iUH1OK8=/136x0:1765x1086/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348012/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_12.26.01.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ft98ee"&gt;Dell’s new 32-inch UltraSharp videoconferencing monitor supports 4K in more ways than one — the first, obvious for a display, is its 3840 x 2160 panel. But it also has a built-in 4K webcam, perfect for the age of Zoom meetings and working from home. Better still, you can connect to the monitor with a single USB-C cable, which will provide a video signal to the screen and send 90W of power back to your laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYe2pb"&gt;The monitor’s official name is the U3223QZ (Dell’s naming is catchy as ever), and its webcam uses a Sony 4K HDR STARVIS CMOS sensor. That’s similar to the imaging tech that Dell uses for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22553857/dell-ultrasharp-4k-webcam-features-price-release-date"&gt;its $200 external UltraSharp webcam&lt;/a&gt;, but unlike that device, the monitor has two built-in microphones. Dell also says that you’ll be able to adjust the camera’s tilt by 20 degrees and switch between 65, 78, and 90-degree fields of view. All of that should add up to you showing up crystal clear in meetings (if that’s something you want to do — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22858876/built-in-laptop-webcam-zoom-video-conferencing"&gt;not everyone does!&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XbPAGymiOGH844UIU-Eikrd_BFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145533/U3223QZ_webcam_expanded_using_MSFT_Teams.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The webcam will let you show up crystal clear in meetings, and also lets you unlock your computer with Windows Hello.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cQvCL7"&gt;That webcam is attached to a decently specced display: it’s 31.5 inches, IPS, and runs at 60Hz. While the low refresh rate means it probably won’t be a game streamer’s first pick — a shame, because a built-in face cam would actually be handy — it should be totally fine for a home (or regular) office. Plus, it has two 14W speakers built in, which should let you hear anyone you’re talking to well enough, though they might appreciate it if you just used headphones instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4byydQ"&gt;The monitor also has a lot going for it beyond the screen and videoconferencing features. If you connect to it with USB-C, it basically acts as a hub, giving you access to five 10Gbps USB-A ports, ethernet, and another USB-C port. If your computer supports Display Stream Compression, you can even use the monitor’s DisplayPort out port to daisy-chain another 4K monitor. Oh, and like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22214786/dell-monitor-microsoft-teams-button-features-specs-price-release-date"&gt;some other Dell monitors&lt;/a&gt;, the U3223QZ has a dedicated Microsoft Teams button on the front.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H2FC-hGiysaG5D3Kn4tnpsrg6GI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145479/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_12.26.22.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dell’s absolutely packed this monitor with ports, but you only need a single USB-C cable to connect to it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X0oJq3"&gt;It’s also got HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.4 input ports, and if you plug in multiple devices, you can view them in picture-by-picture or picture-in-picture modes. Handily, it’s also got a built-in KVM, which lets you use one pair of peripherals with multiple computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mS9ZO"&gt;The ergonomic situation also seems pretty solid: the U3223QZ’s stand supports tilt, swivel, and height adjustments, including the ability to turn the monitor vertically according to &lt;a href="https://content.hmxmedia.com/dell-u3223qz-monitor/index.html"&gt;Dell’s 3D demo&lt;/a&gt; (though that may make things awkward if you’re trying to use the webcam). If that’s not enough, it also has 100mm x 100mm VESA mounting holes for attaching the display to a monitor arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O74eCs"&gt;The monitor will be available starting March 29th, and Dell says it’ll share pricing information closer to the release date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="W9ePtV"&gt;

    <title>Google will pay top execs $1 million each after declining to boost workers’ pay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit 2016" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G4C4plmDrDIFTz7byk2DKL-MqdU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347985/615656976.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Scarnici/Getty Images for Fortune&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JrBlFq"&gt;Google is giving four of its top execs a significant pay bump, raising their salaries from $650,000 to $1 million, just weeks after the company told staffers it wouldn’t automatically adjust salaries to account for inflation. The new executive salaries were disclosed in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204422000009/goog-20211228.htm"&gt;an SEC filing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwv9Gi"&gt;The executives receiving the $1 million base salaries are chief financial officer Ruth Porat, senior vice president Prabhakar Raghavan (who is in charge of Google search); senior vice president and chief business officer Philipp Schindler; and president of global affairs and chief legal officer Kent Walker. All four executives are eligible to “participate in a maximum $2,000,000 annual bonus program, based on contributions to Google’s performance against social and environmental goals for 2022,” according to the filing. Each person has also been granted stock awards with target values in the millions of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09ieAI"&gt;Google has been very financially successful as of late — it posted its fifth quarter in a row of record profits &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747193/google-q3-2021-earnings-record-revenue-profit"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. But in contrast to giving the four execs huge pay raises, Google’s vice president of compensation told workers at an all-hands in December that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828132/google-employee-wages-inflation-2021-record-profits"&gt;doesn’t plan to make broad salary adjustments&lt;/a&gt; to account for the &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coming-up-u-s-consumer-price-index-for-november-11639142278"&gt;rising inflation rate in the US&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RNwtr"&gt;The raises were also given as Google is embroiled in a legal battle with employees over charges that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421969/google-illegally-firing-three-workers-nlrb-president-biden"&gt;they were illegally fired in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The employees are planning to call one of the recipients of a new $1 million salary, Kent Walker, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tri_Becca90/status/1429825092779876352"&gt;to testify as an adverse witness&lt;/a&gt;. Employees are also reportedly dissatisfied with the company’s seemingly different remote work policies for higher-ups. In July, senior vice president for technical infrastructure Urs Hölzle announced he was moving to New Zealand, which two employees &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-employees-angered-by-search-giants-hypocritical-remote-work-policies/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was emblematic of a double standard for executives.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon is the latest carrier to offer a mobile data plan without monthly caps on its fastest network speeds.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VkTGlc"&gt;Verizon has &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/power-verizon-5g-ultra-wideband-coming" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;updated its unlimited plans&lt;/a&gt; in anticipation of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;new 5G spectrum coming online &lt;s&gt;tomorrow&lt;/s&gt; soonish&lt;/a&gt;. The new plans cost the same and include the same level of access to the carrier’s Nationwide and Ultra Wideband 5G networks, but the priciest Get More plan receives a notable upgrade: unlimited monthly “premium data.” That puts it on even terms with the other major carriers’ top-tier unlimited plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llbC6h"&gt;The plans previously known as Start, Play More, Do More, and Get More Unlimited are now called 5G Start Unlimited, 5G Play More Unlimited... you get the idea. The Get More plan ($90 / month for one line with autopay) previously included 50GB of premium data each month — once customers reached that limit, they’d be subject to slowdowns during times of network congestion. The new 5G Get More plan does away with that monthly cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XnOv32"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Cellphone plan fine print, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"},{"title":"The best phone plans in 2021 (and how to pick one)","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22606623/best-cell-phone-plans-verizon-att-t-mobile"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8IZGUr"&gt;Verizon is playing a little bit of catch-up here; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573847/att-unlimited-elite-data-cap-4k-streaming-phone-plan"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s Unlimited Elite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;T-Mobile’s Magenta Max&lt;/a&gt; already offer all-you-can-eat premium mobile data. The new 5G Get More plan also includes a boost in premium mobile hotspot data: 50GB, up from 30GB. The Play More and Do More plans now offer 30GB compared to 15GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKZTDq"&gt;One thing remains the same, though: customers on the basic Start Unlimited plan won’t have access to the faster Ultra Wideband network at all — just slower Nationwide 5G. That’s no great loss at the moment, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;when C-band joins the call&lt;/a&gt;, it’ll be a real bummer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia still has no idea how to pronounce the name of its best gaming GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E6jwFu65pwQ_HbDdOct1PuNKcQI=/112x0:1312x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347965/85lXfjr.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GpIOHA"&gt;Ti or Ti?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRCi0k"&gt;It’s a question that’s plagued Nvidia fans for years, ever since the company started appending the “Ti” designation to its most powerful GPUs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866454/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-specifications-release-date-price-ces-2022"&gt;like the RTX 3090 Ti&lt;/a&gt; that Nvidia just announced at CES 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JvwW8e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nvidia announces RTX 3090 Ti with faster memory and performance","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866454/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-specifications-release-date-price-ces-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fnCbFv"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; do you pronounce “Ti”? There are two camps: those who pronounce it “tie,” like the neck garment or the first syllable of “titanium,” while others fervently insist that it’s pronounced as initials: “tee-eye.” Not even Nvidia seems to know which is right, as the company’s CES presentation showed — different presenters switched back and forth between saying “tie” and “tee-eye” from one segment to the next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ylzn2o"&gt;Should “GeForce” be called “Gee-Eee Force”? Of course not. Do you say “Ertex” instead of RTX? Preposterous. But Nvidia has let the “tie” / “tee-eye” debate simmer unchecked, even though the branding dates as far back as the GeForce 2 Ti from 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZ0VzO"&gt;Here’s a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq_q6tp3vI0"&gt;YouTube supercut&lt;/a&gt; of Nvidia’s senior vice president Jeff Fisher pronouncing it “tie” many, many times during the RTX 3080 Ti launch last year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9uQfb5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qq_q6tp3vI0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t4VNYN"&gt;And yet whenever founder and CEO Jensen Huang (Nvidia’s motorcycle jacket-wearing public face of the company) cooks up a new graphics card in his kitchen, he tends to say “tee-eye” instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYBjny"&gt;When asked about the proper pronunciation, the company punted on the issue entirely, with Nvidia’s corporate communications director Hector Marinez telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “there is no wrong way to pronounce Ti.... as long as you spell it correctly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IoH5GM"&gt;Or, in other words, in Nvidia’s eyes... it’s a tie.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="0FZrik"&gt;

    <title>TikTok is testing a Twitter-like Repost button for sharing videos </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z1QJeszsZ6W4lctCI0z2_76Lu9E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347937/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ippRK5"&gt;The highly addictive clock app is testing a feature that should save you the trouble of having to DM the most share-worthy clips from your For You page with friends. TikTok has introduced a “Repost” button that works a little like Twitter’s retweet feature — but it doesn’t appear to be available to everyone yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CH5y5G"&gt;Several sites &lt;a href="https://www.imore.com/tiktok-testing-repost-button-will-share-content-your-followers"&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.distractify.com/p/tiktok-repost-button"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/20/tiktok-testing-new-way-to-let-users-repost-content-on-the-social-network/"&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt;, and social media consultant Matt Navarra &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1472579035641397252"&gt;tweeted an image&lt;/a&gt; of the button on December 19th. &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;today reported a more &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/tiktok-tests-its-own-version-of-the-retweet-with-a-new-repost-button/"&gt;detailed explanation&lt;/a&gt; of how the tool works in practice, including that it seems to be limited to the For You feed from the share menu rather than throughout the TikTok app. (Videos that are shared can similarly be un-shared from this menu as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UMU7oO"&gt;Additionally, videos shared with the Repost button won’t appear in the sharer’s profile — just on their friends’ for For You feeds. According to TechCrunch, the Repost button will only push the video into the feeds of users who follow each other. The feature is reportedly being tested with a limited number of users, and some of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff had access to it while others did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4gLovI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;TikTok is testing a ‘Repost’ button &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;h/t &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adrianokev1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@adrianokev1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Nwbj07GXsK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Nwbj07GXsK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1472579035641397252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H8yZBz"&gt;TikTok did not immediately return a request for comment about the feature or how widely it’s available at this time, but the company told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; in a statement that it’s “always thinking about new ways to bring value to our community and enrich the TikTok experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQdctu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports that some users are seeing a “Recommend” button in place of the Repost tool. Both prompt users to share why they’re reposting the video — a step, it’s worth noting, you can skip entirely by simply DMing it. Though again, depending on the pool of mutuals you want to share a video with, that could be a bit of an inconvenience. Keep in mind comments on shared videos can be seen, though they’ll disappear if you un-share a video with your mutuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="miGk3Y"&gt;As I have exactly five (5) mutual friends on TikTok who receive anywhere between two and 20 TikTok DMs a day from me alone, I imagine they’ll be grateful for the shuffle-in alternative to being pinged a dozen times daily if and when they get it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyundai imagines a world in which it has turned everything into a robot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYYqGf2zRzg6nbMgtOJukM29Ohw=/390x0:4610x2813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347904/CES2022_KV_2._MoT_ecosystem.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IJWVdu"&gt;Hyundai has already showed off some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22839417/hyundai-mobed-wheeled-robot-mobility-device-ces-2022"&gt;practical robotics concepts&lt;/a&gt; last month in the lead-up to the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show. Now the South Korean automaker is going full galaxy brain with the introduction of a new “Mobility of Things” concept that it claims will power a whole slew of objects, from household plants and book shelves, to ambulances and autonomous passenger pods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfoIKg"&gt;The spectrum of things that can be roboticized (for lack of a better term) is “unlimited,” said Dong Jin Hyun, vice president and head of Robotics Lab of Hyundai Motor Group, in a statement. “The goal is for robotics to enable all kinds of personal mobility, connected to communicate, move and perform tasks autonomously.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qIHKFM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The goal is for robotics to enable all kinds of personal mobility”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J6Edrx"&gt;Hyundai says it is developing two different standards: a modular platform called “Plug and Drive” (PnD) that combines steering, electric drive, and suspension hardware; and “Drive and Lift” (DnL) that can lift objects up and down. Combined with the four-wheeled robot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22839417/hyundai-mobed-wheeled-robot-mobility-device-ces-2022"&gt;MobED it announced last month&lt;/a&gt;, the two new modular platforms will be able to power a range of objects to move autonomously on their own, from tables and containers, to people movers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/222bQHh0T6lYswYoQgO_BwkTkSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145103/CES2022_KV_3._PnD_Module.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8iLxF4"&gt;Here’s how Plug and Drive will work, according to Hyundai:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GaoAxZ"&gt;The PnD modular platform is an all-in-one mobility solution that combines intelligent steering, braking, in-wheel electric drive and suspension hardware. The single wheel unit uses a steering actuator for infinite wheel rotation, meaning it can turn 360 degrees, which enables holonomic movement, like a figure skater. LiDAR and camera sensors allow a PnD-enabled object to move autonomously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aj39o"&gt;PnD modules can be attached to anything from tables to containers for expandable mobility. Users can select various drive configurations and platform sizes based on their requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42ye09"&gt;“The PnD Module is adaptive and expandable to match human needs. Because in the world to come, you won’t move your things — they will move around you,” Hyun said. “PnD makes normally inanimate objects mobile. It’s this ability that makes changing practically any space possible. It’s a way to configure spaces on demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5uiEu1"&gt;Hyundai claims the modular platforms can be configured to modify office space to make “purpose built spaces” possible. But the more intriguing possibilities are in transportation. The company imagines a “purpose built vehicle,” measuring approximately four feet by five feet, as a “last-mile mobility [solution] for a single passenger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttJSPG"&gt;Sounds cool, but it will depend on how it looks in real life. Hyundai previewed some of these concepts in a glossy video it’s produced depicting a elderly woman retrieving her walking cane from a robotic holder, and then being whisked down the side of her multistory apartment building in an “individualized mobility cabin.” Later, we see her smile contentedly from within a glossy black pod on four wheels as it zooms around the corner of a nameless city. The pod docks with a “mother shuttle” containing a dozen other pods, with a scrolling LED sign meant to look like a city bus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C4l5V9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not exactly dystopian, but it’s not &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;dystopian&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xIRGs2"&gt;It’s not exactly dystopian, but it’s not &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;dystopian, if you get my meaning. Presenting the idea as a mobility solution for people (i.e., seniors) with limited options is a great way to gloss over some of the more disturbing aspects, such as a robot bus packed with human passengers that are trapped inside individualized test tube containers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5Vhap"&gt;Hyundai is clearly excited about the future of robotics. Last year, the company, which has a controlling stake in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22167835/hyundai-boston-dynamics-aquisition-consumer-robotics"&gt;robot maker Boston Dynamics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274297/hyundai-walking-car-tiger-umv-concept-autonomous"&gt;rolled out a new version of its four-legged “walking car” concept&lt;/a&gt; called TIGER, or “Transforming Intelligent Ground Excursion Robot.” It’s the second vehicle to come out of the automaker’s Ultimate Mobility Vehicles studio in Silicon Valley, and the first designed to be fully autonomous, with no space for drivers or passengers. It’s like a real-life Transformer, but without the “bent on world domination” vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unUfXF"&gt;In many ways, this builds on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/4/14172006/hyundai-mobility-concept-smart-home-driverless-car"&gt;concepts introduced by Hyundai at CES in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, when the automaker envisioned a mashup of a smart home with an autonomous vehicle, with futuristic furniture moving seamlessly between both. Tellingly, this vision never came to pass. But as the technology matures, Hyundai is still holding out that its weird robotics concepts can find their footing in the real world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkbJdN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4X5E5H"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All the gaming laptops announced at CES 2022 with the latest Intel, AMD, and Nvidia mobile components</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Alienware X14" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bsBFTNMfPfSmSVMXGKmyfPOXEm0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347778/cfaulkner_141231_4943_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vYefvT"&gt;As is usually the case for CES, there is an abundance of gaming laptops being announced for release in early and mid-2022 that have at least two of the following traits in common: they have Intel’s 12th Gen H-series processors, or they support AMD’s Ryzen 6000-series processors, and they have Nvidia’s new RTX 3070 Ti or RTX 3080 Ti graphics chips. What’s more, many of them will also support DDR5 RAM at 4,800MHz. It’s a great time to be shopping for a laptop, as these seem faster than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wbXbph"&gt;There are always outliers we won’t catch, and we’ll be making more passes at this through the week, but there are currently well over a dozen laptops coming that have some combination of these components. We’ve covered the biggest CES 2022 announcements individually, but for others that we didn’t cover elsewhere, let this be your guide to what the biggest names in portable computing are up to for the next few months. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Nitro 5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UmudguSmeJp8U1RqjX77j5ge6A8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23141990/acernitro52022.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OcDhPn"&gt;Acer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2I2KAR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predator Triton 500 SE:&lt;/strong&gt; Acer’s flagship machine for CES 2022 supports up to Intel’s Core i9-12900HK processor and up to Nvidia’s new RTX 3080 Ti graphics chip. It can house up to 32GB of DDR5 RAM clocked at an impressive 5,200MHz. It supports up to 2TB of PCIe 4.0 storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izTQDx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22624397"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nitro 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This model can be configured with up to AMD’s latest Ryzen 6000-series or Intel’s 12th Gen Core i7-12700H processors, and up to Nvidia’s RTX 3070 Ti. This model can be configured with up to 32GB of DDR5 memory clocked at 4,800MHz. In terms of storage, the Nitro 5 has two M.2 PCIe 4.0 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDDPQn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predator Helios 300:&lt;/strong&gt; Acer’s Helios 300 is an Intel-only machine that can house up to Intel’s Core i9-12900H and up to Nvidia’s RTX 3080 graphics chip. It also supports up to 32GB of DDR5 memory clocked at 4,800MHz, and allows for up to 2TB of PCIe 4.0 M.2 storage in RAID 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="UZEIkR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22629009"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROG Zephyrus G14 and G15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; The G14 for 2022 is an all-AMD affair, going up to the Ryzen 9 6900HS processor, paired with AMD’s Radeon RX 6800S graphics chip. The G15 can go up to AMD’s Ryzen 9 6900HS, supporting up to Nvidia’s new RTX 3080 Ti. Both can support up to 32GB of fast DDR5 memory clocked at 4,800MHz (up to 16GB of it will be soldered to the board, leaving one slot for you to use later on). You can use PCIe 4.0 M.2 2280-sized SSDs in the G14 and G15, though the G14 has one slot (1TB max) and the G15 features two slots with RAID 0 support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wZ9Qg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROG Flow X13:&lt;/strong&gt; This year’s X13 can be configured with up to AMD’s Ryzen 9 6980HS processor and up to the RTX 3050 Ti graphics chip. The main appeal of this laptop is its XG Mobile connector, which lets it connect to Asus’ external GPU enclosure that can power the tablet with improved graphics (up to the RTX 3080 desktop GPU). The X13 packs 32GB of super-fast 6,400MHz DDR5 memory, with support for up to 1TB of M.2 2230-sized PCIe 4.0 storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Oxhkmo"&gt;Gigabyte&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SLseQV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aero 16 and 17:&lt;/strong&gt; These creator-focused machines support up to Intel’s Core i9-12900HK processor and up to Nvidia’s RTX 3080 Ti graphics. Gigabyte says it can support DDR5 RAM clocked at 4,800MHz (up to 16GB per channel) and PCIe 4.0 storage, but it hasn’t shared further specifics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6p4YdH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22628919"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aorus 15 and 17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Both sizes of the high-end Aorus support up to Intel Core i7-12700H and up to Nvidia’s RTX 3080 Ti graphics. These models will support DDR5 memory and PCIe 4.0 storage. These will support up to 64GB of DDR5 RAM clocked up to 4,800MHz and there are two PCIe 4.0 M.2 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdnQuD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22628919"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aorus 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This model supports up to Intel’s Core i7-12700H processor, and in the graphics department it can be configured with up to Nvidia’s RTX 3070. These will support up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM clocked up to 3,200MHz and offer two PCIe 4.0 M.2 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI Stealth GS66" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IFHVPvRzhTQsw2_rNSkYIN6J9y0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145326/msistealthgs662022.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: MSI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSI’s revised Stealth gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="smu9Ry"&gt;MSI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IxkVf2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stealth GS77 and GS66:&lt;/strong&gt; MSI’s revised Stealth gaming laptops support up to Intel’s 12th Gen Core i7-12900H processor and up to Nvidia’s RTX 3080 Ti graphics chips. The 15.6-inch GS66 and 17.3-inch GS77 each have two RAM slots and support up to 64GB of DDR 5 memory clocked at 4,800MHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQh7YS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raider GE76 and GE66&lt;/strong&gt;: Both the 15.6-inch GE66 and 17.3-inch GE76 will support up to Intel’s Core i9-12900HK processor and up to Nvidia’s RTX 3080 Ti graphics. Given that the Raider is thicker than the Stealth, expect better performance here. Similar to the Stealth, the Raider series supports up to 64GB of DDR5 RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wke5wx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vector GP76 and GP66:&lt;/strong&gt; This model is similar to the Raider GE’s design but without RGB lights to give it a more professional look. Like the Raider, it supports Intel’s Core i9-12900HK, though it tops out at the RTX 3080, and the RAM is DDR4 clocked at 3,200MHz. Given that this one is using some parts that aren’t brand-new, it’s fair to expect a slightly cheaper price.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI Crosshair gaming laptop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9sg88xMeaXzseYdbb_CLYEdog-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145330/crosshair2022.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: MSI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One look should tell you whether you want this laptop, or not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dytFZ2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crosshair 17 and 15:&lt;/strong&gt; While the MSI models above each feature the option to go up to QHD or higher, the Crosshair lineup sticks to 1080p panels. This lineup also uses one of Intel’s 12th Gen Core i9 processors with up to Nvidia’s RTX 3070 Ti graphics chip. Oh, and mind the extreme &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Six: Extraction&lt;/em&gt; branding and matching colorway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNdskk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sword and Katana&lt;/strong&gt;: Despite having different names, MSI’s Sword and Katana are similar machines. The Sword comes in white, while the Katana is black with two size options (15.6 inches and 17.3 inches). Both support up to Intel’s Core i7-12700H processor and up to Nvidia’s RTX 3070 Ti graphics chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZYENR"&gt;We’ll be adding more manufacturers as CES 2022 moves along.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Latest Google Pixel update fixes bug that prevents 911 calls with Teams installed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pixel, Android, emergency contacts" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DVGKTVTBuaRoHSxGALtCjHFr9Fk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347707/akrales_190318_3299_0011.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7jFTA8"&gt;Google is bringing an update to older Pixel devices to fix a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826272/911-failure-google-android-microsoft-teams-bug"&gt;dangerous bug that prevents users from calling 911&lt;/a&gt;, as noted by a post on a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/143968432/google-pixel-update-january-2022?hl=en"&gt;Google support page&lt;/a&gt;. The bug stems from an unintended interaction between the Android OS and Microsoft Teams — it only affects devices with Android 10 or later and could occur if you have Teams installed but aren’t signed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZKEH1k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The update resolves the “issue preventing emergency calls in certain conditions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jw2DTf"&gt;On the support page, Google notes that the update resolves the “issue preventing emergency calls in certain conditions while some third-party apps are installed.” It’s available on devices running Android 12 (including the Pixel 3 and up), but the update hasn’t rolled out to the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro yet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860191/pixel-6-pro-google-december-feature-update-paused"&gt;Google paused updates for these devices&lt;/a&gt; following reports of dropped calls when it released the December update but says a fix will arrive later this month. Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/12/22830599/microsoft-teams-911-calling-bug-update"&gt;Teams also issued an update to its app&lt;/a&gt; to fix the bug, however, it’s unclear whether Google will release a patch for other Android devices that could be affected as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8z7gF0"&gt;Aside from the 911 calling bug, the Pixel update also fixes an issue that causes the navigation bar to disappear when the device orientation is changed, a picture-in-picture (PIP) window rendering glitch, and a memory leak in the system UI. A fix for the problem that causes the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro to drop calls over Wi-Fi is also listed, but that still hasn’t been rolled out due to the aforementioned delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgMnGV"&gt;Google also released a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/91975505/google-android-pixel-security-update-january-2021?hl=en"&gt;separate security update&lt;/a&gt;, offering some fixes for Pixel devices running Android 11 and above, and once again excludes the Pixel 6. This includes a problem that causes certain apps to restart intermittently, an issue that blocks users from making calls on specific MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) networks, and also improves “auto-rotation response in certain device orientations.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NXP’s new tri-radio chip makes it easy to add Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, and Thread to smart home gadgets </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vv7UfEjXiyORoZ0pHgSEWUVdHlA=/6x0:6042x4024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347555/nxp_advances_iot_connectivity_with_industrys_first_secure_tr.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Imagine these devices have NXP’s new IW612 SoC | Image: NXP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IWYfay"&gt;&lt;a href="https://media.nxp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nxp-advances-iot-connectivity-industrys-first-secure-tri-radio"&gt;NXP has a new tri-radio SoC&lt;/a&gt; that it’s announcing at CES 2022 that’s designed to serve as a silver bullet for comprehensive smart home connectivity in a single chip, offering out-of-the-box support for Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth LE 5.2, and 802.15.4 (i.e., Thread) all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qSXVZe"&gt;The idea is that hardware manufacturers building new smart home devices — and especially ones building routers, smart speakers, and hubs that are designed to serve as bridges between different radio standards like Wi-Fi and Thread — can now just integrate a single chipset solution to their products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCjtIU"&gt;That’s especially critical with the upcoming launch of the new Matter standard later in 2022, which aims to provide a single standard to connect all the different smart home software solutions out there from Apple, Google, Amazon, Samsung, and other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8ZJTFT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Matter’s plan to save the smart home ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="4hkx0j"&gt;But smart home devices aren’t just fragmented by platform — they also tend to use wildly different connectivity standards. Some lightbulbs have Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, while others use Thread or Zigbee. That’s where NXP’s IW612 SoC comes in: it’ll make it simple for upcoming Matter hub devices to interact with a wide range of smart home devices old and new, which (at least in theory) will help the new standard better integrate with customers’ setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ci3Wsr"&gt;NXP is already sampling the IW612 chip to its customers, and while it’s unlikely that most people buying a smart home product will ever really notice the NXP branding, the new chip could help be a key part of making Matter’s interconnected dream a reality when it rolls out later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
