    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IX1NtC"&gt;The Biden administration will make $1 billion in grants available to expand broadband access and adoption on tribal lands, Vice President Kamala Harris &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/06/department-commerces-ntia-announces-nearly-1-billion-funding-expand"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; at the White House Thursday. The funds, from the Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), will be made to eligible Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian entities for broadband deployment, to support digital inclusion, workforce development, telehealth, and distance learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vArc00"&gt;“For generations, a lack of infrastructure investment in Indian Country has left Tribes further behind in the digital divide than most areas of the country,” Department of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement. “We have a responsibility as a country to build infrastructure that will fuel economic development, keep communities safe, and ensure everyone has opportunities to succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8inln"&gt;According to the Commerce Department, census figures show only half of households on tribal lands subscribe to home internet service, and some areas lack even the most basic cellphone reception. More than 20 percent of people living on tribal lands don’t have broadband access at home. And during the pandemic as schools closed, some students at tribal-serving schools had to drive for miles to find a strong enough connection to participate in online classes. However, the number of people without internet access on tribal lands is likely even higher, as data from the Federal Communications Commission on broadband access, which many government agencies rely on, can be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data"&gt;notoriously inaccurate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xfZP8"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ntia.doc.gov/blog/2021/ntia-announces-tribal-consultations-new-program-increase-broadband-access-across-indian"&gt;Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2020/12/covid-relief-bill-includes-1-billion-for-tribal-broadband-and-250-million-for-fcc-telehealth-program-in-provisions-sought-by-cantwell/ab843eb5-c457-4780-9448-56c0179e6a6d"&gt;coronavirus relief package&lt;/a&gt; Congress passed in December, will fund programs to help make broadband more affordable for tribal areas to help fund the digital divide, the Commerce Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KisgM4"&gt;NTIA will be holding webinars to inform the public &lt;a href="https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=333974"&gt;about the grants&lt;/a&gt;. The next Tribal Broadband Connectivity webinars will be held on June 16th and 17th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The pandemic showed that Big Tech isn’t a public health savior  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mNm6SdOcWwLL4HWPeysghsedfb0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69400528/acastro_210602_4613_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Public health takes a village, not a tech campus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1dK7Q6"&gt;Two days after the World Health Organization declared that the coronavirus outbreak was a pandemic, then-President Donald Trump stood in the Rose Garden next to a flow chart. The chart promised that soon, it would be easy for anyone in the United States to get tested for the virus. According to Trump, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197026/trump-coronavirus-testing-website-plan-google-covid-19"&gt;Google was building a website&lt;/a&gt; to streamline the entire process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V56XEz"&gt;It was the first of many promises that private companies would swoop in and rescue or bolster the country’s flailing COVID-19 response. Public health infrastructure in the United States has been underfunded for decades, and its underlying tech infrastructure is outdated and clunky. Health departments relied on fax machines and paper printouts to ferry data around. Fighting the pandemic would require a clear view of how many people were sick and where those sick people were, but the US was flying blind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y2T6zx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We saw all over the papers: Facebook is gonna save the world, and Google’s going to save the world”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VVu2HN"&gt;It seemed like Big Tech, with its analytic firepower and new focus on health, could help with these very real problems. “We saw all over the papers: Facebook is gonna save the world, and Google’s going to save the world,” says Katerini Storeng, a medical anthropologist who studies public-private partnerships in global public health at the University of Oslo. Politicians were eager to welcome Silicon Valley to the table and to discuss the best ways to manage the pandemic. “It was remarkable, and indicative of a blurring of the boundaries between the public domain and the private domain,” Storeng says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0oWyX"&gt;Over a year later, many of the promised tech innovations never materialized. There are areas where tech companies have made significant contributions — like collecting mobility data that helped officials understand the effects of social distancing policies. But Google wasn’t actually building a nationwide testing website. The program that eventually appeared, a testing program for California run by Google’s sibling company Verily, was &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/25/california-has-quietly-ended-its-covid-19-testing-partnership-with-verily/"&gt;quietly phased out&lt;/a&gt; after it created more problems than it solved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7BtPX"&gt;Now, after a year, we’re starting to get a clear picture of what worked, what didn’t, and what the relationship between Big Tech and public health might look like in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vO94j"&gt;Tech companies were interested in health before the pandemic, and COVID-19 accelerated those initiatives. There may be things that tech companies are better equipped to handle than traditional public health agencies and other public institutions, and the past year showed some of those strengths. But it also showed their weaknesses and underscored the risks to putting health responsibilities in the hands of private companies — which have goals outside of the public good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCbVI8"&gt;“Big tech companies can be extremely useful,” says Andrew Schroeder, who runs analytics programs at the humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief. “The question is, how do you make sure that designing with the public good in mind actually happens?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MBhnTL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding the problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3TSy5m"&gt;When the pandemic started, Storeng was already studying how private companies participated in public health preparedness efforts. Over the past two decades, consumers and health officials have become more and more confident that tech hacks can be shortcuts to healthy communities. These digital hacks can take many forms and include everything from a smartphone app nudging people toward exercise to a data model analyzing how an illness spreads, she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVUBJq"&gt;“What they have in common, I think, is this hope and optimism that it’ll help bypass some more systemic, intrinsic problems,” Storeng says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CDGKt"&gt;But healthcare and public health present hard problems. Parachuting in with a new approach that isn’t based on a detailed understanding of the existing system doesn’t always work. “I think we tend to believe in our culture that higher tech, private sector is necessarily better,” says Melissa McPheeters, co-director of the Center for Improving the Public’s Health through Informatics at Vanderbilt University. “Sometimes that’s true. And sometimes it’s not.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrI7gs"&gt;McPheeters spent three years as the director of the Office of Informatics and Analytics at the Tennessee Department of Health. While in that role, she got calls from technology companies all the time, promising quick fixes to any data issues the department was facing. But they were more interested in delivering a product than a collaboration, she says. “It never began with, ‘Help me understand your problem.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XF31I0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’d have folks come in and say, ‘We can solve your opioid problem because we’ve solved bank fraud before’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AaMjuU"&gt;Before the pandemic, tech companies tended to assume that one data problem was the same as another, McPheeters says. Broadly speaking, they didn’t appreciate how important it was to understand epidemiology and public health in order to work with the data in that field. During her tenure at the department of health, for example, she oversaw efforts to develop a data-driven response to the opioid epidemic in the state. “We’d have folks come in and say, ‘We can solve your opioid problem because we’ve solved bank fraud before,’” McPheeters says. While there may be similar data science involved, the social environment on the ground — how people were behaving, and why — is just as important as the data itself. In that respect, there aren’t many similarities between the two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHeVYk"&gt;This isn’t to say that there can’t be data-driven solutions to public health problems. Tech companies can have important roles to play during infectious disease outbreaks, like offering data-crunching expertise or platforms to analyze information. But companies have to work as partners, not outside disruptors, McPheeters says. That’s hard to do on the fly during an emergency when there hasn’t been a history of collaboration. “One of the challenges of a situation like this pandemic is that if you haven’t built those relationships already, it’s very difficult for those relationships to suddenly flourish,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kFXZre"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bigger barriers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="22MGPb"&gt;Even without a history of robust collaboration, governments were eager to welcome tech companies to the table during the early phases of the pandemic response. When COVID-19 took hold in the United States, the country’s public health infrastructure had been crumbling for years. Underfunded and understaffed health agencies worked on &lt;a href="https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/policy-value-based-care/public-health/article/21147049/pandemic-reveals-public-health-data-infrastructure-shortcomings"&gt;outdated data systems&lt;/a&gt; and didn’t have the resources to invest in new ones. Many test results were still sent on fax machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Trump declares national emergency in coronavirus fight" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kPj9vW-TWBxS9zVjG-4VC7BNdLs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22622426/1207061487.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;In March 2020, Trump promised a Google-built website that never materialized. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="enjeoi"&gt;Faced with the typical levels of public health problems, the systems could keep themselves together. But under the strain of a devastating pandemic, the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/05/pandemic-data-america-messy/618987/"&gt;cracks split&lt;/a&gt;. There weren’t reliable ways to send information on cases, hospitalizations, and deaths between hospitals, labs, and health agencies. Health officials didn’t have the resources to monitor the spread of disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cu0huq"&gt;Scrambling, officials took tech companies up on offers to take on some of the burden. “They got handed the keys to the kingdom,” says Jorge Caballero, an anesthesiologist at Stanford University and co-founder of the volunteer group &lt;a href="https://codersagainstcovid.org/"&gt;Coders Against COVID&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCnGoo"&gt;Some of the first pandemic problems tech companies tried to tackle were COVID-19 testing projects. Google sibling company Verily piloted a testing system in California in March 2020, and eventually inked $55 million in testing contracts with the state. “They started off with this big overture that they could offer a turn-key solution to the state of California,” Caballero says, and to other states, as well. But by October 2020, two counties &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534517/california-verily-testing-google-covid-inequity"&gt;phased out&lt;/a&gt; the Verily testing program over concerns that it was asking for too much patient data and wasn’t accessible to low-income groups that had the greatest need for testing. The state’s &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/25/california-has-quietly-ended-its-covid-19-testing-partnership-with-verily/"&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; with Verily ended in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbOq5E"&gt;Google also wanted to link people to testing sides nationwide, and testing sites started showing up in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225828/google-showing-covid-19-testing-centers-search-results"&gt;Google searches&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of April 2020. The company pulled in location data from state governments and groups like Castlight Health, which had its own testing site directory, Hema Budaraju, director of product management at Google, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cFDsT"&gt;That Google project was technically a success — someone could search for a testing site and find one. But there was a problem with the approach, Caballero says. Any changes to testing site data would take a few days to update. But many COVID-19 testing sites, particularly those targeted at underserved communities, were temporary pop-ups. The lag meant those wouldn’t show up in search. Caballero tried to flag that issue to Google in spring 2020 but says he wasn’t impressed with its response: it took Google a long time to acknowledge the concern, and even then, he says it didn’t seem to him like it fully understood the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAdVKl"&gt;Budaraju tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Google relied on its partners to provide accurate testing site information, and that it makes updates if those partners flag any missing locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9GuAyP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Health experts are always concerned that a push toward high-tech solutions would widen inequities rather than alleviate them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lcCPpt"&gt;Health experts are always concerned that a push toward high-tech solutions would widen inequities rather than alleviate them. If Google wasn’t including pop-up testing sites or was updating them on a lag, people who live in areas without many medical resources — which &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/17/835487746/doctors-bring-coronavirus-testing-to-underserved-communities"&gt;were targeted&lt;/a&gt; by those pop-up sites — may have had a harder time finding them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3we9z"&gt;After someone tests positive for COVID-19, the next step for health officials is to identify the people who that person had been in contact with to encourage them to quarantine or get tested themselves. Tech companies thought they were positioned to help with that, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3X2pAG"&gt;One of the flashiest attempts tech companies made to fight the pandemic was the Google and Apple exposure notification program. The companies teamed up on an app-based system that utilized Bluetooth to keep tabs on which smartphones spent time near each other. Then, if someone tested positive for COVID-19, they could alert strangers whose phones had been nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKmb3l"&gt;In theory, this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222161/apple-google-bluetooth-contact-tracing-system-coronavirus-health"&gt;could help&lt;/a&gt; track down people who had been exposed to COVID-19 but wouldn’t have been identified by traditional contact tracing, which relies on sick people remembering everyone they’d been in touch with while they were contagious. “There was a naivete about it,” Storeng says. “Wouldn’t it be awesome if I could just be notified when I’m exposed to infection, and that can solve it all?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Phone App Warns Of Covid Exposure" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WECk0p9bs9ERkEbMeAyq2cxknHs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22161150/1290167857.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;California released an exposure notification app in December 2020. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aWYbYf"&gt;In the end, evidence on the system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22168473/coronavirus-contact-tracing-apps-exposure-notification-covid-google-apple"&gt;was mixed&lt;/a&gt;. In the United States, only a small percentage of people used apps built on the system — likely not enough to make a difference in the trajectory of the pandemic. In the United Kingdom, where a quarter of the population signed up, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03606-z_reference.pdf"&gt;researchers estimated&lt;/a&gt; it helped avert hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZwxJk"&gt;All of the data, though, are estimates: because of the app’s focus on privacy, officials around the world can only extrapolate from the number of people the app notified about a possible exposure. There’s no way to know if people who got those notifications actually isolated themselves or got tested for COVID-19. Without that data, officials can’t evaluate how many infections the exposure notification programs prevented. It also meant that they weren’t able to learn &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; was notified about a possible exposure, let alone get in touch with them to offer support or resources. That information stayed in the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4vdbl"&gt;It’s an example of a tech company building a digital system without incorporating the most important elements of the manual program it’s attempting to augment. McPheeters says that contract tracing can’t be as effective if there isn’t any connection to the people who were exposed. “If you look at the history of contact tracing and you talk to experienced contact tracers, it’s actually about relationship building,” she says. “It’s not about tracking.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W08OfQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding lanes that work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vW86rt"&gt;There are success stories from the past year. One clear bright spot was mobility data. Companies like Facebook and Google tracked how people’s movement patterns changed in response to social distancing policies. Before the pandemic, there hadn’t been anything like the sweeping stay-at-home policies introduced by governments around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzrAl6"&gt;“This was really chaotic. Nobody really knew what was going to happen, or if anyone would listen to these policymakers,” Schroeder at Disaster Relief says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nyofOx"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/7/21209595/google-mobility-reports-facebook-disease-prevention-maps-tech-privacy-backlash"&gt;started releasing&lt;/a&gt; COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports in April 2020, and Facebook pushed out similar information through its Data for Good program, which builds datasets in partnership with humanitarian organizations and academic research institutions. That helped researchers understand how people’s behavior changed under new policies. “It went from flying blind, to not flying totally blind,” Schroeder says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6mpPCx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It went from flying blind, to not flying totally blind”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uTrdLz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/reports/Working%20paper%20%E2%80%93%20model-based%20estimates%20of%20COVID-19%20burden%20in%20King%20and%20Snohomish%20counties%20through%20April%207.pdf"&gt;Seattle area researchers&lt;/a&gt; used Facebook’s data for one of the earliest looks at how movement patterns affected the spread of COVID-19. Other cities, like New York City, used the information to tailor their public health response. The data also informed academic research on COVID-19 &lt;a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Facebook-Data-for-Good-2020-Annual-Report-1.pdf"&gt;over the past year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srdoQF"&gt;Tech companies are the only resources for this data, Schroeder says. “There’s no government anywhere that’s producing this, no nonprofit producing it — if you want that information, the only way to do that is through one or another private tech company.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMvmzz"&gt;Through Data for Good, Facebook also started running large-scale surveys in partnership with academic researchers. One project, the KAP COVID dashboards, was a collaboration with the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The group surveyed people in 67 countries about their COVID-19 knowledge and pandemic behaviors. Facebook provided the platform, and the researchers designed the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;A March 2020 COVID-19 testing site in Seattle, one of the earliest pandemic hot spots. Researchers used Facebook data to look at how movement patterns changed the disease’s spread.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YLmK12"&gt;“It’s a phenomenal resource. There’s really nothing like it,” says Douglas Storey, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs working on the project. The team has used its findings to run webinars with working groups in the countries it surveys and to share information about how people are modifying their behavior to prevent COVID-19 spread. The team has started to incorporate questions on vaccine acceptance, as well. Then, countries can use the information for their own pandemic response strategies, Storey says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZr8Js"&gt;The Data for Good team was eager to work with the scientists, he says, and seemed to have a clear sense of the areas in which it didn’t have expertise. “They seemed genuinely committed to understanding how they can have a more positive impact.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a51LcZ"&gt;These enormous, worldwide surveys could only really be done by big tech companies like Facebook. “Facebook, every single day, is surveying hundreds of thousands of people all over the world,” Schroeder says. “Could any government run a survey, daily, globally, at that scale? The UN doesn’t have the ability to do that, and they’re the only ones who would have the authority globally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="A7t8yr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Could any government run a survey, daily, globally, at that scale?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7zVdu5"&gt;Notably, Facebook and Google weren’t doing their own interpretation of this data — they supplied it to public health experts and left them to do the epidemiology. That’s an important part of the Data for Good approach, Laura McGorman, policy lead on the team, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Our partners provide the domain expertise required to make use of these tools to solve real-world problems — whether it’s in public health, natural disaster response, or climate change. This work is extremely collaborative and plays to the unique strengths of everyone involved,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFE5hZ"&gt;It’s different from, for example, the exposure notification program — where Google and Apple built a self-contained product that collected and used data. In the recovery from the pandemic, as tech companies continue to push into healthcare and public health, there’s an open question around which approach will win out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SFzlc"&gt;“What is the role Big Tech should play as a neutral data publisher, and what role should it have in terms of producing something where analysis has already been done?” Schroeder asks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wqoGz7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning for the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nYihD3"&gt;Despite the mixed record on tech contributions during the COVID-19 pandemic, coalitions of companies are gearing up to keep pushing into healthcare. It’s a hugely lucrative area that they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166673/technology-health-care-amazon-apple-uber-alphabet-google-verily"&gt;already interested in&lt;/a&gt; before the pandemic — the healthcare market is a nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/highlights.pdf"&gt;$4 trillion industry&lt;/a&gt; in the US alone. Last summer, for example, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) launched the &lt;a href="https://cta.tech/Resources/Newsroom/Media-Releases/2020/July/Major-Health,-Tech-Leaders-Join-CTAs-New-Initiati"&gt;Public Health Tech Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, a working group that includes CVS, Facebook, Microsoft, and other major players. It plans to analyze the things that did — and didn’t — go well for tech companies during the pandemic and leverage that experience to prepare for the next health emergency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gY0AgP"&gt;To start, the group is focusing on health data and virtual care, says René Quashie, vice president of digital health at the CTA. Members are talking about projects like an early warning system for public health that aggregates data from wearables, or creating data sharing platforms for public health agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4FLD1"&gt;“We would envision sort of a new paradigm, more of a public-private partnership where public health agencies and government bodies are able to leverage the technological expertise of the private sector,” Quashie says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Az1uiG"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “What is a public good coming from private companies?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w05AuN"&gt;Some experts remain wary about the implications of integrating the private sector even more tightly with public health. Public health is supposed to be just that: public, and governed with the public good in mind. “What is a public good coming from private companies?” Schroeder asks. “Could you have some kind of structure that draws on what they’re good at, but doesn’t turn the authority over to them? I have no idea.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGI5v6"&gt;The goal of public health is to make a community healthier, not just individuals. Everyone shares in the success of reducing the spread of a disease like COVID-19, for example — no one is excluded from the benefits of lower levels of disease, even if they don’t personally contribute to reduction efforts. Turning a public health task over to a private company could turn the overall goal of a project away from the pursuit of a collective good and toward accomplishments that would benefit the company. It may &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; lead to collective good, but that might be secondary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70u1Mw"&gt;Companies that used their resources to fight COVID-19 got something out of it. Whether it was lucrative contracts, good PR, or even just helping their customer base stay healthy — it benefits companies to participate when the world’s health is on the line. As the emergency of the pandemic recedes, companies’ motivations to venture into public health and healthcare may change — and consumers and governments should pay attention to that changing landscape, experts say. “Does it have anything to do with health improvement, or is it about something else? Is it a way for these companies to harvest data, or get entry into new markets, or just some corporate social responsibility scheme to enable other kinds of activities?” the University of Oslo’s Storeng says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HuRIq"&gt;The mobility data, for example, was a huge boon to researchers through the pandemic. At first, many companies were giving that information away for free. “Now, it’s like, ‘About that free price,’” Schroeder says. He isn’t expecting Facebook to put up any paywalls. “The profit or loss on the mobility data or the survey data is a rounding error for Facebook,” he says. But it’s more of a concern for the smaller companies. Mobility data company SafeGraph, for example, offered its data for free to government agencies and nonprofits early in the pandemic but is now charging those users for data again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TjmMQl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You have to ask skeptical questions about the legitimacy of their involvement”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9fJ1oF"&gt;But it shows the tension created by relying on a private company for a critical public health service: it could, at any time, decide that it no longer wants to provide it to researchers — or it could decide that that valuable information comes with a price; private companies, after all, are first and foremost in the business of making money. Or, health officials have to make compromises on the terms and conditions around the data, as with the Apple and Google exposure notification program. “These are companies that have been known to be monopolistic, and potentially antithetical to democracy and free speech,” Storeng says. “You have to ask skeptical questions about the legitimacy of their involvement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xh7Lc"&gt;The pandemic highlighted the underlying weakness of the US public health system, particularly around its data systems and tech infrastructure: they’re outdated, disjoined, and underfunded, which leaves the country vulnerable to infectious disease threats. The past year opened the door for the tech industry to tackle some of those problems. Regardless of concerns around the companies’ intentions, it will likely stay open — and companies have made their interest in the space clear over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166673/technology-health-care-amazon-apple-uber-alphabet-google-verily"&gt;the past few years&lt;/a&gt;. They may be able to make useful, lifesaving contributions, but the public good still has to be the priority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="lWT6RW"&gt;“What is really clear, and I think this was clear well prior to the pandemic, is that tech does not substitute for strong public institutions,” Schroeder says. “Public health investment needs to happen independently of what any tech company does.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford delays Mustang Mach-E deliveries in the UK due to ‘safety risk’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SmtadszCT8KKVkDBy_mp7Q6et7c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69400513/sokane_210125_4386_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GUYK8m"&gt;Deliveries of Ford’s first long-range electric vehicle, the Mustang Mach-E, in the United Kingdom are on hold after a “safety risk” was discovered, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned. It’s the latest delivery snafu to hit the automaker’s much-hyped electric SUV, after US customers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/16/22234668/ford-delays-deliveries-mustang-mach-e-quality-checks"&gt;experienced similar delays earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bhxrK"&gt;But while the cause of the US delivery delays was unknown, the UK delays are a result of “incorrect location information when using the eCall system,” according to documents viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The eCall system, in which emergency services are notified when a vehicle’s airbags are deployed, &lt;a href="https://www.carbuyer.co.uk/tips-and-advice/155428/ecall-explained"&gt;is a European Union requirement&lt;/a&gt; in all vehicles manufactured after 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gCPc5S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“incorrect location information when using the eCall system”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HDgFFQ"&gt;“While investigations continue new vehicles ... must not be released to customers,” the announcement about the hold to dealerships read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQlG0U"&gt;The Mustang Mach-E SUV is Ford’s first update to the iconic Mustang brand, and the company’s biggest foray into the EV marketplace. The news of the delay also comes on the heels of Ford’s announcement that its EV sales were up 184 percent in May, which included the sale of 1,945 Mustang Mach-Es. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fy2iAP"&gt;The UK is going to be a major part of Ford’s push into new EV markets. In May, the automaker staged a &lt;a href="https://fordauthority.com/2021/05/mustang-mach-e-fleet-invades-tiny-uk-town-amid-ford-ev-push/"&gt;large-scale marketing event&lt;/a&gt; in Fordwich, Britain’s smallest town, with the aim of getting more customers to consider switching to electric. Over several days in May, Ford allowed most of the town’s 380 residents to test drive the Mach-E, which is the only Ford EV available in the European market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uv1J6j"&gt;In February, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311594/ford-mustang-mach-e-delays-quality-free-charging-cash-back"&gt;Ford acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that 4,500 customers in the US would have to wait an unspecified amount of time to receive their Mustang Mach-Es after an unexpected delay in deliveries. The automaker didn’t specify what was causing the delay, just that it was holding back the EVs “as part of our commitment to deliver a quality vehicle to customers.” To make up for the US delays, Ford said it gave affected customers an extra 250kWh of free vehicle charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1kpOn"&gt;Ford’s not alone in experiencing trouble with its EV. Volvo was forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307866/volvo-xc40-recharge-delay-software-update-on-call-ota"&gt;hold a number of XC40 Recharge SUVs at US ports&lt;/a&gt; in order to ship a software update before the electric vehicles got to customers. Volkswagen also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21288572/volkswagen-id3-ev-delay-software-vw-herbert-diess"&gt;ran into trouble during the launch of its ID 3 mass-market EV last year&lt;/a&gt; because of a software issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnN7Mu"&gt;A spokesperson for Ford did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nanoleaf’s light-up wall panels now look like wood accent pieces</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e5mMthw5KLHOYGzgBzurFCIupbg=/313x0:3688x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69399208/Elements_7x_Dining_Winter_4000x2250px.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nanoleaf Elements accent lights&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nanoleaf&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K7ycSs"&gt;Nanoleaf, the company best known for illuminated panels that you stick to your wall, has announced the new Nanoleaf Elements line, a set of wall panels that are designed to look as nice turned off as they do when on. The new Elements line accomplishes this through a wood-like veneer that allows the light to shine through when its on but doesn’t look blank when the light isn’t in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0Lwaz"&gt;Aside from the new veneer, the Elements lights are very similar to Nanoleaf’s other hexagonal light panels. They glow from both the front and back of the panel, allowing for a double lighting effect, and can be programmed with different lighting patterns and effects. The Elements do not have a full color spectrum LED, but they are adjustable from warm to cool white. Nanoleaf includes 11 preset lighting effects, or you can use the app to program your own. The touch-sensitive panels can also be synced to music or adjust their white temperature automatically throughout the day based on circadian rhythms. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZZMKagW8ruUipAvY2DqxuWnfWis=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22560542/Elements_10x_Panels_Off_Statement_Wall_4000x2250.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nanoleaf&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elements are designed to look good both on and off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FJhRwI"&gt;The base $299.99 Elements Smarter kit includes seven panels that can be arranged in whatever pattern you’d like. Add-on packs of three more light panels are available for $99.99 each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYMLjZ"&gt;With this new design, it appears that Nanoleaf is attempting to make its product more accessible in more homes, as the wood veneer and lack of full RGB lighting effects have less of a nightclub vibe than previous products. But the basic premise remains the same: unlike standard lighting that is mostly meant to provide illumination, the Elements are purely decorative and meant to change the mood of a room, not brighten it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3X018a"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XwIu2_YHYEY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sQyZke"&gt;The new Nanoleaf Elements products are available through the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnanoleaf.me%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fnanoleaf-elements%2F%3Futm_source%3DPR%26utm_medium%3Dtech%26utm_campaign%3Delements_launch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F3%2F22466594%2Fnanoleaf-elements-light-panel-smart-home-price-release" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company’s website&lt;/a&gt; starting today, June 3rd, and will be at Best Buy stores later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPZE4N"&gt;In addition, Nanoleaf has announced that its light panels will become Thread border routers, allowing them to act as a hub on a Thread network and extend the signal throughout the home. The company already supports Thread in its Essentials line of smart lights and light strips and it says it will be possible to add Thread devices from other manufacturers to the Nanoleaf border routers. Thread is the main technology in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;forthcoming Matter smart home standard&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to unite smart home devices and platforms and allow for more interoperability. Nanoleaf says the Thread compatibility will be added through a software update this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haFWRz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome will soon warn you when you might not want to trust an extension</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oloOkW97UiHtdC8cs1c3qmruZjA=/1x0:1972x1314/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69396912/install_dialog___friction__2x__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new dialog box will warn if an extension isn’t considered trusted.&lt;/em&gt; | Image; Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KhXju2"&gt;Google is rolling out new safety features for Chrome which are designed to make it easier to spot dubious downloads and extensions. They build upon the browser’s Enhanced Safe Browsing feature, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262923/google-chrome-privacy-security-safe-browsing-cookies-dns-https-extensions"&gt;launched last year&lt;/a&gt; to offer better warnings against phishing sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kcm933"&gt;When it comes to Chrome extensions, the browser will now show a warning if what you’re installing is not considered “trusted.” In order to be trusted, extensions need to come from a developer that has followed &lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program_policies/"&gt;Google’s Developer Program Policies&lt;/a&gt; and has been around for “at least a few months.” That means brand-new developers won’t immediately be considered trusted by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Am9ZS2"&gt;When attempting to download an extension that’s &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;trusted, Chrome will show a pop-up warning that you should “proceed with caution.” However, there’s still the option to “continue to install” the extension. Google says nearly three-quarters of the extensions on Chrome’s store will be considered trusted under its criteria. Not being “trusted” doesn’t mean Google thinks an extension is dangerous, but that its developer might be newer to the store or may have recently committed a minor policy violation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TB7j6j1H4QMiaprzHin-cXo8mIw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22556652/ezgif.com_gif_maker__12_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suspicious files can now go through a more thorough scan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yRZo4p"&gt;Chrome is also getting a new scanning feature for suspicious-looking downloads. In the future, any downloads that seem “risky, but not clearly unsafe” will offer an option to upload them to Google’s servers for a more thorough scan. This process can be bypassed if you prefer, but it offers an extra layer of protection when downloading files from the web. The new scanning option is offered in addition to the existing metadata checks that Chrome already performs on downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EhvQS"&gt;Google says the new features are rolling out gradually for Chrome 91, the version of the browser that released late last month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam now lets developers team up on game bundles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GV2ch_K2BQvmYpCeZArHrnFPKTM=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69396600/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2tzoXX"&gt;Valve has started letting developers team up to create bundles on the Steam gaming storefront. It outlined the new “DIY collaborative bundles” &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3074248029695078497"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, describing the feature as a way to collect titles with “common themes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CbCp7"&gt;Steam already offered multi-developer bundles, but only ones that were specially curated by the platform. Now, any developer can create a bundle and send an invitation link to other creators, who can then choose to add their own projects. The bundle owner then locks the bundle and participants agree to a name, royalty split, discount amount, and other details. All participants have to approve later game additions, but someone can remove their game from the bundle unilaterally, and the bundle owner can change the description and art without approval — so Valve notes that you should “be sure that you trust the owner of the bundle.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JmdP2x"&gt;Valve characterizes DIY bundles as a “co-marketing” option for related games, as well as an option for splitting the royalties on soundtracks. Instead of the publisher selling a game’s soundtrack and passing along funds, they can collaborate on a bundle with the musicians. Themed bundles have a long history on many platforms, including the Humble Bundle storefront, which helped popularize the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vivil9"&gt;Developers on the smaller platform Itch.io in particular have used collaborative bundles for activism and commentary, supporting causes like Black Lives Matter or &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/10/22167534/cyberpunk-indie-bundle-itch-io"&gt;indie alternatives&lt;/a&gt; to big-budget releases like &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077. &lt;/em&gt;(That’s in addition to an official &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/6/9/21285134/itchio-bundle-1000-games-5-dollars-best-gaming-deal-pc-black-lives-matter"&gt;Itch.io-organized Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality&lt;/a&gt;, which raised over $8.1 million last year.) Valve’s new system could facilitate something similar — in addition to making it easier for developers to market games together.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google announces $99 Pixel Buds A-Series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzp_YPSSvIWob8XWzZ4zmKi0vVc=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69390998/pixelbudsa.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DH2sGY"&gt;As usual for Google hardware, the new Pixel Buds A-Series have already been extensively leaked, and the company even tweeted about them prematurely. But today, the earbuds are being officially announced. They’re priced at $99, a significant savings compared to the $179 standard Pixel Buds, and are available for preorder in the United States and Canada starting now. Google says the Pixel Buds A-Series be released on June 17th. They come in either olive green or white and gray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPKJBX"&gt;Despite their much lower cost, the Pixel Buds A-Series retain the same sound quality as the 2020 Pixel Buds. They also still offer hands-free “Hey Google” voice commands and are rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance. Google has slashed some features of the prior earbuds — like wireless charging for the case and swipe controls for volume — but the Pixel Buds A-Series don’t skimp on much else. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4yuWVO"&gt;Battery life is rated at five hours (24 hours counting recharges in the case), and Google says you can get up to three hours of listening time with a 15-minute quick charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LH0ar9"&gt;While the Pixel Buds A-Series look practically identical to the regular Pixel Buds, Google has tweaked the design by softening the integrated ear hooks / stabilizer arcs and making them a bit smaller. The company has also taken steps to avoid the connectivity bugs and audio cutouts that still affect some owners of its last earbuds. And the Pixel Buds A-Series can crank louder in overall volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1VZV1"&gt;Did Google succeed in making a must-have pair of $99 earbuds? Well, I’ve actually been using the Pixel Buds A-Series for a few days now, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22229692"&gt;you can read the full review&lt;/a&gt; right now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel Buds A-Series review: price is everything</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The $99 Pixel Buds are a better buy than their pricier predecessors&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="MBwNxA"&gt;With the new, awkwardly named Pixel Buds A-Series, Google is trying to do more than merely introduce a much cheaper set of true wireless earbuds: the company wants to get it right this time — and get it right for under $100. Google’s second-generation Pixel Buds were certainly an improvement over the company’s original wireless earbuds; let us never forget &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16659314/google-pixel-buds-review-bluetooth-headphones"&gt;the most overly intricate carrying case of all time&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21400695/google-pixel-buds-2-2020-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;the 2020 earbuds&lt;/a&gt; came with issues of their own. At the top of that list were concerns with stability. Google never managed to get the two Pixel Buds connected as reliably as many competitors, and some owners still complain of audio dropouts even after numerous firmware updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fzvcX"&gt;In several ways, Google has succeeded at its goal. The $99 Pixel Buds A-Series are more comfortable to wear over longer stretches of time than the pricier earbuds. They retain the same enjoyable sound quality, and hands-free “Hey Google” access to Google Assistant and features like real-time language translation are still useful tricks to have at your disposal. The carrying case is just as fun to fidget with as before (though it lost wireless charging) and has the same satisfying thunk when you close it. Google promises the same five hours of continuous battery life, with a total of 24 hours when you include case recharges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKSngV"&gt;The bad news is that Google didn’t fully overcome the connectivity issues, though it made some improvement. I recently talked with Google’s Sandeep Waraich, who went over some of the changes made to the A-Series buds that were meant to enhance wireless reliability. Each earbud connects individually to the source device. Both the antenna and chipset architectures were optimized for stronger transmission power and increased range to avoid cross-body audio dropouts. There’s even an all-new chipset inside, though Google declined to tell me who manufactures it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N02isN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10578046"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EhyAYZ"&gt;But in my experience so far, the Pixel Buds A-Series still have more occasional blips and audio interruptions than those from many competitors. It’s not as much of a glaring problem as before, and I really only noticed it on the move (and on busy streets with plenty of wireless interference), but it’s still something you might encounter. The Bluetooth connection does seem to be stronger regardless of which pocket your phone is in. I find that it’s easier to tolerate things like this for $99 than the $179 that Google still asks for the 2020 Pixel Buds, but I wish they were gone completely. Almost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUjrBu"&gt;Google also told me about some subtle improvements it made to the physical design. The A-Series earbuds look nearly identical to the 2020 Pixel Buds, but according to Waraich, the nonremovable “stabilizer arc” — a source of discomfort last time after prolonged listening — has been made softer and smaller than before. I’ve got large ears, and it seems like the hook never settles into the folds of my ear the way it’s meant to, but the Pixel Buds A-Series sit snug and stable regardless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z-mqRAbZIEGmwTya0612daUqEMg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555558/cwelch_20210528_4608_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel Buds A-Series look just like the regular Pixel Buds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gODBJp"&gt;Google also shaved off a few milligrams of weight from each earbud. The Pixel Buds A-Series come in either white or olive green, and the inside of the carrying case is now color matched to whichever earbuds you get. In the ear, the Pixel Buds continue to have a very discreet, flush style and can be hard to spot when looking at someone head-on. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Et7hgK_0Sa-H76MD0t84D6oWk3M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22556165/DSCF4053.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;They still have a discreet design that sits flush against your ear and doesn’t stick out far.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8GGsB2"&gt;The acoustic architecture is unchanged, so the sound signature between the Pixel Buds and Pixel Buds A-Series is very consistent. That’s a good thing. Google aims for full, natural audio reproduction, and that’s what you get from these earbuds and their 12-millimeter drivers. You can still enable the “bass boost” option in settings to give the low end some added oomph. Even with bass boost active, the Pixel Buds don’t match the boominess of something like the Jabra Elite 75ts or Sony’s WF-XB700s. Still, there’s a level of clarity that outshines many earbuds that sell at the $100 mark. Waraich told me that Google increased overall volume levels across the board after some customers found the 2020 Pixel Buds couldn’t crank as high as they’d hoped. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OmxE4K223PuPFL17vC4WAICDJNw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555553/cwelch_20210525_4608_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The carrying case is also similar, though this one lacks wireless charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8E6mFU"&gt;But although the Pixel Buds A-Series can get louder, they still have to contend with a lot of the outside world. Like the previous model, these A-Series earbuds just aren’t very good at noise isolation. While working from the outdoor seating area at my local coffee shop, I could hear an annoying level of traffic at all times. I think it partially comes down to their vented, airy design, but Google seems to struggle with this more than other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W_xoHKFR7xJj3CktlP7Zz9ztFFM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555560/cwelch_20210528_4608_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use hands-free voice commands by saying “Hey Google.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z3CWAnAE-vIe0slq75QDJnkshnI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555559/cwelch_20210528_4608_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel Buds A-Series can easily connect to Android phones with Fast Pair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n6JQ3B"&gt;Google says it actually tweaked the spatial vents to allow &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; outside noise in, but it’s still a noticeable downside of these earbuds. I think it’s inherently got something to do with the fit and “gentle” in-ear seal that Google had in mind with the design. What’s become clear to me is that the next flagship Pixel Buds really need some form of active noise cancellation to counteract this. I know there are people who prefer some awareness of what’s happening around them, but you get a little too much of that with the Pixel Buds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="7J2UyK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10531483"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c3Tklq"&gt;I already mentioned the loss of wireless charging, but other sacrifices that Google made to hit the $99 price aren’t as obvious. The swipe forward / back gestures that let you easily control volume on the Pixel Buds are gone; now you’re limited to just taps for track controls. The A-Series earbuds also ditch the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/answer/9642883?hl=en#:~:text=Attention%20Alerts%20is%20an%20experimental%20feature%20on%20Pixel,baby%20crying%2C%20dog%20barking%2C%20and%20emergency%20vehicle%20siren."&gt;“experimental” attention alerts feature&lt;/a&gt; that could detect specific sounds like sirens, dog barks, or a baby crying. And the LED that was on the &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; of the Pixel Buds case (to indicate charge status of the buds) is also history. These omissions make sense to me, and Google has at least preserved other important vitals like IPX4 water and sweat resistance. Voice calls also remain a Pixel Buds strength on the A-Series, with dual beamforming mics that do a good job of plucking your voice out of noisy environments and maintaining clarity during phone chats or work conference calls. Voice commands to Google Assistant were also recognized loud and clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HdlwQctHOnP35unxIC27xUpcuM0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555555/cwelch_20210528_4608_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mc1thk"&gt;The “adaptive sound” feature, which automatically adjusts volume based on your surroundings, is also carried over from the 2020 Pixel Buds. It works reasonably well and only activates when there are sustained changes in ambient noise as you move between different locations, but I’m old-school and prefer controlling volume myself rather than letting algorithms do it. The Pixel Buds A-Series still support Android’s Fast Pair feature for quick setup. On Pixel smartphones, the companion app is built in, but you can also grab it from the Play Store on other Android phones. With it, you can locate your earbuds, toggle settings like bass boost and in-ear detection (another thing Google didn’t skimp on), or check battery levels for the earbuds and case. No such app exists for iOS, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3mqhCP"&gt;By holding onto a lot of what worked best on the 2020 Pixel Buds — namely sound quality and hands-free voice controls — and improving other parts that didn’t, Google has ended up with an appealing set of $99 earbuds. The Pixel Buds A-Series haven’t fully stamped out the biggest issue that dragged down their pricier older sibling, and the level of outside noise your tunes compete against will turn some people away. But even with some of the things Google left out, you’re getting a better overall product for less money. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>United Airlines is buying 15 supersonic aircraft from Boom Supersonic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RrKs2FNzivDmDw2nq09_bJ8UFTI=/158x0:1862x1136/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69388852/img.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mq8GZi"&gt;United Airlines has agreed to purchase 15 supersonic aircraft from Boom Supersonic, with an option to increase that order to 50 jets, the companies announced Thursday. That agreement, though, is still subject to change depending on the outcome of United’s safety testing and also Boom’s ability to deliver on its promises despite never having built or flown a full-scale supersonic jet before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUYjIy"&gt;If Boom’s Overture jets pass inspection, the plan is for them to be rolled out in 2025, fly in 2026, and expected to carry passengers by 2029. At that point, Boom claims its supersonic jets will eventually be able to travel from New York to London — normally a seven-hour flight — in just 3.5 hours, or Los Angeles to Sydney — typically a 15-hour trip — in six hours and 45 minutes. Boom has said that tickets will cost $5,000 per seat, but United says it’s too early to announce pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Coen18"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a stellar flight experience”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EZIs9X"&gt;“Boom’s vision for the future of commercial aviation, combined with the industry’s most robust route network in the world, will give business and leisure travelers access to a stellar flight experience,” United CEO Scott Kirby said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="71hk2X"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Introducing the United supersonic fleet.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/united?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@United&lt;/a&gt; will purchase up to 50 Overture airliners and fly the fleet on 100% sustainable aviation fuels. &lt;a href="https://t.co/zVG2aMCVKx"&gt;https://t.co/zVG2aMCVKx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BoomSupersonic?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#BoomSupersonic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/kg9eoFT2Ww"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kg9eoFT2Ww&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Boom Supersonic (@boomaero) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boomaero/status/1400406948546220036?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g69k05"&gt;It’s the latest deal for Boom, the startup that has been focused on resurrecting commercial supersonic air travel. In addition to United, the company has contracts or memorandum of understanding with Rolls-Royce and the US Air Force. Boom has raised $240 million in funding and fielded preorders from Virgin Group (which is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11298798/virgin-group-boom-supersonic-airplanes-concorde"&gt;working on its own supersonic jet&lt;/a&gt;) and Japan Airlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPyPib"&gt;To be sure, Boom has only just revealed its first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505653/boom-supersonic-reveal-xb1-demonstrator-speed"&gt;full-scale XB-1 demonstrator aircraft&lt;/a&gt;, which is scheduled to take its inaugural flight in 2021. At 71 feet long, the XB-1 is a scaled-down version of the full production model that Boom hopes to have ready for passengers by 2029. The prototype only has room for the pilot, while the commercial-ready version will eventually hold up to 88 passengers and crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wZBMv"&gt;The demonstrator is expected to reach speeds of Mach 1.3, thanks to its three J85-15 engines, which are manufactured by General Electric, primarily for military aircraft. By comparison, the full-scale Overture jet will be 205 feet long, have a cruising altitude of 60,000 feet, and achieve speeds of Mach 1.7.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OZF5Qwtg0AvfRmSH9TsK4qD4Av0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22571361/united_interior_2x.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ermPDpKK8Pso84I20vBVGDP49rs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22571418/united_hero_2x.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="j6qGf7"&gt;Both companies claim the jets will be “net-zero carbon from day one [and] optimized to run on 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel.” But neither provided additional details about what kinds of fuel they would be using or how they would achieve net-zero carbon emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2uPce"&gt;Environmental groups are worried that faster speeds will equal more pollution into the environment. The global aviation industry produces around 2 percent of all human-induced CO2 emissions, but supersonic jets are known to be far more polluting. Boom says it will be carbon-neutral as a goal, but simply put, it takes more fuel to go faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yRwKIO"&gt;&lt;q&gt; it takes more fuel to go faster&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bl8Kta"&gt;Boom is behind schedule, having promised to begin flight tests by 2017 in the hopes of ferrying real passengers in 2020. Now, that timeline has been set back nearly a decade. There hasn’t been a supersonic commercial jet in operation since Concorde, constructed by French aerospace company Aérospatiale and British Aircraft Corporation, was &lt;a href="http://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2016/11/2/13409324/supersonic-flight-concorde"&gt;retired after 27 years of service in 2003&lt;/a&gt;. Concorde was a gas-guzzler and a money-loser for Airbus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxLVwO"&gt;Boom is also testing new technologies that could muffle the sonic boom that occurs when a supersonic airplane breaks the sound barrier. These cannon-blast booms led Congress to ban supersonic jets from flying over US soil in 1973. But in October 2018, President Trump &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-signs-h-r-302-law/"&gt;signed a bill&lt;/a&gt; directing the Federal Aviation Administration to consider lifting the ban. It’s unclear where President Joe Biden, who has made infrastructure and climate change a hallmark of his early days in office, stands on supersonic travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MN7BOw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 3rd, 12:46PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; United said it would purchase 15 jets from Boom Supersonic, with the option to buy 35 more, for a total of 50 aircraft. Also, Boom has said that its tickets would cost $5,000 per seat, but United hasn’t announced pricing yet. This story has been updated to reflect these facts. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vlwj7M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Have autonomous robots started killing in war? The reality is messier than it appears</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="quadcopter" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GSnCJHiphL4mL-AsaenW5zvv4nk=/85x0:795x473/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69388835/Screen_Shot_2015-05-07_at_10.02.05_AM.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quadcopters equipped with munitions and machine vision systems are creating cheap, autonomous-enough weapons. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xapei5"&gt;It’s the sort of thing that can almost pass for background noise these days: over the past week, a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/autonomous-drone-attacked-soldiers-in-libya-all-on-its-own/"&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/flying-killer-robot-hunted-down-a-human-target-without-1847001471"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/autonomous-drone-attacked-soldiers-in-libya-all-on-its-own/"&gt;publications&lt;/a&gt; tentatively declared, based on a UN report from the Libyan civil war, that killer robots may have hunted down humans autonomously for the first time. As one headline &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/flying-killer-robot-hunted-down-a-human-target-without-1847001471"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;: “The Age of Autonomous Killer Robots May Already Be Here.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4UYXdc"&gt;But is it? As you might guess, it’s a hard question to answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FfF7q"&gt;The new coverage has sparked a debate among experts that goes to the heart of our problems confronting the rise of autonomous robots in war. Some said the stories were wrongheaded and sensational, while others suggested there was a nugget of truth to the discussion. Diving into the topic doesn’t reveal that the world quietly experienced the opening salvos of the &lt;em&gt;Terminator&lt;/em&gt; timeline in 2020. But it does point to a more prosaic and perhaps much more depressing truth: that no one can agree on what a killer robot &lt;em&gt;is, &lt;/em&gt;and if we wait for this to happen, their presence in war will have long been normalized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQoyWv"&gt;It’s cheery stuff, isn’t it? It’ll take your mind off the global pandemic at least. Let’s jump in: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ftALl1"&gt;What’s the actual news here? &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="z1JYGA"&gt;The source of all these stories is a 548-page report from the United Nations Security Council that details the tail end of the Second Libyan Civil War, covering a period from October 2019 to January 2021. The report was published in March, and you can &lt;a href="https://undocs.org/S/2021/229"&gt;read it in full here&lt;/a&gt;. To save you time: it is an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; thorough account of an &lt;em&gt;extremely &lt;/em&gt;complex conflict, detailing various troop movements, weapon transfers, raids and skirmishes that took place among the war’s various factions, both foreign and domestic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CsGHt9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;News stories were based on just two paragraphs from a UN report&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s7BZQb"&gt;The paragraph we’re interested in, though, describes an offensive near Tripoli in March 2020, in which forces supporting the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) routed troops loyal to the Libyan National Army of Khalifa Haftar (referred to in the report as the Haftar Affiliated Forces or HAF). Here’s the relevant passage in full: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="DWybQy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logistics convoys and retreating HAF were subsequently hunted down and remotely engaged by the unmanned combat aerial vehicles or the lethal autonomous weapons systems such as the STM Kargu-2 (see annex 30) and other loitering munitions. The lethal autonomous weapons systems were programmed to attack targets without requiring data connectivity between the operator and the munition: in effect, a true “fire, forget and find” capability.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HvHL0G"&gt;The Kargu-2 system that’s mentioned here is a &lt;a href="https://www.stm.com.tr/en/kargu-autonomous-tactical-multi-rotor-attack-uav"&gt;quadcopter built in Turkey&lt;/a&gt;: it’s essentially a consumer drone that’s used to dive-bomb targets. It can be manually operated or steer itself using machine vision. A second paragraph in the report notes that retreating forces were “subject to continual harassment from the unmanned combat aerial vehicles and lethal autonomous weapons systems” and that the HAF “suffered significant casualties” as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VkRjpbJNC8_GQFyXqazeLOpv_48=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22556972/Screen_Shot_2021_06_03_at_2.28.11_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: STM&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kargu-2 drone is essentially a quadcopter that dive-bombs enemies. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6NJTAC"&gt;But that’s it. That’s all we have. What the report doesn’t say — at least not outright — is that human beings were killed by autonomous robots acting without human supervision. It says humans and vehicles were &lt;em&gt;attacked&lt;/em&gt; by a mix of drones, quadcopters, and “loitering munitions” (we’ll get to those later), and that the quadcopters had been programmed to work offline. But whether the attacks took place without connectivity is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rd8K3n"&gt;These two paragraphs made their way into the mainstream press via a story in &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2278852-drones-may-have-attacked-humans-fully-autonomously-for-the-first-time/"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which ran a piece with the headline: “Drones may have attacked humans fully autonomously for the first time.” The &lt;em&gt;NS&lt;/em&gt; is very careful to caveat that military drones &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have acted autonomously and that humans &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have been killed, but later reports lost this nuance. “Autonomous drone attacked soldiers in Libya all on its own,” read one headline. “For the First Time, Drones Autonomously Attacked Humans,” said another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75GYFQ"&gt;Let’s be clear: by itself, the UN does not say for certain whether drones autonomously attacked humans in Libya last year, though it certainly suggests this could have happened. The problem is that even if it &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; happen, for many experts, it’s just not news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="7XOznb"&gt;The problem of defining “killer robots”&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="FrRDid"&gt;The reason why some experts took issue with these stories was because they followed the UN’s wording, which doesn’t distinguish clearly between loitering munitions and lethal autonomous weapons systems or LAWS (that’s policy jargon for killer robots). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ec9mcB"&gt;Loitering munitions, for the uninitiated, are the weapon equivalent of seagulls at the beachfront. They hang around a specific area, float above the masses, and wait to strike their target — usually military hardware of one sort or another (though it’s not impossible that they could be used to target individuals). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7DjWh"&gt;The classic example is Israel’s IAI Harpy, which was developed in the 1980s to target anti-air defenses. The Harpy looks like a cross between a missile and a fixed-wing drone, and is fired from the ground into a target area where it can linger for up to nine hours. It scans for telltale radar emissions from anti-air systems and drops onto any it finds. The loitering aspect is crucial as troops will often turn these radars off, given they act like homing beacons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ka8B3l5KTFYULQNZVbWh-CAbSzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22556979/Harpy_NG_1021.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: IAI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The IAI Harpy is launched from the ground and can linger for hours over a target area. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xrD8dI"&gt;“The thing is, how is this the first time of anything?” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RikeFranke/status/1399670524998000640"&gt;tweeted Ulrike Franke&lt;/a&gt;, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Loitering munition have been on the battlefield for a while - most notably in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict"&gt;Nagorno-Karaback&lt;/a&gt;. It seems to me that what’s new here isn’t the event, but that the UN report calls them lethal autonomous weapon systems.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="qb5Ixr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the line between something being autonomous and being automated has shifted over the decades”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KCP7yL"&gt;Jack McDonald, a lecturer at the department of war studies at King’s College London, says the distinction between the two terms is controversial and constitutes an unsolved problem in the world of arms regulation. “There are people who call ‘loitering munitions’ ‘lethal autonomous weapon systems’ and people who just call them ‘loitering munitions,’” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This is a huge, long-running thing. And it’s because the line between something being autonomous and being automated has shifted over the decades.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDGraf"&gt;So is the Harpy a lethal autonomous weapons system? A killer robot? It depends on who you ask. IAI’s own website &lt;a href="https://www.iai.co.il/p/harpy"&gt;describes it as such&lt;/a&gt;, calling it “an autonomous weapon for all weather,” and the Harpy certainly fits a makeshift definition of LAWS as “machines that target combatants without human oversight.” But if this is your definition, then you’ve created a very broad church for killer robots. Indeed, under this definition a land mine is a killer robot, as it, too, autonomously targets combatants in war without human oversight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="x4OEjl"&gt;Artificial intelligence makes it worse&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="rjjJ8l"&gt;If killer robots have been around for decades, why has there been so much discussion about them in recent years, with groups like the Campaign To Stop Killer Robots &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17786080/united-nations-un-autonomous-killer-robots-regulation-conference"&gt;pushing for regulation of this technology in the UN&lt;/a&gt;? And why is this incident in Libya special? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fat8eM"&gt;The rise of artificial intelligence plays a big role, says Zak Kallenborn, a policy fellow at the Schar School of Policy and Government. Advances in AI over the past decade have given weapon-makers access to cheap vision systems that can select targets as quickly as your phone identifies pets, plants, and familiar faces in your camera roll. These systems promise nuanced and precise identification of targets but are also much more prone to mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HYoeGW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AI vision has been proven to be brittle, time and time again&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RaK2yO"&gt;“Loitering munitions typically respond to radar emissions, [and] a kid walking down the street isn’t going to have a high-powered radar in their backpack,” Kallenborn tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “But AI targeting systems might misclassify the kid as a soldier, because current AI systems are highly brittle — one study showed &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08864.pdf"&gt;a change in a single pixel&lt;/a&gt; is sufficient to cause machine vision systems to draw radically different conclusions about what it sees. An open question is how often those errors occur during real-world use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hPeNh"&gt;This is why the incident in Libya is interesting, says Kallenborn, as the Kargu-2 system mentioned in the UN report does seem to use AI to identify targets. According to the quadcopter’s manufacturer, STM, &lt;a href="https://www.stm.com.tr/en/kargu-autonomous-tactical-multi-rotor-attack-uav"&gt;i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stm.com.tr/uploads/docs/1579732425_kargu-en.pdf?"&gt;t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stm.com.tr/en/kargu-autonomous-tactical-multi-rotor-attack-uav"&gt; uses&lt;/a&gt; “machine learning algorithms embedded on the platform” to “effectively respond against stationary or mobile targets (i.e. vehicle, person etc.)” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqv9yaPLhEk&amp;amp;ab_channel=STM"&gt;Demo videos&lt;/a&gt; appear to show it doing exactly that. In the clip below, the quadcopter hones in on a mannequin in a stationary group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3wYo5n"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/auRlh-f2wwQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cgzcvn"&gt;But should we trust a manufacturers’ demo reel or brochure? And does the UN report make it clear that machine learning systems were used in the attack? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbbuxF"&gt;Kallenborn’s reading of the report is that it “heavily implies” that this was the case, but McDonald is more skeptical. “I think it’s sensible to say that the Kargu-2 as a platform is &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt; to being used in an autonomous way,” he says. “But we don’t necessarily know if it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;.” In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jackmcd83/status/1397873682249355266"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, he also pointed out that this particular skirmish involved long-range missiles and howitzers, making it even harder to attribute casualties to any one system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="lYkHgE"&gt;What’s next for LAWS and the law?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="ycLCf3"&gt;What we’re left with is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the fog of war. Or more accurately: the fog of LAWS. We can’t say for certain what happened in Libya and our definitions of what is and isn’t a killer robot are so fluid that even if we knew, there would be disagreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXHlum"&gt;For Kallenborn, this is sort of the point: it underscores the difficulties we face trying to create meaningful oversight in the AI-assisted battles of the future. Of course the first use of autonomous weapons on the battlefield won’t announce itself with a press release, he says, because if the weapons work as they’re supposed to, they won’t look at all out of the ordinary. “The problem is autonomy is, at core, a matter of programming,” he says. “The Kargu-2 used autonomously will look exactly like a Kargu-2 used manually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CP27Ek"&gt;Elke Schwarz, a senior lecturer in political theory at Queen Mary University London who’s affiliated with the International Committee for Robot Arms Control, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that discussions like this show we need to move beyond “slippery and political” debates about definitions and focus on the specific functionality of these systems. What do they do and how do they do it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WXPh02"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“there is critical mass building amongst nations and international organizations to push for a ban”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h9J8gM"&gt;“I think we really have to think about the bigger picture [...] which is why I focus on the practice, as well as functionality,” says Schwarz. “In my work I try and show that the use of these types of systems is very likely to exacerbate violent action as an ‘easier’ choice. And, as you rightly point out, errors will very likely prevail [...] which will likely be addressed only post hoc.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uv3Y3w"&gt;Schwarz says that despite the myriad difficulties, in terms of both drafting regulation and pushing back against the enthusiasm of militaries around the world to integrate AI into weaponry, “there is critical mass building amongst nations and international organizations to push for a ban for systems that have the capacity to autonomously identify, select and attack targets.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXTFvi"&gt;Indeed, the UN is still &lt;a href="https://dig.watch/process/gge-laws"&gt;conducting a review&lt;/a&gt; into possible regulations for LAWS, with results due to be reported later this year. As Schwarz says: “With this news story having made the rounds, now is a great time to mobilize the international community toward awareness and action.”&lt;/p&gt;
