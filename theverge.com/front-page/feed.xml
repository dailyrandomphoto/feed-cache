    <title>Sony’s WH-1000XM3 are a great deal at $190</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vdkYWH"&gt;There’s a fantastic discount happening on the previous generation Sony WH-1000XM3 wireless, noise-canceling headphones at Best Buy. Originally $350 (but usually around $250 or so these days), &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743780474724360893#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get them for $190 new&lt;/a&gt;. While these lack some niceties found in the newer XM4 model (concurrent Bluetooth connections, auto play / pause when you remove them or put them on), the package is overall similar in terms of nailing the fundamentals. These have great battery life, USB-C charging, among the best noise cancellation effect around, and sound quality that’s tough to beat at this price. In addition, these come with a zip-up case that makes them easy to stow. I bought these in 2018 and am still patting myself on the back for that decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="dLWHsU"&gt;Nintendo’s limited-edition Game &amp;amp; Watch handheld is $10 off at B&amp;amp;H Photo, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594162-REG%2Fnintendo_hxasraaaa_game_watch_super.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F30%2F22557070%2Fsony-wh1000xm3-headphones-nintendo-game-watch-jbl-charge-4-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing $40 instead of $50&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth picking up if you want easy access to classic games like the original &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Super Mario Bros. 2&lt;/em&gt;, and a Mario-themed version of &lt;em&gt;Ball&lt;/em&gt;. The handheld itself is more technologically impressive than original Game &amp;amp; Watch consoles, with a color LCD screen and USB-C charging.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tIxHDb"&gt;If you love both retro Neogeo games and modern fighting games, Neogeo’s Arcade Stick Pro seems like it was made just for you. Normally $150 on Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fneogeo-arcade-stick-pro-controller-pack%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_3_7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get it on Woot for $120&lt;/a&gt;. You can connect it to a TV via HDMI to play 20 built-in games, or simply use the device as a gamepad for any game that supports that kind of input. It works while connected to a Nintendo Switch, and it includes a USB adapter to work on PlayStation consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xxy7hB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10630903"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="dGdhbL"&gt;
&lt;p id="c1tJOY"&gt;Summer is here, and if you’re in need of a Bluetooth speaker that sports long battery life and a waterproof design for the beach or a poolside party, check out JBL’s Charge 4. It can last up to 20 hours on a charge (and can charge a device with its USB-C port), and it has IPX7 water and dust resistance. Originally $180, you can get the red-colored speaker for $110 at B&amp;amp;H Photo.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to block and report text spam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4L-IfKtQ76K7Il4nXctrhDAQtl4=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69520154/texting_lumia.0.1437583471.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xS9Cl4"&gt;Spam texts can be incredibly irritating — you get a notification and stop what you’re doing to check your phone, only to find somebody is trying to sell you something you don’t want. How can you prevent it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cz3VXk"&gt;Unfortunately, there are no absolutes in preventing text spam. But there are some ways you can at least minimize the number of spam texts that get through. Here are some strategies to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kZBYfb"&gt;Do not answer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6jYMm1"&gt;Top of the list is — as you probably already know — never reply to a spam text, and never &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; click on a link within a spam text. If you’re not sure whether a text is spam or legitimate, hold off on replying until you’ve done a bit of research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6qez8i"&gt;Use the spam filter on your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rIeftn"&gt;Android phones and iPhones have spam-filtering features that you can enable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NuvT8Q"&gt;If you have an Android phone:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aZycxQ"&gt;Open the Messages app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Aitn1H"&gt;Click on the three dots in the upper-right corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AcwIN3"&gt;Select “Settings” &amp;gt; “Spam protection”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Qw3pYw"&gt;Make sure “Enable spam protection” is toggled on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="LIp4DO"&gt;If you want to see what numbers you’ve marked as spam, you can go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Spam &amp;amp; blocked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To set up spam blocking, go to “Settings” &amp;amp;gt; “Spam protection.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FXwdP2ahVxd3OAOhvklYwpyG92s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688826/Screenshot_20210629_115526.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Spam protection.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle on “Enable spam protection.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N95yPCbJSuhETaseeQ-cGaSctgw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688921/Screenshot_20210629_115223.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle on “Enable spam protection.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Bhbi4Z"&gt;If you have an iPhone:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lVIqKL"&gt;Apple’s spam blocking is a little more basic than Android’s: it blocks phone numbers that you &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099"&gt;don’t have saved in your contacts list&lt;/a&gt; and haven’t been in contact with before, which could be an issue (say, if you’re expecting a call from a car service). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mT9Wfz"&gt;Open the Settings app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cON9RE"&gt;Scroll down to and select “Messages” &amp;gt; “Unknown &amp;amp; Spam”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9DWUaL"&gt;Toggle on “Filter Unknown Senders”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Scroll down to “Unknown &amp;amp;amp; Spam.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQ5MN3_pe8P_1cEcmcKEuXpe4ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688833/IMG_DE165A8C72D3_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scroll down to “Unknown &amp;amp; Spam.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle on “Filter Unknown Senders.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/54lBOdOA3HP0fjky5doQXJanBug=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688834/ios_spam_filter.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle on “Filter Unknown Senders.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OAOftX"&gt;Block specific texts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CPlAZi"&gt;When you get a spam text, you can block that individual number from contacting you again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CHYvJs"&gt;If you have an Android phone: &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="y9iZCr"&gt;When you tap on a message that Android tags as suspicious, the OS will often give you the opportunity to report it as spam (or verify that it’s not spam). But if you get a spam text that wasn’t flagged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YMRXxv"&gt;Tap the three dots in the upper-right corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gj3lEy"&gt;Select “Details” &amp;gt; “Block &amp;amp; report spam”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wNHf6y"&gt;You can just block that number if you want, or you can check “Report spam” to send the number to Google and possibly your carrier as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JC7myw"&gt;Note that this process can differ depending on which Android phone you’re using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android often gives you the chance to report spam." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r9JTEBdcapOnyMcpc-0VoQVCoi4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688787/Screenshot_20210629_114432__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android often gives you the chance to report spam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can just block a spam text, or you can report it to Google." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e_t3PKQ43dotIaSJBmoDsb5TSrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689083/Screenshot_20210629_103221__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can just block a spam text, or you can report it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EdU9wB"&gt;If you have an iPhone:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9x3Rtt"&gt;Open the spam text and select the user icon on top of the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BjzvjY"&gt;Tap on the “info” icon and then on the “info” button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pWO3eN"&gt;Select “Block this Caller”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “info” and then click “info” again on the next page." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vbBVda0Q1NfpFBAFWsQOixyVK0E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689118/IMG_FEEE7B27517F_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “info” and then click “info” again on the next page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="At the bottom of the page, select “Block this Caller.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9plBrvQdpfvsj0mGwCG1R6X9FDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689119/IMG_ED1CBC48272A_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the bottom of the page, select “Block this Caller.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H2JCJ1"&gt;If you want to report an iMessage that you received as spam, then look for the “Report Junk” link under the message, tap it, tap “Delete,” and then “Report Junk.” Note that this doesn’t automatically block that phone number; you’ll have to do that separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AEFlot"&gt;Forward the text to 7726&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F8kP0O"&gt;If you’re using one of the major carriers (Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, or T-Mobile), you can report a spam text by forwarding it to 7726. (Note that this spells “SPAM” on your phone keyboard.) This may also work with other carriers; to find out if it’s possible, check with your carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hHZUy1"&gt;This isn’t just a US thing, by the way. Ofcom, which regulates the UK’s communications services, &lt;a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/problems/tackling-nuisance-calls-and-messages/spam-texts"&gt;also accepts reports of spam texts&lt;/a&gt; forwarded to 7726.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rxUjrU"&gt;Block spam using your carrier’s services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4EbKlM"&gt;Most major carriers these days offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327304/spam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android"&gt;spam-blocking services for phone calls&lt;/a&gt;, and these can carry over to texts. Carrier sites will offer details about free and for-pay security services offered by &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/security/security-apps/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fplans-features%2Fblock-unwanted-calls&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22555521%2Fspam-text-block-security-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/call-filter/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;; if you use a different carrier, check its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AbbBTq"&gt;Use a third-party spam-blocking service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cz49nD"&gt;If you’re really frustrated and the above strategies aren’t working for you, you can try using a third-party anti-spam service. These are not free. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.robokiller.com/"&gt;RoboKiller&lt;/a&gt; costs $4.99 a month or $39.99 a year after a seven-day trial, while &lt;a href="https://nomorobo.com/"&gt;Nomorobo&lt;/a&gt; costs $1.99 per month per device after a 14-day trial. If you do decide you need a third-party service, you can use the trial to see if it works for you before committing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s Mini LED TVs to release in the US starting in July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kqTZTekFcsJkJVlsFbhVgsF5iRM=/0x108:1863x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69522668/LG_8K_QNED_Mini_LED_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s Mini LED use an array of thousands of tiny LEDs as a backlight.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="98Wumc"&gt;LG’s new range of Mini LED TVs, which it’s branding “QNED,” are releasing worldwide starting next month, the &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/06/now-rolling-out-worldwide-lg-qned-mini-led-tv-sets-new-standard-for-lcd-picture-quality/"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The lineup consists of three sets, the 8K QNED99 and QNED95, and the 4K QNED90, ranging in size from 65- to 86-inches. LG says the TVs will launch first in North America, with additional regions following “in the weeks ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyb1U3"&gt;Mini LED is a relatively new kind of display technology which uses an array of thousands of tiny LEDs as a screen’s backlight. Because there are so many (up to 30,000 in the case of the 86-inch QNED99), they can create a sharper contrast between light and dark areas of an image. LG says the technology, which has previously been used on some TVs from TCL as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;Apple’s latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, allows for “10 times better contrast ratio” than normal LCD TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DvSRJb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not to be confused with MicroLED&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FFUqy9"&gt;LG is marketing Mini LED as a “giant leap forward in LCD TV picture quality,” but it’s not quite at the level of an OLED TV, where its the individual pixels themselves that are illuminating to create an image (with Mini LED, the LEDs are still shining through an LCD layer). Mini LED should not be confused with Samsung’s outrageously expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18168793/samsungs-75-inch-microled-4k-tv-pitcure-quality-ces-2019"&gt;MicroLED&lt;/a&gt; technology, which also uses an array of tiny LEDs but without the need for an LCD layer at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpaZpo"&gt;We’ve reached out to LG to clarify pricing for its full lineup of QNED TVs (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fqned-mini-led-tv&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F30%2F22556962%2Flg-mini-led-qned-tvs-release-date-usa-july" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s US site&lt;/a&gt; still lists them as “coming soon”) but based on a previous report &lt;a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1612506923"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;FlatPanelsHD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; they’re unlikely to come cheap. The 8K QNED99 will reportedly start at $5,000 for the 75-inch model, rising to $8,000 for the 86-inch version, while the 4K QNED90 will reportedly cost up to $4,000 for the 86-inch model. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple isn’t backing down from its hybrid work model, according to internal note</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jc9msMcOm5mdjtNGvste1f9dXpM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521850/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UfXTiO"&gt;Apple isn’t backing down from its hybrid work model that will require most employees to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Fully remote positions will be extremely limited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fST2ny"&gt;“We believe that in-person collaboration is essential to our culture and our future,” said Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of retail and people, in a video recording viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If we take a moment to reflect on our unbelievable product launches this past year, the products and the launch execution were built upon the base of years of work that we did when we were all together in-person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiBoeB"&gt;The news comes nearly a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook sent out an email&lt;/a&gt; telling employees the company was rolling out a new work model that would require them to return to in-office work on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays starting in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLC88B"&gt;In the wake of that announcement, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;Apple employees wrote a letter&lt;/a&gt; saying some employees had been forced to quit because of the policy, and asking Cook to change his stance. They asked that all teams be given the option to work remotely, noting “without the inclusivity that flexibility brings, many of us feel we have to choose between either a combination of our families, our well-being, and being empowered to do our best work, or being a part of Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agQ9e0"&gt;Now, Apple is essentially denying that request, saying any remote work decisions will be made “on a case-by-case basis with any new remote positions requiring executive approval.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iiEsmz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom acquires an AI company building real-time translation</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KwQpF0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-to-acquire-kites-gmbh/"&gt;Zoom has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s acquiring a company known as Kites (short for Karlsruhe Information Technology Solutions), which has worked on creating real-time translation and transcription software. Zoom says the acquisition is a move to help it make communicating with people who speak different languages easier, and that it’s looking to add translation capabilities to its video conferencing app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCEVrd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kites.ai/"&gt;According to its site&lt;/a&gt;, Kites began at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and its technology was originally developed to &lt;a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2020-10-ai-outperforms-humans-speech-recognition.html"&gt;act as in-classroom translation&lt;/a&gt; for students who needed help understanding the English or German their professors were lecturing in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1LvAY"&gt;Zoom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300740/zoom-live-transcription-closed-captions-accessibility-free-accounts"&gt;already has real-time transcriptions&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s limited to people who are talking in English. &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207279736-Closed-captioning-and-live-transcription"&gt;On a support page&lt;/a&gt;, Zoom also makes it clear that its current live transcription feature may not meet certain accuracy requirements. The company says it’s considering opening a research center in Germany, where the Kites team will be staying.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku launches its new originals with a Demi Lovato talk show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hVveFmLJbF_BmIAo2D6MtrT-EPY=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521611/image002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Demi Lovato Show will debut July 30th.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HZ7nt2"&gt;The first of a dozen-plus Roku Originals to premiere on the Roku Channel will kick off July 30th with &lt;em&gt;The Demi Lovato Show&lt;/em&gt;, a series that had originally been slated for a debut on Quibi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqCtrC"&gt;The show will now launch as Roku’s first “original” to land on the Roku Channel, the platform’s free and ad-supported streaming offering. While originally intended for Quibi, the show will be brand new to audiences when it arrives on the Roku Channel this week. Each episode will be 10 minutes long, feature a celebrity guest, and will cover topics as wide-ranging as UFOs, activism, mental health, gender identity, and police reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3Bmr3"&gt;In a statement, Lovato said that they have “never been one to shy away from speaking candidly about things.” The show had previously been announced as &lt;em&gt;Pillow Talk with Demi Lovato&lt;/em&gt; on Quibi, though it never aired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkXKmg"&gt;Roku swiped much of Quibi’s library after the service finally folded and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/roku-wisely-rebrands-its-soon-to-debut-quibi-content-as-1846733852"&gt;announced in April&lt;/a&gt; that it would rebrand the haul as Roku Originals. The company further said at the time that some 75 titles would stream on the Roku Channel as free and ad-supported content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t98EJA"&gt;A spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that while some of these earlier released shows technically &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/06/roku-originals-quibi-streaming-one-billion-1234777771/"&gt;made their way&lt;/a&gt; to the Roku Channel in May, others have not been previously released, including this one. That makes &lt;em&gt;The Demi Lovato Show&lt;/em&gt; the first Roku Original debuting on The Roku Channel to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpSAq4"&gt;It’s almost as if Quibi never truly left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSOmb1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this article used pronouns other than Lovato’s preferred “they/them.” We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp’s Spanish language content moderators push for equal pay in internal letter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YKBqYiWvTj3CCD1y2yehE18-pks=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521541/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Skp3S8"&gt;WhatsApp’s Spanish language content moderators and customer service representatives are pushing the company for equal pay, according to an internal letter obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. They say they’ve been excluded from a $2 per hour premium paid to other bilingual contractors. The workers are employed by Accenture, a third-party contracting firm, in Austin, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzDFhj"&gt;“For several years now, Accenture, Facebook, and Whatsapp have denied equal treatment and pay to Spanish language Contingent Workers,” employees say in the letter. “It is an insult for companies like Facebook and Accenture to publicly champion diversity, but yet fail to deliver this to its own workers.” Accenture classifies much of its workforce as contingent, meaning employees are hired as contractors for a specific period of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypL2YK"&gt;Workers are demanding that Spanish language contractors receive the $2 premium, as well as backpay for the money they missed out on since they were hired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sOKoUv"&gt;One worker says they were told they’d need to learn Arabic or Portuguese in order to receive the premium. “I’m already bilingual,” the employee says they responded, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Still, the policy didn’t change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFxCgS"&gt;The letter was sent to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, WhatsApp CEO Will Cathcart, and Accenture CEO Julie Sweet. It was posted today on Workplace, Facebook’s internal communications platform. It currently has 89 signatures from Facebook, WhatsApp, and Accenture employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zv6SWe"&gt;The letter came after workers pushed for years to have equal pay, according to the internal letter. “Managers and HR reps for Accenture in Austin, Texas have not only ignored the complaints of discrimination for several years now, but they also actively engaged in ensuring this gross injustice go unacknowledged and unaddressed,” the note says. “We say this blatant act of racism and discrimination towards its own essential workers needs to end now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KA4V1z"&gt;Facebook content moderators at Accenture’s Austin office &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497789/facebook-content-moderators-accenture-return-office-coronavirus"&gt;were asked to come back to the office during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. Many said they feared for their safety and felt the company hadn’t adequately addressed their concerns. These employees are often among the lowest paid Facebook workers, and make roughly $18.50 an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFSCiv"&gt;Accenture’s Spanish speaking customer service reps say they make as little as $16.50 an hour. “Accenture is the Walmart of the tech industry,” an employee tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Most of us have to have two jobs to survive. We get paid $16.50 an hour. That’s not a livable wage in Austin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSsf8P"&gt;Facebook and Accenture did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sen. Warren calls for ‘meticulous’ review of Amazon’s MGM acquisition </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Votes On Whether To Advance For The People Act" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JncTv_4zwCDFJMMAkppOOc7QXGE=/0x0:7280x4853/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521454/1233598960.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) speaks with reporters on her way to a lunch with Senate Democrats at the U.S. Capitol on June 22, 2021 in Washington, DC.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CMfawC"&gt;Senator Elizabeth Warren is calling on the Federal Trade Commission for a thorough review of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22441644/amazon-mgm-acquisition-prime-video-subscription-service-james-bond"&gt;Amazon’s bid to acquire MGM&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that the deal could harm consumers and may have anticompetitive effects in the streaming space and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Ilu4t"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689724/Letter_to_FTC_re_Amazon_MGM_Deal.pdf"&gt;In a letter&lt;/a&gt; addressed to newly sworn-in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;FTC chair Lina Khan&lt;/a&gt; and shared exclusively with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Warren urged the FTC to specifically and closely examine “the possible anticompetitive effects this deal will have on streaming services and entertainment products in addition to the broader impacts that this transaction may have on workers, small businesses, and competition overall as Amazon—which already dominates numerous markets—accelerates its aggressive monopolistic behavior.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2qoUE"&gt;The FTC is said to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546106/ftc-investigation-amazon-mgm-acquisition"&gt;reviewing the deal&lt;/a&gt; as part of a larger antitrust investigation of Amazon’s business. In her letter to Khan, Warren cited Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act as barring mergers for which the outcome “may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.” Warren argued that because Amazon’s economic impact is so far-reaching — including but not limited to its services business — a deal that benefits its streaming service Prime Video will only strengthen its position in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VEA380"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Warren argues the deal could hurt consumers and competition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="70gjaM"&gt;Amazon has a limited footprint in the film industry, but it will have a number of advantages as it enters the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pyAco"&gt;The company’s deep pockets put the company in a virtually unmatched position to invest heavily to strengthen its position in the streaming wars. Moreover, Prime Video is offered as one of many services that are technically “perks” rather than individual paid subscriptions. New offerings like exclusive content serve to boost the appeal of Amazon’s paid Prime subscription service, which costs $119 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="him8Uj"&gt;Amazon announced in May that it had reached a deal to acquire the legacy film studio for $8.45 billion. At the time, SVP of Prime Video and Amazon Studios Mike Hopkins said that Amazon was drawn to MGM because of “the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM’s talented team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a79exp"&gt;In her letter, however, Warren wrote that the company’s “tactic to operate at a financial loss and use low prices to lure in customers and capture the market has worked before, and the FTC must determine whether this vertical acquisition is truly an entertainment strategy or merely another step towards unfettered monopolization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtuRmh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>United’s latest jets will offer Bluetooth for in-flight entertainment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NdgPYdElk5WDA3pMxTiWWDoMt8k=/313x0:3688x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521351/Interior_IFE_Rendering.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: United&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EhOGef"&gt;United Airlines is adding a long-awaited feature to the in-flight entertainment seatback screens of its new Boeing 737 Max 8 jets — support for Bluetooth headphones. The company &lt;a href="https://hub.united.com/united-adds-270-boeing-and-airbus-aircraft-to-fleet-largest-order-in-airline-s-history-and-biggest-by-a-single-carrier-in-a-decade-2653586391.html"&gt;is making the upgrade as part of “United Next”&lt;/a&gt;, a new plan to expand and modernize its fleet with what it says are larger, fuel-efficient jets and a more comfortable in-flight experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCoXsd"&gt;I haven’t flown in the last two years — for reasons that are hopefully obvious — but the thing that grinds most of my past flying experience to a halt is dealing with the bizarre two-pronged audio jacks airplanes use for inflight audio. Having headphones with a 3.5mm audio jack isn’t hard, but it doesn’t reflect the Bluetooth audio lifestyle, Apple, and plenty of other tech companies have slowly forced me to adopt. I don’t like the wireless audio freak I’ve become, but it happened, which makes United’s upgrades so exciting, as demoed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AirlineFlyer/status/1409916190445670405?s=20"&gt;in the tweets below&lt;/a&gt; from aviation writer Jason Rabinowitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0muG5Z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The main attraction of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/united?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@united&lt;/a&gt;'s new interior is the new &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PanasonicAero?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@PanasonicAero&lt;/a&gt; seatback IFE system. It finally offers one of the overall most requested passenger items: BLUETOOTH AUDIO. Narrowbody aircraft with these screens will finally make it a reality. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PaxEx?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PaxEx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/tD004G4x7c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tD004G4x7c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Rabinowitz (@AirlineFlyer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AirlineFlyer/status/1409916190445670405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tD5U5r"&gt;Adding seatback screens made a huge difference in how tolerable flying is, but it’s been held up by lagging audio support that &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20982261/airpods-in-flight-entertainment-bluetooth-adapter-twelvesouth-airfly-pro-review-price"&gt;has even written a guide&lt;/a&gt; to getting around. And this isn’t a problem unique to United. Other airlines like Delta or JetBlue have been offering seatback screens for years, but have also saddled flyers with analog audio. United just might be one of the first airlines to start the next wave of inflight entertainment improvements (hopefully).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMAFgy"&gt;However, there’s room for things to go a bit sideways. As part of its upgrades, United’s new 737 Max 8 jets offer 10 or 13-inch inflight entertainment screens on the backs of all seats, which might mean a lot of people trying to connect to Bluetooth at once. That could cause interference, and might also make the process of connecting your headphones more of a chore if you’re having to hunt through multiple devices trying to pair in the same menu. United currently only offers Bluetooth on its Max 8 jets which it says should start flying this summer. The company didn’t share how it plans to address issues with Bluetooth, but said it’s still “studying the technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8X0Iu"&gt;I can’t rightfully claim that Bluetooth is as meaningful a change as more legroom or safer flights, but for an airline industry hoarding cash &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21363675/delta-america-united-airlines-layoffs-cash-covid-19-losses-loans-cares-act"&gt;to make it through the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and looking to entice frequent flyers to earn their miles again, any snazzy new feature can’t hurt. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Twitter bug temporarily removed the option to switch to the chronological feed on the web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_kKNyOL4GiS4IiwA2qBqjxVpuSQ=/0x0:1125x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521285/IMG_1908.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our friend, for whom we feared the worst today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uFD8P2"&gt;Twitter has fixed a bug that left some of us horrified when we opened the site (as is often the case, but for different reasons) — those viewing the social network in a web browser found that they &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/29/twitter-ditching-latest-chronological-feed-option-on-the-web-still-available-on-ios-for-now/"&gt;no longer had the option to switch between&lt;/a&gt; the algorithmic view and the reverse-chronological one. The algorithmic view, which shows tweets out of order, has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18145089/twitter-latest-tweets-toggle-ranked-feed-timeline-algorithm"&gt;much maligned since it first appeared&lt;/a&gt;, and the bug on Tuesday &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/killedbygoogle/status/1409976275440185354?s=20"&gt;had people worried&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter was finally starting to force it on everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeIaKm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1409983835245326336?s=19"&gt;Twitter’s support account says&lt;/a&gt; that web users should be able to change their timeline order again, and a few of us at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;have confirmed that the button is back on our timelines. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1409981506055929857?s=20"&gt;Twitter product lead Kayvon Beykpour&lt;/a&gt; called the toggle’s disappearance a “bug,” reiterating what a company spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cntMqD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tweets in chronological order on web has been fixed –– the option to switch your Home timeline view to latest Tweets first was removed for some of you on web. We’ve fixed this and the option should now be available again for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1409983835245326336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gSqZZh"&gt;Adding to the confusion, Twitter’s &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-timeline"&gt;page explaining the timeline&lt;/a&gt; has a bullet saying that switching between top tweets (aka tweets served up algorithmically) and latest tweets is a feature that’s only available on iOS and Android. Some took this to mean that the option was really going away, but it turns out that the line has been there for years, &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190203140705/https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-timeline"&gt;according to the WayBack Machine&lt;/a&gt;. It’s possible the line is just a holdover from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18145089/twitter-latest-tweets-toggle-ranked-feed-timeline-algorithm"&gt;when the “sparkle” button was first introduced&lt;/a&gt;, because it conflicts with information that shows up later in the article: Twitter includes instructions on how to change your timeline order for the web at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CKdSQmJDV6InO9pm2Qg1Fc1BuQ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689668/Screen_Shot_2021_06_29_at_2.39.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-timeline" target="_blank"&gt;Instructions: Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter’s instructions for changing your timeline direction on web, Android, and iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ogjqta"&gt;If Twitter has a plan for doing away with the option to view a chronological timeline, it doesn’t seem like it’ll be carrying it out today. For some, that news may come as a mixed bag — maybe being forced to use an algorithmic timeline was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/status/1409967220650692609?s=20"&gt;the best way to kick a bad habit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fYXW7N"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Extremely glad that Twitter removed the "Latest Tweets" option and is forcing everyone to use their algorithm because now I will spend way less time on Twitter&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1409949383362289669?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
