    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HkjjGN"&gt;Facebook parent company Meta is adding updates to its bug bounty program for products from its metaverse division &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse"&gt;Reality Labs&lt;/a&gt;, including its Quest 2, Portal, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses&lt;/a&gt;, the company announced Friday. The work will play an important role in its “journey to help build the metaverse,” according to a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgOMpR"&gt;The press release emphasized that verified Ray-Ban Stories bug submissions are eligible for awards, which it’s hoping will incentivize more researchers to “analyze the glasses and our other hardware devices.” The minimum award for discovering a bug is $500, and the amounts increase depending on the device and the potential impact of the bug discovered. The biggest payout listed is $30,000 but could go even higher at the company’s discretion, for bugs that could potentially result in health, safety, or privacy risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8elnxZ"&gt;Meta offered a list of hypothetical bugs and what the payouts could look like: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="r1KcJC"&gt;An issue that would allow a malicious third-party application to inject content that is then consumed by a first-party application, such as pictures to a slideshow or audio to a call, would receive a ~$1,000 payout under the “Issues caused by potentially malicious third-party apps”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYbAZi"&gt;A third-party app gaining microphone access without requesting it on a Quest device would receive a $5,000 payout under “Unauthorized mic access by third-party app.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yTLRtN"&gt;A third-party application on Quest that is able to crash or disable Guardian would receive a $3,000 payout under “DoS” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glLAF5"&gt;Remote code execution through a buffer overflow in the Quest voice chat library, getting execution in a privileged first-party application would receive a $16,000 payout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cbdUFd"&gt;The company first established its bug bounty program in 2011 and says it’s been instrumental in helping it find and fix bugs, with nearly $2 million in awards paid to security researchers last year alone, according to a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/11/bug-bounty-program-10th-anniversary/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from company security engineering manager Dan Gurfinkel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQZi4d"&gt;The complete list of payouts and guidelines can be &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/payout_guidelines/hardware"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKWXt0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla leak reveals all-in-one ‘Superhorn’ for Model 3 and Y</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Model Y" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l_Zi41MATnubH0myWOiKUX7Q8tY=/418x0:3582x2109/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70255430/0x0_Model_Y_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QdYCxi"&gt;Tesla may be adding new hardware components to its upcoming 2022 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles — including a new all-in-one “Superhorn” that combines a horn, alarm, and loudspeaker. This feature and more was revealed (&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/12/08/tesla-model-3-y-new-features-changes-leak/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) in a leaked document on German-speaking Tesla forum &lt;a href="https://tff-forum.de/t/model-3-model-y-technische-veraenderungen-und-details/100784/641"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dr1ErC"&gt;The listed component changes presented in the document appear to be meant for the eyes of European regulators. Tesla generally does not line up new features with model years as closely as most other manufacturers. For instance, the company started adding its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18511594/tesla-new-self-driving-chip-is-here-and-this-is-your-best-look-yet"&gt;new full self-driving computer&lt;/a&gt; (HW3) to cars in April 2019. Then, in September of that year, it began including an &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2019/09/10/tesla-pedestrian-warning-system-model-3/"&gt;external speaker&lt;/a&gt; under Model 3 bumpers (to comply with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/16/13651106/electric-car-noise-nhtsa-rule-blind-pedestrian-safety"&gt;legislation&lt;/a&gt; requiring electric vehicles to be equipped with a pedestrian warning system).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTdi22"&gt;That external speaker add-in was a component of Tesla’s Acoustic Vehicle Alerting System (AVAS), which emits sounds to warn nearby inattentive pedestrians (due to electric vehicles being relatively quiet compared to internal combustion engine vehicles). The company, known for its quirky novelties, later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/25/22199963/tesla-holiday-update-fart-sound-horn-goat-boombox"&gt;added new sounds&lt;/a&gt; that blast from the external speaker after honking the horn — including goat bleats and fart rips.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2p_u_UPm9RaoJs7kxTw8fpQ-yjs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23078502/tesla_eu_add_ons.001.jpeg.001.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: TFF Forum user eivissa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The leaked document also shows another LG battery variant for the Model 3 Performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rNcsg8"&gt;The new part is set to replace the current system, listed as “Superhorn (3-in-1 horn, alarm, speaker) AVAS version” — which alludes to simplifying the number of speaker parts the car uses. The component may contain a single speaker or a combination of speakers that can output the AVAS sounds, honk, and play the Sentry Mode alarm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Xf4Vk"&gt;It could also discourage unsafe modifications — some electric vehicle owners prefer silence in motion and have disconnected pedestrian warning speakers, including owners of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHWT8VqnRGo"&gt;Nissan Leafs&lt;/a&gt; and some Teslas. With the new all-in-one AVAS speaker, disconnecting it could mean disabling the horn as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUkzjD"&gt;The list also reveals that the Model 3 and Model Y will toss their legacy lead-acid batteries aside for 15.5V lithium-ion versions (along with refreshed accessories like a new windshield pump compatible with the new voltage). Tesla already made a &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/02/02/tesla-model-s-x-get-rid-lead-acid-12v-battery-moves-li-ion/"&gt;similar&lt;/a&gt; change to the new 2021 Model S and Model X. Other notable changes include a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21377981/tesla-radar-sensor-child-hot-car-fcc"&gt;new cabin radar&lt;/a&gt; and infrared camera for Model Y, laminated rear door windows, and a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462660/amd-tesla-model-x-s-plaid-ryzen-radeon-rdna-2"&gt;infotainment computer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New social media transparency bill would force Facebook to open up to researchers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) speaks during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SyqqllZdtjcPx9Ww5s2vcoVCn4Q=/0x0:5015x3343/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70255424/1237080101.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CHEoH3"&gt;A bipartisan group of US senators have announced a new bill that would require social media companies to share platform data with independent researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wOe2t"&gt;The bill was announced Thursday by Democratic senators Chris Coons (D-DE), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and also Rob Portman (R-OH), a Republican. Named the &lt;a href="https://www.coons.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/text_pata_117.pdf"&gt;Platform Accountability and Transparency Act&lt;/a&gt; (PATA), it would establish new rules compelling social media platforms to share data with “qualified researchers,” defined as university-affiliated researchers pursuing projects that have been approved by the National Science Foundation (NSF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NFS1wU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“this legislation would provide a real pathway for researchers to better understand online harms”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="245Gdr"&gt;Under the terms of the bill, platforms would be bound to comply with requests for data once research was approved by the NSF. Failing to provide data to a qualifying project would result in the platform losing the immunities provided by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzlpCu"&gt;“The PATA act is a truly comprehensive platform transparency proposal,” said Laura Edelson, a PhD candidate at NYU Tandon School of Engineering and lead researcher at NYU’s &lt;a href="https://cybersecurityfordemocracy.org/"&gt;Cybersecurity for Democracy&lt;/a&gt; project, in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If passed this legislation would provide a real pathway for researchers to better understand online harms and start coming up with solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJyqOS"&gt;Earlier this year, Edelson and other researchers at the NYU Ad Observatory project were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609020/facebook-bans-academic-researchers-ad-transparency-misinformation-nyu-ad-observatory-plug-in"&gt;banned from Facebook&lt;/a&gt; after the platform alleged that their research violated terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DsHsdQ"&gt;The PATA bill is the latest in a long line of proposed legislation aimed at peering into the black box of social media algorithms. The 2019 Filter Bubble Transparency Act &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20943634/senate-filter-bubble-transparency-act-algorithm-personalization-targeting-bill"&gt;took a swing at algorithmic content distribution&lt;/a&gt;, theoretically mandating that users be allowed to opt out of news feed and search personalization. In 2020, another bipartisan bill, the Platform Accountability and Consumer Transparency (PACT) Act, also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302170/facebook-google-brian-schatz-john-thune-section-230-content-moderation"&gt;proposed amendments to Section 230&lt;/a&gt; as a means to hold platforms more accountable for content moderation decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKGTil"&gt;While neither of those bills passed, the latest bill comes in a moment when social media companies in general, and Facebook in particular, come under increased scrutiny in the wake of testimony from whistleblower Frances Haugen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2sMEz"&gt;While documents leaked by Haugen revealed extensive details about the inner workings of the company, some of the most damaging material was research showing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"&gt;that Facebook’s products could be harmful to children and teens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMIlc1"&gt;Earlier this week, Instagram head Adam Mosseri &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22816730/mosseri-testimony-instagram-senate-hearing-haugen-child-safety-facebook-meta"&gt;appeared before a Senate Commerce subcommittee&lt;/a&gt; to answer questions about whether the photo-sharing app was harmful to the mental health of young users. At that hearing, senators from both sides of the aisle expressed deep frustration at a perceived lack of action on longstanding safety issues from Instagram and its parent company, Meta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NeG9Si"&gt;“Some of the big tech companies have said ‘Trust us’,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) to Mosseri &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/08/1062576576/instagrams-ceo-adam-mosseri-hears-senators-brush-aside-his-promises-to-self-poli"&gt;per &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; reporting&lt;/a&gt;. “That seems to be what Instagram is saying in your testimony but self-policing depends on trust. The trust is gone.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Redditors are spamming Kellogg’s job portal to support striking workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kellogg Union Workers Continue Strike For Second Week" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TOC8zCO4KNTy061DEcsdAMJJscU=/0x0:2736x1824/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70255347/1236053125.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tutDQj"&gt;Reddit’s r/antiwork is typically filled with horror stories that make you want to quit not just your own job but strangers’ jobs, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBXGqP"&gt;“My boss suggested I might not be able to take forty minutes to see my daughters [sic] first ever school play, so I told him try not to be a cartoon villain and he hung up on me,” reads one post from earlier this month. “That’s permission to take the whole afternoon off, right?” the post concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmqhU1"&gt;The underlying ethos of r/antiwork isn’t just to be a place to vent—it’s to push back on the idea of work as we know it. So it might seem counterintuitive that on Thursday, a thread blew up that was urging members to apply for jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAIadk"&gt;The jobs in question are permanent positions at Kellogg’s cereal plants in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, and Tennessee. The goal was to overwhelm the system with fake applications, making it a nightmare for recruiters to sort through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NSacve"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s very easy to empathize with the Kellogg’s workers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbO5NB"&gt;Members of r/antiwork were aligning with the 1,400 Kellogg’s workers who went on strike more than two months ago over stalled union negotiations with the company. Kellogg’s &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/07/1062240467/kellogg-to-hire-replacements-for-striking-workers-who-rejected-a-proposed-contra"&gt;announced this week&lt;/a&gt; that it would hire permanent replacement workers after those on strike voted to reject a tentative agreement with management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBuBsn"&gt;“It’s very easy to empathize with the Kellogg’s workers,” says Kevin McKenzie, a moderator of r/antiwork. Hearing Kellogg’s workers talk about being overworked, being paid low wages, and having a poor work-life balance resonates with others, he says. “It lights a fire in the community, and you get ideas like this that spring up and get supported.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1PHO2"&gt;Kellogg’s didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ermDn"&gt;Threads on r/antiwork compile timelines of the Kellogg strike, lists of products made by Kellogg to boycott, and links to the jobs that would replace striking workers. At the time of writing, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rcacru/apply_now_kellogg_is_hiring_scabs_online_lets/"&gt;the main thread&lt;/a&gt; encouraging subreddit members to flood the system with fake applications had more than 62,000 upvotes and thousands of comments. In another, members share tips on how to use features like autofill to submit applications faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="qSXtET"&gt;&lt;q&gt;r/antiwork has grown by 279% in membership between 2020 and 2021, now home to 1.3 million members&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W0t7pp"&gt;The striking workers are aware of the efforts, says Corrina Christensen, director of communications for the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers’ International Union, which represents the Kellogg’s employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyXRRD"&gt;“It’s phenomenal,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w58oGu"&gt;Earlier this week, Reddit &lt;a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-recap-2021-community-reflections"&gt;highlighted r/antiwork&lt;/a&gt; as being “the poster child for the great resignation.” According to the company, the subreddit has grown by 279 percent in membership between 2020 and 2021, now home to 1.3 million members. The fourth most upvoted post of 2021 was a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/q82vqk/quit_my_job_last_night_it_was_nice_to_be_home_to/"&gt;thread on r/antiwork&lt;/a&gt; of someone unceremoniously quitting their job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="et15Ov"&gt;Any organizing around flashpoints like the Kellogg’s strike is member-driven, says McKenzie. McKenzie is a graduate social work student in South Carolina who says the philosophy of antiwork resonates with him personally: he holds down multiple jobs and internships while in school, and at times, work has taken over his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRBZSj"&gt;“That’s why this kind of action gets popular,” McKenzie says. “Everybody feels the struggle, and the pain, and the misery that these Kellogg workers feel right now.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtRxzg"&gt;Moderators pinned a post with suggestions on how to support the strike, including flooding the job postings, but otherwise have let members take the lead. McKenzie says some members reported the job site crashing throughout the day, and the initiative has now spread to Twitter and TikTok, introducing new people to the r/antiwork community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7z8J7"&gt;It’s not the first time antiwork messages broke out of digital spaces. Last week, a slew of posts on social media suggested &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjbb9d/hackers-are-spamming-businesses-receipt-printers-with-antiwork-manifestos"&gt;receipt printers&lt;/a&gt; were being hacked to spit out pro-worker manifestos, encouraging people to discuss wages with co-workers and form unions, eventually directing people to visit r/antiwork. McKenzie says the moderation team doesn’t know who’s responsible for the hacked printers — they originally thought the stunt was fake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q59AOD"&gt;Now some in the antiwork community see organizing around the Kellogg’s strike as an important way to turn their shared beliefs into real-world actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrrDV5"&gt;“It’s time for &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/"&gt;r/antiwork&lt;/a&gt; to make the news as a formidable fighter for the average worker,” one post reads. “I submitted four applications. How many did you submit?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dz6a0a"&gt;Marvel’s supersized superhero epic &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; is officially going to be available to stream on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome&amp;amp;subid1=Verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus &lt;/a&gt;on January 12th, Disney announced today, about two months after it was first released on November 3rd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vZqVyj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Marvel’s Eternals is big, beautiful, and empty","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759203/eternals-review-marvel-studios-chloe-zhao-gemma-chan-richard-madden"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EnKTIu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; will also be available to stream in IMAX’s Expanded Aspect Ratio format, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22764957/marvel-disney-plus-imax-expanded-aspect-ratio"&gt;Disney Plus started rolling out&lt;/a&gt; on other Marvel films, including &lt;em&gt;Iron Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, and the recently released &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt;, in November. The January 12th date has been floating around the internet for a few weeks already, but today marks the official confirmation from Disney of the streaming release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NARAGx"&gt;The January release for &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; is also perfectly placed for Disney to keep Marvel fans from canceling their subscriptions after &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; concludes later in December. Since Disney Plus first started offering original Marvel content in January 2021, there’s only been a single month (May) that lacked a major MCU release on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPK5w0"&gt;

&lt;p id="QtV7bu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; is the latest example of how much faster films are transitioning from a traditional theatrical release to a paid digital and disc release period to subscription streaming in just a matter of weeks, instead of the usual monthslong cycle. It also speaks to how important boosting Disney Plus subscription numbers is to Disney, as a long-term business strategy, one that could indicate that the swift pace of movies from theater to streaming will only continue to accelerate. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s working on a rollable smartwatch with a camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PnktxtPTyFqEyqajtVAxcGWoqog=/0x98:1442x1059/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70255067/Screen_Shot_2021_12_10_at_10.47.51_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung recently filed a patent depicting a rollable smartwatch display and camera&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: WIPO via LetsGoDigital&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zUoAPt"&gt;Though there have been attempts at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21374933/nubia-watch-hands-on-preview-flexible-oled-kickstarter-price"&gt;wraparound smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;, the gadget category itself hasn’t really seen much design innovation for quite a while. Earlier this year, there was talk of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;a flat-edged Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, but those turned out to be mere rumors. While it’s unlikely we’ll see drastic change any time soon, it appears tech companies have been toying with the idea of watching videos and taking photos from the wrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZLjY7"&gt;The latest example comes courtesy of &lt;a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/uploads/2021/12/samsung-rollable-smartwatch.pdf"&gt;a Samsung patent&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/wearables-smartwatches/samsung-rollable-watch/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;LetsGoDigital&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://petapixel.com/2021/12/09/samsung-designs-smartwatch-with-rolling-display-and-centered-camera/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peta Pixel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Originally filed in June with the World Intellectual Property Office (WIPO), the patent depicts a Galaxy Watch with a rollable screen and camera smack dab in the middle. The watch concept looks like an average round-faced watch, but pressing the crown allows you to extend the screen further into a sort of pill-shaped oval that’s 40 percent larger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nyyf7v"&gt;In addition to novel ways of displaying information, Samsung also seems to think a larger screen might entice people to watch videos from the wrist. One drawing depicts a potential user watching what appears to be Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Thor&lt;/em&gt; on the watch. As for the camera, the schematics show a design where it’s located in the middle of the watch and is intended for taking photos or video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0C2b3a"&gt;It’s not out of left field that Samsung might try to extend its foldable screen tech to wearables. Samsung has experimented with cameras &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/smartwatch-with-camera-1637240/"&gt;in wrist-based wearables before&lt;/a&gt;. Meta is also purportedly working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526266/facebook-smartwatch-two-cameras-heart-rate-monitor"&gt;a smartwatch that will house not one but two cameras&lt;/a&gt;. And while there is no camera in the Apple Watch, there is the Wristcam, a $299 third-party strap with a built-in camera that can also be used for &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-apple-watch-camera-band-brings-live-video-to-your-1847152682"&gt;short-form video chatting&lt;/a&gt;. All of this is neat from a technological perspective, but as a wearables reviewer, I can tell you one thing: cameras and videos on smartwatches don’t make much sense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bm6YWQ561pize2gl19HXcdBpuBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23078692/Screen_Shot_2021_12_10_at_10.30.06_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: WIPO via LetsGoDigital&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Would you watch a movie on the wrist?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7PdZ8T"&gt;For many, one of the smartwatch’s greatest “flaws” is that it’s a companion device. While you can do a lot with it on its own, it’s still limited without your smartphone. For example, replying to texts is tedious no matter how large the screen or how accurate your voice assistant is. Anything more than a quick “yes” or “on my way” requires you to whip out your phone. Poor battery life also means taking long calls just isn’t an option. Standalone capability is improving, however. More advanced models have LTE and contactless payments, which means you can safely leave your phone behind for quick jaunts around the neighborhood. But when it comes to taking photos and videos, smartwatches can’t replace your phone in any capacity just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t38Wuy"&gt;That’s probably the idea behind this nascent push to add cameras to our wrists. We’re all video chatting now, and wrist communicators have been buried deep into our collective psyche thanks to spy flicks like &lt;em&gt;James Bond&lt;/em&gt; and sci-fi classics like &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;. When you take a call from the wrist, however, you can do so naturally. You don’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to hold up your arm in a specific way to be heard — you can just continue what you were doing. You &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; for cameras and video chats. When I tested the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-apple-watch-camera-band-brings-live-video-to-your-1847152682"&gt;Wristcam’s video chat for the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, one of the things I hadn’t anticipated was how tired my arm felt after holding it up to capture my face at a flattering angle. Likewise, it’s easy to take out your phone, snap a photo, and get on with your day. Contorting your wrist to get a picture is less fun and more awkward to do in public. The effort doesn’t make sense when my phone is &lt;em&gt;right there&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8PqCt"&gt;Watching videos from the wrist is less than ideal for the same reasons. While testing the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/samsung-had-to-fix-one-thing-with-the-galaxy-watch-acti-1838454731"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2&lt;/a&gt;, I attempted to view a Bon Appetit YouTube video — partly because Samsung said I could, partly because I wanted to know what watching a video on such a small screen would be like. It worked, but that’s the best I can say about that experience. The screen was too small, the video was laggy, streaming video zapped battery life, and the app crashed more than once. It’s uncomfortable to hold your arm for an ideal viewing position for an extended period. Even if you could increase the screen size, I cannot fathom watching all 149 minutes of &lt;em&gt;Avengers:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Infinity War&lt;/em&gt; from the wrist when I could reach into my pocket for my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyF17R"&gt;And these are just the technical obstacles. Privacy is an &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_comments/2015/10/00050-98093.pdf"&gt;entire bag of worms&lt;/a&gt; that no wearable company has effectively “solved” yet. These are incredibly personal devices, and they collect treasure troves of data. Privacy concerns are a major obstacle to wearable adoption, and you just have to recall the Google Glass Explorer Edition to understand how adding cameras to mix could go terribly wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FzaV2x"&gt;Perhaps one day, tech companies will figure out a way for smartwatch cameras to work without all the extra steps and tradeoffs. But in the meantime, cameras on smartwatches aren’t something most consumers are yearning for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Better CEO who fired 900 people over a Zoom call is taking time off </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AMFz_hjUsHDrwvjuEz6wQZJxFio=/177x0:1530x902/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70255034/better_ceo_garg.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;CEO Vishal Garg is reportedly taking time off from Better.com, the company he founded in 2012. | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/215031211" target="_blank"&gt;Better.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wkWRnz"&gt;The CEO of digital mortgage firm &lt;a href="http://Better.com"&gt;Better.com&lt;/a&gt;, who fired 900 employees on a Zoom call last week, is taking time off from the company while it conducts a “leadership and cultural assessment,” according to an email to employees from the board of directors. As first &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgmpab/better-ceo-taking-time-off-effective-immediately-email"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the board’s email says following “the very regrettable events over the last week,” CEO Vishal Garg will be taking time off “effective immediately,” and Better CFO Kevin Ryan will manage day-to-day operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIX3os"&gt;Better, which Garg founded in 2012, has been in the spotlight after he held a Zoom call with 900 employees on December 3rd to inform them they were losing their jobs. “If you’re on this call, you are part of the unlucky group that is being laid off,” Garg reportedly said on the call. He lamented that it was not the first time he had to conduct layoffs: “The last time I did it, I cried, this time I hope to be stronger.” The video call was captured by Better employees and widely circulated on social media. It has since been taken down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RP0g7G"&gt;Garg later sent a &lt;a href="https://cdn.brandfolder.io/A8SA0YBW/at/ggkbfpsbjbvc335cprpv33bg/A_Message_From_Our_Founder___CEO.pdf"&gt;message to Better employees&lt;/a&gt; apologizing for how he handled the layoffs. “I failed to show the appropriate amount of respect and appreciation for the individuals who were affected, and for their contributions to Better,” Garg wrote. “I realize that the way I communicated the news made a difficult situation worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axdWe5"&gt;Following the news of the layoffs, reports of Garg’s past insensitive comments and behavior began to trickle out; &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkpgkm/bettercom-ceo-called-top-investor-sewage-said-making-company-money-would-earn-employees-freedom"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; he once referred to a top investor in Better as “sewage” and reportedly told Better employees that instead of taking a day off for Indigenous Peoples’ Day, it was better for them to work and earn the company “capital, and therefore our freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sUfaOs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"SPACs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jCbv6y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-07/better-com-laid-off-900-workers-over-zoom-day-after-spac-merger-deal-delayed?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; has reported&lt;/a&gt; that Better pushed back its planned SPAC, which was supposed to close in the fourth quarter. On November 30th, Aurora Acquisition Corp. and SoftBank amended the terms of their financing agreement with Better, giving the mortgage company a cash infusion of about $750 million. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that the day after the new SPAC terms were announced, Garg fired the 900 workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tlvZyh"&gt;Better did not reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ZwpH70"&gt;Alex stays on for the entire show because there is so much to talk about — including a hands-on experience of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22819963/snap-ar-spectacles-glasses-hands-on-pictures-design-features"&gt;Snap’s first AR Spectacles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22827037/google-android-games-windows-pc-google-play-games"&gt;Google bringing Android games to Windows&lt;/a&gt; next year, the clash between Roku and YouTube, and this week in metaverse news.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Citing fires, London’s transport agency bans e-scooters on public transit network</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;E-scooters have been banned on London’s transport network after several fires. | photo by Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MoxkgC"&gt;Transport for London &lt;a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2021/december/tfl-announces-safety-ban-of-e-scooters-on-transport-network"&gt;announced a ban on all e-scooters&lt;/a&gt; on its network, effective December 13th, over safety concerns following recent fires. The ban will apply to all public transport in London, including underground trains and buses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alhAhv"&gt;E-scooters are currently banned on UK roads and sidewalks, but shops can still sell them for use on private land. The only legal e-scooters in use in London are the ones part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440320/london-electric-scooter-rental-trial-dott-lime-tier"&gt;rental trials that started over the summer&lt;/a&gt;. The ban does not include mobility scooters that are permitted on TfL’s network, and foldable e-bikes are still permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5HrBU"&gt;“We have been extremely worried by the recent incidents on our public transport services, which involved intense fires and considerable smoke and damage,” said TfL’s chief safety, health, and environment officer Lilli Matson. “We have worked with London Fire Brigade to determine how we should deal with these devices and, following that review, we have decided to ban them. Customers who try to bring them onto our network will be refused access to our stations and premises, and not be permitted to use any of our services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJjbdl"&gt;TfL did not reference specific fires, but local news &lt;a href="https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/cars/1515958/electric-scooter-london-underground-battery-fire-explosion"&gt;reported on an incident&lt;/a&gt; in November, when an e-scooter exploded in a London Underground station, causing black smoke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hHmjXt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Exclusive - Footage shows the dangers of escooter battery fires on the tube. This happened on Monday night. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TSSAunion?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TSSAunion&lt;/a&gt; calling for a ban on carrying escooters on public transport saying they’re a “significant threat”. More BBC1 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BBCLondonNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BBCLondonNews&lt;/a&gt; 1330 &amp;amp; 1830 &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://t.co/AnnXezXTE2"&gt;https://t.co/AnnXezXTE2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/iCjNLtlKDu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iCjNLtlKDu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Edwards (@BBCTomEdwards) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BBCTomEdwards/status/1455869992738725892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S2pxsW"&gt;The transport agency said the incidents it referenced were caused by “defective lithium-ion batteries which ruptured without warning,” which led to fires that cause toxic smoke. If such a fire happened in an enclosed area, it could lead to significant harm to staff and customers, TfL said in its news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tpNV8"&gt;Anyone who violates the ban could face a fine of up to £1,000 (about $1,300 USD). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="johXIR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
