    <title>Stadia version of Terraria is back in production after developer reconciles with Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qIfw1oiKMhz8KQIMFJNMWU9zbDQ=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68882686/ss_ae168a00ab08104ba266dc30232654d4b3c919e5.1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Re-Logic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UmvDnk"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;em&gt;Terraria &lt;/em&gt;co-creator Andrew Spinks announced that his studio Re-Logic would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272502/terraria-google-stadia-port-canceled-deceloper-locked-out"&gt;cancel a Google Stadia port&lt;/a&gt;. However, the developer announced today that the Stadia port is now back in development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HsPaM"&gt; ”As you may have noticed, we had a ton of issues to kick off the year stemming from the locking-down of Redigit’s entire Google account in early January,” Re-Logic said in a &lt;a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-state-of-the-game-february-2021.103428/"&gt;recent &lt;em&gt;Terraria &lt;/em&gt;forum post&lt;/a&gt;. “After a month of pushing (and with the immense support of our fans), Google finally reached out and was able to provide a lot of transparency around the situation and to restore access to all of our accounts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQoNTg"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t46quC"&gt;On February 8th, Spinks fired off a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Demilogic/status/1358661840402845696?s=20"&gt;series of tweets&lt;/a&gt; expressing frustration that he was locked out of his Google accounts for weeks, which included losing access to his Gmail and Google Play account. Spinks first noted that he lost access to his accounts on or around January 16th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DO3Us3"&gt;Re-Logic has yet to announced when &lt;em&gt;Terraria&lt;/em&gt; will launch on Google Stadia, but the game being back in development is good news for fans of Google’s cloud gaming service. On Friday, two reports from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/google-video-game-unit-stadia-struggled-to-be-googley-enough"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-stadia-games-entertainment-collapse/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shed light on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303496/google-stadia-struggle-wired-bloomberg-reports-studios"&gt;some of Google’s failures in building Stadia&lt;/a&gt;. And earlier this month, Google announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;closing its in-house&lt;/a&gt; development studio. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This TikTok Tom Cruise impersonator is using deepfake tech to impressive ends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QCe2t_Rd-Fwy9kFz_iw1DvWl3rU=/13x91:898x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68882612/Screen_Shot_2021_02_26_at_2.24.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not pictured: Tom Cruise&lt;/em&gt; | Image: @deeptomcruise on TikTok&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="df7yVy"&gt;What’s better than an ultra-high-tech, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1Y4CubBi60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible&lt;/em&gt;-style mask&lt;/a&gt;? The deepfake technology this TikToker is using to impersonate Tom Cruise, apparently (&lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/shockingly-real-tom-cruise-deepfakes-are-invading-tiktok?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@deeptomcruise"&gt;deeptomcruise account&lt;/a&gt; appears to feature someone who’s pretending to be the famous actor, and the impression isn’t just jaw-dropping because of how well the person replicates Cruise’s famous laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nEgEWR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@deeptomcruise/video/6932166297996233989" data-video-id="6932166297996233989" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@deeptomcruise" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@deeptomcruise"&gt;@deeptomcruise&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sports!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Tom" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6932166350203357957"&gt;♬ original sound - Tom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M5ZnkY"&gt;How can you tell it’s not actually Tom Cruise using some sort of strange Twitter name? First, his voice is close, but it’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; there, especially since the lip-syncing is a tiny bit off at some points. You can hear what the real Cruise sounds like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1wsCworwWk"&gt;in this video&lt;/a&gt; (unless, of course, James Corden also deepfaked him in).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQ0f6K"&gt;Second, while the tracking and lighting on the face are darn near immaculate — especially&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;when the actor passes something in front of his face — there are still a couple of telling glitches, notably in &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@deeptomcruise/video/6932166297996233989"&gt;the golf one&lt;/a&gt; where the sunglasses disappear and his mouth morphs for a frame or two. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_6WCa-EnHql3t-exNNS7V2z3EHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22332191/NotCruiseHQ.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not perfect, but it’s close.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QFeXqF"&gt;Even with these minor blips, the effect is still spooky. I’m not going to yell from the rooftops that deepfakes will be ruinous to society, but the fact that someone is posing, almost believably, as a famous actor on TikTok (and gaining 236,000 followers in the process) shows that it’s still hard to track deepfakes. While the account pretty clearly indicates that it’s a fake by using “deep” in its name, the next one to pop up might not. TikTok didn’t immediately respond to an email from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asking whether this type of account is allowed under its terms of service, but its TOS explicitly call out impersonations as forbidden:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="xH768Y"&gt;You may not: [...]&lt;br&gt;impersonate any person or entity, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent you or your affiliation with any person or entity, including giving the impression that any content you upload, post, transmit, distribute or otherwise make available emanates from the Services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FcBSPj"&gt;That said, this account does seem to be a bit of relatively harmless fun. If you’re reading this, person who runs deeptomcruise (or the real Tom Cruise), please show us if this tech can keep up with your best Tom Cruise run, or if it can handle you &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2UVsyVLLcE"&gt;dancing and lip-syncing to Bob Seger&lt;/a&gt;. Just whatever you do, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Slrfkruvnk8"&gt;leave Oprah, deepfaked or not, out of it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Persona 5 Strikers is a perfect excuse to reunite with the Phantom Thieves</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NJwmEthDHWA6-LNqRcflhkn9jhY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68882493/ss_8ab45ed170a4f44838dbd3fa4a8978c3a2313e62.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h4SHdY"&gt;Atlus is a master of weird spinoffs. In the past, the developer has revamped its RPG series &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt; as dungeon crawlers, brawlers, and rhythm games. Heroes have bounded through space and time for fanfiction-worthy team-ups, all in service of giving players a reason to see their favorite characters again. &lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers&lt;/em&gt; goes one step further, turning an action-heavy adventure into a road trip that feels right at home with the original game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwjauG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers&lt;/em&gt; is a direct sequel to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15098458/persona-5-review-ps4-ps3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, set months after the Phantom Thieves hung up their masks. The gang reunites for a long-overdue vacation, only to have it interrupted by the appearance of Jails — warped versions of reality where one person rules, not unlike the Palaces they encountered in the original game. To solve the mystery of these jails, the Phantom Thieves get an RV and take their investigation across Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ek8Uts"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strikers&lt;/em&gt; is an action-RPG take on the game in the vein of Omega Force’s other spinoffs of popular series, like Hyrule Warriors. It trades in the careful turn-based strategy of the original for button-mashing through mobs. Players are no longer confined to controlling only the game’s hero, Joker, and can swap between party members like Makoto or Ann at will. In addition to elemental abilities specific to their personas, like nuclear or wind attacks, each has special physical attacks to help you through battle. Characters I barely used in the original &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;, like Ryuji, became my go-to for mobs I wanted to melee; I rarely needed Morgana’s magic but loved his ability to turn into a car and mow down shadows. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F8l-4oIoOJLBrNd4qPvBIMIn7c4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22332030/ss_71b63fbbd55221007aabf84fd4c150a6125329da.1920x1080.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xOaeF5"&gt;Despite being able to swap between characters, the game’s mash-heavy gameplay can become monotonous at times. On a good streak, I would string together combos, pile on follow-up and all-out attacks, and zap enemies with magic attacks — but mostly, I just spent a lot of time frantically hitting buttons. The amount happening on-screen can sometimes be dizzying if not tough to follow, between characters talking during battle and zipping around a screen smashing enemies in the face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1OS8u"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t offer as robust an experience as the original game — there are no personality traits to improve, and relationships are distilled down to a single “Bond” metric that applies to your entire team — but it offers a solid array of ways to break up your playtime. New cities mean sidequests, shops to visit, and recipes to find for you to cook with; party members often want to visit special restaurants and attractions. The constraints of a deadline are gone as well. You can pop in and out of jails as often as you wish to go hang with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Kqx1R"&gt;The experience feels like a streamlined version of &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt;, the video game equivalent of a summer vacation. It’s a way to spend extra time with a world I fell in love with over the course of dozens of hours, and a welcome expansion to the game’s mythos. Where &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;’s Palaces were desires pushed to their extreme and corrupted, Jails revolve around trauma. In order to defeat the monarchs of each jail, you’ll need to first uncover and understand the pain that birthed them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oZzchCMAWTSi674NC0iwn4eW9Hc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22332031/ss_473822957f4077b28c5a81bfeb74e5b5cacba8ca.1920x1080.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SkRept"&gt;It’s a welcome change, a turn that makes people’s cruelty more interesting. &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;’s examinations of people at their darkest sometimes ran up against the cartoonish villainy of it all. The rulers you faced were so exaggeratedly evil that taking them down needed no justification. But &lt;em&gt;Strikers &lt;/em&gt;offers a more complex alternative: that hurt people hurt people. The monarchs have manipulated and deceived, yet they’re still a path for them to learn and grow from their mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ey92nC"&gt;As a sequel, &lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t offer much in the way of big revelations — but it doesn’t have to. Like the series’s many other spinoffs, the allure is the opportunity to play in their world a little longer. Clearing a jail is fun, but it still can’t compare to a night out with your friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDS80s"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt; is available on Nintendo Switch, PC, and PlayStation 4.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKHONs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyPqVh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-997" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0bkRzx3mmxyLTxrwUx0Mo389UkET95QnWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0bkRzx3mmxyLTxrwUx0Mo389UkET95QnWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestiPadDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. Right now, if you don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730154636955201273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;. If you want a new pair, the lowest price you can get them for currently is $219 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine backed by independent FDA committee</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L4ACLMGJRclSmaphdngThgriOUM=/0x0:2757x1838/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68882429/1230137617.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jason Armond / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j5gwnb"&gt;An independent committee of vaccine experts has unanimously recommended that the Food and Drug Administration authorize the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298855/covid-vaccine-johnson-effective-fda-south-africa-variant"&gt;one-shot COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt; for people 18 and older, taking it one step closer to use in the United States. The FDA is expected to authorize the vaccine within days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWfkUz"&gt;“I think it’s a relatively easy call,” said committee member Eric Rubin, an immunologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “It’s nice to have a single-dose vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q7GSfo"&gt;The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) met today to discuss the data from clinical trials of this vaccine, which the FDA evaluated over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267984/covid-vaccine-johnson-fda-one-dose-review"&gt;past three weeks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vmnE5l"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298855/covid-vaccine-johnson-effective-fda-south-africa-variant"&gt;The FDA’s analysis&lt;/a&gt;, released earlier this week, showed that the vaccine was safe and 85 percent effective against severe cases of COVID-19 globally. No one who received the vaccine was hospitalized with or died from COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rJ1uQA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I am pleased to have been part of VRBPAC for review of the vaccine.  We must not let a narrative take hold that this is a "lesser" vaccine than the mRNA vaccines. This vaccine prevents severe disease and death and in the crisis we are in that the most important thing. &lt;a href="https://t.co/YIfnAd44Bv"&gt;https://t.co/YIfnAd44Bv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— James E.K. Hildreth (@JamesEKHildreth) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JamesEKHildreth/status/1365423896212692994?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="32TMJB"&gt;When more moderate cases are included, the efficacy dropped to 72 percent in the US and 64 percent in South Africa, where a coronavirus variant that may partly evade immune protection is spreading. But even for people who did get moderate cases, the trial had some very positive results. People who still got sick with COVID-19 after being vaccinated had fewer symptoms than people who got sick and who weren’t vaccinated, according &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/146219/download"&gt;to an analysis&lt;/a&gt; from Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1phmX"&gt;Early data about the vaccine showed that it seemed to be less effective in older adults or people with health conditions like HIV, but FDA officials noted that there was less data available in those subsets of trial participants. As more cases were added to the analysis, the differences between those at-risk groups and the rest of the people in the trial started to  shrink, said Rachel Zhang, a medical officer with the FDA, during a presentation on the data today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUpVgO"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s vaccine only takes one dose to give people protection against COVID-19, which makes it easier to distribute than the Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech vaccines, which each need two shots. “It simplifies the process. People only have to make one appointment for their complete vaccination. A one dose vaccination decreases the burden on the health care system and health care providers,” Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group, said during the company’s presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9t9vC"&gt;The company is also running clinical trials to see if two doses of their vaccine would be even better than one. VRBPAC member Paul Offit, a vaccine researcher at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed out that it would be tricky to switch the vaccine to two doses if that regime turned out to be more effective. “You can see where that would be confusing to people,” he said during the meeting. Rubin raised the same issue. “It seems like a big logistical problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPJuwk"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson will also run additional trials to test its vaccine in adolescents, children, and pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAc9qU"&gt;The company says it has &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-johnson-and-johnson-short-doses/"&gt;4 million doses&lt;/a&gt; of the vaccine ready to ship on authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wrmt5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK0LbEtEShHQh97Hs1ENU1d_fQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/bking_200322_3945_0023.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;You can currently get the base iPad with 32GB of storage at Amazon for $320 ($9 off) in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5J9699?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J65DST5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space to store things like apps, you can grab a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5J7BF1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model for $400 if you buy it in gold&lt;/a&gt;, which is $29 off its usual price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s2PEas"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="pxIjz0"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X7SsrD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new iPad mini is a terrific small tablet with no competition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on the basic Wi-Fi model are rare, but you can buy the 64GB iPad Mini in gold for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PRD48RS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$385 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PRD48RS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PRD2NQ7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; only) or for &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1468029-REG%2Fapple_muqy2ll_a_7_9_ipad_mini_early.html"&gt;$394 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEZSI9"&gt;Amazon also has the 256GB model on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07NHN9W4J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$529 in space gray&lt;/a&gt;, or just $1 more, you can get this model in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PQ8XKZC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PSK4LGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PSFYBw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="WfS02T"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad Air (2020) review|96393" data-volume-uuid="6c97cb5b6" data-volume-id="96393" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-804" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Air (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen, and features thinner bezels around the display. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="u6ZCyC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Air (2020) review: take it from the Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ByT0LP"&gt;The best deal you can currently get on the iPad Air fourth-gen is at Micro Center. The retailer has the most competitive sale price right now, where you can grab a 64GB model in all five colors (&lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628782/apple-ipad-air-4---green-(late-2020)"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628780/apple-ipad-air-4---rose-gold-(late-2020)"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628779/apple-ipad-air-4---silver-(late-2020)"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628781/apple-ipad-air-4---sky-blue-(late-2020)"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628778/apple-ipad-air-4---space-gray-(late-2020)"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzykEb"&gt;Amazon currently has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen iPad Air 64GB model with Wi-Fi in all colors on sale&lt;/a&gt;, ranging from $549 to $570 depending on the color you select. Walmart has the same configuration on sale for $559 if you buy the 64GB iPad Air with Wi-Fi in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Green%2F968764839%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestiPadDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Rose-Gold%2F149437127%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestiPadDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wn6zsS"&gt;The 256GB configuration has also been discounted at Amazon; you can get this model for $699 ($50 off) in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J63W44Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FTH75?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FVJMX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6LJMT4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7jir3Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="nFcTiz"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad Pro (2020) review: beyond the trackpad|75424" data-volume-uuid="a90d1f137" data-volume-id="75424" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-112" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Pro (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="B73hce"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Pro review 2020: small spec bump, big camera bump","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8em56"&gt;If you are looking to pick up the 11-inch model at a discounted price, Amazon has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08639YQTV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB configuration on sale for $849&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="G5QUP2"&gt;Of course, if you have money to spend and want a ton of storage, you can buy the 11-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08631TDC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB configuration in space gray for only $1,249 in space gray;&lt;/a&gt; that’s $50 off its usual retail price of $1,299.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eK4A7f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="48UoRv"&gt;If you want a slightly bigger screen, Amazon has the 12.9-inch iPad Pro on sale &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JF4KR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $949&lt;/a&gt; for the base model, which includes 128GB of storage.

    <title>Netflix teams up again with Ghost in the Shell studio Production I.G for a Terminator anime</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J0l3c-c5DsM-WBleC3ghu0Bwfyg=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68882411/t2_judgementday.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: TriStar Pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rFWUFy"&gt;Netflix is pairing up with renowned Japanese anime studio Production I.G for an animated TV series set in the &lt;em&gt;Terminator &lt;/em&gt;universe. The company is billing the project as a team-up between Matt Tomlin, the writer of the Netflix superhero film &lt;em&gt;Project Power&lt;/em&gt;, and the studio best known for producing TV adaptations of legendary manga &lt;em&gt;Ghost in the Shell&lt;/em&gt;, though little else is known about the show or when in the complex &lt;em&gt;Terminator &lt;/em&gt;timeline it may take place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flyDHY"&gt;This isn’t Netflix’s first time working with Production I.G. Beyond its &lt;em&gt;Ghost in the Shell &lt;/em&gt;work, the studio is known as the animator of the &lt;em&gt;Psycho-Pass series &lt;/em&gt;and the wildly popular sports anime &lt;em&gt;Haikyu!! &lt;/em&gt;But with Netflix, Production I.G produced an original series called &lt;em&gt;B: The Beginning &lt;/em&gt;(originally pitched under the name &lt;em&gt;Perfect Bones&lt;/em&gt;), which debuted in 2018 with a long-awaited second season arriving on Netflix next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DIh1Zo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The most terrifying killing machine in sci-fi history is back, just like it promised. Project Power’s Mattson Tomlin and legendary anime studio Production I.G are teaming up for an animated series set in the Terminator universe.&lt;/p&gt;— NX (@NXOnNetflix) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1365406286557380611?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdsMZ4"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Terminator&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most iconic sci-fi stories ever created–and has only grown more relevant to our world over time,” John Derderian, Netflix’s vice president of Japan and anime, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/terminator-anime-series-netflix-1234916466/"&gt;said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “The new animated series will explore this universe in a way that has never been done before. We can’t wait for fans to experience this amazing new chapter in the epic battle between machines and humans.” In addition to Production I.G, Netflix has reportedly brought in Skydance Media, too, the production company behind the last two &lt;em&gt;Terminator &lt;/em&gt;films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DBnKT"&gt;Netflix is no stranger to anime. The all-encompassing anime umbrella, which includes animated works of various styles and genres, has been one of the hottest streaming service content categories of the last half-decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giZXs1"&gt;Numerous platforms have shelled out big money over the last few years to both acquire the rights to stream existing anime series and also develop new, exclusive ones that can draw in new subscribers, with Netflix arguably leading the pack while longtime anime distributors like Funimation and Viz Media have become major players in the streaming licensing business. Late last year, Sony paid nearly $1.2 billion to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166585/sony-buy-anime-streaming-service-crunchyroll-at-t-funimation"&gt;acquire anime streaming service Crunchyroll&lt;/a&gt; from AT&amp;amp;T, yet more evidence of the entertainment industry fervor surrounding anime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bI4X8Q"&gt;It’s paying off, too: more than 100 million households watched at least one episode of an anime on Netflix between October 2019 and September 2020, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/streaming/asia/japanese-anime-is-growing-success-netflix-1234816488/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;reported last fall&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGMMTq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s new app Bars will let you rap over premade beats</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LepSaA3ZJKEFT3WfYWUtNP5GEo0=/0x55:1612x1130/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68882350/Screen_Shot_2021_02_26_at_12.46.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: BARS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dziSZt"&gt;Despite being an annoying hipster, I definitely did not see this one coming: Facebook is &lt;a href="https://npe.fb.com/2021/02/26/introducing-bars-a-new-beta-test-empowering-rappers-to-create-and-share/"&gt;releasing an app&lt;/a&gt; that will let users post and share videos of them rapping over beats, which are provided by the app (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/facebook-launches-bars-a-tiktok-like-app-for-creating-and-sharing-raps/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9gCmn"&gt;The app is called Bars, and its main selling point is it provides the beats and lets you create 60-second rap videos over them. According to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, you can then post the video to a TikTok-style feed, where people can watch it and mark it as “fire” (that is, of course, if your skills are up to par). The app also promises “studio quality vocal effects,” including actual, honest-to-goodness AutoTune. I hope there’s a slider that goes from “making my voice passable” to “T-Pain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8Tnbl"&gt;The app also promises an auto-rhyme dictionary for those who mark themselves as “beginners” in the app’s sign-up. For those closer to the “Advanced” level, it also promises a Freestyle mode, which gives you eight random words to work into a 16-bar off-the-cuff rap.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JPbGu4hVKLA4hMRJG8wuQRWEMeM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331886/IMG_0899.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have anything lower?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="igLRfi"&gt;If you’re itching to lay down some Bars, I have some bad news: the app seems to currently be in closed beta, but you can at least sign up to secure your username and get a place in line for when the app starts opening up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IVSXhF9yqYWug35xEN_x4fdmCRI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331863/IMG_0902.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I promise you, Bars will never be ready for me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DqgwBTPCHU-cMWTvR6jIss76uFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331841/IMG_0903.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hopefully this is not indicative of the quality you can expect from the auto-rhyme suggestions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sBPnlT"&gt;I’m going to be honest, I don’t understand why the, erm, bars in the App Store description are so weak. The &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/getbarsapp"&gt;announcement rap posted on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; is honestly not bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="INhpRH"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3x0Hq"&gt;The app promises it’ll provide professionally made beats for you to rap over, and if the examples it’s posting on Instagram are indicative of the overall quality, that may actually be the case. They sound way closer to what you’d hear in an actual song than to the embarrassing things I’ve posted to SoundCloud. (No, I’m not linking that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JASKIa"&gt;The app is being made by Facebook’s New Product Experimentation group, which also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174882/facebook-collab-app-store-release-date-price"&gt;released a similar musical app called Collab last year&lt;/a&gt; that allows musicians to make songs together, each providing separate parts. After scrolling through that app a bit, my hopes for Bars are slightly diminished, as the audio quality isn’t near the level of what the Bars previews promise. That said, I can see Bars being able to fine-tune its EQ, as it will really only have to deal with the human voice, rather than an infinite range of instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYz1H0"&gt;So far, the app is &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1521789321"&gt;only on iOS&lt;/a&gt;, and I wouldn’t hold my breath for an Android version; it doesn’t seem like Collab has made it to the Play Store yet, either. For as much fun as I’ve poked, though, I actually will genuinely keep this app until it lets me in — not so I can actually contribute (goodness no) but so I can see what people come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5g3b1"&gt;Facebook was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="MyfWR7"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or simply use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling through Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while a niche piece of tech, is designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with no other functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon has dominated the space for years with its Kindle products. Right now, there are three Kindle models you can choose from, each with pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRHBaM"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current Kindles available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one or, in some instances, all of the products. In that case, we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price so you know when is a good time to buy the e-reader at a discounted rate. But most of the time, there’s some deal going on. Whether you’re looking for a new model or to grab a bundle that includes a few extras, these are the best Kindle deals right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, usually costing $90. Released in 2019, this base Kindle model includes a front light, comes in one storage configuration of 8GB, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, this model has a slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07978J597?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a tenth-gen Kindle with lockscreen ads&lt;/a&gt; for $90, which is its usual price. If you want &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB085VZV5VB%3F%26linkCode%3Dll1%26tag%3Dtheverge02-20%26linkId%3D1ccac7c6dd4bb605e9b24952e83a00de%26language%3Den_US%26ref_%3Das_li_ss_tl&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21539047%2Fbest-amazon-kindle-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you can grab it for the usual price of $110. Both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VT322X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;models&lt;/a&gt; also have a promotion where you can receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FEssentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter%2Fdp%2FB08C6NDPFM%3F%26linkCode%3Dll1%26tag%3Dtheverge02-20%26linkId%3D245b190dc0183c0524d2fca4e15ce6fe%26language%3Den_US%26ref_%3Das_li_ss_tl&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21539047%2Fbest-amazon-kindle-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $120 ($15 off its usual price); it includes a printed cover and a power adapter. Amazon is also running a promotion where you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FPX819Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save 20 percent off on any two eligible Kindle devices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019, Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $109 ($20 more than the base Kindle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited service. The latter is the biggest selling point of this device, as it allows parents to grant access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost. You can grab one for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its normal price of $110&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7AYlh"&gt;Right now, Amazon is offering the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Essentials-including-Protector-Adapter/dp/B07XW24MVK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition Essentials Bundle, which is $128&lt;/a&gt; and includes all of the things previously mentioned above, plus a power adapter. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (fourth-generation).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (Fourth Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="P1C5xu"&gt;Amazon released the fourth-generation Kindle Paperwhite in 2018. Starting at $130, the Paperwhite comes in three different configurations: 8GB Wi-Fi, 32GB Wi-Fi, and a second 32GB model that drops the ads from the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qneu65"&gt;The Paperwhite features a six-inch, pin-sharp backlit display, which is the main reason to get one over the base Kindle. The 2018 model added a few useful features normally found on Amazon’s flagship reader, the Oasis, such as water resistance and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;No deals are currently available, but if you want to buy one in the near future, the Kindle Paperwhite is on sale for the price it usually tends to sell for; you can buy an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ96B6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB Kindle Paperwhite with ad support&lt;/a&gt; for $130 or for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTCW9G7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 without ads&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PP49ZDW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB Paperwhite with ads for $160&lt;/a&gt;; if you want an ad-free model, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PT96B3T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this configuration for $180&lt;/a&gt;. Just like the base Kindle, Amazon currently running a promotion where you can grab the e-reader plus three months of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/18/5915039/amazons-all-you-can-read-kindle-unlimited-is-now-official-at-9-99-per"&gt;Kindle Unlimited&lt;/a&gt; at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emeowb"&gt;Amazon also discounted its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader bundle for $160&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 if you buy the 32GB&lt;/a&gt; (with ads).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindle Oasis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Oasis (Third Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations: 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get the product with or without ads on the lockscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The Kindle Oasis 2019 model looks very similar to its previous model. It still maintains its waterproof, seven-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks by connecting to Bluetooth. Yet, the biggest change to the Kindle Oasis 2019 is that it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we have seen the Kindle Oasis go down to as low as $200 if you get the 32GB model, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are no deals on just the Oasis itself, you can grab one of the many configurations plus three free months of Kindle Unlimited for the normal price starting at $250. The ad-supported &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $250 and the one without ads is $270. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB is $280 with ads&lt;/a&gt;, or for the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;without ads&lt;/a&gt; configuration, you can buy it for $300. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087YZGRGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087Z7Z3DF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB&lt;/a&gt;, and it will also include a leather cover, a power adapter, plus three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Two new reports reveal the depths of Stadia’s struggles</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qCJ8dI"&gt;Two new reports from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/google-video-game-unit-stadia-struggled-to-be-googley-enough"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-stadia-games-entertainment-collapse/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have shed light on some of Google’s failures in building its Stadia cloud gaming service. The reports come just a few weeks after Google announced it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;shutting down&lt;/a&gt; its in-house Stadia game development studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9phj6A"&gt;One key issue, according to &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, is that Google may not have put as much investment in its internal studios as its much-hyped plans for Stadia may have suggested. Stadia chief Phil Harrison announced Google’s Stadia Games and Entertainment studios at the Game Developers Conference in 2019, when Google made its first big splash with Stadia. However, according to &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, “it would be months until Google would actually hire the bulk of” the studio’s developers&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Google’s goal was to hire 2,000 people over the course of five years to make Stadia games, &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jA9pH2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stadia employees said the tech felt like a beta&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0330AM"&gt;When Stadia first launched, my colleague Sean Hollister said it was “still just a beta” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel"&gt;right in the headline&lt;/a&gt;. And apparently, Stadia developers agreed: “Stadia employees shared the concern that the technology felt like a beta at launch,” according to &lt;em&gt;Wired. &lt;/em&gt;Although Stadia worked — in that it could stream games from the cloud to a PC or phone — it was still missing many features that were shown off in its pre-launch marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzOAmF"&gt;Two sources also told &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; that Stadia “did not meet internal expectations in 2020.” That’s backed up by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, which reported Google missed Stadia targets for “sales of controllers and monthly active users by hundreds of thousands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXRICs"&gt;If you’ve been following Stadia, that may not be all that surprising — my colleague Tom Warren found Stadia to be a lonely place &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21252200/google-stadia-cross-play-games-lonely-venue"&gt;back in May&lt;/a&gt; — but it seems &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/19/21572301/cyberpunk-2077-google-stadia-free-premiere-kit-preorder-deal"&gt;even&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558820/youtube-premium-subscribers-free-stadia-premiere-edition-bundle-deals"&gt;promotions&lt;/a&gt; for free Stadia Premiere kits weren’t enough to help Google meet its goals for Stadia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEILEH"&gt;Google also attempted to attract users to Stadia by making deals with publishers for ports of tentpole games like &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;in the tens of millions of dollars&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; reports &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1365376842765651970"&gt;according to Jason Schreier&lt;/a&gt;, the author of the &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; story, Google apparently spent tens of millions &lt;em&gt;per port&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SsbQIK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just to reiterate the absurdity of this thing: Sources say Google spent tens of millions of dollars -- the budgets of some major games -- PER Stadia port. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Publishers like Ubisoft and Take-Two were raking it in&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1365376842765651970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nnfJ1x"&gt;I highly encourage you to read both &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-stadia-games-entertainment-collapse/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/google-video-game-unit-stadia-struggled-to-be-googley-enough"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports about Stadia’s struggles. For now, Stadia will continue to exist as a platform, even though Google won’t be making games for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JNXwIa"&gt;In a blog about the studio closures, Harrison also said that Google has an “increased focus on using our technology platform for industry partners,” which could suggest that Google may offer Stadia as a white-label cloud gaming service to other companies. But with studio closures and these two reports, it’s hard not to feel that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"&gt;writing’s on the wall for Google Stadia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
