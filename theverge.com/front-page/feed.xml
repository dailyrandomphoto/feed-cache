    <title>Hybrid work is coming to big tech. Its contractors might not be so lucky</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pRoNjf"&gt;In fits and starts, the US is reopening — in many cases to the chagrin of office workers who have settled into work-from-wherever setups they’ve had the past 16-ish months to perfect. And given the willingness of many of those same workers to quit rather than go back to full-time cubicle life, many companies have offered some form of “hybrid” arrangement as a compromise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrj36O"&gt;It seems that benefit isn’t being extended to all workers, though. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft were short on concrete answers as to which contingent workers — which comprise sizable, sometimes majority portions of their workforce, and perform functions from hospitality and security to content moderation and coding — if any would be allowed to work remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="CCIz44"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10619076"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sbMzdw"&gt;Each of these tech giants appear to be instituting some version of partial remote work for corporate employees, with some minor variations. &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/amazon-updates-return-to-office-guidance"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/life-at-google/hybrid-approach-work"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/03/22/the-philosophy-and-practice-of-our-hybrid-workplace/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; each announced these changes publicly on their corporate blogs, while internal memos to the same effect within Facebook and Apple were reported on by the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-lets-more-employees-choose-full-time-remote-work-or-return-to-the-office-11623258049"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. All instituted a future of what Microsoft hazily described as “working from home part of the time (less than 50%) as standard for most roles,” and its competitors as some variation of requiring three days per week in the office. Apple took the extra step of mandating which three days — Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WerBel"&gt;There are of course, caveats in both directions. Some roles were flagged by Facebook and Amazon as not being remote work-applicable: jobs like hardware engineers and data center workers. On the other hand, nearly all of these companies noted that eligible employees could remain fully remote if they were granted that permission by their manager. Google even &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-rolls-out-tool-to-show-its-employees-compensation-changes-for-transferring-offices/"&gt;developed a tool&lt;/a&gt; that will show remote workers how much it plans to shave off their salaries if they go the remote option and move somewhere with a lower cost of living. (Thanks?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nA3t6B"&gt;Missing from any of these memos or announcements, though, was any mention of whether remote work options were available to the legions of contractors that help these companies function. Spokespeople for most of these companies sidestepped the question. “When it comes down to our contractors and partners, I wouldn’t be able to speak on their behalf or how they would implement our policy,” an Amazon spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; Facebook provided a similar answer. Facebook’s spokesperson did not respond to a request for a list of which agencies they used for contract labor so that we could ask each company about its remote work policies, while Amazon declined to provide one citing “confidentiality reasons.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8YErj"&gt;A spokesperson with Google stated that temporary staff would likely be required to come in the same days as the teams of employees that oversee them, while the companies that employ its contingent “vendors” had already determined which jobs could or could not perform their work remotely. The same spokesperson was not able to provide an approximate percentage for how many of these vendors would have that benefit extended to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Hzmjz"&gt;Through an external communications agency, a spokesperson for Microsoft wrote that aforementioned corporate blog was “all the company has to share.” Apple did not respond to multiple requests for information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qnZ98"&gt;It’s logical to defer to these external agencies, but it also belies how much leverage tech companies have in these relationships. Microsoft has previously &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/076474aa0b1b47b6b4790dbf98ed6108"&gt;required&lt;/a&gt; firms it works with provide paid childcare leave for its contractors; Google too has &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-require-suppliers-give-benefits-workers/"&gt;mandated&lt;/a&gt; contractors receive at least $15 per hour, healthcare, and parental leave. Facebook has also &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/05/compensating-and-supporting-contractors/"&gt;instituted&lt;/a&gt; “well-being and resiliency training” for its contractor moderators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBDFO2"&gt;It’s also a bit hard to believe — especially in instances where these workers would be reporting to these companies’ facilities — that these companies lack any direct oversight over who is coming into their offices at a time when indoor capacity limits are not only a matter of corporate policy, but often a matter of state mandate too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgpBMi"&gt;The issues of remote work for contractors is also not a new one — and much earlier in the pandemic it caused quite a bit of bad PR for several of these companies. Facebook took heat from having some of those same content moderators working from the office back in November, a month where the US was seeing around 100,000 new cases of covid daily — and from awarding monetary bonuses to employees &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/17/facebook-coronavirus-bonus-contractors/"&gt;but not to contractors&lt;/a&gt;. Google was requiring some contractors to report to work in person in March of 2020, sparking internal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21184495/google-employees-memo-contract-workers-coronavirus-covid-19"&gt;backlash from its own employees&lt;/a&gt;; it also rescinded job offers to around 2,000 contractors — citing the economic downturn — while apportioning $1,000 each for employees to purchase desks and other items for their from-home workspaces. Around the same time, hundreds of contractor jobs with Apple were reportedly suspended without pay — only to be restored after a contingent of unionized janitors and the Wall Street Journal began &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-commits-to-paying-contractors-after-some-were-told-theyd-lose-work-11585667276"&gt;asking questions&lt;/a&gt;. Most of this &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7j7mb/amazon-delivery-drivers-are-overwhelmed-and-overworked-by-covid-19-surge"&gt;barely holds a candle&lt;/a&gt; to what Amazon’s considerably more frontline delivery contractors experienced, as a whole country, trapped inside, dramatically increased its online purchasing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqZlJx"&gt;This is all relevant insofar as it illustrates that the two-tiered system of employment within these companies is alive and well, but also that these very big, very wealthy companies, supposedly staffed by the best and brightest, had many, many months to consider a return to office plan that would be transparent and comprehensible. Contractors themselves, and a news media willing to report on them, has been asking how tech companies will handle this disparity in benefits &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/09/tech-contractors-coronavirus/"&gt;essentially since the pandemic began&lt;/a&gt;. A year and a half later, there’s still no clear answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDduGv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OMG, BuzzFeed is worth 1.5 billion?? WIN</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BuzzFeed Hosts Press Conference To Announce Plans To Become Public Company By Merging With 890 5th Avenue Partners In New York On Thursday, June 24" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oqd7B3YeP4GtrP70b9PbJJK9240=/6x0:6000x3996/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69503546/1325288676.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Craig Barritt / Getty Images for BuzzFeed&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;From surfing Facebook’s wake to trying to get big enough for a better deal&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="uIu3gS"&gt;How much is it worth to be shareable? BuzzFeed founder Jonah Peretti is hoping for about $1.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PHgnQ"&gt;BuzzFeed &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210624005657/en/"&gt;has agreed to go public&lt;/a&gt; through an acquisition by 890 Fifth Avenue Partners, a publicly traded company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;with no purpose except to buy another company.&lt;/a&gt; (890 Fifth Avenue Partners is part of a recent wave of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"&gt;some startups are using to go public&lt;/a&gt;.) As part of the deal, BuzzFeed is also acquiring Complex Networks, another media company, for $300 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tAq5pe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;BuzzFeed was an experiment to discover what content people would share on social networks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lpzbjP"&gt;Cast your mind back, if you are able, to the antediluvian era, before the 2008 crash. Peretti, who had graduated from the MIT Media Lab, had taken his expertise in online popularity — which, in that era, was search engine optimization — to found &lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post &lt;/em&gt;in 2005. A year later, he created BuzzFeed as an experiment to discover what content people would share on social networks. In 2011, when AOL bought &lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;, Peretti left — and BuzzFeed became his mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIC9Az"&gt;This was a significant shift, one that Peretti was quicker to understand than a lot of other web types. In the SEO era, you could fake it based on the right keywords — “What time is the Super Bowl?” — but people wouldn’t share that kind of thing. People had to &lt;em&gt;intentionally&lt;/em&gt; share something on Facebook because they liked it or because they liked what sharing it said about themselves. From the jump, BuzzFeed was interested in truly massive scale, and most of its content was aimed at surfing Facebook shares to traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODYZp7"&gt;It worked. At first, BuzzFeed focused mostly on quizzes and memes, but in December 2011, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/business/media/at-buzzfeed-the-significant-and-the-silly.html"&gt;Peretti hired Ben Smith&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; to build out a news division. People shared news, too, after all — and sharing was the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsALyQ"&gt;“One thing Jonah was saying very early on that people thought was crazy — &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; thought he was crazy — was that platforms were like cable networks, and we had to find distribution on the new networks,” says Smith, now the media columnist for &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. “Ultimately, directly or indirectly, they were going to pay.” This turned out to be true, to some degree; BuzzFeed set up several lucrative relationships with platforms such as Snapchat. Smith declined to comment on whether the news division was profitable while he ran it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="48FZbz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At the time, BuzzFeed’s dependence on Facebook was seen as savvy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jK1FnX"&gt;From the beginning, BuzzFeed did headline A/B testing — and the headline that got more shares was the one that won. The revenue bet, at first, was on sponsored content since there were no display ads. HBO would pay for a quiz (&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/hbogameofthrones/how-would-you-die-in-game-of-thrones"&gt;“How Would You Die In “Game Of Thrones”?&lt;/a&gt;) or Pillsbury would pay for a listicle (&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/pillsbury/10-things-you-never-knew-you-could-do-with-a-cresc-2pec"&gt;“10 Things You Never Knew You Could Do With a Crescent Roll”&lt;/a&gt;). People would share things if they liked them or if they thought they were good — something most people won’t do for other kinds of ads. That meant BuzzFeed’s sponcon traveled further than competitors’ ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpdQfw"&gt;At the time, BuzzFeed’s dependence on Facebook was seen as savvy: it had unlocked some kind of secret formula, and suddenly, BuzzFeed was everywhere. Other media companies scrambled to catch up with how BuzzFeed was reinventing the culture of a newsroom. BuzzFeed was &lt;em&gt;fun,&lt;/em&gt; several early news hires tell me. “You’d be working in the office, and an army of people would walk in,” Charlie Warzel, a former BuzzFeed tech reporter, says. “And it’d be like, Tyler the Creator and Grumpy Cat. One day, we were working in the newsroom, and we heard this bellowing. And Tracy Morgan came in, just yelling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2LIx71"&gt;In 2013, Facebook was sending &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/out-of-the-blue-facebook-is-now-driving-enormous-traffic-to"&gt;&lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of traffic&lt;/a&gt; to publishers. The company had tweaked its algorithm such that traffic spiked a nice 69 percent from August to October that year. Facebook was, at the time, trying to compete with the reporters’ platform of choice, Twitter. In retrospect, this should have been a warning shot, but the party went on — and BuzzFeed continued expanding after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/technology/a-move-to-go-beyond-lists-for-content-at-buzzfeed.html"&gt;an injection of $50 million&lt;/a&gt; in 2014 from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, valuing the company at $850 million. BuzzFeed moved offices, and it was hard to keep up with the influx of new employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="gMXOlY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In 2015, someone wrote to an advice columnist to say, “I hate myself because I can’t work for BuzzFeed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gy9YR2"&gt;“From 2013 to 2015, we mostly looked at platforms as playgrounds,” Warzel says. Sure, they’d be volatile, but they were places to experiment and learn. Several people I spoke to for this article described this period as playful. There was a kind of trust in the platforms, they say. If BuzzFeed evolved and changed with them, there would be nothing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oaGNX"&gt;Plus, BuzzFeed was considered a cool place to work. In 2015, someone &lt;a href="https://www.theawl.com/2015/03/i-hate-myself-because-i-dont-work-for-buzzfeed/"&gt;wrote to an advice columnist&lt;/a&gt; to say, “I hate myself because I can’t work for BuzzFeed.” The letter went on to call BuzzFeed “the most successful media company of our time,” “the future of the media business,” “the most widely recognized media brand among young people,” and predicted it “will inevitably eclipse the major media organizations and one day become a super-hegemonic media power the likes of which we’ve never seen.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQGTeR"&gt;Later that year, NBCUniversal &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-269B-4293"&gt;invested $200 million in the business&lt;/a&gt;, giving it a valuation of $1.5 billion, about double its value in 2014. BuzzFeed wasn’t the only new media company with a sky-high valuation; in 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/vice-media-raised-money-at-a-sky-high-valuation-now-the-bill-is-coming-due-11581450643"&gt;Vice was valued at $5.7 billion&lt;/a&gt;. Vox Media, the parent company of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, was valued at $1 billion in 2015. (Vice is now in talks for its own SPAC merger that would &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-10/vice-is-said-target-3-billion-valuation-in-ipo-via-spac-merger"&gt;value it at just $3 billion&lt;/a&gt;. Vox Media was valued at $750 million in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-media-valued-at-about-105-million-in-vox-media-merger-11569452124"&gt;when it acquired New York Media&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNwLjA"&gt;Around then, Facebook began favoring video content. BuzzFeed’s strategy, up to that point, had been based on YouTube — to get some ad revenue. But the success of Tasty convinced the company to pay more attention to Facebook, some former BuzzFeed staffers say. The company invested in Facebook Live, Facebook’s livestreaming service. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/brendanklinkenberg/this-exploding-watermelon-was-facebook-lives-biggest-hit-to"&gt;BuzzFeed’s 2016 Facebook Live event of a watermelon being wrapped in rubber bands&lt;/a&gt; until it exploded was viewed as a massive success for the company. “That was massive and exciting in the office,” Warzel says. “Like, ‘Oh, we figured it out again!’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="K8ftYC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There was a sense of ‘These people are just dicking us around.’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B1g4dL"&gt;But then, Facebook changed its algorithm, deprioritizing video — and traffic tanked. (Later, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/facebook-settlement-video-advertising-lawsuit-40-million-1203361133/"&gt;Facebook would pay $40 million&lt;/a&gt; to settle advertiser lawsuits, after the company admitted it had inflated view counts in 2015 and 2016.) That seemed to sour Peretti and others on the platform. “There was a sense of ‘These people are just dicking us around,’” Warzel tells me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2wXUx"&gt;In October 2017, Peretti criticized Facebook’s News Feed for supporting low-cost content. “The business model of news is changing, and if Google and Facebook take all the revenue but don’t want to pay for the fact checking, the reporting, the more-intensive investigations, who does that work?” &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/buzzfeed-ceo-google-facebook-should-share-more-revenue-1508356543"&gt;Peretti said at a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt;. That year, BuzzFeed laid off 100 employees after missing its revenue targets by 15 to 20 percent, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/buzzfeed-nears-deal-to-go-public-via-spac-eyeing-digital-media-rollup-11624485898"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DG6Ab"&gt;By 2018, Peretti was floating the idea of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/business/media/buzzfeed-jonah-peretti-mergers.html"&gt;a merger with other media companies&lt;/a&gt; — to increase their leverage against the platforms and make more money. This struck some staffers as ironic. In 2015, Peretti had told staff, “I don’t think a union is right for BuzzFeed.” Now, suddenly, he was suggesting that media companies should band together, as a group, to increase their bargaining power. But Peretti had clearly been thinking about acquisitions for some time. He almost never said anything publicly that he hadn’t discussed in detail privately, a source says. If he was saying it publicly, he was already committed. (BuzzFeed &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/business/media/buzzfeed-news-union-walkout.html"&gt;unionized in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFPwNU"&gt;BuzzFeed tightened its belt in 2019, cutting 43 journalists’ jobs. It sought other revenue streams, selling merch and investing in affiliate agreements with companies such as Amazon. In November 2020, the company announced its plan to acquire what was now called &lt;em&gt;HuffPo,&lt;/em&gt; Peretti’s previous company. (That acquisition valued BuzzFeed at $1.7 billion, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-24/buzzfeed-to-go-public-in-spac-deal-valuing-it-at-1-5-billion"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;) To welcome them, &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; staffers pooled their money and bought a Cameo of Fiona the hippo. Less than a month after the deal closed, BuzzFeed fired 47 &lt;em&gt;HuffPo&lt;/em&gt; journalists in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/mar/09/huffpost-layoffs-buzzfeed-jonah-peretti"&gt;in an online meeting&lt;/a&gt; with the password “spr!ngisH3r3.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="45YZY1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Staffers are trying to figure out how much their options are worth&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I0yttV"&gt;BuzzFeed turned a profit in 2020 for the first time since 2014, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/buzzfeed-nears-deal-to-go-public-via-spac-eyeing-digital-media-rollup-11624485898"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Complex did not; its profits actually fell 14 percent last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BICZ1R"&gt;The deal gives BuzzFeed more cash — $438 million, about $150 million of which is debt financing. Because it is going public through this merger, rather than an IPO, the company wasn’t constrained from giving future projections. In a&lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60cbbb36879f9269a9b2c1e5/t/60d46000058c421e525ff0d2/1624530951725/BuzzFeed+Investor+Presentation.pdf"&gt; slide deck&lt;/a&gt;, BuzzFeed projected that its 2021 profit will be $57 million before taxes and $117 million in 2022. Peretti &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/media/buzzfeed-merger-spac.html"&gt;suggested in a press conference&lt;/a&gt; that his acquisition spree isn’t over with Complex, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfThav"&gt;Now, staffers are trying to figure out how much their options are worth, two current employees told me. Some people who left and bought their options on the way out are just hoping to break even. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwDPKN"&gt;Smith, the former &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; head, referred me to his &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; disclosure about his stock and declined to say anything further (&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/business/media/coronavirus-union-newsrooms.html"&gt;In April 2020&lt;/a&gt;: “I retain stock options in the company, which could bring me into conflict with The Times’s ethics standards. I also agreed to divest those options as quickly as I could, and certainly by the end of the year.” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/business/media/capitol-anthime-gionet-buzzfeed-vine.html"&gt;In January 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Smith again disclosed he still held some options).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="gG21nz"&gt;In the meantime, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; has been aggressively poaching BuzzFeed journalists. Besides Smith, the former editor-in-chief, and Warzel, who worked as an opinion columnist at &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;before launching his own subscription newsletter, Virginia Hughes, Davey Alba, Sheera Frenkel, and Sapna Maheshwari are among the more than 20 journalists the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;has lured away. Today, as BuzzFeed announced its SPAC deal, &lt;a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/ryan-mac-joining-technology-team/"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;announced that it took one more&lt;/a&gt;: Ryan Mac, who recently won a Polk Award for his tech coverage. In the end, it seems an awful lot of the journalists who’d attempted to redefine journalism for the internet age defected to the stuffiest, most old-school journalism institution of them all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Nord N200 5G review: T-Mobile’s best phone under $250</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re on the Un-carrier, the N200 offers 5G and a high-quality screen for the right price.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6BOFeg"&gt;The answer to whether you should buy the $239 OnePlus Nord N200 5G depends a lot on who your wireless carrier is. If you’re on T-Mobile — and thanks to a generous trade-in offer and a carrier exclusive, you probably are if you’re considering the N200 — then this is a fine, basic device that will allow you to take advantage of the company’s good 5G network at a very low price. The N200 5G will only work on Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s 4G networks, however, so if you’re with either of those carriers, it’s not your best option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Z2160"&gt;Why does your carrier make such a difference? Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G networks aren’t great at the moment, so using the N200 as a 4G-only device isn’t actually a big deal right now. But they’ll start getting much better over the next couple of years thanks to some newly acquired spectrum, and when that happens, being stuck on LTE could become a real drawback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIgNgq"&gt;The N200 5G has a few things going for it aside from 5G connectivity, starting with a big 5,000mAh battery. It has a large 6.5-inch display with a faster refresh rate that’s one of the best available in this class. You’ll also get three years of security updates, which isn’t &lt;em&gt;stellar&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;but is an improvement over the two years more common among sub-$300 phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZaQMw8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10620908"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OQOFEo"&gt;On the downside, the camera system is basic. While overall phone performance is fine for day-to-day email and browsing, it’s a little slow with more processing-intensive tasks. And while you can get by on the 64GB of built-in storage, most people will need to add in the cost of a MicroSD card to their purchase for expanded storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OHbxB"&gt;The N200 is an acceptable, inexpensive 5G device, and it’s even a relatively good deal as a 4G device at the moment. But your mobile carrier and your inclination toward keeping your phone for more than one or two years makes recommending the N200 5G complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hF4edUedso0aYhx715Y3XtHFSZw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677496/ajohnson_210623_4644_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N200 5G is one of few devices in its class to offer a screen with 90Hz refresh rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cwU1sh"&gt;OnePlus N200 5G screen, battery, and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sMDXOX"&gt;As far as screens on budget devices go, the N200 5G has one of the nicest out there. It’s a big 6.5-inch LCD panel with 1080p resolution, which is an upgrade from 720p that’s more typical in this class. It also stands out with a faster 90Hz refresh rate, making scrolling and animations look just a little smoother than usual. The screen is usable even in very bright, direct sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pP5DfO"&gt;The N200’s battery life is very good, thanks to a big 5,000mAh cell. It also supports 18W charging with the included wired charger — not &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; fast &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;like OnePlus’ pricier devices&lt;/a&gt;, but good enough to take it from 12 percent to a full charge in about two hours. With moderate use I got two days out of the N200 before I dipped into low battery territory; a full day of heavy use should be no problem, and many will see it last well into the second day, if not longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oBPkla"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most people will need to add a MicroSD card for more space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5gxBHT"&gt;The N200 uses a Snapdragon 480 5G processor, which is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;relatively new chipset designed for budget 5G phones&lt;/a&gt; like this one. It’s coupled with 4GB of RAM and keeps up well in day-to-day use switching apps and scrolling social media. It doesn’t take a lot to push it outside of its comfort zone where you’ll notice slight hesitations and stuttering, especially with intensive tasks like zooming in and out of Google Maps and starting navigation. But considering the price, it feels appropriately equipped to provide usable daily performance over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwKCyE"&gt;While you might be able to get by on the N200’s 64GB of built-in storage, it’s on the lower side and a healthy chunk of that is occupied by system files. Most people will need to add a MicroSD card for more space, so consider that extra $20 or so part of the overall cost of the phone unless you’re really frugal with your storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yjFr7J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the N200’s 5G connectivity works on T-Mobile, but on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon the phone is 4G-only&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8OAKrz"&gt;As noted above, the N200’s 5G connectivity works on T-Mobile, but on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon the phone is 4G-only. It supports sub-6GHz 5G only — no super-fast mmWave, but that’s not a big deal since it’s hard to find and T-Mobile doesn’t offer much of it. There’s also no support for the C-band spectrum that will be put to use for 5G starting early next year, but that would be a bigger deal if the phone could use AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon 5G. It can’t, so it’s not. What you do get access to is T-Mobile’s 5G sub-6 5G network, which is good and has broad coverage, even if it’s not mind-bogglingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTYZKp"&gt;Android 11 is loaded on the N200 out of the box, and OnePlus says it will provide one more major OS platform update during the phone’s life span. It will also get the aforementioned three years of security update support, which is a better-than-average policy for a budget Android phone. OnePlus’ implementation of Android is less fussy than most and is mercifully low on clutter and pre-downloaded apps. It’s a grown-up-looking interface that’s about as close as you’ll get to a “pure” Android experience outside of Google’s own Pixel phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zHgFURqjsIIuX5f-FJa0V9wrf6M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677497/ajohnson_210623_4644_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N200’s main rear-facing camera uses a 13-megapixel sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vhpB9d"&gt;OnePlus N200 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="m4NjF8"&gt;The N200’s camera performance is acceptable, if a bit disappointing even considering the phone’s price. Included are a 13-megapixel f/2.2 main camera, 2-megapixel f/2.4 macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. Around front there’s a 13-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3weoTJ"&gt;That 13-megapixel main camera will do fine for snapshots in good lighting, but it quickly reaches its limits with high-contrast scenes, like landscapes with deep shadows and bright highlights. Noise starts to creep into shots taken in moderate lighting conditions, like interiors, and dark scenes show a lot of smeared details and noise. Night mode works well enough to preserve a little more detail, but it’s only suitable for scenes without moving subjects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cnALW6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10621086"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DWs5CO"&gt;The N200’s camera system may be more of a disappointment considering that the higher-tier Nord N10 5G’s 64-megapixel camera is surprisingly good. The N10 costs $60 more than the N200 (a full 25 percent higher) so it’s not a totally fair comparison, but I can’t help feeling that the N200 could have been a little better equipped. Pixel count isn’t everything, but in this case, a newer, higher-resolution sensor would probably have made a significant difference in detail retention and its handling of high-contrast scenes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xsuqtRm9MA0ww26SXO3QNUW-LRM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677495/ajohnson_210623_4644_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re on T-Mobile, the N200 is a good pick for a nice screen and 5G at a low price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XqudbD"&gt;If you’re considering the OnePlus N200 5G because T-Mobile is offering you a good deal on one, then I think there’s a good argument for this phone. It doesn’t offer a lot in the way of nice extras and features, but you will get a good screen, long battery life, and a 5G device that should last a few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHGDJZ"&gt;If you live in an area with poor T-Mobile 5G coverage, or you’re with another wireless carrier, then you’ll be better served by another option. You could save some money and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"&gt;go with the $179 4G-only N100&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a lot of the same features. The screen isn’t quite as detailed (720p vs. 1080p) but you still get that 90Hz refresh rate, big battery, and nice OnePlus user interface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NRBOsJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;you’ll get a good screen, long battery life, and a 5G device that should last a few years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ABv6hi"&gt;On the other hand, if you can spend a little more, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;$279 Samsung A32 5G is worth considering&lt;/a&gt;. The interface is more cluttered and its screen isn’t as nice with its 720p resolution and standard 60Hz refresh rate, but almost every other aspect of the device is meaningfully upgraded, from the camera to wider 5G compatibility to a stronger four-year security support policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="2h8CDU"&gt;All of that said, if you’re comfortable with the N200’s shortcomings and you’re tempted by a sweet deal from T-Mobile, I won’t be the one to stand in your way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Lucid Air is nearing the finish line</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GZnUzk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429319/lucid-motors-air-electric-sedan-price-specs-range-reveal"&gt;The Lucid Air&lt;/a&gt; has been in the works for a very long time, nearly a decade by some accounts. The first time I rode in the 1,000-horsepower electric sedan was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/9/14186108/lucid-motors-air-electric-car-ride-along-ces-2017"&gt;in Las Vegas in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, when Lucid Motors had an engineering prototype on hand at the Consumer Electronics Show. I rode in the Air again just this past Monday, in a near-final version of the massive, roomy vehicle. Suffice to say, it was better the second time around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rshbcg"&gt;In the four years between then and now, the EV startup struggled to raise money and very nearly went out of business. But thanks to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/20/17757218/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-funding-tesla-billion"&gt;timely investment from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund&lt;/a&gt;, in which it put up its own intellectual property as collateral, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;recent SPAC deal&lt;/a&gt; that will leave the company with $4.4 billion in cash, Lucid Motors is now on track to starting delivering its first EVs to customers later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AUjuC6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I rode in the Grand Touring version of the Lucid Air&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oRU2lb"&gt;In advance of that, the company is opening up design studios (just don’t call ‘em dealerships) in bustling neighborhoods around the country, in the hopes that the reopening economy and increased foot traffic will send more EV-curious customers their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vub8Pz"&gt;I rode in the Grand Touring version of the Lucid Air, the second highest level trim with just 800-horsepower and a starting price of $139,000. The company says that this version, with its 113kWh battery pack, will get up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21358613/lucid-motor-air-electric-vehicle-ev-range-517-miles"&gt;517 miles of range&lt;/a&gt; on a single charge, which is really just an unfathomable amount of battery power. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENVOgNI20WLtwK6b-q7CTpE3XTg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677729/ahawkins_210623_4646_0007.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NsLf9X"&gt;Just like last time, I came away impressed with the car’s acceleration, which should come as no surprise. Pretty much every EV on the road today has near instantaneous torque, and trying to compare one EV’s acceleration to another has become a bit of a joke. Lucid said the Air can sprint from 0 to 60mph in two seconds, while Tesla says the Model S Plaid can do it in under two seconds. Can you tell the difference? Of course not. And there are so many caveats involved in both claims that it hardly seems worth mentioning. Did the electric car go fast? Yes it did.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWoddB"&gt;The exterior design hasn’t changed much from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/28/15052752/lucid-motors-air-electric-car-alpha-photos"&gt;alpha prototype we saw in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. With its rounded edges, low-slung stance, and dramatic glass roof, the Air makes a great first impression — which is exactly what Derek Jenkins, the former Mazda designer and Lucid’s senior vice president of design and brand, is hoping for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yd8lNR"&gt;After all, Lucid is about to run head first into a very competitive market. The luxury EV segment is already crowded with the likes of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274376/audi-etron-gt-rs-electric-car-specs-price"&gt;Audi E-Tron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/14/13628872/jaguar-ipace-concept-electric-car-suv-unveiled-la-auto-show-2016-photos"&gt;Jaguar I-Pace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range"&gt;Porsche Taycan&lt;/a&gt;. Other vehicles are soon to follow, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375877/mercedes-benz-eqs-ev-s-class-specs-hands-on"&gt;Mercedes-Benz EQS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;Cadillac Lyriq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335807/bmw-i4-sedan-ev-m-performance-range-photos"&gt;BMW i4&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357789/lexus-lf-z-electrified-concept-car-ev-toyota-electric"&gt;Lexus LF-Z&lt;/a&gt;. And don’t forget the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528963/tesla-model-s-plaid-ev-price-specs-range-speed"&gt;Model S Plaid&lt;/a&gt;, which started rolling out to customers earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1JwOSRf-GZKjIzRQDP_pOX8qvio=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677726/ahawkins_210623_4646_0004.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BQagPW"&gt;Under direction of the former Model S lead engineer Peter Rawlinson, then Lucid Motors’ CTO, now its CEO, there is a sense in the automotive world that Lucid has the internal knowledge and technical chops to tease Tesla’s grip as maker of the ultimate electric luxury sedan. It seems as if every electric vehicle that’s released these days is inevitably held up against Tesla for a comparison. But few electric vehicles have actually Tesla DNA running through their bloodstream. The Lucid Air is one of those vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcBN5O"&gt;“Model S is obviously a pivotal vehicle,” Jenkins said. “This car is going to offer a lot more space, a lot more comfort, nicer material, trim, cargo... I just think it’s a more luxury-focused product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzsFOA"&gt;The interior of the Air is simple without straying into minimalist territory. The main feature is a 34-inch, high-resolution 5K horizontal curved display which starts to the left of the steering wheel and stretches to the middle of the dash. A second, retractable screen known as the “Pilot Panel” sits above the center console. And with the touch of a button, the screen folds away neatly into the dash, revealing some extra cargo space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="l5xXIb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I just think it’s a more luxury-focused product”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UrH9dk"&gt;The two screens can interact with each other, too. Jenkins demonstrated how items on the main screen can be “swiped” down on to the Pilot Panel for further perusal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkOTzl"&gt;“We really wanted to get back to just a simple, elegant screen dedicated for the driver to make the driver experience awesome,” he said. “And then have a nice panel that’s for both driver and passenger, and make sure there’s still a relationship between the two.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/csBmLhSng9YeZgr-AvS17J_aBHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677738/ahawkins_210623_4646_0015.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LBOVTq"&gt;The ride itself was fine, with the Air’s suspension (which is not air suspension, but conventional springs and active shocks) handling itself well on the cobblestone streets. Despite its wider than average stance, the sedan was able to slip in and out of some tight spaces with relative ease. And while traffic in Manhattan was generally pretty terrible, the driver did get the opportunity to demonstrate the acceleration when the cars cleared momentarily on the West Side Highway. (Reader, I woo’d.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aofTBA"&gt;Lucid’s retail strategy — opening studios in areas with heavy foot traffic — is smart, but the company will still run into headwinds as it tries to navigate the legal landscape. Dozens of states have laws on the books that protect car dealerships and &lt;a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/03/22/electric-vehicles-direct-sales-dealerships-evs/"&gt;prevent direct-to-consumer sales by automotive newcomers&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla has managed to get by with some exemptions, and Lucid is hoping to piggyback on that success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9oW2z"&gt;“In each state, it’s either allowed or allowed with conditions,” said Zak Edson, Lucid’s senior director of retail operations. “We’re working with local authorities to try to find a way to make it allowed.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8atn3ox0auR1Un5FJuAcbBrFz4s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677733/ahawkins_210623_4646_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Zo4Pd1"&gt;New York is one such state that bars a manufacturer from selling cars directly to customers. As such, anyone visiting the company’s Manhattan studio will be directed to make a reservation online, and when they actually take delivery, the car will likely come from another state, like Illinois, which allows direct-to-consumer sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PItudm"&gt;The New York studio is Lucid’s seventh, with Chicago, Boston, and Phoenix locations slated to open by year’s end, and 21 total by mid-2022. Lucid plans to open service and delivery centers to support each showroom, including one in New Jersey for New York-area owners. The majority of Lucid’s service calls will be handled by mobile technicians, with Edson predicting that “80 percent” of repairs will be handled in customer driveways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u2AJtM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was a herculean effort to get to this point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CBMM7X"&gt;Lucid had previously said it would start making deliveries in the spring of 2021, but that’s been delayed to later this year. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21739985/lucid-motors-ev-factory-construction-arizona"&gt;finished the first phase&lt;/a&gt; of its $700 million factory in Arizona late last year, and has built over 100 vehicles so far. “We are already producing cars at the factory, with the focus on ensuring the highest possible quality for a high-end luxury brand,” a spokesperson said. Next year, the company plans to unveil an SUV, codenamed “Project Gravity,” which won’t go on sale until 2023.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxfgJ5"&gt;It was a herculean effort to get to this point, and Lucid very nearly didn’t make it. Starting a new car company from scratch is nearly impossible to do, as evidenced by Tesla’s several close brushes with total disaster. Lucid was no different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjvUaX"&gt;It’s not a guarantee that Lucid will succeed and the Air will become the new Model S. There’s no question that the company is about to reach an important milestone. But everything else is still up in the air. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xgimi Horizon Pro 4K all-in-one projector review: more for less</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Android TV on the go&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="C1ZrzC"&gt;Xgimi’s latest all-in-one smart projector not only looks good, but it supports native 4K and HDR content. Better yet, the &lt;a href="https://us.xgimi.com/products/horizon-series-3"&gt;Xgimi Horizon Pro&lt;/a&gt; boots straight into Android TV and features a pair of 8W Harman Kardon speakers that sound great despite the projector’s compact size. Couple that with a bright LED light source, built-in Wi-Fi, and the ability to automatically avoid obstacles when determining where to project the image, and you’ve got a 300-inch display that can go anywhere there’s a power outlet and a flat surface. Hell, it’ll even double as a Bluetooth speaker in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8of6k"&gt;I’ve never been a fan of smart televisions when it’s so easy to offload those smarts to a more capable streaming box or stick, which can be neatly hidden out of sight. But it’s much harder to do the same thing with a projector when they’re mounted to ceilings or placed on a coffee table for an impromptu movie or gaming night with friends. With projectors, the more self-contained they are, the better. The Xgimi Horizon Pro measures just 8.2 x 8.6 x 5.4 inches / 6.6 pounds (208.4 x 218.4 x 136.2mm / 2.9kg), making it a fairly portable party box. And Xgimi’s “no advertising” pitch is refreshing at a time when ads are increasingly polluting the television viewing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37hKaX"&gt;I’ve been using the $1,699 Xgimi Horizon Pro for a few weeks now, using it to stream media from Disney Plus, YouTube, Apple TV Plus, Amazon Prime Video, Plex, and HBO Max, to name just a few of the Android TV integrations available on the Google Play Store. The notable omission is Netflix, which isn’t officially supported on the Horizon Pro. While I did manage to install the app via a hacky workaround, it’s not something most people would be willing or even capable of doing. And because Netflix is used by over 200 million people around the world, the lack of official support is a big deal that you should be aware of at the outset of a review for a nearly $2,000 projector from a company you might never have heard of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5ODAuW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10623608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jHqNXZ"&gt;Xgimi got its start in 2014 in China. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/30/11329640/XGIMI-Z4-Aurora-hands-on-review"&gt;officially debuted in Western markets in 2016&lt;/a&gt; as part of an Indiegogo program to promote established Chinese brands. The company has since developed a loyal fan base for its smart projectors that favor a mix of good design, ample specs, and low pricing. If the Z4 Aurora I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/30/11329640/XGIMI-Z4-Aurora-hands-on-review"&gt;tested back in 2016&lt;/a&gt; was a work in progress, then Xgimi’s new Horizon Pro flagship is the culmination of those efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DgYCklHpsYGhFw9UO23shrhR5_4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22680886/verge_DSC_5569_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Horizon Pro includes everything you need for home theater on the go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Pp9iEG"&gt;To start, the Horizon Pro’s integrated AI makes setup a breeze. Turn it on and point the lens at a wall or projector screen, and Xgimi’s spatial algorithms will detect any obstacles and calculate what it thinks is the ideal picture size, location, and image brightness. The whole detection process takes less than 15 seconds upon first boot. The automatic screen adaption is close to magical at times and simplifies a process that can be laborious on other projectors even when Xgimi gets things wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fFt45v4A77ORpX7uECN9SfoQv6c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22680873/xgimi_auto_keystone.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xgimi will automatically avoid obstacles to find the best image location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0C2URs"&gt;In my testing, the AI generally found the gap on my living room wall above the TV, but only with the projector mounted to a tripod in order to first aim it upward. I still had to manually tweak the keystone in order to extract the largest display possible. It did much better when the image was cast onto a dedicated projector screen, quickly finding the surface and neatly aligning the projected image between the defined black borders. Fortunately, the Horizon Pro drops you into a manual keystone mode after every automatic attempt in order to position the screen exactly where you want it, even at some fairly extreme angles. The Horizon Pro can level the picture when tilted on its side by as much as 45 degrees, with a keystone correction of ±40 degrees on the horizontal and vertical axis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HH8NW8"&gt;Beware that those extreme angles will create elongated light shadows around the keystone-corrected image. It’s an unfortunate side effect of the Horizon Pro’s DLP engine having to project “black pixels” of light onto the wall where the projected image naturally falls. This overflow of light can be distracting when viewing dark scenes in very dark rooms, so it’s best to use as little keystone correction as possible. Using a projector screen with a heavy black border can help minimize the effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yr8CBEO92hMYxaO2pPBFyiBDPu0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22680888/verge_DSC_5553_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The remote control is a joy to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OEYhzsw-prI3LOJzsYq1JvNfPNs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22680889/verge_DSC_5590_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Controls are built into the top of the projector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zo6e5kWgfBGYKPLUrVoFlYI92Y8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22680885/verge_DSC_5538_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;4K HDR for less than $2,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="l4SIPT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10622408"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o4AayE"&gt;Xgimi’s brushed aluminum remote control is a joy to use. The tubular remote looks as good as its weighted mass feels in the hand. It includes only a minimal set of controls, but I didn’t miss anything. From the top down, you’ll find a built-in mic and buttons for power, settings, and a dedicated Google Assistant button. Below the D-pad are buttons for back, menu, home, volume down and up, and focus. It can’t control an on-screen pointer like other Xgimi projectors, which might disappoint some. (I didn’t miss it.) It’s also not rechargeable like previous Xgimi remotes, opting for a pair of AAA batteries instead. Conveniently, the settings button slides a useful Shortcut Settings menu over your content to quickly toggle image and sound modes. (More on those later.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4eSXW"&gt;Brightness, measured in ANSI lumens, is one of the most critical measurements of any projector, especially one capable of 4K (3840 x 2160) HDR. Xgimi lists the Horizon Pro at 2200 ANSI lumens, which is bright, especially for a portable DLP projector, but not anything close to what a modern LCD or OLED TV can produce. As such, contrast and HDR content suffer by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUsybC"&gt;I don’t have blackout blinds, which means the Horizon Pro isn’t watchable until about mid-afternoon (when the sun shifts to the other side of my house). From there, it has to be set to the brightest mode, the blinds have to be closed, and the projection is limited to a size of about 60 inches in order to compress those lumens into a tighter rectangle. Given my choice, I’d rather fire up my 55-inch LG OLED during the day, so long as I don’t have to carry it anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bsPbs"&gt;It’s in darkened rooms where the Horizon Pro really comes alive. Here, those 2200 lumens provide enough contrast to make 4K HDR content pop. It reminds me just how much I’ve missed viewing films on a richly colorful giant screen ever since my local cinema shut down last year. The Horizon Pro does a good job with 1080p and 720p content in my testing. And let’s face it, the majority of legacy content viewed on this 4K projector will require upscaling long into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The image is watchable in the late afternoon but can’t compete with traditional TVs. (Non-4K live broadcast)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OSerkLRIPnKbVmPdiJO7eMLArQk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22680878/verge_DSC_4748_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At night is when the projected image really comes alive. (Non-4K live broadcast)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SahWDXmdXr9-HDVtaNrU3bbRRnE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22680879/verge_DSC_4822_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Projection from extreme angles can create a distracting light shadow. (4K HDR)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nc60YhBbWQOv0wkeF3ceTrTnLD8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22680880/verge_DSC_5122_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The light shadow can be avoided by projecting as directly as possible. (4K HDR)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tRATYD"&gt;The Horizon Pro comes with four optimized Image Modes. Movie mode includes 60Hz MEMC motion compensation, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127329/how-to-turn-off-motion-smoothing-tv-lg-samsung-vizio-sony-roku"&gt;I promptly disabled&lt;/a&gt;. Football mode is designed for fast-paced sports. Office mode is optimized for presentations, and Game mode is meant to reduce lag for consoles connected to the Horizon Pro’s two HDMI inputs. There’s also a Custom mode where every setting can be tweaked at will. I noticed very little difference between Movie and Sports modes, so I left the projector in Movie mode for most of my testing. There’s also a general Brightness setting, which can be adapted automatically using a built-in ambient light sensor. I ignored the sensor and left the projector in Bright mode to help it overcome the long summer days here in Northern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2udCFk"&gt;Regarding gaming, the Xgimi Horizon Pro won’t help you bring home any professional titles.  Its input latency hovers around 35ms, which is above the &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/tests/inputs/input-lag"&gt;25ms that &lt;em&gt;Rtings&lt;/em&gt; generally considers acceptable&lt;/a&gt; on TVs, and its HDMI ports are version 2.0, so you don’t get HDMI 2.1’s gaming-focused features like support for variable refresh rates. But those specs should be more than good enough if you just want to project a 300-inch Nintendo Switch screen onto your wall for an evening of &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4W7JD"&gt;Now, as to Netflix support, Xgimi tells me that it’s unlikely to come soon, even though Disney Plus was added recently. According to a Xgimi spokesperson, Netflix requires its own certification process due to its proprietary &lt;a href="https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/"&gt;Open Connect program&lt;/a&gt; that works with ISPs to make Netflix streams more efficient. While Xgimi is applying for certification, I’m told to not expect anything in the immediate future. As such, I had to install the Aptoide TV store in order to install the latest version of Netflix, which means fretting about malware. Alternatively, you can cast Netflix content from a phone or tablet, thanks to the Horizon Pro’s built-in Chromecast feature, which is a safer, easier option for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQWfR7"&gt;The sound produced by the Horizon Pro is good — not just compared to what you’d normally get from projector speakers but also in relation to the Bluetooth speaker you’d typically want to use with portable beamers. I easily preferred the sound produced by the two integrated 8W Harman Kardon speakers over my trusty (4W) Jawbone Big Jambox Bluetooth speaker when listening side-by-side. The audio from the Horizon Pro sounded fuller by comparison. Obviously, we’re not talking home theater quality (for that, there’s optical audio out), but it’s good enough that you won’t feel compelled to carry an extra speaker around should you take the projection show mobile (as I did multiple times). The Horizon Pro even lets you turn off the LED light and use the projector as a Bluetooth speaker, which I did quite a bit while writing this review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilepcf"&gt;There are three preset sound modes available, which are aimed at Movie, Music, and Sports. The audio can be further refined with a Volume Balance setting and a DTS Studio toggle to enable a virtualized surround-sound audio experience that’s meant to enhance dialogue and bass. While the different modes and settings do alter the sound output by making it seem wider, deeper, or louder (but with a notable hiss), I left everything set to Movie mode with both DTS Studio and Volume Balance turned on since I was using the Horizon Pro primarily for TV episodes and film, some sports and gaming, and occasional music over Bluetooth. I did enjoy the Sports mode with DTS and Volume Balance both turned off for a more arena-type experience, but the minor improvements usually weren’t worth the effort of toggling all of the options each time I changed content types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vHRdT8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10623566"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qbh5as"&gt;Other observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="V05MsR"&gt;The Horizon Pro runs Android TV 10.0, which some prefer over the newer Google TV-inspired UI that sometimes favors promoted content over your own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Yw6hU0"&gt;It lacks a lens cover, which makes transport a bit worrisome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="s5sTjq"&gt;It powers on and boots into Android TV in about 45 seconds, or less than five seconds from standby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="G97CPO"&gt;Air is sucked in from the front and exits out the back, which can be quite warm if the projector is sitting on a table in front of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="M90PyC"&gt;There are four manual controls along the top of the projector: on/off, play/pause, volume up, and volume down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NTL5S9"&gt;It lacks newer Wi-Fi 6 support, but I was able to stream 4K HDR content without issue when connected at 5GHz to my nearby access point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iO3Jxb"&gt;Automatic keystone correction can be activated any time the projector senses motion. It was too sensitive for my needs as any bump would start a new hunt and override my carefully constructed rectangle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cnFloo"&gt;It’s relatively quiet for a projector at around 30dB, but that’s loud enough to hear the fan above Sir David Attenborough’s voiceover work if you’re seated near the projector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mDlWaiVNbfJk3Ohv4NBp2unpmm4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22680928/verge_IMG_7005_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An impromptu UEFA Champions League soccer match viewing with friends made possible by the Horizon Pro’s portability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ghzN1u"&gt;$1,699 is a lot to spend on anything, so you’d better have a clear idea how a projector like the Xgimi Horizon Pro fits into your life before pulling the trigger. But that price isn’t too bad when you consider &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/an-awesome-projector/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wirecutter’s&lt;/em&gt; budget 4K projector&lt;/a&gt; lists for about $3,000, and the Xgimi is $100 less than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21453070/best-projector-home-theater"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; budget 4K pick&lt;/a&gt;, which isn’t nearly as portable or connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="2pBTbB"&gt;Importantly, the projectors that Xgimi is making for Western markets in 2021 are light-years ahead of what it started selling back in 2016. If you’ve got the cash and a dark room, then the Horizon Pro won’t disappoint at home or on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on the business of Windows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ApALyWD4z9QB0o8ehN7WR1R-tjI=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69503200/VRG_ILLO_Decoder_Satya_Nadella_s.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Microsoft wants to make Windows 11 more flexible and open&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mI1Chj"&gt;We’ve got a special episode of &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; today — I’m talking to Satya Nadella, the CEO and chairman of Microsoft. Satya’s always been one of my favorite tech execs to talk to, and Microsoft has some big news for us to discuss: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22544124/windows-11-microsoft-event-news-next-generation-interface"&gt;it announced Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, which comes with an all-new design, a bunch of new features, and the ability to run Android apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ELjOZ"&gt;That’s all wrapped up in some big changes to how apps are &lt;em&gt;distributed&lt;/em&gt; on Windows: Microsoft is opening up the Windows app store, allowing developers to put more kinds of apps in the store, and it’s allowing developers to bypass the fees in the store if they want to use their own payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1yR2D"&gt;If you’ve been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457400/spotify-horacio-gutierrez-apple-app-store-interview-decoder"&gt;listening to &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you know there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;a lot of controversy about Apple’s App Store fees&lt;/a&gt; and the control it has over developers on its platforms. There are lawsuits, there are bills in Congress, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;and there are unhappy Europeans&lt;/a&gt;. Nadella and Microsoft are explicitly positioning Windows as the opposite, saying it’s more open and that the goal of Windows is to allow other companies to build big businesses and platforms of their own without Microsoft getting in the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1a2t7"&gt;If you think that sounds like a pretty intense role reversal for Apple and Microsoft, well, you’re not wrong. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17827042/antitrust-1990s-microsoft-google-aol-monopoly-lawsuits-history"&gt;Twenty years ago, Microsoft was facing down regulators&lt;/a&gt; while the Mac was the more open platform. But I was curious how Nadella felt about it, how he thinks about Windows as a platform and what Microsoft’s responsibilities are, and how he thinks the various antitrust bills in Congress will affect Microsoft’s plans for the future. And I definitely wanted to know about the decision to run Android apps on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DziDL5"&gt;A couple notes: Satya talks about Azure and “the edge” a lot. Azure is one of Microsoft’s cloud computing platforms that competes with Amazon’s AWS and one of its biggest and most important lines of business. And if cloud computing is about computers far away from you in data centers, the edge is about the computers closest to you — like Windows PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQSnPr"&gt;Nadella also mentions “aggregators” in the context of the Windows store. He’s talking about places in the user interface where lots of people show up and are directed to the other apps and services they need. This is a reference to &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/"&gt;Ben Thompson’s aggregation theory&lt;/a&gt;, which actually comes up on &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKaTXb"&gt;Other things you’ll hear him say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="akLR5o"&gt;NUI, which stands for natural user interface, like voice and gestures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EFYzUH"&gt;POSIX, which is a set of operating system standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9d424g"&gt;WSL, which is the part of Windows that lets you run Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="54vzWo"&gt;PWAs, which are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/11/17207964/web-apps-quality-pwa-webassembly-houdini"&gt;progressive web apps&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="S9gg2x"&gt;UWPs, which are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645609/microsofts-universal-windows-app-dead-microsoft-store-windows-store"&gt;Universal Windows Platform apps&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9vDJDC"&gt;HoloLens, which is Microsoft’s augmented reality headset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ceSC0V"&gt;Pat, who is Pat Gelsinger, CEO of Intel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="WwPLLE"&gt;This one’s deep. I think you’re going to like it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kQzPrR"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP3710346080&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ius7Gc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following transcript has been edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PV2mHD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft announced Windows 11 today. There is a lot to talk about, but I want to start with some personal news, as they say. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537683/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-chairman-bill-gates-john-thompson"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You only recently became the chairman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; as well as the CEO of Microsoft. What does that actually mean to be the chairman?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMuDEu"&gt;The reality is — as you know — when it comes to corporate governance in the United States at least, it’s really the lead independent director who has full authority over all of the people who are part of the management, including me and my compensation and my performan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0Cajk"&gt;Basically they hire and fire me. The independent directors are the folks who have the governance. If anything, the way I interpret any change here is fundamentally how do we bring the management team and the board together around what is Microsoft’s purpose [and] strategy? How do we hold ourselves accountable as a team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfqQc2"&gt;So orchestrating it, as somebody best described it to me — maybe I should attend more meetings, or more committee meetings. But I think of this as just a natural outgrowth of what I’ve been doing for the last seven years. There’s no real change, quite frankly, around the rigor of corporate governance and who has truly got the hire and fire authority on the CEO. And that’s the independent directors of the Microsoft board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwIXJF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You led right into my next question, which is — who’s your boss? To whom are you most accountable?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ISFXJ"&gt;To the board of directors and the lead independent director in some sense, if you think about it. If your boss is defined as the person who ultimately can hold you accountable, it’s the independent directors of the Microsoft board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meATfi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I ask every executive who comes on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; this question: what is your decision-making framework? Microsoft is a vast business. You have multiple lines of business, multiple billion-plus-dollar lines of business. How do you make decisions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQoXZO"&gt;I try to simplify this. Maybe you and I’ve talked about this in the past — I’ve had this framework which I’ve been consistent with ever since I became CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmUbsk"&gt;It starts with mission, it ends with culture, and in between [there is] what’s our worldview, what’s our strategy. I think of the things that are constant as that sense of purpose and mission and culture, and the things that are temporal are worldviews and strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbnuPZ"&gt;To your point about the decision-making framework: anything we do has to be aligned with that first question, which is: is this something that makes sense given who we are as a company? And more importantly, if we go about doing that, does it add unique value in the world? Is that something that both differentiates us competitively and is that something that’s useful for people? That’s, to me, the most helpful way to [run] the businesses we are in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPx8bd"&gt;When we say “what does the CEO do?” They have to pick and choose which businesses you’re in. Then they have to set standards on what cultural values are expressed internally as experienced in the lived experience. And so those are the two things I try to go back to all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hI8YZg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about a big decision. Several years ago, you and I were talking and you said, “Windows, we could just &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21071108/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-iot-windows-ios-android-future"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rename it Azure Edge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, if people would let us. It’s just an extension of our big business, which is Azure. We’re in a mobile-first, cloud-first world.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rk8yPm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 2019, I think you had said to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wired&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, “The operating system is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-surface-duo-neo-phone/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;no longer the most important layer for us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;” But today, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546791/microsoft-windows-11-announcement-features-updates"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows 11 was announced&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I listened to you and Panos Panay, who’s the chief product officer at Microsoft, discuss how the pandemic really refocused your attention on Windows and what it could be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3haSg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me about that process, because it does feel like a big shift.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ffu5J"&gt;All of those statements that you said I’ve made earlier are all still true because Windows doesn’t live in isolation. Windows lives in a world where there is a lot of cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xf2zNU"&gt;There are multiple cloud providers and a lot of cloud computing. So anything that is a client operating system ultimately does rendezvous with cloud computing. In that sense, technically and business-model-wise and usage and experience-wise, it’s the cloud and the edge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NaoE9T"&gt;The billion-plus users of Windows, for sure, we think of from a distributed computing architecture perspective as the edge of Azure. And you could even say the Windows folks would look at Azure as the cloud for Windows. So that’s, I think, absolutely right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ga7Fd7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eKNtHS"&gt;The other point is it also lives in an ecosystem. Let’s say Windows has a billion users. So does Android. So does iOS. In fact, Android and iOS will have more than a billion users perhaps, or maybe Android has 2 billion, [and] maybe iOS is similar to Windows size or what have you. But the reality is any Windows user — we have to start with the assumption that they have a phone and that phone may be Android and iOS and we have to design for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFr4BK"&gt;I do think that operating systems are important, but they’re important in so far as they compose with everything else that’s part of my life, whether it’s other devices with other operating systems, [or] whether it is clouds that I use, which are powering some of the applications and experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4j6YL"&gt;It’s a practical reality, really. Let’s meet Windows users where they are, and meet their current needs and unmet, unarticulated needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2P7JSN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don’t think that the pandemic pushed Windows in a different direction? That was very much the sense that I got. Everyone is working from home, everyone is staring at a Windows laptop for many more hours of a day than they might have been previously.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nss3O"&gt;Absolutely. There is no question about that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSbQcr"&gt;What happened in the pandemic, even for me — I didn’t have a home office. Suddenly, I found myself [saying], “Oh my God, not only do I need a home office. I have all my girls home and they need all their own independent PCs.” Without the PC, we wouldn’t be able to do remote education, remote work, telemedicine visits. It became mission critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ry0YZf"&gt;All screens in life matter. So that realization that larger screens on which Windows runs are super important, because not all tasks can be done on a mobile device, became abundantly clear. We came out of the pandemic with — I would say — a renewed sense of why we need to do some of our very best work in serving [the] customers we have today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXDqCL"&gt;That’s why I think about improvements to Windows Update. I want to celebrate that as much as any feature because it’s important. It matters to our users. They tell me in my inbox loud and clear every day about what all I should be doing with Windows Update, and I take that seriously now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xqtW6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I like the idea that you were at home and your family was at home and suddenly Windows Update got real for you, too. My team is always telling me that whenever it’s about me, it becomes much more important. Was there any of that going on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GaEPhV"&gt;Oh, for sure. Although I’ll have to admit that the people inside the company are a lot more responsible than waiting for a CEO to have a personal experience. We have better systems, better accountability [than that[. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHWxQW"&gt;But that said, if I go back to your decision-making framework [question], I think I have a better appreciation coming out of this pandemic about Windows’ role in the world. As an ecosystem, as an operating system — what should we do so that we are serving the current customers and their expectations? Windows Update being one [example]. And also, what should its innovation vector be given where the world is going?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2Yzux"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That brings me to some of the big changes in Windows, which are fundamentally about what kind of operating system Windows is going to be and what kind of businesses you can run on it and what kind of business will that be for Microsoft.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K57JjK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a new user interface. The Start button is in the center of the screen. There’s cosmetic differences. But you’re also &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;allowing Android apps to run on Windows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. You are integrating the Amazon Android app store. You’ve made some changes to the store economics. You’ve reduced Microsoft’s cut to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546635/microsoft-windows-11-new-app-store"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15 percent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. That’s in comparison to the very controversial 30 percent that Apple charges. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilvxxi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then you’re saying to developers, “You can be in our store and you can not pay us a cut at all if you want to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549222/microsoft-store-developers-windows-11-revenues-games"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;use your own payment model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.” How much of that is opportunistic changes — you’re seeing all the controversy and you sense a market opportunity? And how much of it is this being the correct way to shift your business”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLcUUk"&gt;I think it’s driven by competition. What I mean by that is – what should Microsoft do to manage the platform and the platform rules such that we can thrive in that role?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ1Cs7"&gt;The way I’ve interpreted what platforms do is: they have to create opportunity for people who build on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCoR3F"&gt;That’s the way to keep a platform relevant. If you’re creating a great opportunity for others to be born on your platform and scale on your platform — that’s the Microsoft I grew up in. That’s the Windows I grew up with. Whether it is the Adobe folks creating their Creative Cloud or SAP building their ERP [enterprise resource planning] business. Or in today’s world, whether it’s Discord building their community for gamers on Windows or any other business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3FsXd"&gt;To me, how do we make Windows more vibrant going forward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Kz0D7r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Platforms and aggregators don’t need to be governed by the same rules&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7WuC5t"&gt;I sense a real opportunity, because the other two ecosystems that are at scale, for their own internally consistent set of reasons, have conflated — at least in my mind — the platform and the aggregation layer with one set of rules. There’s no reason why there should be one set of rules. They can be disaggregated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xcfa1i"&gt;After all, we do have a store. We do have commerce. You can use it all or you can bring your own. That’s [a] practical thing for Microsoft to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfhJdx"&gt;I’m not even trying to make some value statement that Microsoft is virtuous here and others are not. Others have chosen it for whatever reasons they have. This is a design choice and a business model choice. I want to make our own set of design and business model choices so that creators find more choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5ZE5M"&gt;That’s competition. I go back and say, “It’s time to compete.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3h7ODx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned the other two platforms at scale. That’s obviously iOS and Android. Then you mentioned the internally consistent reasons for their decisions. Apple has been pretty clear about its internally consistent reasons for saying the store extends across its entire platform. The loudest reason is that this is how Apple pays for giving the software away for free. Everybody gets iOS updates for free over the life of their phone, [and] the phones last a long time. To pay for all of that innovation, and software, and security updates, and all those things, Apples takes a cut of what happens in the store. That’s Apple’s business model.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUjXRd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You also give Windows away. If I have a newer PC, I’m just going to be able to update to Windows 11 for free. How do you pay for those updates if you’re not going to take a cut of everything?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q4HvNp"&gt;We have different business models. In many cases, we have subscriptions. We also have OEM royalties. Apple obviously has device gross margin. I think everyone ultimately has to have a business model that allows [them] to pay for what they do. I think it’s just a question of, where are you monetizing and what are then the rules on which fundamentally others can monetize? They have to be long-term stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2yLL1"&gt;In our case at Microsoft, I’ve always felt that, at least the definition of a platform is: if something bigger than the platform can’t be born, then it’s not a platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQwD4z"&gt;The web, it grew up on Windows. Think about it. If we said, “All of commerce is only mediated through us,” Amazon couldn’t exist, if we had somehow said, “We’re going to have our own commerce model.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DHzusX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Flexibility could be Microsoft’s competitive advantage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GM8QmM"&gt;Therefore I think each company has to choose and see what aggregation layer, what platform layer, [and] what rules work for them and their ecosystem. But, in our case, it’s very clear to us that we do want to solve for the same security issues, [and] discoverability issues, because that’s one of the reasons why we’re emphasizing the store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5SO4i"&gt;At the same time, the store can be used at different levels by different creators. We want to have that flexibility be a competitive differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFsZnF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned rules. Let’s say I’m VP of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; at Microsoft. My goal for the year is to increase Verge signups by 30 percent. The easiest way for me to do that is to go to the Windows team and say, “Every time you open Windows, show people &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Push them towards a signup to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.” This is a pressure that every operating system feels. Windows has certainly felt this push and pull. The Edge team wants Edge to be the default browser in Windows.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x20mD5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you balance that internal pressure against wanting to be an open platform where competitors can succeed against Microsoft’s own products?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYY0t2"&gt;There are two different things. One, you curating a set of experiences that work well with each other, and then allowing for someone else to curate an experience that perhaps is a substitute to something. [Do] you allow that only through your store or other rules, or is that something that can happen independent of you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llVgCs"&gt;Take the browser, which is at this point pretty foundational. We, of course, have a browser. It is default. But you don’t need to go to Microsoft. You can go to Google and download their browser, or you can go to Firefox and download their browser. In some sense, [that’s the] ability to have both agency as a consumer to directly choose, and at the same time, preserving our right to curate and, quite frankly, the right of others to curate as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9WlaP"&gt;We want to be a &lt;em&gt;platform&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;platform creators&lt;/em&gt;, not just a platform for other people’s apps. That’s the subtle difference we want to call up, which is: I want us to do a great job of being a platform. That means all the things platforms do. We’ll have a store. We’ll have our own defaults. We will curate stuff. But if somebody else can come in and create lots of value on our platform and use it as the base infrastructure, [at the] OS level, so be it — including the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1285Wr"&gt;By the way, that’s how we run our cloud. It’s not like this is that different to us. We have layers in the cloud from the applications all the way to infrastructure. Different application vendors and companies use it in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RfmJ5y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s funny that you brought up browsers. Microsoft famously fought an antitrust battle about bundling the browser with Windows and setting it as the default. It feels like the rules of the road there are a little bit clearer. There is a lot of history about browser defaults in Windows. What about places where it’s less clear? Do you have internal rules? Do you have a culture that says, “Okay. We can set a default, but the Windows team needs to build the hooks for other platforms and other services to be defaults”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slEpsu"&gt;Absolutely. There is no question. But, first of all, whatever we learned out of our case in the ‘90s means that you just need to be an open platform. There are certain things that are built into the operating system. If there are things that are independent of the operating system, then others can absolutely substitute without compromising the integrity of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vaa6mJ"&gt;Even communications — whether it’s Slack, or Zoom, or anything else — [they] can be first class on Windows. In some sense, we don’t have that restriction that other people’s software in its full glory cannot be available on Windows. We do have distribution advantages, but that doesn’t mean that other people don’t have their own distribution advantages. For me, whenever I visit some Google site, they’re very clear about their distribution advantage, even on a Windows PC. There is just no way to escape that, and that’s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLeToF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many Google sites do you visit in a day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKnAXO"&gt;Probably YouTube, I think, is the one that most often comes up on my Bing search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVhqWl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of Google — you are bringing Windows closer to Android. That’s been going on for some time. One of the biggest announcements of Windows 11 is that Android apps will run directly on Windows. What were the pros and cons of that decision?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U05PRt"&gt;Interestingly enough, the Windows architecture’s always had this. You can have multiple personalities in Windows. In fact, I remember when I first started at Microsoft, I was evangelizing the POSIX interface on top of Windows NT. And now one of the favorite features of Windows for me is WSL. I love it. The new terminal, and the fact that now we even support the full Linux UI on Windows. Linux is now first class on Windows, and Android is just another subsystem. Now we can support these multiple personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vT23fN"&gt;The decision for us was — what’s the best way to both allow for more applications to be available to our users? How can we add value to the 1.3 billion [Windows] users who may want more applications? That’s one side of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyF6FH"&gt;The other side of it is to create more opportunity for people who have built Android apps by exposing them to this billion-plus user base. I think that both sides benefit from this, and it was a fairly straightforward decision to go enable that. And now it’s going to be driven by what is the adoption, what are the use cases, what apps do they want to use that are Android on Windows versus PWAs versus UWPs and what have you. We are going to take that approach, where we welcome all apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="navt9e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the best argument you heard against it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YzitS0"&gt;I think always the argument will be, “do we have to have a consistent app model?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WaqV5c"&gt;Because if you think about innovation — is there is some kind of NUI or even an AI chip that we want to light up? How can the APIs of that be lit up in such a way that this application can take advantage of it? When you have multiple subsystems and multiple app models, can you surface your platform system-level innovation such that all apps light up? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i06r7Y"&gt;Thatis going to be the fundamental challenge in such a world, but we feel that there are ways. One of the ways I look at this is you can light an Android app or a PWA app or a UWP app on Windows in the future, or even today, for some of the new AI APIs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtULIC"&gt;At Microsoft we build for iOS, we build for Android, we build for Windows. That’s one of [our] fundamental challenges. We’re trying to make sure that as developers, we can leverage as much of the common code base, as much of the cloud, but at the same time, be native on each platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQKlIm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Android apps now run on Android, they run on Chrome OS, they’re going to run on Windows. Do you see them becoming sort of the lowest common denominator application environment for a developer that just wants to hit everything, without some of those opportunities that native development brings?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BjMH8Z"&gt;I think whether it is the web or Android, [it] gets you to multiple places faster, and then you optimize on those platforms based on what your users tell you, because the last thing anybody wants is an app that’s there, but nobody’s using, or nobody’s liking. Therefore, ultimately, it has to be competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P65Kxj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve covered [Android apps on ChromeOS] a lot. It’s not great. What’s going to make this great?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goCTES"&gt;I’m mostly interested in seeing what app developers start doing once they have traction on Windows with an Android app. Are they then going to extend it to take advantage of some native capability? Is just the system-level work we have done, with all of the things that it inherits, going to make it possible? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8N3Idf"&gt;How do I get, let’s say, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; app or &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; app , and then see it alongside, say, some PWA app? [With] all of the windowing work, it works beautifully. Now the question is, what is the experience for the users? And they’ll vote with their clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtbOkD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re a partner with Amazon to distribute Amazon apps. You said at the event other Android app stores are welcome to participate in delivering to Windows. The Amazon Appstore right now is pretty focused on Amazon’s own Fire tablets and products. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nGOoD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s... fine. I would not call it great. It certainly doesn’t have the volume that the Google Play Store has for Android apps. Are you expecting that it’s going to get better? Do you think it’s good enough now? Tell me about that partnership.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEdvap"&gt;I think it’s a good place for us to start, and I hope that more developers even look at Amazon Appstore as a way to go reach more users. I’m hoping that benefits them and us. And as I said, if this works, I would hope that even Google will take a look at it, right? If they feel like this is a way that they can increase the usage of Android apps, we’ll welcome any other app store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXOu36"&gt;And, of course, there are parts of the world where already there are many substitutes to the Android app store, which [are] even bigger than the Google app store. And so we’ll see what happens in that dynamic as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2OkdM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re passing through Amazon’s app terms. You’re not getting in the way of that relationship. It’s their store. If Google shows up, they would have their store and their own economics. Would you then expect the terms there to be competitive? Are they going to fight for developers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYusOv"&gt;That’s actually a fascinating question. That’s the thing, right? The world has not seen that — other than perhaps on Windows, where you have Steam and now you have Epic. You have our store. There are multiple marketplaces and there should be competition in marketplaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQyNyF"&gt;It’s kind of like there are multiple operating systems, and on any given operating system, if there are multiple marketplaces that are all vibrant and competing, how will it look? You’ve seen it in gaming on Windows. I’m hoping now we’ll see it at scale on all categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bfvRlU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re taking Microsoft’s app store cut down to 15 percent. It’s 85 / 15. What do you provide developers for that 15 percent? What’s your argument that developers should pay Microsoft the money and not roll their own [payment systems]?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1jD4C"&gt;It’s the discovery. It’s the app verification. It’s all of the things that one expects in an app store today that gives you the peace of mind that somebody is going to curate the apps, look at the security of the apps, and then make it easy for you to find the apps you want. Then, of course, the commerce capabilities. And there’s real costs associated with all of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0wTHd"&gt;We don’t think of the app store as an independent business. It’s sort of a utility that increases the value of the operating system at this point. App stores very much need to be part of operating systems at this point. We don’t at all disagree with that. It’s just a question of — should there be competition and flexibility? And even there, we just have our rules. Other platforms may have other rules, and users will choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULWSK3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As you and I are talking, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549025/big-tech-antitrust-amazon-apple-facebook-google-house-judiciary-jim-jordan"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;there are antitrust bills in Congress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; being debated right now about digital marketplaces. Some of them are very targeted toward the Apple and Google ecosystems. Others are targeting other parts of the tech stack. Do you think Microsoft is going to come under fire for the things it does with Azure or the things it does in Windows?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JyPO2"&gt;Whatever rules they come up with will apply to everybody who is an industry participant. So very much so, Microsoft will be part and parcel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeOw7z"&gt;The question is what ultimately passes into law. And then, we look at where Microsoft is in relation to all of that. I think that if you step all the way back, digital technology comes in these two flavors. There is this flavor — I’ll call it a factor of production, that it’s an input to somebody else’s creation. And there’s another flavor where I’ll call it factor of distribution, for lack of a better word, where it’s about matching supply and demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuiTwz"&gt;An operating system is actually an input to somebody else’s creation. An app store is more a distribution capability. You blend the two and set up rules that then have their own second-order effects around what’s happening with the competitive ecosystems around you. So I think that’s where people are going to look at it from a legislative perspective and say, “Hey, what set of rules allow for the most amount of surplus to get created in the broader economy?” And that’s a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3g3U4S"&gt;I think competition has always been the best thing that helps capitalism move forward, and we will be subject to the same set of rules that everybody else will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vScdv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned ecosystems, and I want to ask you about the broader ecosystem that Microsoft plays in. Most people do not experience Windows on Microsoft hardware. The Surface products are great, but most people experience Windows on other companies’ laptops with other companies’ chips in them. Some parts of that ecosystem are doing great. Some parts are lagging behind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZREyrz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m curious where you see the Intel relationship and their roadmap versus all of the things you might want to do with custom AI hardware and the other features you’ve discussed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1EOnl"&gt;First of all, to us, the Intel relationship is pretty critical, and we’re excited about Pat [Gelsinger, Intel’s new CEO] and his team and their innovation roadmap, and we will definitely deeply be partnered with them, and so will we with AMD and Qualcomm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PgTca"&gt;One example: the PC has always stood for that very broad design surface area in terms of what could one do, whether it’s silicon innovation, board-level innovation, ASICs, the way they can get assembled, what Nvidia has done with GPUs. That is what led us to build amazing gaming PCs, amazing laptops, desktops, what have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CpKPen"&gt;I think in the next 10 years, when we look at it — what is the system on package that Pat likes to talk about? I’m very excited about it. What is going to be the level of innovation that’s going to come about that will allow us to rethink the operating system, lighting up on that, and then there to be vibrant competition and innovation? I look at Intel innovating, Qualcomm innovating, AMB innovating, and Nvidia innovating, and say, “I want to do a great job of bringing all that innovation to life through Windows, and then surfacing it to developers.” You bring your UWP, you bring your PWA, you bring your Android app, use Windows to light up on that silicon innovation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gR4Qsp"&gt;That’s the opportunity I see. And our OEMs at Dell and HP and Lenovo are excited about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUyqwt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last question. You currently make one Android phone, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Surface Duo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Are you going to make more?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4k43aG"&gt;I want to build out experiences that are always pushing the form function. I like the way you said it directly. [&lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NaaU6v"&gt;I don’t think of [Surface Duo] as a substitute to the phone. Even though sometimes I dream about it as a phone, it’s not a phone. It does have phone functionality, but we wouldn’t have built it if what we were trying to do was a phone. We were trying to see what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bHN87m"&gt;I love it because it absolutely is my notebook. It’s that Moleskine that I carry around with me everywhere. I do use it as a phone, but that’s unique. That’s not the use case. But my god, do I love reading Kindle on one screen and taking OneNote notes. That’s kind of my killer app. We built it for that. And I want to keep innovating on that. Whether it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18235460/microsoft-hololens-2-price-specs-mixed-reality-ar-vr-business-work-features-mwc-2019"&gt;HoloLens&lt;/a&gt; and what happens in the future there, or Duo and what happens in the future, I want us to take shots on goal, on changes in form and function.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Who needs COVID-19 boosters?  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vm8qkeylAO1Sqs3VI9l5SMb9x8g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69503207/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="taX4qG"&gt;The first COVID-19 vaccines were barely in the arms of doctors and nurses in the United States before people started wondering what might come next. The vaccines would keep them safe, but for how long? Would variants make them less effective? Would everyone need a booster shot in a year or in two years? Could some people get away without that boost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyVfD5"&gt;Those questions were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-06/06-COVID-Oliver-508.pdf"&gt;front and center&lt;/a&gt; at this week’s meeting of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). The group isn’t making recommendations around COVID-19 vaccine boosters yet, but the discussion shows how leading health experts are thinking through the issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="pANvVp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10620891"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E1F8BU"&gt;Here’s what we know so far: the vaccines authorized in the United States work extremely well at protecting the majority of people from the coronavirus. Protection seems to last a while. We’re not sure quite how long, but at the very least, it’s longer than the flu shot, which people get every year. The shots still work against coronavirus variants, even the fast-moving Delta variant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8jjkl"&gt;But for some people, the vaccines don’t work. People who are immunocompromised, particularly people who have had organ transplants, often don’t produce antibodies after the regular doses of the COVID-19 vaccines. &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2108861"&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that a third booster dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine could give them more protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oIrVxi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Emerging data that a 3rd dose of mRNA &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#COVID19&lt;/a&gt; vaccine provides a greater antibody response in  solid organ transplant recipients. &lt;a href="https://t.co/mHP4EfNYmW"&gt;https://t.co/mHP4EfNYmW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Isaac Bogoch (@BogochIsaac) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BogochIsaac/status/1408030418432147456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QkIEY7"&gt;That’s the group the ACIP seems to think could be the first to get a booster because we have clear signals that it could help them. Then, after we learn more about how long protection lasts for everyone else — or if new variants emerge — experts could hammer out the details about boosters for the rest of us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajQ5CH"&gt;“There’s no data to support recommendations for booster doses at this time, except for the caveat in severely immunocompromised hosts who are not able to mount a strong response,” said Sharon Frey, an ACIP member and clinical director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Saint Louis University Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWNndw"&gt;That data will come later. Ongoing studies are tracking the durability of COVID-19 vaccine protection, for example, and the CDC is watching to see if any variants evade the vaccines. Studies will check if people should get a third (or second, in the case of Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson) dose of a COVID-19 vaccine that already exists or a new shot with an updated form of the vaccine that targets specific variants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7mGxl"&gt;“If we start to see an uptick in reinfections for people, or new infections in people who have been vaccinated, that’s our clue that we need to move quickly,” Frey said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="lGmy5V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oM3Slo"&gt;Looming over the ACIP’s discussion, though, was the troubling rates of vaccination in the US and around the world. Only 45 percent of the US population is fully vaccinated. Only 17.7 percent of the world is vaccinated. Unvaccinated people don’t need boosters; they need their first shots. Having more people vaccinated will slow the spread of the virus and prevent new variants. It’ll protect people who are immunocompromised, too: when everyone around them is far less likely to have COVID-19, they’re at a far lower risk of catching it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sHeyU"&gt;Figuring out boosters is important. But getting unvaccinated people their shots — both in the US and around the world — is a critical way to protect everyone, said ACIP member Helen Talbot, an associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University. “Prior to going around giving everyone boosters, we really need to improve the overall vaccination rate,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qgw5lc"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;

Immunizations mean cases are less closely tied to hospitalizations and deaths. (Todd Gillespie / &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLpKqi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/childrens-birthdays-may-have-spread-covid-infections/"&gt;Children’s Birthdays May Have Spread COVID Infections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Households where someone had a birthday were at a 30 percent higher risk of COVID-19 infection in the next two weeks than one with no birthday, a new study found. The results show the risk of social gatherings when the virus is widespread. (Rachel Nuwer / &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

According to an &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; analysis, only about 0.8 percent of the deaths in May were in fully vaccinated people.

But it didn’t use a special chemical modification on one of the components of the genetic material, which may have made it less effective. (Jon Cohen / &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

But this shot might be even better than the mRNA vaccines. (Hilda Bastian / &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="grbPRu"&gt;Perspectives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NgfJTi"&gt;What I find most troubling, though, is the helplessness that so many people still feel more than a year later as the country seems to be joyfully emerging from its coronavirus slumber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Satya Nadella wants to snatch competition from the jaws of antitrust</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ErqfIcpQCFbB0NakqfaU8j4og5M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69503198/vpavic_180502_2536_0016_alt.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kNEXe8"&gt;The world is waiting to see whether the United States Congress, and a US judge, crack down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549025/big-tech-antitrust-amazon-apple-facebook-google-house-judiciary-jim-jordan"&gt;on Big Tech’s monopoly power&lt;/a&gt; and decide the future of Apple’s App Store. I don’t think readers have ever cared so much about revenue share, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452035/epic-apple-antitrust-trial-final-arguments"&gt;market definition&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;anti-steering rules&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qJlWP"&gt;So it’s a wild time for Microsoft to be pitching the tech industry on a new-and-improved app store, too. Remember, this is the company that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17827042/antitrust-1990s-microsoft-google-aol-monopoly-lawsuits-history"&gt;famously got sued in the ‘90s for bundling Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt; with its operating system, dominating the nascent web browser market, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dinabass/status/1408185225641820161"&gt;Some might say it’s up to its old tricks&lt;/a&gt; with the new Windows 11 — which similarly bundles the company’s Microsoft Teams video chat and collaboration software at the potential expense of rivals like Slack and Zoom. (More on that in a bit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="53s2eK"&gt;But on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22313426"&gt;today’s episode of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; podcast&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft chairman and CEO Satya Nadella suggests there’s a fundamental difference between his vision and what Apple and Google are doing. He argues they’ve entangled their operating system and app stores to the point that they’re doing developers a disservice. That’s where Microsoft can step in, he says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="jljDvC"&gt;I sense a real opportunity, because in some sense what has happened is the other two ecosystems that are at scale, for their own internally consistent set of reasons, have conflated — at least in my mind — what is the platform and the aggregation layer with one set of rules. There’s no reason why there should be one set of rules. They can be dis-aggregated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WqQ5JA"&gt;Windows 11 will demonstrate that “disaggregation” in at least two big ways. First, where Apple and Google insist on developers forking over up to 30 percent of their revenue and using proprietary payment processing (unless you’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22547934/google-play-app-store-fee-15-percent-movies-tv-books-audio"&gt;quietly secured an exemption&lt;/a&gt;), the Windows 11 app store will now let non-game developers roll their own payments &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549222/microsoft-store-developers-windows-11-revenues-games"&gt;and keep every penny they make&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="owwEOO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’ll welcome any other app store”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TubFwT"&gt;Second, Microsoft will explicitly let companies build entire app stores within Microsoft’s app store — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;starting with the Amazon Appstore&lt;/a&gt;, which Microsoft claims will bring Android apps to Windows that can run natively there. “We’ll welcome any other app store,” says Nadella, up to and including Google should it be interested. Windows chief Panos Panay is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550103/microsoft-new-windows-app-store-steam-welcome"&gt;open to Steam and the Epic Games Store&lt;/a&gt; being part of Microsoft’s app store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBYdR4"&gt;More:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8D7JfU"&gt;I want us to do a great job of being a platform. That means all the things platforms do. We’ll have a store. We’ll have our own defaults. We will curate stuff. But if somebody else can come in and create lots of value on our platform, and use it at, just, I’ll call it the base infrastructure, OS level, so be it, including a store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Ry8Plm"&gt;Apple in particular has long railed against the idea of allowing any competing app store into its platform. Top Apple executives like App Store boss Phil Schiller repeatedly used the “store within a store” excuse as sufficient reason to reject an app, according to internal Apple emails unearthed during the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial. (Part of Apple’s reasoning is that the company wouldn’t be able to ensure the quality of those apps, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;it’s easy to point out&lt;/a&gt; Apple doesn’t police each Netflix or YouTube video, Spotify song, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;Roblox “experience.”&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6M5DXO"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP3710346080&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ifxqxg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;How many pieces of the process should a platform provider own?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DcG5WI"&gt;It’s become clear over the past two days that Nadella is a student of Ben Thompson, with Nadella’s nod to “sovereign” creators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549007/microsoft-windows-11-satya-nadella-remarks-apple"&gt;in the stinging critique of Apple he delivered yesterday&lt;/a&gt; at the Windows 11 event and his discussion of &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/"&gt;aggregation theory&lt;/a&gt; today, but it reminds me most of Thompson’s &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; essay from August 2020. That’s the one &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/"&gt;about how Apple bit off more than it should really chew&lt;/a&gt; by attempting to own the customer relationship and payment processing &lt;em&gt;on top of&lt;/em&gt; the core security, stability, and other abilities of its operating system, angering developers in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDrDyn"&gt;This is where Apple has repeatedly taken flak in recent months, as critics argue that the App Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423567/apple-epic-app-store-policies-fortnite-trial-day-4"&gt;doesn’t actually provide&lt;/a&gt; meaningful amounts of curation or a high enough bar for quality in exchange for its 30 percent tax. They point to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;the egregious scams sitting in plain sight that Apple didn’t catch&lt;/a&gt;, or Apple employees’ seeming admission that it’s the core operating system, not anything an App Store employee does, that makes the iPhone a relatively secure place to work — and Apple already gets rewarded for that with its hardware profits, some argue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rwhaS"&gt;Critics also point to the far smaller fees that credit card companies charge for payment processing, typically just a couple percent plus a handful of cents per transaction. Even those can impact some small businesses, as you’ll know if you’ve ever wandered into a mom-and-pop shop that asks for a minimum purchase of $10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KtPJdr"&gt;“It’s very clear to us that we do want to solve for the same security issues, discoverability issues, because that’s one of the reasons why we’re emphasizing the store. But at the same time, the store can be used at different levels by different creators. We want to have that flexibility be a competitive differentiation,” says Nadella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RlhhWM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft needs all the apps it can get&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fYC1DF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549007/microsoft-windows-11-satya-nadella-remarks-apple"&gt;As Dieter pointed out yesterday with richer language&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; Microsoft is going to say these kinds of things right now, because it doesn’t have much to lose — the company’s Windows app store has practically been a punchline for years, and Microsoft needs all the apps it can get. I couldn’t help noticing that Microsoft padded the list of apps coming to the new Windows store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546635/microsoft-windows-11-new-app-store"&gt;by namedropping Microsoft’s own Notepad, Paint, and Teams&lt;/a&gt;, even though all three of them are (or will be) built into Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIDnQ5"&gt;And where Microsoft&lt;em&gt; does&lt;/em&gt; have something to lose — PC gaming revenue — it’s conspicuously decided &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549222/microsoft-store-developers-windows-11-revenues-games"&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to offer that 100 percent revshare option&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qGmG5"&gt;Microsoft sees an opportunity to give disgruntled Apple and Google developers an alternative at a time they’re paying attention, and it’s doing it in a decidedly Microsoft way, touting the openness of its platform while favoring its own apps by promoting them and bundling them instead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528701/apple-rank-own-app-over-competitor-files-dropbox-wwdc-2017"&gt;repeatedly accidentally boosting them in search&lt;/a&gt; like Apple did pre-2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yikeZN"&gt;But Microsoft’s learned some lessons, too. Nadella freely admits that each platform is making its own calculated business decisions: “I’m not trying to make some value statement that Microsoft’s virtuous here and others are not.” And while every Windows 11 will come with a side of Microsoft Teams, the company tells us you can fully uninstall the app, and it’s making native Windows 11 features (like being able to quickly mute or chat directly from your taskbar) freely available to competitors in the form of APIs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIo3KA"&gt;“Whether it’s Slack, or Zoom, or anything else, it can be first-class on Windows,” Nadella says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEEZH6"&gt;Besides, no one seemed to care all that much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/15/4623780/skype-built-into-windows-8-1-microsoft-confirms"&gt;when Microsoft bundled Skype with Windows 8.1&lt;/a&gt;, or the Microsoft Edge browser with Windows 10. Not until &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21310611/microsoft-edge-browser-forced-update-chromium-editorial"&gt;Microsoft force-restarted people’s computers just to shove Edge in front of our faces&lt;/a&gt;, anyhow. But Slack &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200722005498/en/Slack-Files-EU-Competition-Complaint-Microsoft"&gt;did file an antitrust complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Teams in the EU, and it doesn’t seem pleased about Teams’  seeming dominance today. Microsoft said Teams &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406472/microsoft-teams-145-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;had 145 million daily active users&lt;/a&gt; in April, while Slack hasn’t updated its count of 12.5 million concurrents since the beginning of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9j8nc"&gt;“Our reaction is simple: choice is better than lock-in, open is better than closed, and fair competition is best of all. Unfortunately, Microsoft has never seen it that way,” reads a statement from Slack.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft wants Steam to be part of its new Windows 11 app store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qbdi1NNlZNN_xtjNHvumsmzxluc=/186x0:2292x1404/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69503151/microsoft_store_windows_11_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new app store on Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gQn2Hr"&gt;Microsoft’s surprise change to Windows 11 is a much more open approach to its Windows store, and it could mean we see Steam games listed in the future. This new open approach sees many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546635/microsoft-windows-11-new-app-store"&gt;changes to the Windows app store&lt;/a&gt;, including Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;connecting up to Amazon’s Appstore&lt;/a&gt; to list Android apps and allowing developers to keep 100 percent of their revenue by using third-party payment platforms. Microsoft also wants other alternative app stores, like Steam and Epic Games Store, to be part of this new Windows app store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLGfn1"&gt;“Windows already in many ways hosts those stores, and if we can host it through the Microsoft Store then of course,” says Windows and device chief Panos Panay, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “For sure, it means as others want to come to the Store, they’re very welcome. As a matter of fact, encouraged, and that’s kind of why we’re building out some of these policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54cxZJ"&gt;Steam has become a huge game and app store on Windows throughout the years, and Panay envisions a future for the Windows app store where people find the apps they want regardless of rival stores. “I really want this experience where you go to the store, you type the app in and you get the app you want,” says Panay.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new Windows app store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Cj0Hgu"&gt;While Microsoft is embracing the idea of an open store, there are some caveats. Microsoft will let developers keep 100 percent of the revenue from apps if they use alternative payment platforms, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549222/microsoft-store-developers-windows-11-revenues-games"&gt;but this doesn’t apply to games&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a big omission, that comes just weeks after Microsoft announced that it would lower its cut of game revenues in the Microsoft Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;from 30 to 12 percent starting on August 1st&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUUx9A"&gt;How this policy might apply to separate app stores isn’t clear, either. Microsoft appears to just be listing Android apps from Amazon’s Appstore in its own store, so it’s effectively linking out to another store. If Steam were to be integrated with the Windows app store, it would likely be through a similar linking scenario, which avoids apps and games being directly hosted in Microsoft’s app store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbQHUj"&gt;This would still be an improvement over what exists on Windows 10 today. If you set up a new machine you have to search around the web for installers, grab only some of the apps that are available in Microsoft’s Windows store, or use a third-party package manager to manage which apps get installed. If Microsoft can pull off its open dream of a store with every Windows app listed, that will be a big benefit to every single Windows user.&lt;/p&gt;
