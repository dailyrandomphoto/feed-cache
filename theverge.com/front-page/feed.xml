    <title>Amazon is retiring Alexa — no, not that one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NDXH-OwHnwtaKvYZ1XrzfCzuzKw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70248592/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QgYstZ"&gt;Amazon is shutting down Alexa Internet, a service that has provided web traffic analysis for more than two decades. Alexa was founded in 1996 and bought by Amazon in 1999 (15 years before the shopping giant revealed its digital assistant of the same name). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5QAxC"&gt;Alexa is best known for Alexa Rank, a ranking of the world’s most popular websites, with this information frequently referenced in news coverage and public resources like Wikipedia. The company extrapolates this data from a small sample of web users who use its &lt;a href="https://www.alexa.com/toolbar"&gt;browser extension&lt;/a&gt; and from sites which choose to install its &lt;a href="https://www.alexa.com/about"&gt;traffic monitoring software&lt;/a&gt; directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bDHjc"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://support.alexa.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410503838999"&gt;announcement post&lt;/a&gt;, the Alexa.com team said the company stopped offering new subscriptions on December 8th, 2021, and will shut down the site on May 1st, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AuqBuZ"&gt;“Twenty-five years ago, we founded Alexa Internet. After two decades of helping you find, reach, and convert your digital audience, we’ve made the difficult decision to retire Alexa.com on May 1, 2022. Thank you for making us your go-to resource for content research, competitive analysis, keyword research, and so much more,” reads the post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gr9jKM"&gt;Paid users of Alexa’s services can export their data and delete their account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05zVxf"&gt;Alexa.com’s rankings have always been simultaneously popular and contentious — not surprising given the importance of establishing traffic metrics in many online businesses. Over the years, there have been many accusations that the service’s Alexa Rank could be gamed, but it nevertheless remained the most familiar name in the web-ranking world. A number of alternate services exist, including &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.similarweb.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22825744%2Famazon-retiring-alexa-web-ranking-sevice" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SimilarWeb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://tranco-list.eu/"&gt;Tranco&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.comscore.com/"&gt;ComScore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo teases its first foldable, the Find N</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/210HuY0HIuuHi38kluFnSvr6ByA=/0x0:1446x964/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70248508/ezgif.com_gif_maker__7_.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A short teaser trailer shows the folding mechanism in action.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Oppo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TWmyrz"&gt;Oppo has announced its first foldable smartphone, the Oppo Find N, in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oppo.com%2Fen%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress%2Foppo-inno-day-2021-pete-letter-findn%2F%3Fs%3D09&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22825716%2Foppo-find-n-foldable-inno-day-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; penned by its chief product officer (and OnePlus CEO) Pete Lau. The device will be launched next week on December 15th, on the second day of Oppo’s annual Inno Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmzUEx"&gt;Although the post doesn’t reveal too many specifics about the device, a teaser trailer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1468777421243490312"&gt;released on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; shows it has a similar form factor to Samsung’s Z Fold devices, combining a large internal folding screen with a smaller outer screen that can be used like a traditional smartphone. Interestingly, this small outer screen looks like it has a similar aspect ratio to a traditional smartphone, unlike the tall thin external display of the Fold 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2broZE"&gt;In his post, Lau admits that other companies have beaten Oppo to commercializing foldable smartphones. But he claims that these competing devices haven’t had the “utility, durability, and user experience” to make them feasible purchases for most people. “For Oppo, it is better to launch a product at a later date when it is ready to offer a great user experience instead of simply rushing to keep up with trends,” Lau writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CbZPyd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is the exquisitely engineered &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPOFindN?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OPPOFindN&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;Hold. Fold. Enjoy. Repeat.&lt;br&gt;Coming December 15. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPOINNODAY2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OPPOINNODAY2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/LVZKNgYiAv"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LVZKNgYiAv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OPPO (@oppo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1468777421243490312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uOBTso"&gt;The Find N is said to be the result of four years of R&amp;amp;D and six generations of prototypes, with Lau noting that the first generation of the Find N dates back to April 2018. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/25/18239353/oppo-foldable-phone-prototype-huawei-mate-x"&gt;February 2019 the company showed off&lt;/a&gt; one of its foldable prototypes, although this version had a single large display that wrapped around the outside of the device, as opposed to the Find N’s internal folding screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hi8grN"&gt;Lau says the aim was to make a device with a beautiful design that feels good in the hand, while also being useful and easy to use. “For a foldable smartphone, both the closed-screen and open-screen experience should be equally simple to use,” Lau writes. “Then on top of that, we should create a groundbreaking efficient experience that a traditional smartphone cannot provide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hDUC3"&gt;Oppo plans to launch the Find N on the second day of its annual Inno Day event, where it typically shows off concept technologies and products. In previous years, Oppo has used these events to announce concept technologies like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571056/oppo-x-2021-rolling-phone-ar-glass-concept-inno-day-2020"&gt;rollable phone&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536363/oppo-x-2021-rollable-smartphone-demonstration-features"&gt;Oppo X 2021&lt;/a&gt;, as well as AR glasses, neither of which have made it to market. As well as the Find N, Oppo has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823689/oppo-retractable-phone-camera-teaser-inno-day-2021"&gt;teased a device with a retractable rear camera&lt;/a&gt; for this year’s Inno Day, as well as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1468475432601370626"&gt;more augmented reality glasses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktfd81"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AR headset reportedly uses 3D sensors for hand tracking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wVPmyMe9aWsqzwUyemG7vkI4iDY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70248440/acastro_170731_1777_0005_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XkbnAo"&gt;Apple’s widely rumored upcoming mixed reality headset will make use of 3D sensors for advanced hand tracking, according to analyst Ming-chi Kuo, whose latest research note has been reported on by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/apple-ar-vr-hand-gesture-interface/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/08/kuo-apples-mixed-reality-headset-to-have-advanced-hand-gesture-detection/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The headset is said to have four sets of 3D sensors, compared to the iPhone’s single unit, which should give it more accuracy than the TrueDepth camera array currently used for Face ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Cerzh"&gt;According to Kuo, the structured light sensors can detect objects as well as “dynamic detail change” in the hands, comparable to how Face ID is able to figure out facial expressions to generate Animoji. “Capturing the details of hand movement can provide a more intuitive and vivid human-machine UI,” he writes, giving the example of a virtual balloon in your hand flying away once the sensors detect that your fist is no longer clenched. Kuo believes the sensors will be able to detect objects from up to 200 percent further away than the iPhone’s Face ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bcjJHE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Oculus Quest 2 review: better, cheaper VR","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ycJiW2"&gt;Meta’s Quest headsets are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/18/21260554/oculus-quest-anniversary-hand-tracking-third-party-games-beat-saber-tracks"&gt;capable of hand tracking&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not a core feature of the platform and it relies on conventional monochrome cameras. Kuo’s note doesn’t mention whether Apple’s headset will use physical controllers as well as hand tracking. Bloomberg &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in January that Apple was testing hand tracking for the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PX4ay3"&gt;Kuo also this week provided some &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/08/kuo-apple-ar-vr-headset/"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; on what could come after Apple’s first headset. While he expects the first model to weigh in at around 300-400 grams (~0.66-0.88lbs), a “significantly lighter” second-generation model with an updated battery system and faster processor is said to be planned for 2024. The first model will arrive sometime next year, according to Kuo, and Apple reportedly expects it to sell about three million units in 2023. That suggests the initial product may well be expensive and aimed at early adopters. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ViacomCBS announces partnership with Wattpad to adapt originals </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x7ZJzJVAw6Nf7BKd8uFtaFfM-ag=/88x0:1033x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70247590/Paramount_Plus.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: ViacomCBS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YjtUY0"&gt;Wattpad has long been a pipeline bringing content adaptations of stories by emerging writers to streaming services like Netflix and Hulu. Now, ViacomCBS and Wattpad’s studio arm are teaming up to spin out a slate of original series from successful titles on Wattpad and Webtoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vom7B"&gt;Wattpad has been a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22215052/wattpad-authors-fanfiction-netflix-hulu-streaming-movies-romcom-teen-drama"&gt;story springboard&lt;/a&gt; for streaming services for years — &lt;em&gt;The Kissing Booth&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;After&lt;/em&gt; franchises are two notable examples — in part because Wattpad is able to mine a &lt;a href="https://digiday.com/future-of-tv/wattpad-using-platform-data-sell-shows-tv-studios-streaming-services/"&gt;trove of internal data&lt;/a&gt; about how readers are interacting with stories and what specific kind of storytelling they return to. That can easily translate to hit franchises for services hungry for new original content, particularly for content that appeals to younger viewers. (&lt;em&gt;After&lt;/em&gt;, for example, started out as &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/the-making-of-anna-todd-s-after-movie.html"&gt;Harry Styles fanfiction&lt;/a&gt; published on Wattpad.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTWcCO"&gt;ViacomCBS plans to work with the publisher’s entertainment arm to mine stories from Wattpad and its sister site Webtoon, whose parent company Naver &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22239704/naver-buy-wattpad-600-million-aquisition"&gt;snapped up Wattpad&lt;/a&gt; for more than $600 million dollars earlier this year. Wattpad Webtoon Studios will work with ViacomCBS to develop originals for its various networks and properties, including Paramount Plus, the &lt;a href="https://company.wattpad.com/blog/viacomcbs-international-studios-partners-with-wattpad-webtoon-studiosto-discover-diverse-talent-and-develop-series-from-webtoon-and-wattpad-hits"&gt;companies announced&lt;/a&gt; today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2yCNsY"&gt;The originals are expected to appeal specifically to Gen Z and millennial audiences and will be sourced from a range of genres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkKIlS"&gt;“Wattpad Webtoon Studios is home to some of the most exciting new voices in comics and literature,” Aron Levitz, president of Wattpad Webtoon Studios, said in a statement. “Between our massive global IP catalogue with built-in fandoms, and a roster of superstar comic artists and indie authors, we’re fueling a new era of data-backed entertainment.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kickstarter says it’s switching to crowdfunding via the blockchain</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XcdZV3Mb4EqxSwDR4SfekUoH2mo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70247549/acastro_190319_1777_kickstarter_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KUJJ5p"&gt;Kickstarter is announcing some big changes to the foundations of its technology. The company said Wednesday that it will support the development of “an open-source protocol that will essentially create a decentralized version of Kickstarter’s core functionality,” &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/articles/the-future-of-crowdfunding-creative-projects"&gt;according to a Kickstarter blog post&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday. The protocol will live on a public blockchain and will enable anyone, “even Kickstarter competitors,” to build upon or use it, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsLjVs"&gt;An independent organization will start the development of the protocol, and Kickstarter will give this group funding, appoint a board, and will be one of the protocol’s first clients, the company says. It’s also making an “independent governance lab” that oversees “the development of the protocol governance.” The protocol will be built on &lt;a href="https://celo.org/about"&gt;Celo&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source blockchain that uses the more environmentally friendly proof of stake system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oS7m65"&gt;The new company making the protocol does not have a name, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/kickstarter-blockchain-will-combine-crowdfunding-with-crypto?cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which also reports that Kickstarter expects to move its site over onto the protocol in 2022. Kickstarter didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment about if the change will affect the company’s business model but did say in its blog that “as a user, the Kickstarter experience you’re familiar with will stay the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTyZ5d"&gt;Kickstarter’s efforts sound somewhat similar to what Twitter kicked off with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21010856/twitter-jack-dorsey-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-research-moderation"&gt;Bluesky decentralized social network standard&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being announced in December 2019, it, too, is still in its nascent stages, having just hired a project lead &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627435/twitter-bluesky-lead-jay-graber-decentralized-social-web"&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter confirms its ‘Project Guardian’ keeps an eye on today’s main character</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/101ggAJNUTdxEVXBO1x9jtNsduY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70247352/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kGMfp3"&gt;Twitter’s secretive “Project Guardian” aims to shield controversial characters and users with large followings from an onslaught of trolls and haters, according to a report by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/twitter-s-highest-profile-users-get-vip-treatment-when-trolls-strike"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The platform reportedly maintains a list of thousands of users that Twitter deems high risk for harassment, which includes musicians, professional athletes, journalists, and other users who are particularly prominent — even if just for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKIGea"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that when Twitter receives a report of an abusive post related to an account on the list, Twitter’s content moderation team will respond to that report faster than all the other ones it has lined up. The thinking behind the program is that Twitter can prevent harmful content from spreading, as well as keep prominent tweeters content and less likely to speak out about bullying on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gtIdN4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Users who get caught up in viral Twitter drama may also be included, but typically only temporarily&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0zrTPD"&gt;Yoel Roth, Twitter’s head of site integrity, told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that an array of users make up its Project Guardian list, and they don’t have to be celebrities. Users who get caught up in viral Twitter drama may also be included, but typically only temporarily. Once the 15 seconds of fame wears off, Twitter will remove that user from Project Guardian, while others have a more permanent place on the list. As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; states, a user may get added to the program when a Twitter employee notices that they’re seeing large volumes of hateful messages, even if that user doesn’t realize it. On the other hand, a high-profile user may even have their manager personally ask Twitter to offer more protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4Yqi7"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, some users enrolled in Project Guardian in the past include makeup artist James Charles, Egyptian activist Wael Ghonim, as well as former US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb. Twitter has also used the program to protect journalists who cover controversial topics, like the January riots or 8chan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E0UhdG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Project Guardian doesn’t just shield users; it also protects Twitter from bad PR&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fsv15Z"&gt;In addition to Project Guardian, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; found that Twitter uses several other factors to prioritize its responses to user reports. This includes a post’s impression, how many followers the user in question has, as well as whether or not the reported tweet is actually harmful. There appears to be no indication that a particular incident sparked the creation of the program, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says that it might’ve been around for two years or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTanxL"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; points, Project Guardian doesn’t just shield users; it also protects Twitter from bad PR. In March, Twitter came under fire for its inability to tame the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350049/twitter-chrissy-teigen-quits-abuse-harassment"&gt;bullies that bombarded former model Chrissy Teigen&lt;/a&gt;. Trolls targeted Teigen by making unfounded claims she was part of a conspiracy theory that involves a celebrity pedophile ring. She quit Twitter as a result of the bullying (although she has since returned). Critics argue that Twitter could’ve done more to protect Teigen, although Teigen herself said she didn’t blame the platform for the barrage of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NGhQY"&gt;Just before this revelation, Twitter has been making rapid-fire changes to the platform. In the span of just one day, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822184/twitter-quill-messaging-platform-dms-slack"&gt;Twitter has acquired messaging platform Quill&lt;/a&gt;, rolled out a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822878/twitter-testing-changes-report-tweet-abuse-suspicious-behavior"&gt;test to change the reporting process&lt;/a&gt;, began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823870/twitter-content-warning-test"&gt;piloting individual content warnings&lt;/a&gt;, and started experimenting with a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1468619385472438279"&gt;TikTok-style “For You” tab&lt;/a&gt;. This spurt of announcements has come in the first week or so after former Twitter CTO Parag Agrawal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;replaced Jack Dorsey as CEO&lt;/a&gt;. In an interview shortly after Agrawal took over, he said he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22823093/twitter-new-ceo-parag-agrawal-move-faster-interview"&gt;hopes to hasten Twitter’s “execution”&lt;/a&gt; and streamline its operations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Destiny brings back Gjallarhorn, immediately Nerfs it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cdyd92DwE67UWmREme3ArFhIIqo=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70247296/nerf_gjallarhorn_01_1000x1000.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n8hfxk"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt;, the legendary rocket launcher &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/15/8611387/destiny-gjallarhorn-best-worst"&gt;Gjallarhorn was the ultimate weapon for a time&lt;/a&gt;. Its ability to create explosions filled with &lt;em&gt;more explosions&lt;/em&gt; was unparalleled — and, some would argue, in desperate need of &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-07-17-destinys-gjallarhorn-to-be-nerfed-in-huge-balance-changing-update"&gt;a nerf&lt;/a&gt;. Amusingly, Bungie and toymaker Hasbro are now taking that part literally: the Gjallarhorn is now slated to become an official Nerf blaster, complete with Wolfpack Round-like cluster missiles of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/brjB_-rhn33OnoFrtX5VRmt_H0M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23074318/Destiny_2_Screenshot_2021.12.07___12.54.53.04.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bungie&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The in-game version that just came back to Destiny 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAwEfr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; just brought the digital Gjallarhorn back this week as part of &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22821051/destiny-2-bungie-30th-anniversary-patch-notes-update-exotics-abilities-halo-crossover"&gt;the $24.99 Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack&lt;/a&gt;, and you’ll have to pay a lot more than that for the Nerf version, of course — $160, which makes it one of the most expensive Nerf blasters ever made. Plus, people who unlock the Gjallarhorn in-game get dibs on the limited-edition Nerf version, so you can expect to pay well over $200 for the Pack, tax, and / or shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOw0FJ"&gt;But, according to &lt;a href="https://bungiestore.com/bungie-rewards-nerf-lmtd-destiny-gjallarhorn-blaster"&gt;Bungie’s official Gjallarhorn blaster store page&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll get something unique in exchange, and I’m not just talking about the blaster’s physical build. Bungie claims Hasbro has designed a “first of its kind Mega shell” that “blasts 3 darts at once from a shell,” which makes it sound like they’re trying to replicate the explosions-within-explosion effect that the Gjallarhorn is known for. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/obau8xIMc8X3BfLQuy6ZCM19qkE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23074245/nerf_gjallarhorn_02_1000x1000.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hasbro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You get an illuminated scope that runs off two AA batteries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RxNc2E"&gt;Frankly, that sounds tricky — particularly when Bungie is also promising it’ll have a breech-loading mechanism like the game, too, where you’d stuff a rocket canister right into the back of its top bulge (instead of, say, into the front of the tube). You get three of the new Mega shells and nine darts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAJjKG"&gt;It’s not at all clear how the Nerf Gjallarhorn might load those shells into the chamber, or what kind of mechanism might provide enough oomph to fire them any distance, or how the rocket might split into three darts, or where those darts might go while feeling impressive and staying within Hasbro’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663549/nerf-hyper-rush-40-siege-50-mach-100-review"&gt;strict safety rules&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a tall order, and there are no guarantees. (The awesome-looking &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; Nerf blaster finally came out this year and was roundly panned by reviewers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22153843/the-mandalorian-rifle-nerf-star-wars-amban-phase-pulse-blaster"&gt;though we definitely saw that coming&lt;/a&gt;.) We’ve been trying to get answers from Hasbro and Bungie all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCKR3h"&gt;Either way, it looks like an awesome prop, much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/23/22742194/halo-needler-nerf-lmtd-announce-price-release-date"&gt;the new Nerf Halo Needler&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22627453/nerf-aliens-pulse-rifle-preorder-hasbro-gamestop"&gt;Aliens Pulse Rifle&lt;/a&gt; that are also on the way. The Gjallarhorn might be a long way away, though — even the preorders for this one won’t start till late 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6G1fO"&gt;Digitally, the Gjallarhorn isn’t the only intriguing returning weapon from Bungie history; &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; is also adding the Forerunner, a stylized version of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;’s famous magnum pistol. &lt;a href="https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/M6H_Personal_Defense_Weapon_System?file=H5G+Render+Magnum-M6H2.png"&gt;Specifically, the M6H2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Apple’s upcoming macOS 12.1 update will fix the MacBook Pro’s notch and menu bar issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New MacBook Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A66lvRvT5xwTQrQMiBwwgAfDcHQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70247196/akrales_211020_4803_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7MdMDA"&gt;Apple’s upcoming macOS 12.1 update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22748371/apple-macbook-pro-notch-issues-inconsistencies-apps"&gt;will fix some odd interactions&lt;/a&gt; between its new MacBook Pros’ notched displays and menu bar apps, which should no longer be blocked behind the notch, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/macos-12-1-fixes-notch-obscuring-menu-bar-icons/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1U6zX"&gt;Previously, some users had reported issues where menu bar icons could end up getting pushed behind the notch in the event that too many were open. Or, as Apple’s changelog describes the issue, prior to macOS 12.1, “[menu] bar extras may be obscured by the camera housing on 2021 MacBook Pro computers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ttbR5Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple seems to have forgotten it built a notch in the MacBook Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22748371/apple-macbook-pro-notch-issues-inconsistencies-apps"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="CRGxsh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;WTF HAHAHAHA HOW IS THIS SHIPPABLE? WHAT IS THIS?! &lt;a href="https://t.co/epse3Cv3xF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/epse3Cv3xF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Quinn Nelson (@SnazzyQ) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SnazzyQ/status/1453143510111059968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VtDbB8"&gt;The bug admittedly was rare to begin with, requiring that users had enough menu bar icons (referred to by Apple as “menu bar extras”) to reach from the right side of the display to the notch’s location, but particularly large menu bar apps (like iStat Menus) could accomplish the task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ula5Va"&gt;In addition to fixing the menu bar / notch bug, the new update also brings a few other issues, including HDR problems with YouTube and MagSafe bugs on the 16-inch MacBook Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7IiAG"&gt;macOS 12.1 is still in beta, but given that the company has seeded the release candidate version of the software to developers, the update (and the bug fix for the notch issues) should be rolling out to all users in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CD Projekt Red is working to settle a class-action lawsuit over botched Cyberpunk 2077 launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TohRpJ9Iy3WNFOCeJjFJVODvBgY=/30x0:1460x953/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70247073/Cyberpunk2077_The_man_with_the_silver_hand_RGB_en.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Johnny Silverhand in &lt;/em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1CbLps"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; developer CD Projekt Red has &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/current-report-no-43-2021/"&gt;entered negotiations&lt;/a&gt; to settle a class-action lawsuit over the game’s bungled launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOhkKl"&gt;There are still a number of outstanding questions about any potential settlement, &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21150635-in-chambers-order-re-notice-of-settlement-and-requirements-re-preliminary-approval"&gt;according to court documents&lt;/a&gt;, including all class certification requirements, the proposed allocation plan for the settlement fund, and how the settlement will be administered. In other words, it’s undecided exactly who will be eligible for anything awarded in a settlement or how much those eligible parties may receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCybyu"&gt;The plaintiffs in the case must next file a preliminary approval of the settlement or an update on its status by January 13th, 2022. Four lawsuits against the company were compiled into one &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/current-report-no-27-2021/"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQmsu7"&gt;At release (which was almost exactly one year ago), &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;many glitches&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2077-cyberpunk-2077-how-bad-is-last-gen-performance-and-can-it-be-improved"&gt;ran quite poorly on older consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Things were so bad that Sony pulled the game from the PlayStation Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;within a week&lt;/a&gt;. CDPR has spent much of the year since trying to fix things up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627096/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-3-reset-perks-mini-map"&gt;hotfixes and updates&lt;/a&gt;, and the game eventually returned to the PlayStation Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543298/cyberpunk-2077-playstation-store-ps4-warning"&gt;after more than six months&lt;/a&gt;. The studio also pushed a planned update optimizing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; for next-gen consoles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808038/cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-2077-next-gen-update-release-date"&gt;into 2022&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram head says it’s bringing back the chronological feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yxBE7qui038gdQiz00edJnGtcl0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70246745/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram is working on a chronological feed | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MuDoWa"&gt;During a hearing before a Senate subcommittee on Wednesday, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said the company is working on a version of its feed that would show users' posts in chronological order, unlike its current ranking algorithm that sorts posts based on user preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AHzuD"&gt;The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/3/11853026/instagram-algorithm-feed-global"&gt;algorithmically sorted feed&lt;/a&gt;, introduced in 2016, and then updated in 2017 to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/27/16823118/instagram-recommended-posts-feature-roll-out-now-android-ios"&gt;include recommended posts&lt;/a&gt;, is widely disliked by users who prefer to have their posts and their friends’ posts surface in a timely manner. The current feed uses AI to create what Instagram considers a more personalized feed, based on users’ activity. But it has remained generally unpopular among a vast swath of users, despite the company’s assertions otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlcBxR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22816730/mosseri-testimony-instagram-senate-hearing-haugen-child-safety-facebook-meta"&gt;Mosseri appeared before the Senate subcommittee&lt;/a&gt; where he was grilled by senators about child safety issues on the app, prompted in part by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"&gt;revelations from whistleblower Frances Haugen&lt;/a&gt;, who provided internal documents to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;that suggested the company was aware its app may be “toxic” for teenagers. “Have some empathy. Take some responsibility,” Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) chided Mosseri as the hearing wound down.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnJ4p6"&gt;During his testimony, Mosseri proposed the creation of an “industry body”  that would determine best practices over the handling of children’s data and parental controls to help keep children safe online. The body would receive input from parents, regulators, and civil society, to create universal standards and protections. Mosseri said platforms would need to earn the protections of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"&gt;Section 230&lt;/a&gt; of the Communications Decency Act by following those standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xaVLRP"&gt;Senators seemed skeptical that such an an “industry body” could be effective. “The time for self-policing is over,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who has called for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747330/snap-tiktok-youtube-facebook-papers-blumenthal-coppa-kids-child-safety"&gt;online child safety measures&lt;/a&gt; to address concerns about Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="h72kIU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Section 230 is 25 years old, and it’s never been more important","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22268421/cda-section-230-25th-anniversary-reform-stakes-big-tech-internet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NpKoa9"&gt;On Tuesday, Instagram rolled out the “Take a Break” feature it started testing last month to users in the US and other English-speaking countries. The opt-in feature prompts users to pause using the app after they’ve been using it for a certain time period. More parental controls over their teenagers’ use of Instagram will be released next year, Mosseri said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQYhB8"&gt;“What you’ve suggested so far is underwhelming,” Blumenthal told Mosseri before ending Wednesday’s hearing, referring to Take a Break and the other updates. “That ain’t gonna save kids from the addictive effects ... of your platform.” &lt;/p&gt;
