    <title>PAX East is canceled, but organizers are ‘cautiously optimistic’ about other in-person events</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aiiR8GBGbuUmo8qwwUoN4XUoe-4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69042624/3Z1A0056.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Penny Arcade&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NR6ggZ"&gt;The PAX East 2021 gaming convention, previously scheduled for June 3rd through 6th, &lt;a href="https://east.paxsite.com/news/article/pax-east-21-update"&gt;has been canceled&lt;/a&gt;, Penny Arcade and event coordination company ReedPop announced today. The PAX organizers also announced an online convention, PAX Online 2021, for July 15th to July 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FikpKh"&gt;“While we hoped PAX East could safely take place, we remained realistic and did not sell any tickets or space to exhibitors to avoid significantly inconveniencing our friends and partners,” Kyle Marsden-Kish, the PAX event director at ReedPop, said in a statement. “As we have shown via our actions throughout the pandemic, our utmost concern is the safety of the PAX family — from attendees, exhibitors, and show staff to media and content creators — as well as the local communities that host our celebrations of all things gaming. We will only move forward with a live PAX once we are confident the show will be safe for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pxG6KN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Since we can't wait until September to reconnect with the wonderful PAX community, PAX Online will return July 15-18.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read the full statement at &lt;a href="https://t.co/ptaZiGTazE"&gt;https://t.co/ptaZiGTazE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PAX (@pax) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pax/status/1376536351529697285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cUurzj"&gt;The conference organizers said that PAX East will happen again in Boston in 2022, but no specific date was given. They are also “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pax/status/1376536350661427201"&gt;cautiously optimistic&lt;/a&gt;” that PAX West and PAX Unplugged will still happen as planned as in-person events in September and December, respectively. Last year, PAX West was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21293169/pax-west-online-australia-canceled-date-seattle-gaming-convention"&gt;canceled and replaced&lt;/a&gt; with the first PAX Online, which took place in September as a nine-day virtual event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQapYG"&gt;Many conventions in 2021 have had to shift their schedules or make changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22355081/comic-con-november-event-in-person-2021-announced-dates"&gt;the organizers of the San Diego Comic-Con announced&lt;/a&gt; a three-day in-person event set for the Friday through Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend in November. At the beginning of March, the organizers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307929/sdcc-e3-anime-expo-cancel-in-person-virtual-events"&gt;had announced&lt;/a&gt; that the planned July conference event would be virtual instead of in person. And Anime Expo 2021, also previously set as an in-person event in July, &lt;a href="https://www.anime-expo.org/2021/03/03/anime-expo-2021/"&gt;announced this month&lt;/a&gt; that it would shift to an online event.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrSHDHNRiQrX7uCuXdtZyYvmZKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this incredibly tough time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a Nintendo Switch (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a Switch Lite (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that are preowned or refurbished — will likely continue to sell out quickly during the pandemic. But we’ll do our best to keep this article up to date with the latest in-stock offers, and we’ll tell you when each offer was posted. When something gets sold out, we’ll try to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5uFyz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TvQrKG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10394076"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qcOiY9"&gt;Over at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMR6NB8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (in stock 04/15), you can buy an updated Nintendo Switch model with neon and blue Joy-Cons, plus a 64GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $319. You can also get a similar bundle, but with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YBVJRD7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB MicroSD card for $324 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (in stock 04/15).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ueoxw3"&gt;You can buy the updated Nintendo Switch model with red and blue Joy-Cons for $300 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07VGRJDFY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-with-neon-blue-and-neon-red-joy-con%2F-%2FA-77464001%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XPkmNL"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fb%2Fnintendo%2F-%2FN-5y626Z3p2mgZ551qz%3Ftype%3Dproducts&amp;amp;subid1=VergeNintendoSwitchRestock3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; is running a promotion that lets you get a free $20 gift card when you purchase Nintendo’s compact handheld, the Switch Lite. The $20 gift card you receive will be for whichever retailer you buy the handheld from, and all of the Switch Lite colors (blue, coral, gray, yellow) are all eligible for the promotion. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZaaYGt"&gt;Otherwise, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Coral/dp/B07V4GCFP9/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=25204d2c5e9e7105ec173ae5b3e28bcc&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1732099797003183412#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-lite-turquoise%2F11095775.html%3Futm_expid%3D.cxvp7jeuRNKc9QoJTI6kMQ.0%26utm_referrer%3D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Lite-Console-Turquoise%2F306029956&amp;amp;subid1=VergeSwitchRestocks03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have Nintendo Switch Lite stock available in different colors. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pbWPDc"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergehowto&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fq%3Dnintendo%2Bswitch%26lang%3Ddefault" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1720139703165212912#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; receive new supplies of the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite consoles fairly regularly, and it’s a good strategy to keep these pages open so you can quickly add one to your cart when they come back in stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="o2G175"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-with-gray-joy-con%2F206007.html%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAiAt9z-BRBCEiwA_bWv-HzeKt4-dsaWdi9G9SGmxFTUUEAxrCA4NxZS0xEWCkIacwTZ_cUKPRoCEYUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html"&gt;Nintendo’s own online store where it sells refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Those have been sold out recently, but there’s no telling when it will restock the page with some repaired, refreshed consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jnXhNd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556339"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a microSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SC7BZHR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $75&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074RNRM2B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A 400GB microSD card will cost you around $59&lt;/a&gt;, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Agp45r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, Walmart also has the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Switch Pro controller for $59&lt;/a&gt;, knockings $11 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2BZPIqmUqpLcZoV5GVxdxMULT3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9537475/akrales_171025_2091_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ulULMw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3ASPNV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A two-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Nintendo Switch is $6.99&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l1NCcr"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2YZPQpf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TCPVHTM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; three-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Switch Lite is $6.99&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $20 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728487093072266361" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mj7LGifJ1euP-dbrplwPMhD36I4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67781485/dseifert_191123_3810_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Echo Show 5 (left), Echo Show 8 (middle), and the Echo Show (right) | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. But, if you want an Echo Dot now, you can buy it for $35 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fpreselect%3D80770243%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which is $5 more than its lowest price yet. There is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; to show the time, weather, and other information on sale for $45 (usually $60). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHsulr"&gt;Amazon is also selling some bundles, including a $45 one that features &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one Sengled Bluetooth bulb&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Amazon-Smart-Charcoal/dp/B08GTWC9ZB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot and Amazon Smart Plug bundle&lt;/a&gt; available for the same price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;We have seen this product go down to $40; right now it is on sale for $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h2 id="3GbSWO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;Currently, the fourth generation Echo is on sale for $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733330369536034962#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770246%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, Amazon is selling a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KVFM2XM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Echo for two Philips Hue bulbs&lt;/a&gt; for $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiNGuc"&gt;If you are looking for a pair of Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $160&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $40 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is the one to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90 and we have seen it go down as low as $45. At the moment, the Echo Show 5 is on sale for $50 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="xJmJw1"&gt;Amazon also has a few bundles available; you can get an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089Q2RJH9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and three months of Amazon Kids Plus&lt;/a&gt; for $51, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086P992GD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $60, and an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SW188FP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 plus an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $70. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVFAcO"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling a bundle with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730445461281046110#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $60.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the Show 8 go down as low as $65. The Echo Show 8 is currently on sale for $75 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="x04s5v"&gt;There are also a few bundles available for a few dollars more. For $85 you can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an Echo Show 8 and a 1080 Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt;; or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $100. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation Echo Show 10. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It is also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;Right now, Amazon’s Echo Show 10 is on sale for the first time ever.

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s new flagship has a giant camera bump with its own OLED screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aGfOLe-QM-MlawlMUpYKqCztL0g=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69042307/mi11u2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="angaRd"&gt;Xiaomi has announced its latest flagship, the Mi 11 Ultra. It’s based on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;the excellent new Mi 11&lt;/a&gt;, but has a more advanced camera system — including a second screen housed inside the camera bump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MG9c3"&gt;The Mi 11 Ultra has three cameras on the back: a 1/1.12-inch 50-megapixel main sensor, a 48-megapixel ultrawide, and a 48-megapixel 5x periscope telephoto. Those sensors should be upgrades across the board when compared to the regular Mi 11, which had a smaller 108-megapixel main sensor, a 13-megapixel ultrawide, and a 5-megapixel macro camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JWmDumwybJx2EV0d_WXE2SvzEGE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22404983/K1_Black____5G.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KCRBdG"&gt;The camera bump dominates the top portion of the Mi 11 Ultra, and its secondary screen is the reason why. It’s a 1.1-inch 126 x 294 OLED display with a peak brightness of 450 nits and a power-saving mode. Xiaomi says it can be used as a selfie viewfinder, an always-on display, or a way to check notification alerts when the phone is face-down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ovhLGD9foMbpihbT4BkRwTBpnw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22405103/xiaomi_display.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rear display demonstrated for selfies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gBP8AY"&gt;The specs are otherwise similar to the regular Mi 11. There’s a 6.8-inch 120Hz 1440p OLED display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. The battery has been boosted to 5,000mAh and is now capable of being fast-charged at 67W both wirelessly and with a cable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6QZ63HDgjBDiFs5oM5svSAAZh2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22404985/m11l.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V6bcLJ"&gt;Xiaomi is also launching a cut-down version of the Mi 11 called the Mi 11 Lite 5G. It looks similar to the regular Mi 11 but it’s more of a mid-range device. It’s the first phone to launch with the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350079/qualcomm-snapdragon-780g-888-5g-mobile-chipset-phone-android"&gt;Snapdragon 780 processor that Qualcomm announced last week&lt;/a&gt;, for example. The emphasis is on its slim and light design — it’s just 6.81mm thick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U07PV7"&gt;Elsewhere you’ll find a 6.55-inch 1080p 90Hz OLED display, which is smaller, slower, and lower-resolution than that of the Mi 11. The triple-camera system includes a 64-megapixel primary sensor, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, and a 5-megapixel macro. The battery is also a little smaller at 4,250mAh, though you do at least get a headphone jack with the Mi 11 Lite, unlike the Mi 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivbJIs"&gt;Xiaomi hasn’t provided pricing or release details for the Mi 11 Ultra and the Mi 11 Lite just yet — stay tuned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7ctns"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfteMb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s wireless charging pad is the latest clone to attempt the AirPower dream</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XmMpFLirD1-i5XfGi7XZF7kNv3E=/173x0:1586x942/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69042245/image__1_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QcfRDd"&gt;Xiaomi unveiled a new wireless charging pad during its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350245/xiaomi-mi-mix-liquid-lens-autofocus-focal-length-camera"&gt;Mi Mix event this morning&lt;/a&gt;. The pad is capable of simultaneously charging three devices without precise placement, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;canceled Apple AirPower charger&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoSfpz"&gt;According to Xiaomi, this wireless charging pad features up to 20W of wireless power per device and includes &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1376506733493768192?s=20"&gt;19 coils&lt;/a&gt;, allowing users to place any three devices that support Qi wireless charging, according to Xiaomi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTOOaT"&gt;Unlike most other clones out there, Xiamoi’s wireless charging pad is more affordable, selling for about $90. However, it is unknown if the charging pad will see a release outside of China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1lB9kW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Xiaomi is not the first company to make its own clone of the Apple AirPower&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wiAfR4"&gt;Xiaomi is not the first company to make its own clone of the Apple AirPower. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/11/20909687/nomad-base-station-pro-wireless-charger-airpower-18-coils"&gt;Nomad released the Base Station Pro&lt;/a&gt;, an 18-coil wireless charger that can charge any three devices with no specific placement, but as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21399941/nomad-base-station-pro-review-wireless-charger-aira-freepower-price"&gt;noted by my colleague Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/a&gt;, one of the downsides was that aside from the iPhone, the pad only provided 5W of charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWuT8g"&gt;Alongside a new wireless charging pad, Xiamoi also unveiled the Mi 11 Pro, which includes 67W wireless charging as opposed to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363317/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-announcement-twitter-fast-charging"&gt;Mi 10 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528249/huawei-mate-40-pro-plus-release-date-news-features-price-specs-cameras"&gt;Huawei’s Mate 40 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which have previously had the fastest wireless charging with 50W. Additionally, Xiaomi also announced a new 80W wireless charger. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/57UbhRyK3-qOJZ-4qNid2C5QF5M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22405174/image.png"&gt;

    <title>These TikToks are a playful look into the harsh realities of game development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zK_9bqxJRpO24kRF1Bud7RS0oE4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69042206/acastro_210326_4492_famousStreamer_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FCimnf"&gt;Leslee Sullivant approaches the camera curiously. Her hair is pulled back into a ponytail, and she’s dressed in an olive green button-up against a bar background. “Are you one of the new hires?” she asks. “Oh, you’re the intern!” She offers to sneak you a drink when she learns you’re underage and asks about your boyfriend. You’re not like her wife, she says. The wife doesn’t really get the whole gaming thing. “If you’re looking for a mentor, I’m your guy,” she concludes. The caption on the TikTok video is “grooming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOMoWn"&gt;The games industry struggles with #MeToo-style reckonings every few months, and Sullivant’s video is a pitch-perfect impression of one of the many insidious ways those problems happen. On TikTok and Twitter, where she later shared the video, people can relate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fQIa9"&gt;As one woman put it: “raise your hand if you’ve met this person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="7qf1TG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@famous_streamer/video/6942576723531713798" data-video-id="6942576723531713798" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@famous_streamer" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@famous_streamer"&gt;@famous_streamer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;grooming &lt;a title="greenscreen" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/greenscreen"&gt;#greenscreen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp"&gt;#fyp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="foryoupage" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryoupage"&gt;#foryoupage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="gamedev" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gamedev"&gt;#gamedev&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="gamedevelopment" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gamedevelopment"&gt;#gamedevelopment&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="BiggerIsBetter" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/BiggerIsBetter"&gt;#BiggerIsBetter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - leslee" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6942576598637873925"&gt;♬ original sound - leslee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lpfYEX"&gt;Sullivant’s TikToks are more than a way to pass the time — they’re small performances of digital activism and education. “I’m always trying to find a way to make [the industry] better,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, citing stories of abuse and harassment endemic to the field. “I don’t know how to fix it. In the past, I have raised issues internally only to get punished for them. I have written an article about my time in games, and that’s not going to move the needle. It’s really hard for one person to do something about it. Barring me raising money to start my own studio, which will what? Impact 10 people in 10 years? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NuUS7"&gt;“I’m desperate to change the industry for the better. This seemed like one of the ways maybe it could be far-reaching and impactful.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWJKF6"&gt;Through TikTok, Sullivant, a producer with a long career in games, has a chance to reach new audiences she’d never find through other platforms. It’s lower effort than a YouTube video, allowing her to edit in-app and get her point across in less than a minute. The app’s algorithm surfaces videos to users more organically than a place like Twitter, where Sullivant will repost her content to her followers. And the playfulness of TikTok makes it easier to tackle these issues in a direct, albeit tongue-in-cheek, way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpetnQ"&gt;In one video, Sullivant plays a pair of writers interrupted by an executive with terrible advice and impossible standards. In another, she gives two employees, Todd and Amy, performance reviews. Todd gets high marks and feedback. Amy not so much: “Says here you’re a huge bi—” The video cuts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXTEZF"&gt;“I think a lot of these things happen and there aren’t a lot of great avenues to talk about them,” Sullivant says. “I think a lot of these discussions are discouraged, or they have to be done in secret.” That can make it hard for people to speak up at all, let alone find each other for support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="UibP92"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@famous_streamer/video/6937750048876875014" data-video-id="6937750048876875014" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@famous_streamer" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@famous_streamer"&gt;@famous_streamer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;diversity &amp;amp; inclusion programs &lt;a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp"&gt;#fyp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="foryoupage" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryoupage"&gt;#foryoupage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="gamedev" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gamedev"&gt;#gamedev&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="gamedevelopment" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gamedevelopment"&gt;#gamedevelopment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ tarawarolin wants you to know this isnt my sound -  ‍♂️" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/tarawarolin-wants-you-to-know-this-isnt-my-sound-6874404787064949510"&gt;♬ tarawarolin wants you to know this isnt my sound -  ‍♂️&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yEjo6J"&gt;“A lot of these videos talk about stakeholders or people in power,” she says. “God forbid you bring that up at work, or you run into that kind of thing. I’m hoping this is providing an outlet for that kind of emotion and validation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcZz5q"&gt;Sullivant’s early TikToks are fashion-focused — they were motivation for her to get dressed even while working from home in a pandemic — but she was interested in making videos about millennial work culture. It just took some courage to put her face on camera. “I want to do something that really speaks to my actual work experience and the way I like to cope with my experiences in games, and that’s by poking fun of stuff that happens at game development,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LK34WP"&gt;She aims for “self-deprecating and also trying to highlight the weird issues” that come with a career in game development. And although she says some of her content does have some inside baseball talk, it’s still accessible to someone who doesn’t work in the industry — and maybe even still relatable for someone who doesn’t. “People don’t have to be in the know about how the games industry works to understand the impact of the thing that’s being explored in those videos,” Sullivant says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFHKaT"&gt;Her videos aren’t based on any specific experience, she says, but rather a sort of conglomeration of her 11 years in development. “I was very scared at first, and I always have that sense of regret immediately after publishing a video,” she says. “Is this the one that’s going to get me doxxed?” Her aim isn’t to discuss players or the gaming community, but rather keep it within her industry, and what her peers — or future peers — experience. “The amount of people being like, ‘Oh, I didn’t realize this was a problem,’ or even the more senior game devs who were like, ‘I absolutely can see it now, but I didn’t in my 20s, and I want other young people to see this,’ was eye-opening,” Sullivant says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAlg7p"&gt;“We can do a little bit of education and hopefully improve things for the better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyKqzV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXYvgK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Echo Show 10 that moves is $40 off for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wPodj7lFb1FHnnI9faV8l36lNa8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69042100/dseifert_210219_4433_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3BWttr"&gt;If you’ve been waiting for a deal on Amazon’s new Echo Show 10 smart display that can spin around to always be facing you, today’s your day. Normally $250, it’s down to $210 right now for the black or white versions, both of which feature a camera for video chats, as well as for tracking you in order to make sure the screen’s within view for convenience. This is the first price drop, and 16 percent off isn’t bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qA5gIY"&gt;This deal is available through &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551%3Fpreselect%3D80770248%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, but Amazon has the exclusive on a deal that &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/echo-show-10/dp/B08SQ2F8D2?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs just $5 more&lt;/a&gt; and lets you checkout with the Blink Mini home security cam added to your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huV3QT"&gt;There are several other Echo Show models, and aside from the rotating feature, this one provides a similar experience. My colleague Dan Seifert &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;reviewed this new model&lt;/a&gt; recently, saying “Alexa in the new Echo Show 10 is largely the same Alexa you get on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17944022/new-amazon-echo-show-review-2018-alexa-speaker-video-camera"&gt;prior Echo Show&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16161058/amazon-echo-show-alexa-dot-which-one-to-buy"&gt;every other Alexa-powered smart display&lt;/a&gt;. You ask it for information — a weather report, a favorite playlist, news, calendar appointments, and so on — and it will give you a polite response and show the requested information on the screen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S9AZ16"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10362085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u37uez"&gt;The Beats Flex wireless neckbuds usually cost $50, but you can get the black, sky blue, or bright yellow models for $10 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08L6ZYW21?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. These are Beats’ first headphones to charge via USB-C, making them equally suited for Android users as they are for the Apple ecosystem of devices. For folks heavily invested in Apple’s products, these have the Apple W1 wireless chip that makes these buds easily connect to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrM4bN"&gt;I own these, and I’ve found the sound quality to be delightful for the price, and the controls are simple enough to learn. But, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522700/beats-flex-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;as Chris Welch’s review mentions&lt;/a&gt;, they aren’t perfect. They aren’t rated for sweat resistance or waterproofing, and these don’t have great sound isolation when you’re surrounded by a fair amount of noise. Still, $40 is hard to turn down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPjS3e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591203"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M4xEQq"&gt;If you have a Nintendo Switch and don’t yet own a high-capacity microSD card to store games on, Amazon’s deal of the day has your name on it. You can get a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GYG5SVQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;400GB SanDisk microSD card for $39&lt;/a&gt;, which is near the lowest-ever price (you’re getting more than 10GB per dollar here). Games for the Switch range in size between a few gigabytes to dozens, so this sub-$40 purchase should last you a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UGRcg4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327706"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="BJozrz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Amazon is becoming the face of American inequality</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Bezos has become a useful foil for Democrats&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="vKpbXM"&gt;In the days leading up to the Bessemer union vote, Amazon is throwing punches. They’re just not aimed at workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBBqtf"&gt;As the Alabama warehouse votes on whether to unionize, Amazon has been facing mounting pressure from progressive lawmakers — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352977/amazon-twitter-feud-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-trolling-labor-pee-bottles"&gt;on Friday, the company went on the offensive&lt;/a&gt;, calling out Sens. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for their criticism of the company’s policies. Predictably, tweets &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1375502593863073792"&gt;provoked more tweets&lt;/a&gt;, turning into days of jousting between progressives and a corporate PR account. Over the weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/3/28/22354604/amazon-twitter-bernie-sanders-jeff-bezos-union-alabama-elizabeth-warren"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt; broke the news&lt;/a&gt; that Bezos had personally encouraged the callout, worrying that his company was being too passive in the face of progressive pressure. Whatever the risks, Bezos clearly sees this fight as a winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yaI0Rq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bezos sees this fight as a winner — so do Democrats&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DO1fvj"&gt;So do Democrats. It’s rare to see this much national involvement in a union drive, but President Biden jumped in earlier this month, expressing support in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306952/amazon-union-biden-statement-bessemer-alabama-warehouse"&gt;hedged but unmistakable terms&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is a useful foil for a party trying to recapture working-class voters, and Amazon’s loose tweets could spark a much bigger fight. As Democrats respond to the economic fallout of the pandemic, Amazon makes an ideal antagonist, making billions while the rest of the economy withers. The pandemic has only intensified that disparity, shutting down in-person retail while Amazon’s e-commerce business thrived. The company is the perfect villain for a party eager to tell a story about economic justice — and while the Bessemer election will be counted and done in a few days, the fight between Amazon and Democrats may not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5QjqIu"&gt;Much of the Bessemer fight so far has come from Biden’s particular commitment to unions as a political force. Biden wants to be seen as enthusiastically pro-labor (a rare quality for a post-Clinton Democrat), and this is the most important labor effort in years for reasons &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;we describe in detail here&lt;/a&gt;. So the Bessemer fight lets Biden stick up for the little guy and suggest his labor board will come down hard on any irregularities from Amazon. It casts Biden as a different kind of Democrat with more to offer the working class. It’s not just the right thing to do; it’s also good politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxuLEz"&gt;But that political calculus extends far beyond the Bessemer fight. Biden wants to be seen as a bold, progressive president taking on entrenched inequality. A public spat with Amazon makes it clear he’s trying, even if more ambitious efforts like the $15 minimum wage (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17929068/amazon-wage-raise-bernie-sanders-increase-15"&gt;Amazon’s preferred remedy&lt;/a&gt;) get lost along the way. And since tossing insults at Amazon is easier than reversing decades of economic damage, the feud gives Biden an easy way to show he’s trying. All he has to do is cast Amazon as the face of the problem — the leading edge of everything that’s wrong with the American economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="I21Xia"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon “not only altered the national landscape itself, but also the landscape of opportunity in America”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xLfPey"&gt;This month, &lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374159276"&gt;a new book&lt;/a&gt; lays out the same story at a grander scale. Written by &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt;’s Alec MacGillis, &lt;em&gt;Fulfillment&lt;/em&gt; is less about Amazon’s business than the social dislocation left in its wake, pairing Amazon’s rise to power with the struggles of a cardboard packer in Dayton or a small office supply store in El Paso. Many of the figures in the book aren’t even officially Amazon employees, instead working for contractors or selling on the company’s marketplace. Still, the overall message is clear: Amazon is growing rich and powerful off of these people’s work, while they scramble just to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T05fZK"&gt;In the introduction, MacGillis makes the case for Amazon as a poster child of this new style of American business explicitly. As he describes it, the idea for his book emerged when he realized Amazon was “an ideal frame for understanding the country and what the country was becoming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="znhs0n"&gt;[Amazon] served as the ultimate lens on the country’s divides because it was present just about everywhere… It had segmented the country into different sorts of places, each with their assigned rank, income, and purpose. It had not only altered the national landscape itself, but also the landscape of opportunity in America — the options that lay before people, what they could aspire to do with their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Duta0B"&gt;Of course, that economic chasm is much older than Amazon. The landscape of American opportunity has always been skewed, and the latest tectonics date back at least 50 years. Amazon has been at the forefront of many of those changes — particularly the shift to e-commerce, exurban fulfillment networks, and vastly scaleable online interactions. But Amazon didn’t cause those shifts; it just positioned itself to benefit from them. MacGillis acknowledges as much in how he describes the company: a lens, rather than the whole picture in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BYyX2E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Political pressure will change Amazon in profound and unpredictable ways&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cvglRb"&gt;As Democrats scramble to connect with working class and rural voters, that lens can be a powerful political force. For decades, the party has struggled to describe the crushing divide in the American economy that has pushed wealth to major cities and left the rest of the country to decay. Since 2016, many of the voters on the wrong side of that divide have left the party for Trump, a trend that Biden is eager to reverse. Neither party has a meaningful plan to undo the structural damage, but Biden is hoping a surge in federal money will soften the blow, beginning with &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2021/03/10/covid-19-stimulus-bill-joe-bidens-plan-explained-6-graphics/4601454001/"&gt;the trillion-dollar relief package&lt;/a&gt; and continuing with &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/25/biden-putting-final-touches-potential-3-trillion-economic-package/6986152002/"&gt;trillions more&lt;/a&gt; in infrastructure spending planned for this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPsF8K"&gt;Democrats are hoping to cast those bills as a contemporary New Deal, rescuing the country from economic ruin while uniting it politically. Portraying Amazon as the face of that ruin — and using a public fight with the company as proof the party is serious about taking it on — is just good messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9760cR"&gt;A feud between Democrats and Amazon would also catch Republicans off balance, splitting the party between its populist rhetoric and pro-business policies. Since Trump, Bezos has been a rhetorical foil for Fox News, but Amazon &lt;a href="https://itep.org/from-0-to-1-2-amazon-lauds-its-minuscule-effective-federal-income-tax-rate/"&gt;benefited hugely&lt;/a&gt; from Trump’s tax cut and quadrupled in value over Trump’s four years in office. Even now, Republicans weighing in on the feud between Sanders and Amazon have found themselves &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kenklippenstein/status/1376318757845471232"&gt;in the awkward position&lt;/a&gt; of defending a company they’ve spent much of the past four years attacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77pRqB"&gt;Amazon has plenty of resources to defend itself. The company is still wildly profitable, the second largest employer in the United States (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_United_States%E2%80%93based_employers_globally"&gt;after Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt;) and the second largest federal lobbyist (&lt;a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/big-tech-lobbying-update/"&gt;after Facebook&lt;/a&gt;). It will have ample chance to soften the blow of any new policies and is better equipped to ride out the changes than nearly any other company on Earth. Congress’ efforts to change Section 230 have been focused on Google and Facebook rather than Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21080720/amazon-product-liability-lawsuits-marketplace-damage-third-party"&gt;product liability issues&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136641/amazon-microsoft-pentagon-contract-jedi-10-billion-paused"&gt;Pentagon contract aside&lt;/a&gt;, government work is still a relatively small part of the company’s business. After decades of unbelievable growth, there is only so much that can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BpnCQQ"&gt;But political pressure will still change Amazon in profound and unpredictable ways. Facebook was in this position in 2016 — suddenly blamed for Trump’s election, Brexit, and the fraying condition of liberal democracy across the world. Five years later, every new project is met with hostility, and ambitious politicians around the world look at the company as a prize waiting to be taken down. Most companies would try to avoid that fate. After this weekend’s dustup, Amazon seems to be leaning into it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenAI’s text-generating system GPT-3 is now spewing out 4.5 billion words a day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eCB_yq1i0VB7wGza7_OzU_JLNGA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69041640/acastro_200730_1777_ai_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ojPk2Z"&gt;One of the biggest trends in machine learning right now is text generation. AI systems learn by absorbing billions of words scraped from the internet and generate text in response to a variety of prompts. It sounds simple, but these machines can be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;put to a wide array of tasks&lt;/a&gt; — from creating fiction, to writing bad code, to letting you chat with historical figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vi7SBS"&gt;The best-known AI text-generator is OpenAI’s GPT-3, which the company &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; is now being used in more than 300 different apps, by “tens of thousands” of developers, and producing 4.5 billion words per day. That’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of robot verbiage&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;This may be an arbitrary milestone for OpenAI to celebrate, but it’s also a useful indicator of the growing scale, impact, and commercial potential of AI text generation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmMKnT"&gt;OpenAI started life as a nonprofit, but for the last few years, it has been trying to make money with GPT-3 as its first salable product. The company has an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451283/microsoft-openai-gpt-3-exclusive-license-ai-language-research"&gt;exclusivity deal with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; which gives the tech giant unique access to the program’s underlying code, but any firm can apply for access to GPT-3’s general API and build services on top of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d5A8Me"&gt;&lt;q&gt;No company stands to benefit more from GPT-3’s rise than OpenAI itself&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ibGXBb"&gt;As OpenAI is keen to advertise, hundreds of companies are now doing exactly this. One startup named &lt;a href="https://askviable.com/"&gt;Viable&lt;/a&gt; is using GPT-3 to analyze customer feedback, identifying “themes, emotions, and sentiment from surveys, help desk tickets, live chat logs, reviews, and more”; &lt;a href="https://fable-studio.com/"&gt;Fable Studio&lt;/a&gt; is using the program to create dialogue for VR experiences; and &lt;a href="https://www.algolia.com/"&gt;Algolia&lt;/a&gt; is using it to improve its web search products which it, in turn, sells on to other customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISqdta"&gt;All this is good news for OpenAI (and Microsoft, whose Azure cloud computing platform &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2019/07/22/openai-forms-exclusive-computing-partnership-with-microsoft-to-build-new-azure-ai-supercomputing-technologies/"&gt;powers OpenAI’s tech&lt;/a&gt;), but not everyone in startup-land is keen. &lt;a href="https://bakztfuture.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-startup-monopoly-with"&gt;Many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.allencheng.com/starting-a-business-around-gpt-3-is-a-bad-idea/"&gt;analysts&lt;/a&gt; have noted the folly of building a company on technology you don’t actually own. Using GPT-3 to create a startup is ludicrously simple, but it’ll be ludicrously simple for your competitors, too. And though there are ways to differentiate your GPT startup through branding and UI, no firm stands to gain as much as from the use of the technology as OpenAI itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMro4T"&gt;Another worry about the rise of text-generating systems relates to issues of output quality. Like many algorithms, text generators have the capacity to absorb and amplify &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/"&gt;harmful biases&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also often astoundingly dumb. In tests of a medical chatbot built using GPT-3, the model responded to a “suicidal” patient by &lt;a href="https://artificialintelligence-news.com/2020/10/28/medical-chatbot-openai-gpt3-patient-kill-themselves/"&gt;encouraging them to kill themselves&lt;/a&gt;. These problems aren’t insurmountable, but they’re certainly worth flagging in a world where algorithms are already creating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301759/facial-recognition-detroit-police-wrongful-arrest-robert-williams-artificial-intelligence"&gt;mistaken arrests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21372045/uk-a-level-results-algorithm-biased-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-university-applications"&gt;unfair school grades&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20929337/care-algorithm-study-race-bias-health"&gt;biased medical bills&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJE6DI"&gt;As OpenAI’s latest milestone suggest, though, GPT-3 is only going to keep on talking, and we need to be ready for a world filled with robot-generated chatter. &lt;/p&gt;
