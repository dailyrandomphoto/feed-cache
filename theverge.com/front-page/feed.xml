    <title>Foxconn is dangling a shiny new EV plant in front of Wisconsin</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ckmmtw"&gt;iPhone builder Foxconn is dangling a massive electric vehicle project in front of Wisconsin after burning the state with promises of a multibillion-dollar LCD factory that never happened. The Taiwanese conglomerate has also already fallen behind its own arbitrary deadline for choosing where it will build the EV factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adcA9D"&gt;The Taiwanese conglomerate said Friday that it has started talks to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) about making EVs with California startup Fisker Inc. at the mostly empty site it owns in the state. This is despite chairman Young Liu saying in March that he would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333868/foxconn-ev-wisconsin-fisker-geely-faraday-future"&gt;decide between building EVs in Mexico or Wisconsin by July 1st&lt;/a&gt;, and Foxconn and the WEDC agreeing to a far smaller tax subsidy package in April that reflected the failure of the LCD project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkUNcC"&gt;Why did Foxconn take a new deal with the WEDC in April when it knew it had EV ambitions in March, only to announce another negotiation with the state in July? Well, because that’s how things go with Foxconn in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WhE9U6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The conglomerate could still choose Mexico or elsewhere&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dzj1q9"&gt;“As part of the site selection process, Foxconn and Fisker have engaged with the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation to discuss plans for electric vehicle manufacturing,” Foxconn said in a statement. Foxconn and Fisker Inc. first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298878/foxconn-fisker-ev-electric-vehicle-wisconsin-deal-fsr-suv"&gt;announced their partnership in February&lt;/a&gt; and have since shared that they plan to build a low-cost electric sedan, currently called Project PEAR, which stands for “Personal Electric Automotive Revolution.” The two companies signed &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210513006048/en/Fisker-and-Foxconn-Sign-Framework-Agreements-for-Project-PEAR-Confirming-Manufacturing-to-Start-in-U.S.-From-Q4-2023"&gt;a framework agreement in May&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3QJsR"&gt;If Foxconn ultimately does move forward with trying to build EVs in Wisconsin, it would be another huge promise to a state and a workforce that it has already mightily burned by the company. Foxconn broke ground on the Wisconsin facility in 2018 and said it would invest $10 billion and build a 20 million-square-foot factory that would pump out LCD panels. Former President Donald Trump said it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;the “eighth wonder of the world.”&lt;/a&gt; The whole effort was supposed to create 13,000 jobs. In return, the company was going to get $4 billion in tax credits and other incentives from state and local governments. The local government in Mount Pleasant demolished entire neighborhoods to clear land for the proposed factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5FtlA"&gt;But the project has languished ever since. Foxconn struggled to meet the most basic hiring goals. It has invested just 3 percent of the $10 billion that it promised, and the biggest standing facility on the property measures just 1 million square feet. The company recently agreed to reclassify the building as a storage facility in official documents, and in April, Foxconn and the WEDC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393679/wisconsin-foxconn-contract-amendment-shrink"&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; to amend their contract to reflect the current, far more meager ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGWjnp"&gt;David Callender, a spokesperson for the WEDC, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an email that it is the agency’s policy “not to comment on any discussions it may or may not have with a business unless and until a contract is executed.” The agency also cited similar grounds when it denied a public records request from the &lt;em&gt;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; about the talks with Foxconn and Fisker Inc., the &lt;a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/business/2021/07/08/foxconn-partner-fisker-talks-wedc-making-electric-vehicles/7909713002/"&gt;outlet reported on Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DHnBEt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 8th Wonder of the World","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DSbccD"&gt;Foxconn has spent the last year and a half racking up deals in the EV world. It has agreements with startups that have yet to put a car into production like Fisker Inc. and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212994/byton-foxconn-electric-vehicles-china-shutdown-extended"&gt;Byton&lt;/a&gt;, a Chinese startup owned by state-run First Automotive Works. The conglomerate has also discussed making EVs with established companies like Stellantis (the company created following the recent merger of Fiat Chrysler and France’s PSA Group) and the largest private automaker in China, Geely. The Geely deal may also result in Foxconn working &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333868/foxconn-ev-wisconsin-fisker-geely-faraday-future"&gt;with Faraday Future&lt;/a&gt; (the Chinese automaker recently negotiated a stake in the California startup). Foxconn even recently announced its own electric vehicle platform that it hopes to sell to other automakers, and it’s working with Taiwanese company Gogoro on electric scooters and battery technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JpZQi3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Wisconsin amends Foxconn’s contract to reflect radically smaller project ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393679/wisconsin-foxconn-contract-amendment-shrink"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="IY5QZW"&gt;Liu, who took over the Wisconsin project after Foxconn founder Terry Gou left the company, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-wisconsin-mexico-scott-walker-taipei-313ff82519f7ac551f1a149eebf82b4e"&gt;said in March&lt;/a&gt; that he “need[s] to find a product that fits that location.” It’s a search that has stretched on for more than a year now, as Foxconn has considered &lt;a href="https://www.wpr.org/failed-partnerships-and-vacant-buildings-foxconns-wisconsin-commitment-remains-standstill"&gt;making everything from coffee robots&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21213269/foxconn-ventilators-wisconsin-plant-medtronic-pb-560-open-source-design-covid-19"&gt;ventilators&lt;/a&gt; at the facility. Still, Liu said at the time that there was no guarantee Foxconn would choose to build electric vehicles at the site. “Whether it’s Wisconsin or Mexico, it’s not political, it’s business from my perspective,” he said in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yffL6S"&gt;Wherever they wind up trying to build it, Fisker Inc. and Foxconn have said they plan to start production on the EV by the end of 2023. Fisker Inc.’s first vehicle, the Ocean SUV, is supposed to go into production in November 2022. It will be &lt;a href="https://investors.fiskerinc.com/news/news-details/2021/Fisker-and-Magna-Sign-Long-Term-Manufacturing-Agreement/default.aspx"&gt;built in Austria by automotive supplier Magna&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok will start automating video removals for nudity and more in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rtd4JO3uJ3WOwyfNdJyZV9FDBlA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69561312/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0002.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UUOiDE"&gt;TikTok is trying to speed up its moderation process by removing human reviewers where its automated systems can do the job about as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4M9lC9"&gt;In the US and Canada, the company is &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/advancing-our-approach-to-user-safety"&gt;going to start&lt;/a&gt; using automated reviewing systems to weed out videos with nudity, sex, violence, graphic content, illegal activities, and violations of its minor safety policy. If the system catches a video in those categories, it’ll be pulled right away, and the creator will be given the opportunity to appeal to a human moderator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYNZ2P"&gt;Until now, TikTok has run all videos by human moderators in the US before pulling them, a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The change is meant in part to limit the “volume of distressing videos” moderators are required to watch and give them more time to spend on trickier clips, like misinformation, that require context to properly review. Moderators for other companies, like Facebook, have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona"&gt;developed PTSD-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt; from the videos they were required to watch. The announcement is also part of an effort to provide more transparency around moderation, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/tiktok-automation-video-removals-5388a03a-4625-4435-9311-ede21fafc148.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which first reported the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tw25xd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most videos TikTok removes fall under these categories&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dPZJiX"&gt;The problem TikTok will face is that automated systems are never perfect, and some communities may be hit hardest by errors in automated takedowns. The app has a history of discriminatory moderation and was recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22519433/tiktok-intersex-ban-mistake-moderation-transparency"&gt;criticized for pulling the intersex hashtag twice&lt;/a&gt;. TikTok says it’s starting to use automation only where it’s most reliable; it’s been testing the tech in other countries, including Brazil and Pakistan, and says only 5 percent of the videos its systems removed actually should have been allowed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gu2qPA"&gt;That’s a low number, but when put in context of &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/resources/tiktok-transparency-report-2021-h-1"&gt;how many videos TikTok removes&lt;/a&gt; — 8,540,088 videos in the US during the first three months of 2021 — there could end up being tens or hundreds of thousands of videos pulled by mistake. The vast majority of the videos removed fall under the categories TikTok is implementing automated moderation. That said, not all of those videos are going to be routed around human reviewers. A spokesperson says human moderators will still be checking community reports, appeals, and other videos flagged by its automated systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GC2yt9"&gt;TikTok says it’ll be rolling out the automated review system “over the next few weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo Yoga 9i (14-inch) review: sounds like a winner</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Lenovo’s latest convertible has excellent speakers and good performance&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Zpu7S2"&gt;Lenovo is a big player in the convertible laptop sphere, and the Yoga 9i is its top dog. A sequel to the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fyoga%2Fyoga-2-in-1-series%2FLenovo-Yoga-C940-14IIL%2Fp%2F88YGC901221&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22569871%2Flenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Yoga C940&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fyoga%2Fyoga-2-in-1-series%2FYoga-9-14ITL5%2Fp%2F88YGC901455&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22569871%2Flenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,299.99-and-up&lt;/a&gt; 14-inch Yoga 9i is a capable laptop in almost every area that matters, with a comfortable keyboard, respectable battery life, and some of the better specs you can get at its price point. But there’s one area where it’s far ahead of the pack — the audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vtkjfu"&gt;Yes, you read that correctly. There’s actually a 14-inch laptop out there with very good audio. I know. I’m shocked to be typing that, too. Though it doesn’t quite surpass the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP’s Spectre x360&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309005/microsoft-surface-pro-7-plus-review"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Pro 7 Plus&lt;/a&gt; in many other areas, the Yoga 9i’s innovative speaker design keeps it very much in the premium mix as an exceptional entertainment and multimedia machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SiSv1Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10644262"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u7Kocd"&gt;About this speaker system, to start. There are two downward-firing woofers on the bottom. But the 9i’s secret is that the custom tweeters are housed in a rotating soundbar, which is built into the laptop’s hinge. The positioning means that the grills are always facing outward, regardless of whether the laptop is in clamshell, tablet, or tent mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VgWyT"&gt;I’m not exaggerating when I say this is the best audio I’ve ever heard from a laptop of this size. Its volume more than fills a room, and it sounds great in all orientations with booming bass. The surround quality was also superb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qXp7qLpzQxMQGsH6ALJRZ3W55I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651287/akrales_20210609_4596_0067.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The excellent sound is thanks to speakers embedded in the hinge that always face you, no matter which way you use the 9i. Unfortunately, the garish logo is always visible, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ddiKk_DxNpbrUe_tpbquzgdQWg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651296/akrales_20210609_4596_0172.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you flip the Yoga 9i to tablet mode, the speaker in the hinge faces outward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B6SbQp"&gt;The 9i comes preloaded with Dolby Atmos Speaker System software, where you can swap between presets for Movie, Music, Game, and Voice as well as personalized profiles and a dynamic mode that detects your content and adjusts the audio accordingly. These do make a difference — namely, the Music mode brings the vocals out more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="y3u8jP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10644285"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lKhmHs"&gt;To complement the sound, the 9i has a very nice 1080p touch display with accurate details and colors. I’d have no problem watching movies and YouTube videos on it, and you can switch between different picture modes (Dark, Light, and Vivid) with preloaded Dolby Vision software. The screen is quite glossy, however, and kicked back a frustrating amount of glare in brighter rooms. And it’s not the brightest around, maxing out at 290 nits in testing. I also wish Lenovo would ditch the 16:9 aspect ratio, as it has for some of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22376272/lenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable-review"&gt;premium&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;models&lt;/a&gt; in the business space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nm7n1f"&gt;The final thing to call out about the chassis is its garaged stylus. Garaged styluses are sometimes a huge pain to tug in and out, but this one was smooth to remove. The garage’s location on the right side of the Yoga’s rear edge isn’t the most convenient, but it’s definitely preferable to having to store the pen yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48nA9L"&gt;The stylus has a new “elastomer” tip that’s supposed to mimic the feeling of a pen on paper. That’s a fair description of how it feels in practice, but it also means it’s not as smooth to write and draw with as other touchscreen styluses. (It’s also tiny — much smaller than most real pens.) And there are two (very small) buttons, which can be mapped to various tasks — erase, left click, copy, paste, whatever you want — in Lenovo’s Pen Settings software. You can check the pen’s battery here as well. Lenovo says it can last 40 minutes on a 15-minute charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i9jXCdPFRUa44dRE7Hx6IEMfqbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651289/akrales_20210609_4596_0074.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 9i has a new stylus that feels more like pen on paper when writing on the screen. It lives in a garage on the back side of the laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iJXTc5oFrUG30fLLvB6lg4giHjY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651288/akrales_20210609_4596_0070.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 9i’s design is not as much of a head-turner as HP’s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bIk9iG"&gt;There’s not too much to say about the rest of this chassis. The backlit keyboard is acceptable and roomy, but a bit flatter than my favorites on the market. The device is fine-looking and sturdy enough, but it doesn’t have the same sleek professionalism as the Spectre x360 14 or the Surface Pro 7 Plus (and the prominent Lenovo logo on the hinge looks a bit corny to me). It’s not the lightest laptop around, but it’s still portable at 3.02 pounds. And the port selection is about as good as you might expect for a laptop this thin, including a USB 3.2 Type-A Gen 2, two Thunderbolt 4, and an audio combo jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSAzxy"&gt;There are some optional fancy features — an ultrasonic fingerprint reader, an edge-to-edge glass palm rest, a haptic touchpad, and a leather cover — that weren’t included on the model I was sent. Configurations with those extra features start around &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fcart%2F90ce9411-7e78-4b7e-8a0f-93c96d9ce36f%3FactiveTabName%3D%26transMessageFlag%3Dtrue&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22569871%2Flenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,769.99&lt;/a&gt;, currently discounted to $1,239.99 on Lenovo’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oum5W9"&gt;The Yoga 9i starts at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fyoga%2Fyoga-2-in-1-series%2FYoga-9-14ITL5%2Fp%2F82BGCTO1WWENUS0%2Fcustomize%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22569871%2Flenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,299.99&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1745728072503349543" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,449.99 as tested&lt;/a&gt;). The base model includes a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of RAM (soldered), and 256GB of storage (PCIe SSD). This specific configuration comes with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage as well as a Core i7-1185G7 (Intel’s top chip for thin and light devices). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrnJ4D"&gt;The Yoga 9i is verified through Intel’s Evo platform, as are many of its competitors in the premium 2-in-1 space. To qualify, laptops are supposed to offer a number of Intel-selected benefits, including Thunderbolt 4, Wi-Fi 6, all-day battery life, quick boot time, fast charging, and responsive performance on battery. In my experience, check, check, and check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WRj3ZzKZYMY3aoVq5Jrq89P1Aiw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651283/akrales_20210609_4596_0036.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Yoga 9i’s keyboard and trackpad are adequate but nothing special.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ktjxoF"&gt;Performance was as satisfactory as we’d expect from the top-notch 1185G7. The system blazed through a load of 20ish Chrome tabs and booted up noticeably faster than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21174917/lenovo-yoga-c740-review-laptop-specs-features-price-2-in-1-convertible" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th Gen Yoga systems&lt;/a&gt; would. Intel’s Iris Xe graphics are more than capable of running some games, as long as you’re not expecting 60fps from anything too demanding. Battery life was also a pleasant surprise, given the power of the processor. I averaged eight hours and 25 minutes of continuous use, with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yiwUqZ"&gt;As far as video calling goes, the 9i’s webcam is a bit grainy but serviceable; it has a physical privacy shutter, though it’s very tiny and can be clumsy to move if you have large fingers. The camera doesn’t support Windows Hello (which is a bit disappointing — other top convertibles at this price point like Spectres and Surfaces do have this feature), but there is a fingerprint sensor beneath the arrow keys that you can use to log in. It had trouble identifying my finger once or twice but was quick and accurate otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZF3eb"&gt;The 9i also has two dual-array microphones. These are useful not just for video calling (where they picked up my voice just fine) but for Amazon Alexa, which comes preinstalled on the Yoga. Not only can smart home devotees give Alexa voice commands via the Yoga, but they can also activate Amazon’s Show Mode, which will change the Yoga’s home screen to look like the home screen of an Echo smart display. Hey, don’t let me stop you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVyMb6"&gt;My one disappointment here is bloatware. The Yoga 9i doesn’t come loaded with a ton of junk like some budget computers do, but it does force McAfee LiveSafe on you. McAfee alerts were popping up all over the place while I set the device up, and sometimes even appeared in windows in the middle of my screen and interrupted what I was doing. The program is a pain to uninstall, requiring you to close all of your tabs and then to restart your computer. It’s not a huge issue in the grand scheme of things, but it rubs me the wrong way to see this on a $1,500 laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VqpB6VCPsWUJ7cytwEESzah9uBM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651294/akrales_20210609_4596_0133.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Yoga 9i carries on Lenovo’s heritage of convertible laptops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Trdd8B"&gt;Overall, though, I have very few complaints. The Yoga 9i is an excellent 2-in-1 with standout audio. But is it &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;best? To answer that, we need to compare it to HP’s Spectre x360 14, the reigning monarch of the 14-inch convertible sphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ip7Vbf"&gt;At MSRP, the Spectre is &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeLenovoYoga9i070921&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2FConfigureView%3FlangId%3D-1%26storeId%3D10151%26catalogId%3D10051%26catEntryId%3D3074457345619782318%26urlLangId%3D%26quantity%3D1%26color%3Dnatural%2Bsilver" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$180 more than the Yoga&lt;/a&gt; for identical specs (though it has Intel’s Core i7-1165G7, a slight step down from the 1185G7). Its main advantage over the Yoga is its design. The Spectre is a really beautiful laptop with gold accents and beveled edges; it wouldn’t look out of place in a jewelry store. The Yoga 9i, while far from ugly, will look just about like every other laptop you’ll see in a given business meeting or lecture hall. Another significant advantage the Spectre has is the 3:2 aspect ratio, which is more roomy and comfortable for multitasking use than the Yoga’s 16:9 panel. And the Spectre is just a little bit better in many other areas. I like the keyboard just a bit more, there’s one additional port (a microSD slot, which can be quite valuable for extra storage), the webcam is better, it’s a teensy bit lighter, and it gave me around two more hours of battery life per charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2F6Id"&gt;So the Yoga 9i ultimately doesn’t take the Spectre’s crown. Still, it delivers such standout audio — a realm where so many expensive laptops are flatly terrible — that I’m glad it exists as an option for people who really value the quality of their music and movie soundtracks. And the 9i is certainly functional enough in every other area that if you’re looking for a convertible and the Spectre is out of your price range or if standout audio and a garaged stylus are priorities for you, it’s one to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="H6VjHU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10644295"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>As Marvel’s epics get bigger, Black Widow’s stakes feel too small</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CGd_ah5QSw-KFX7SNJ7FmkXc548=/1171x0:3736x1710/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69560826/nya2960_comp_v013_dd87654e.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BVyDdG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; was released at the wrong time, in multiple ways. The new Marvel prequel was one of the most high-profile films to be displaced by the constantly shifting theatrical release schedule caused by the shuttering of theaters due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; — a film set between &lt;em&gt;Captain America: Civil War&lt;/em&gt;’s superhero dust-up and &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Infinity War&lt;/em&gt;’s cosmos-spanning epic — feels like a movie that should have been released when it’s actually set, instead of as a belated prequel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jF2yee"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: spoilers ahead for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Widow,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avengers: Endgame, Loki, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and the general Marvel Cinematic Universe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-t1-5t0LoKZAGMtNstrHzEmb2s8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706938/bft2060_trl_comp_8bda88b5.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RX6uL6"&gt;It’s not that &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; is a bad movie or an unworthy member of the Marvel saga. Its brand of James Bond-esque spy-fi harks back to some of the more grounded MCU films like &lt;em&gt;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;, less focused on superpowered smack-downs in favor of more traditional action movie fare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5ZyWp"&gt;And if it had been released in 2016 after &lt;em&gt;Civil War&lt;/em&gt;, that would have been fine. But Marvel’s films have undergone vast shifts in tone since then. &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt; opened up the connected universe to straight-up magic, &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt; both offered galaxy-spanning adventures with whole planets at stake, and of course, &lt;em&gt;Infinity War &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Endgame &lt;/em&gt;see the Avengers — and Natasha Romanov — fight to save quite literally all of existence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HWxTT"&gt;After all that, &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;’s stakes feel low, especially for a character that fans have gotten to see in action in far bigger adventures for over a decade. For all the joking about how Thor could handle the Red Room without breaking a sweat, the over-the-top reality that is the regular day-to-day of the modern Marvel shows and movies hangs over &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;’s throwback style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ejhqaq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nothing about Black Widow needs it to be a prequel&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eW9Y10"&gt;Nothing in &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;’s story really necessitates it to be a prequel, either. Sure, it’s fun to see where Natasha gets her &lt;em&gt;Infinity War&lt;/em&gt; get-up from. But outside of its post-credit setup (which is set in the MCU’s post-&lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt; “present”), there’s no story element or revelation about Natasha’s character that would be different had the film been released a half-decade earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oQjpE"&gt;In fact, knowing Natasha has this found family to protect (one that the rest of the Avengers didn’t know about) could have arguably deepened her short-shrifted sacrifice in &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt;. Imagine if Natasha’s adopted sister or parents were lost in Thanos’ snap, and the sequence where she fights with Hawkeye over who gets to fling themselves off a cliff has the added weight of trying to bring them back, too. (Instead, we had Clint as the only one to potentially have to sacrifice being with his family.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jEmos5ey_c4_qRLCrUaYzuP7bt0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706954/ltr2130_103_comp_v039_22aeb1df.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OOX0M4"&gt;Contrast that with &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;. The show is airing on Disney Plus right as &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; comes out, and it also examines an older version of a Marvel character in a new light. But where &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; is using that perspective to re-examine what makes its titular character tick, and what separates the version of Loki then from the more heroic one fans were familiar with, &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t give Natasha the chance to change or grow. She’s already at the end of her journey, fully formed — she’s just the only one who doesn’t know it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PlVlJh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; also suffers from COVID-related delays; Disney is only releasing it now because it’s running out of time, thematically. Its interconnected web of shows and movies means that Marvel can’t advance with series like &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; (which will directly follow up &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;’s post-credits scene). But it also means that &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;’s comparatively grounded and realistic adventure is coming after &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s sorcerous saga or &lt;em&gt;Loki’&lt;/em&gt;s era-spanning epic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2NB8v"&gt;It’s not that &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t try to raise the stakes, establishing Dreykov’s army of Widows as some kind of massive, political force that secretly controls the world. But once you get cosmic magical space mysteries as the norm, it’s hard to go back to “spies, but better” as your table stakes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ljdomt"&gt;There’s a world where Marvel was willing to commit to a film led by one of its female characters in 2016 instead of 2019 (when &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt; finally broke the MCU’s decade-long streak of male protagonists), where &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; serves as a spotlight on Natasha’s origins ahead of her ultimate sacrifice, and where the stakes are still aligned with the studio’s other properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlZXaA"&gt;Based on the trailer for Marvel’s next theatrical bow, Shang-Chi is about to punch a dragon in the face with magic space rings. And next to that, it’s hard not to feel like &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;’s brand of more grounded spy action is too little, too late. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alto’s Odyssey is adding a vibrant new city for its Apple Arcade debut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Md23lF_0-J-SEU6XdwJ2VOMqN9s=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69560629/06_TheLostCity.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MOYytX"&gt;When the team behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/21/17035830/altos-odyssey-sequel-iphone-game-ios-adventure-snowboarding"&gt;the serene adventure &lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were working on the sequel, they had a lot of ideas that didn’t make it into the final release. One of those was a vibrant city that would be the game’s fourth biome, joining the existing desert, canyons, and ancient temples. For various reasons, the city was cut from the final release. But when the chance came to bring the game to Apple Arcade as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"&gt;the streaming service’s recent expansion&lt;/a&gt;, it made sense to go back to the concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8kTN8"&gt;The result is &lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City&lt;/em&gt;, which is coming to Arcade next week. “We’re thinking of &lt;em&gt;The Lost City&lt;/em&gt; as a special edition of &lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;,” says lead artist and designer Harry Nesbitt. “We’ve been able to go back to the drawing board a little bit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WrSJwG"&gt;The core of the game will remain the same as the original version. That means &lt;em&gt;The Lost City&lt;/em&gt; is an endless runner, where players ride a sandboard across a procedurally-generated desert landscape. It’s a mix of chill and challenge that has made the series so enduring. The Apple Arcade version simply adds a new area — but one that really changes the tone. “It’s very much a living, breathing city,” says Nesbitt. “It’s not a dusty ruin or empty wilderness like some of the other spaces we’ve depicted. It’s vibrant and alive, and has almost a party atmosphere to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQV06y"&gt;One of the challenges, he says, was making sure that the new area wasn’t too much of a jolt to players. The team didn’t want players jumping straight from a quiet desert to a bustling city, which is where the procedural aspect of &lt;em&gt;Alto&lt;/em&gt; came in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AL5b6UbGGx7i85CABYZUm6NPEbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22707013/alto_tlc_the_verge.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Snowman&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GLzGDA"&gt;“It’s definitely something we tried to be careful with,” he explains. “We don’t want it to be jarring in any sense. But because it’s a procedural game, we already have a natural progression for revealing new content to players. We try not to throw everything at them at once; we try to pace it out so that one thing leads to another. Just as you’re getting comfortable with one aspect of the game, a new thread opens up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CAT52j"&gt;The expanded version of the game also offered a chance to build on the storytelling, something that’s grown over the course of the series. While the &lt;em&gt;Alto&lt;/em&gt; games don’t have an explicit story with cutscenes or dialogue, there is clear worldbuilding going on. As Nesbitt explains it, the developers want players to feel like there’s more that “exists beyond the edges of the screen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJGBLL"&gt;And while the idea dates back a few years, the current version of &lt;em&gt;The Lost City&lt;/em&gt; was inspired in part by the pandemic, and the fact that so many of us have been trapped inside, largely unable to travel or experience the outdoors. “I think &lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; has always been a little bit about the idea of traveling and going outside of your comfort zone,” says Nesbitt, “and &lt;em&gt;The Lost City&lt;/em&gt; is a natural extension of that idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVTcEL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City&lt;/em&gt; launches on Apple Arcade on July 16th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo Switch OLED hands-on: a small upgrade that makes a big difference</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new Nintendo Switch OLED model" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/epssfWeIICac3HtsYCg_eiFbS_U=/0x0:5400x3600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69560633/NintendoSwitchOLEDmodel_Tabletop_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Nintendo Switch OLED model.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6lfuGx"&gt;Sitting down in Nintendo’s offices in Redwood City, California, yesterday, I already knew all of the main details on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565307/nintendo-oled-switch-screen-news-updates"&gt;new Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt;. It has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22566479/oled-nintendo-switch-vs-lite-screen-size"&gt;larger 7-inch OLED screen&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand"&gt;improved kickstand&lt;/a&gt;, increased internal storage, and very minor design tweaks. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565118/nintendo-oled-switch-cpu-ram-bluetooth-audio-headphones-dock-no-4k"&gt;not the “Switch Pro”&lt;/a&gt; that many have been hoping for. It’s just a Switch with a bigger, nicer screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DvUkq"&gt;I knew all that going in, but after playing a half-hour’s worth of &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild,&lt;/em&gt; I believe the word “just” in the previous sentence is unfair. The Switch OLED model has a bigger, nicer screen, and that’s more than enough to justify its existence — and perhaps its $350 price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Szsjr"&gt;The screen looks brighter and more vibrant to me than the original Switch. The increased contrast is definitely noticeable on Rainbow Road, where the neon lights popped out of the screen more brightly compared to the darker background. I’ve also been using a Switch Lite for the past year or so, and its screen looks positively dim and muddy by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWEOxp"&gt;One concern I had was that increasing the screen size while staying at the same 720p resolution would make pixels stick out and some things would look jagged. Pixels were more visible when I stopped the action and looked for them. I could see some subpar antialiasing on thin text on the home screen and on the blades of grass surrounding Link on the Great Plateau. But once I was actually &lt;em&gt;playing,&lt;/em&gt; all I saw is that the screen was bigger and everything looked brighter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaiFBs"&gt;To get really nerdy: I don’t have a definitive answer to whether the OLED screen uses a Pentile or RGB layout at the sub-pixel level, but it looks like RGB to me. At 7 inches diagonal, my sense is that Pentile would be obvious even to people who aren’t normally annoyed by it (like me). Photos weren’t allowed at the briefing, so I can’t show you a close-up image of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DLdR9m"&gt;But getting nerdy about the new Switch OLED model is overthinking it. The point of this midlife update isn’t to radically change or upgrade the Switch. It’s to make a version that feels just a little more premium and is a little more enjoyable in handheld mode. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new kickstand on the Switch is greatly improved over the original" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MbuAROgKV9qbzJCtuzZIUN1x7-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22707189/NintendoSwitchOLEDmodel_AdjustableStand_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new kickstand on the Switch is greatly improved over the original.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ewNTdG"&gt;I also have nothing but praise for the new kickstand, which is finally good. The original Switch’s kickstand was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/11/5/16602556/nintendo-switch-kickstand-problems-bad"&gt;so bad&lt;/a&gt; I never tried to use it. This one goes across the entire length of the device and can be adjusted to any angle down to nearly flat. It’s stable, too, offering just enough resistance to hold the console up but not enough to make changing its position a pain. I could just lightly press on the top of the Switch while in tabletop mode to adjust the angle and get rid of the glare from an overhead light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6uVp0T"&gt;The last noticeable change is the speakers, which are a bit louder and have just a little more clarity than the Switch Lite I’ve been using. I still prefer headphones (and no, there’s no surprise support for Bluetooth headphones), but these speakers are probably good enough to keep me from reaching for them every time I turn the Switch on like I do now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u1i4n9"&gt;There are a lot of other less important design tweaks. The fan vents on the bottom point downward instead of backward (to accommodate the new kickstand). The bezel around the larger screen is glossy black now instead of matte. The position of the microSD card slot is a little different.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new Nintendo Switch OLED model has an updated dock with ethernet." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/45djf0iouwMIFpUALhSfXKFp1n4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22707192/NintendoSwitchOLEDmodel_03.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Nintendo Switch OLED model has an updated dock with ethernet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nmw9qY"&gt;The dock has an ethernet port on it. I didn’t get a chance to play in docked mode, but the output hasn’t changed from the current Switch’s 1080p, and the processor is the same. If you play docked more often than not, none of the hardware upgrades on the OLED model apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJXuKT"&gt;Overall, I think Nintendo has very slightly improved the overall fit and finish of the hardware. It still feels a little toy-like, but it’s a nicer toy with a nicer finish. Whether that will extend to Joy-Con controllers that are less likely to suffer from drift remains to be seen, but I don’t think Nintendo has done anything notably different — they’re completely compatible with existing controllers, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQ0YsH"&gt;So the Nintendo Switch OLED model justifies its existence, but does it justify an &lt;em&gt;upgrade&lt;/em&gt;? For most people, the responsible answer is no. The improvements here are not going to unlock new game experiences or capabilities, they just make the current experiences a little nicer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqLk6V"&gt;I don’t think I’m going to be responsible, though. I knew going in that it was “just” a Switch with a bigger, brighter screen. I know after playing it that handheld mode feels like much less of a compromise than it does today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoCW02"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden executive order will target right to repair, ISPs, net neutrality, and more</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tpS2tp"&gt;The White House has &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/"&gt;issued a “fact sheet” listing the industries and policies&lt;/a&gt; it’s addressing via an executive order that President Biden will sign later today — and technology is directly in the crosshairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKKb61"&gt;That includes internet service providers, as Biden will encourage the Federal Communications Commission to restore net neutrality rules &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16777626/ajit-pai-net-neutrality-speech"&gt;undone during the prior administration&lt;/a&gt;, require providers to report prices and subscription rates, and prevent ISPs from making deals with landlords that limit tenants’ choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EvjgWu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Democrats are gearing up to fight for net neutrality ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321995/net-neutrality-ed-markey-save-the-internet-open-ajit-pai-rosenworcel"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8Bo7Nl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424363/ftc-repair-restrictions-report-nixing-the-fix-smartphones-automakers"&gt;Right-to-repair efforts&lt;/a&gt; should get a shot in the arm as the Federal Trade Commission is now tasked with trying to “limit powerful equipment manufacturers from restricting people’s ability to use independent repair shops or do DIY repairs.” It also includes language spurring the FTC to place bans or limit on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/26/8280309/amazon-warehouse-jobs-exclusive-noncompete-contracts"&gt;non-competes&lt;/a&gt; that have been common in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uAE46X"&gt;And when it comes to Big Tech, the administration’s agenda now specifically includes a mandate to require “greater scrutiny of mergers, especially by dominant internet platforms, with particular attention to the acquisition of nascent competitors, serial mergers, the accumulation of data, competition by ‘free’ products, and the effect on user privacy.” Via the FTC, the Biden administration plans a push to place more rules on surveillance and data collection, which should affect many of the largest tech companies in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdzTrY"&gt;In the document, the administration claims that 72 initiatives are being undertaken to promote competition and raise wages, although it will be up to the various agencies, as well as Congress, to provide funding and action to make these things happen.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to turn TikTok’s auto captions on (or off)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EPxFQv1msaTb6-ms1eUr01YB3pE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69560363/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hFXacb"&gt;Video captions are important. To begin with, they can be a vital accessibility tool for people who are hard of hearing or deaf. In addition, captioning can be helpful for people who are in environments where they can’t use the audio and / or don’t have headphones available. Or who (like myself) occasionally like to chat during videos and use captions to keep track of what’s being said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kP3Fu"&gt;Before &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-auto-captions"&gt;TikTok added automatic captions to its app&lt;/a&gt; in April of this year, a lot of TikTok creators were manually adding captions to their TikTok videos, either via the app’s text feature or by using third-party apps. However, that’s no longer necessary — the auto caption feature is now a part of TikTok, thanks to organizations such as &lt;a href="https://thedeafcollective.org/"&gt;The Deaf Collective&lt;/a&gt;, which worked with TikTok to develop the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PtOCl"&gt;So, it’s a good idea to enable auto captions for all your videos. And don’t worry: if anybody watching one of your videos prefers not to have the captions on, they can easily shut them off (we’ll go into that in a moment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o18YqV"&gt;How to turn captioning on&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ft6WcR"&gt;After you’ve created or uploaded your video, hit the check mark to indicate you’re ready to start working on it. You’ll now be in the first editing page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fnihz4"&gt;Look for the “Captions” icon on the right side of the screen and tap it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BWCEKk"&gt;The first time you enable captions, you will get a screen that explains how they work and will ask for you to consent to the “collection and use of the audio.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To start, tap the “Captions” icon on the right side of the screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/grY4pqaU_UucIMC8tQEXQ2m9t2U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706834/Screenshot_20210708_162020.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To start, tap the “Captions” icon on the right side of the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The first time you turn captions on, you may get this message." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C8_NE0eh81ZpXKJHk3RTiyR66HY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706837/Screenshot_20210708_094731.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first time you turn captions on, you may get this message.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jUUhdS"&gt;Depending on the length of your video and the power of your phone, it may take a moment or two for TikTok to process your captions. Keep in mind that auto captions will not work for sung music that has been added to your video; this is for speech only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JR1Vjn"&gt;Once your audio has been processed, you’ll be taken to a screen that has a smaller version of the video with the captions listed underneath.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mClm19"&gt;If you’re happy with the captions, tap the “Save” button in the top right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dhQurq"&gt;If you’re not happy with them — because there are misspellings, or wrong words — you can edit them. Tap the edit icon (that looks like a pencil and a piece of paper) to the right of the word “Captions.” You can then use your phone’s keyboard to change any textual problems. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Captions screen will show you what your captions will look like." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xFIin0ZE1DsG4Com_pkM9EX5Q9I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706841/Screenshot_20210708_143929.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Captions screen will show you what your captions will look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="After you’ve tapped on the pencil icon, you can correct any textual mistakes." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XLYcPhHIZIB3hdSHSbrzghHjGfY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706842/Screenshot_20210708_144749.png"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZDBnYq"&gt;You can also split lines that you think are too long — however, you can’t join lines that you think are too short. If you accidentally split a line and change your mind, you’ll have to hit your phone’s back button, discard your edits, and try again. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KxopL0"&gt;Tap on “Save” when you’re done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="fH4EFn"&gt;Unfortunately, you can’t stylize your captions — you’re pretty much stuck with what you get, which tends to be white lettering on a slightly darkened rectangle. If you want to get fancy with your captions, then you’ll have to disable the auto caption feature (using the same Caption icon) and use the Text feature (which is at the bottom of the edit screen) to manually create captions in a variety of colors, sizes, and typefaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ALcWEJ"&gt;Disable captions for videos you’re watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dZ8Pxn"&gt;I personally love having captions on videos, but some people find them distracting. If you don’t want captions on your TikTok videos, you can disable them. (Of course, you won’t be actually getting rid of them, just hiding them on your device.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To hide captions, tap on the caption and then on the “Hide captions” bubble." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X-GgOxlh1Ezbentd-bDnqHta4w4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706845/Screenshot_20210708_154147.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To hide captions, tap on the caption and then on the “Hide captions” bubble.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To restore captions, tape on the little rectangle on the side of the screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-wA8MQH3nm5xyknkXhue-CWXwxM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706846/Screenshot_20210708_154238.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To restore captions, tap on the little rectangle on the side of the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="glsnPv"&gt;While you’re watching a captioned video, tap on the caption, and then on “Hide captions.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="twb903"&gt;Auto captions will not be turned off for all the videos you watch. There will be a small rectangle to the side of each video to indicate that it normally has captions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vl97Yw"&gt;If you want to re-enable captions, just tap on that rectangle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>The Olympics are still stuck in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sODhol"&gt;In two weeks, it’ll be 2020 again: an Olympic year, and a pandemic year, too. This year’s Olympic Games will start in July 2021, but the official logo still reads “Tokyo 2020.” The games were canceled in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, but through the funhouse mirror of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22167586/pandemic-time-perception-2020-covid"&gt;pandemic time&lt;/a&gt;, the competition is stuck back in 2020 — and COVID-19 is still threatening the games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNGXb0"&gt;Tokyo declared a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tokyo-olympics-to-be-held-under-covid-19-state-of-emergency-11625733103"&gt;state of emergency&lt;/a&gt; this week following a surge in COVID-19 cases, and Olympic organizers announced &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-set-declare-state-emergency-tokyo-area-through-aug-22-minister-2021-07-08/"&gt;Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that no fans would be allowed at competitions in the city. The decisions were made as experts &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/africa-japan-tokyo-2020-tokyo-olympics-olympic-games-9fbd360e4524dca0b25140e60ebda389"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/tokyo-doctors-call-cancellation-olympic-games-due-covid-19-2021-05-18/"&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;) that the games could lead to a spike in COVID-19 cases in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DamAu9"&gt;Japan has, so far, avoided some of the most severe impacts of the pandemic. But only around 15 percent of the population is vaccinated. The fast-spreading Delta variant will likely take over as the dominant virus in Japan by the time the games start, a &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.27.2100570"&gt;new modeling study found&lt;/a&gt;. There are &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/third-olympic-team-member-tests-positive-covid-tokyo-383683ef-6eda-46ee-9792-3c73af10aed2.html"&gt;already positive cases&lt;/a&gt; among athletes traveling in for the games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="XFaHEN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SvtOJ5"&gt;Maybe, hopefully, the restrictions in place — no fans, no family members, daily tests — will work, and keep outbreaks at an arm’s length. But in an event like the Olympics, the risk isn’t only when fans and athletes gather in a stadium. It’s the swirl of activity surrounding events that can be dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukY41V"&gt;We saw that with the &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/victoriaforster/2021/06/21/g7-summit-of-world-leaders-may-have-been-covid-19-superspreader-event/?sh=780c0e34bbcc"&gt;G7 summit&lt;/a&gt; in June, which may have been linked to a COVID-19 surge in Cornwall, England, where the gathering was held. The world leaders at the event wouldn’t have been the driver — they were vaccinated. But they brought security and staff to the area, and boosted activity in the hospitality and tourism industries. That’s where the cases spread. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/covid-19-outbreak-closes-hotel-hosting-g7-summit-delegation-2021-06-10/"&gt;One hotel&lt;/a&gt; used by a visiting delegation had to close down because of a COVID-19 outbreak among staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTyvPP"&gt;The World Health Organization also &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/world/europe/euro-2020-covid-outbreak.html"&gt;said last week&lt;/a&gt; that the European Championship soccer games led to new cases in Europe, driven by gatherings in bars and other travel. “We need to look much beyond just the stadiums themselves,” said Catherine Smallwood, the WHO’s senior emergency officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NaYgZ"&gt;Looking beyond the Olympic venues like Tokyo Stadium, tens of thousands of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/world/asia/japan-tokyo-olympics-volunteers-covid.html"&gt;volunteers&lt;/a&gt; will keep the Olympics running. Most won’t be vaccinated. They won’t be in a bubble. Tens of thousands of athletes and coaches are streaming into the country. They’re not required to be vaccinated, and even though they’ll be tested regularly, tests aren’t foolproof. It’s a major risk, and one the Olympic organizers seem ready to take on behalf of the people in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATIaVh"&gt;The march toward the games is marked by a sense of inertia and inevitability (instead of the normal torch rally, which was canceled because of the virus). The ball got rolling back in 2013 when Tokyo was first awarded the games. They’re gargantuan, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/who-could-cancel-the-tokyo-olympics-11623111896"&gt;stuffed with&lt;/a&gt; financial stakes for the International Olympic Committee and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-24/nbc-pays-billions-for-olympics-tv-rights-what-happens-now"&gt;broadcasters&lt;/a&gt;, political symbolism, and contractual obligations with host cities. Despite calls to cancel, the momentum kept going forward. That pulled the spectacle and specter of 2020 through to a second year — medals and disease risk and all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sx6qGZ"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gHfsse"&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ENQOj1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/06/science/Israel-Pfizer-covid-vaccine.html"&gt;The world is worried about the Delta virus variant. Studies show vaccines are effective against it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s hard to figure out how well vaccines work once they’re used in the real world, but it seems like the COVID-19 shots still do a good job at protecting against the Delta variant. (Carl Zimmer/&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

The Fitbits also showed that people recovering from COVID-19 took longer to return to normal sleep and activity levels than people with other illnesses.

Antibodies produced by people with two shots of the vaccine, though, were able to block the virus. (Elizabeth Cooney/&lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

(Robert F. Service/&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="grbPRu"&gt;Perspectives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XAsry3"&gt;There have been times when I broke down and cried. It was just devastating, because you leave the hospital and you come out into a community that doesn’t believe that it’s real and in what it can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="XfR5U2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt; Jamie Swift, a nurse in Appalachia, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/07/06/appalachian-covid-deniers-nurses-virginia/"&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; caring for patients in a community that thinks COVID-19 is a hoax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IOqaIp"&gt;More than numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DQbfNz"&gt;To the people who have received the 3.3 billion vaccine doses distributed so far — thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXrVhu"&gt;To the more than 185,355,311 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYFbjS"&gt;To the families and friends of the 4,005,801 people who have died worldwide — 606,399  of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aB5sN7"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
