    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;When we couldn’t go out, we watched anything and everything&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ygREiP"&gt;By the end of March, questions with friends and family went from “Any plans this weekend?” to “What are you watching now?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xNYT1"&gt;The pandemic forced most of us inside, sometimes for weeks on end. Zoom hangs &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/21314793/zoom-fatigue-video-chat-facebook-google-meet-microsoft-teams"&gt;got tired pretty quickly&lt;/a&gt;, puzzles were finished in &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/09/932652740/puzzle-business-goes-bonkers-as-people-seek-pandemic-pastimes-at-home"&gt;rapid succession&lt;/a&gt;, and there are only so many home workouts to be &lt;a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/a33635518/chloe-ting-teenage-girls-and-the-quest-for-flat-abs-in-lockdown/"&gt;done in a day&lt;/a&gt;. My friends and I started catching up on shows we promised we’d someday watch but kept putting off (for many, that seemed to be &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;) or dove into &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, &lt;/em&gt;DC&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and Marvel Cinematic Universe marathons. Everyone was streaming all the time — to the point that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21195358/streaming-netflix-disney-hbo-now-youtube-twitch-amazon-prime-video-coronavirus-broadband-network"&gt;data caps were instituted in countries&lt;/a&gt; around the world by regulatory boards that were worried the internet would crash under the strain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kjd8LI"&gt;The internet never collapsed, but streaming, once an isolated activity, became one of the only forms of connection we had. In March and April, Netflix’s eight-part documentary series &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21203686/tiger-king-netflix-meme-tiktok-twitter-live-tv-coronavirus-viral"&gt;one of the few things&lt;/a&gt; people could talk about outside of the pandemic. &lt;em&gt;Tiger King &lt;/em&gt;wasn’t special, but it became a show that everyone could obsess over and feel unified by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jhrkSL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At a moment when the world was isolated, streaming became a meaningful connection&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kLmpbm"&gt;At a moment when the world was so isolated and people were cut off from each other, what we were streaming became a meaningful connection. We’ve had that time and again throughout the pandemic: &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/11/queens-gambit-fake-deep-period-piece.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Queen’s Gambit,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152431/the-mandalorian-season-2-episode-6-star-wars-dark-forces-trooper-baby-yoda-grogu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Emily in Paris, The Undoing, &lt;/em&gt;and more. Not to mention we reconnected with friends over shows and movies we love so much: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21266644/avatar-the-last-airbender-netflix-episodes-start-zuko-alone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Grey’s Anatomy, Criminal Minds, Adventure Time, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer,&lt;/em&gt; to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czPHnD"&gt;Companies took note. By the end of 2020, nearly every major company with a streaming service was peddling the same line to investors: streaming isn’t just a way to jump on a moment; it’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536842/streaming-disney-hbo-max-peacock-cbs-all-access-warnermedia-viacom-nbcuniversal"&gt;future of the businesses&lt;/a&gt;. Disney, WarnerMedia, NBCUniversal, and ViacomCBS have undergone massive shifts internally to restructure themselves around their respective streaming products — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562796/disney-plus-one-year-earnings-q4-mandalorian-streaming-subscribers-theaters"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22162918/christopher-nolan-tenet-hbo-max-warner-bros-streaming-service-cinematic-releases"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324215/peacock-nbc-universal-comcast-app-how-to-watch-download-price-subscription-stream-shows"&gt;Peacock&lt;/a&gt;, and CBS All Access (soon to become &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437729/cbs-all-access-paramount-plus-new-name-rebrand-2021-international-disney-hbo"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;). Movies once designated for theaters are premiering on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;streaming platforms&lt;/a&gt;, features like group watch parties allow people stuck at home to make their streaming experience more interactive, and exclusivity deals continue to play out as each company vies for the biggest audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZfw16"&gt;We’re in the middle of a radical shift in the industry — in nearly &lt;em&gt;every &lt;/em&gt;industry — brought on by unprecedented forced acceleration. E-commerce is up because people are choosing to shop online; educators are adapting to teaching over Zoom; and in Hollywood, one message has carried forward throughout the year more so than any other: I stream, you stream, we all stream for eternity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmYFvV"&gt;Every streaming service is trying to accomplish the same thing. Subscribers should be able to hit play, search, fast-forward and rewind, and enable subtitles without difficulty. It shouldn’t take long for machine learning algorithms to pick up on what a particular person is interested in and recommend shows or movies quickly. Each platform is also immensely different. Content design, user interface design, and the slightly different controls that create a streaming experience make all the difference in an enjoyable time navigating and watching a program and huffing in frustration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfH9Ps"&gt;Since streaming is so fundamentally important, and will remain so going forward, and because every platform is unique in its own way, I’ve decided to assign each service a grade. These are my personal feelings on streaming services that I use every single day (often for &lt;em&gt;far too many&lt;/em&gt; hours throughout the day). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="QDAwvw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Report Cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gdopM7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HBO Max: B- &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="p4Hkng"&gt;Pros: &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="et0FHm"&gt;One of the best film libraries of any streaming service, including the Studio Ghibli collection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="W5zLtz"&gt;Incredible lineup of animated shows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ceNE5y"&gt;All of HBO’s catalog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LxLFpu"&gt;Curated selection of episodes for high-profile shows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3pVNxY"&gt;Hubs for different franchises &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9a2o29"&gt;Offline downloads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="025gZU"&gt;Cons: &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uYESnn"&gt;Search functionality isn’t reliable &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yAYC6P"&gt;No fast-forward button &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RLjJvm"&gt;No 4K / HDR capabilities currently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GTwYFE"&gt;Not available on Roku &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tYYYIE"&gt;On the more expensive side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LYvCpb"&gt;Glitchy &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0DyIGm"&gt;HBO Max is my favorite streaming service. It’s the one I open most frequently, the one that I spend most time on, and the one that’s usually carrying a show that everyone is talking about. At the time of this writing, that show was &lt;em&gt;The Undoing, &lt;/em&gt;but I’m obsessed with &lt;em&gt;Industry, &lt;/em&gt;and I’m excited for &lt;em&gt;The Flight Attendant &lt;/em&gt;to drop. With a library that includes all of Studio Ghibli, some good DC movies, an incredible slate of cartoons, and animated programming from Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, HBO Max has everything I need. Still, despite how much I love it, the fact that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324139/peacock-roku-amazon-fire-tv-hbo-max-streaming-warnermedia-nbcuniversal-disney-apple"&gt;it’s not on Roku&lt;/a&gt; (one of the biggest aggregators in the United States), can be glitchy, and doesn’t have 4K-enabled streaming are impossible to ignore. From a content perspective, HBO Max is an A+ service, but it’s everything else that drags it down. At $15 a month, not having access to those features becomes a problem. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney Plus&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aa1uCP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disney Plus: A-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6YhiXz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1lmKqP"&gt;Big hubs for main film and TV franchises &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mJtsi4"&gt;Decent catalog of movies and TV shows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="asSZLg"&gt;4K / HDR streaming capable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8DHVUO"&gt;Watch parties are available &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="18DkjT"&gt;Available on all aggregators &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jWuBDY"&gt;Affordable pricing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zcNxCg"&gt;Offline downloads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Jfxe52"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="AFymIy"&gt;Confusing content design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aJgt23"&gt;Limited selection for subscribers &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hJVhwY"&gt;Not enough new content week after week &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="3fiw9r"&gt;There’s no question that Disney Plus is a breakout success. Parents can have &lt;em&gt;Frozen &lt;/em&gt;running all day to keep kids entertained, and shows like &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;or movies like &lt;em&gt;Hamilton &lt;/em&gt;are enough to keep people subscribed. The biggest issue, however, remains that Disney’s content design is often confusing. Searching for something should be a pretty seamless activity, but Disney Plus’ hubs ironically make it frustrating to find movies or TV shows even within their specific sections. The &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; section, for example, could be separated into various trilogies, animated shows, and others, but for some reason, it’s all thrown together in a nonsensical way. Streaming is more than just the content on a platform — it’s the experience of using said platform. Disney Plus could use a little work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cxk-fpsDpO58IMBUOQkLSb_V-vs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20051231/umbrella_academy.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6FakUB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Netflix: A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sqMGKY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lZT44C"&gt;Most extensive library of films and TV shows, including new programming being added weekly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vf4KUX"&gt;Available on all aggregators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d4Hzcy"&gt;4K / HDR capabilities &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QRmLfX"&gt;One tap fast-forward and rewind capabilities &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5pBNRd"&gt;Great audio control and options directly inside the streamer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="n4C99k"&gt;Offline downloads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="R4718z"&gt;Pretty good personal recommendations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="8KWAt6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xypOrh"&gt;Quality of programming is inconsistent at best&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XXOfGe"&gt;Terrible content organization &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="6hDN1Q"&gt;Netflix is the be all, end all of streaming services for a reason. It’s not because Netflix has been around the longest (that goes to Hulu); it’s because Netflix is the equivalent to basic cable. There’s something for everyone at a relatively affordable price, with new shows and movies appearing all the time — not to mention Netflix’s international power means shows from different countries can find new audiences. The Spanish series &lt;em&gt;Money Heist, &lt;/em&gt;for example,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is one of Netflix’s most popular shows. Netflix’s worst quality is that navigating its interface can be a chore, and I end up searching for something for 10 minutes before settling on a &lt;em&gt;Hannibal &lt;/em&gt;rewatch because there’s too much &lt;em&gt;meh &lt;/em&gt;content. But for $14 a month, Netflix remains the best bang for your buck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GFE564xNwwF0w4lEIJtWSQEU6Do=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154956/picard.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fvnLL4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBS All Access: B-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5b9qDM"&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HiGGMj"&gt;Access to live news and some sports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J6PYFW"&gt;Excellent catalog of older titles &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1Meu3L"&gt;Affordable pricing options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OJTaqa"&gt;Available on all aggregators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="pHKV3x"&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9XOFP9"&gt;Not 4K / HDR capable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4maPoE"&gt;Lack of new shows on a consistent basis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TOX3m4"&gt;Terrible UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PmAtGe"&gt;Most shows I want are also available on Netflix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ldn6Ii"&gt;CBS All Access is like the channel you forget you have until you’re scrolling one night and see something that catches your attention. There’s nothing particularly wrong with CBS All Access, but there’s hardly any reason to sign up when compared to what competitors are offering. Originals bring people in; libraries keep them. CBS All Access has a stellar library of classic TV shows and films, but I can’t think of the last time I felt like I had to open CBS All Access to catch something. Even some of my favorite ViacomCBS shows, like &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds&lt;/em&gt;, are available on Netflix. CBS All Access has yet to prove why it’s something I should want, let alone why it’s something any of us need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P9Lij1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Prime Video: C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Esko4T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="V4bZ2b"&gt;Included with Amazon Prime account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fR1pK3"&gt;A number of projects from all-star creatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="toDkYt"&gt;Available on all aggregators &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f46ZX8"&gt;Offers 4K / HDR content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ejL915"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zXgr7g"&gt;Absolute garbage user interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Nw5s8A"&gt;Search functionality isn’t optimal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="56qIFr"&gt;New content is sparse &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EPckvt"&gt;Library offering doesn’t compare to competitors &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hffvUm"&gt;Overall incredibly frustrating to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dwotfn"&gt;No offline downloads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="CZ5Ov2"&gt;Considering that Amazon Prime Video is a massive undertaking from one of the biggest corporations in the world, one might expect it to work well. It doesn’t. Nothing about using Amazon Prime Video is a pleasant experience. The catalog is relatively weak compared to others, browsing and searching are more complicated than they need to be, and the experience of watching something through the streaming portal is dismal. If it wasn’t part of the Amazon Prime package, I don’t know why anyone would use it. &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Marvelous Mrs. Maisel &lt;/em&gt;isn’t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; good. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jTYfLu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hulu: B+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Q15x0W"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ts0Tzm"&gt;Incredible library of content &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1JZ0qN"&gt;4K / HDR capability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KvOSC5"&gt;Offline downloads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ADzVWF"&gt;Consistent stream of new content &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VKr9fR"&gt;Home to the FX on Hulu hub for prestige series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7P8TwV"&gt;Excellent personalized recommendations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="flAtJr"&gt;Affordable pricing options &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FF4n1u"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wWEjYI"&gt;Not super intuitive &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3TPm5L"&gt;Browsing is a pain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AMLtyd"&gt;Content design is difficult to navigate &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="dKOBQ2"&gt;Hulu is one of the longest-running streamers, so the team has had some time to figure things out. It’s mostly worked out pretty well. Hulu has one of the best library offerings at an affordable price and allows for seamless viewing when a movie or TV show is selected. The biggest issues remain browsing, searching, and the content design. Hulu isn’t search friendly. The personal recommendations are great, but actually scrolling around trying to find something is annoying. There doesn’t appear to be any rhyme or reason to how Hulu is laid out, and it takes away from how great the service truly is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="BHBIOM"&gt;“Channels” section is confusing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1VPyiU"&gt;Content design is counterintuitive &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="TyrgM3"&gt;Peacock is… well, that’s part of the issue. I’m still not quite sure what Peacock wants to be. It’s a general streamer that has one of the best collections of classic TV shows, thanks to NBCUniversal, but Peacock is trying to be too many things at once. It’s a bit of a mess. If it weren’t for the affordable pricing and library collection, I don’t see why anyone would return to it. There are some good series (I love the &lt;em&gt;Saved by the Bell &lt;/em&gt;reboot), and if I want to marathon &lt;em&gt;Law and Order: SVU&lt;/em&gt;, I can. But trying to figure out how to navigate the service takes more time than it should. There also aren’t enough new series or exclusive titles that make me want to open Peacock every day. Fans of &lt;em&gt;The Office &lt;/em&gt;might start doing that in 2021 when the show moves from Netflix to Peacock, but NBCUniversal needs to give me more reasons to open the app. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple TV Plus&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qFGB5x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple TV Plus: B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ycmIbk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fmM1bM"&gt;Cheapest of the group &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1wafY6"&gt;Quality programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XEKmJC"&gt;Easy to navigate &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DZS0ke"&gt;Offline viewing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oWfGl8"&gt;4K / HDR capable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SkTHkB"&gt;Available on all aggregators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="9vXuw2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jzuGI4"&gt;Not a huge library offering &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wPXwWm"&gt;No catalog of classic TV shows or movies &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="o1L1xe"&gt;Not enough consistent new entries &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="l19pCq"&gt;Much like Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV Plus has the advantage of belonging to a much bigger ecosystem. Buy any new Apple product, get Apple TV Plus for free. The downside is that there isn’t much to watch. And as far as downsides go, that’s a pretty big one. If the goal is to keep users subscribed and open the app every day, Apple’s lack of endless things to watch makes that a difficult ask. The upside is that many of the shows and movies being added to Apple TV Plus are worth checking out. I don’t use Apple TV Plus as often, but when I do, I enjoy what I watch. I feel pretty confident in saying that in a few years, that B- will be hovering around a B+ / A-.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yJz18PtYp96dYMfepUXYW-UwDGw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68522344/cwelch_201114_4292_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kZ8W3Z"&gt;Apple had a solid year of tech products across a wide variety of categories. From introducing the M1 chip on computers (including the MacBook Pro), releasing four new iPhones (including the first iPhone with the “mini” moniker), two new Apple Watches, and a few updates on some iPad models, this year’s releases spanned a wide gamut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfjv0F"&gt;Today’s deals highlight some of the better discounts you can find right now if you want to buy some Apple tech this holiday season, including historically low prices on the Mac mini with M1 and multiple iPad Pro configurations discounted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eJ1uGJ"&gt;The new Mac mini with M1 is on sale at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WdjsGd"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;new Mac mini with the M1 chip&lt;/a&gt; launched last month, and if you were looking to upgrade to this computer, you could get the base configuration with &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604799-REG%2Fapple_mgnr3ll_a_mac_mini.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB of memory and 256GB of SSD for only $669&lt;/a&gt; at B&amp;amp;H Photo. If you need a bit more storage, the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604800-REG%2Fapple_mgnt3ll_a_mac_mini.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage (and 8GB of RAM) model is $849&lt;/a&gt;, which is $50 off its usual price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="q7Xbyx"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro models feature a dual-lens rear camera, 4K rendering for video editing apps, a 120Hz display, and Face ID. Multiple configurations for both the 11- and 12-inch models are on sale right now.

&lt;p id="UszOBy"&gt;The holiday season is a great time to buy an influx of video games, given how many holiday sales are available at various retailers. If you didn’t have luck getting a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S before the holiday season, perhaps consider picking up a Nintendo Switch if you have not already. If you do buy a Switch or already have one and need some games to play with family and friends, Target has a &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmario-kart-8-deluxe-super-mario-party-double-pack-nintendo-switch%2F-%2FA-80960673%3Fclkid%3Dc9d24d41Ne08b11eab1b942010a246e26%26lnm%3D360518%26afid%3DSlickdeals_LLC%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe + Super Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; double pack&lt;/a&gt; for just $80 right now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Half-Life: Alyx is my game of the year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Half-Life: Alyx art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XBL7Io-wTnVaHxqkOS1f1cCiAnw=/140x0:1660x1013/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68522258/CITADEL_2K.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RWzJJ9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/em&gt; is one of the last things that makes me feel like a fan, and that’s why I was afraid of &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9wtDO"&gt;Writing about video games changed my relationship with the medium. I’m used to analyzing exactly why I like my favorite games. Meeting developers has helped me see their work as an idiosyncratic human creation, not a magical self-contained artifact. I’ve encountered the worst of fan culture, and it’s made me wary of deep, unconditional, inarticulable loyalty to media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fr4MID"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gordon and Alyx felt like old friends&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o9lm27"&gt;For some reason, though, &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/em&gt; and its follow-up episodes are special. They’re not my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/11/20759434/system-shock-2-looking-glass-20th-anniversary-retrospective"&gt;favorite games&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18102541/half-life-20th-anniversary-retrospective-first-person-shooter-design"&gt;my favorite &lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt; games&lt;/a&gt;. Like a robot short-circuiting while trying to articulate the concept of love, I’m incapable of explaining my deep investment in the story of a crowbar-wielding physicist named Gordon Freeman fighting an oppressive alien regime with his tech-genius partner Alyx Vance. But I played the games in college, and I somehow developed the kind of obsession that leads you down a rabbit hole of &lt;em&gt;Garry’s Mod&lt;/em&gt; fan comics because you &lt;em&gt;just want to be around more Half-Life. &lt;/em&gt;A decade later, long after I gave up on the fabled &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 3&lt;/em&gt;, Gordon and Alyx still felt like old friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0zTUz"&gt;When Valve announced &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; for virtual reality, promising a &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/em&gt; prequel that would address the series’ cliffhanger ending, I knew I’d end up reviewing it. And part of me dreaded the prospect. At worst, the game might be terrible. Even if it was okay, I worried encountering a new &lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt; game would expose my fandom as simple nostalgia — something I could &lt;em&gt;remember&lt;/em&gt; feeling, but only enjoy as an echo from a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0LYAr9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 is my game of the year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22175868/tony-hawk-pro-skater-1-2-game-of-the-year-2020"},{"title":"Why Demon’s Souls is my game of the year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22150718/demons-souls-remake-ps5-playstation-5-sony-game-of-the-year-2020"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rhfDaN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; was neither terrible &lt;em&gt;nor&lt;/em&gt; just okay. I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"&gt;wrote about the game at length&lt;/a&gt; in March, explaining how good it is — both as a VR experience and a first-person shooter. &lt;em&gt;Alyx&lt;/em&gt; recaptures the seamless level design that Valve perfected in earlier &lt;em&gt;Half-Life &lt;/em&gt;games. It combines &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2’s&lt;/em&gt; physics system with the pleasure of having actual motion-tracked “hands” through VR controllers. Like &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/em&gt;, it applies that ethos to both explicit puzzles and random, funny mechanics like grabbing hats to protect you from overhead enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NQrY6u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Half-Life: Alyx’ is both a great VR game and a great first-person shooter&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f9CVI8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alyx&lt;/em&gt; is one of several good VR shooters. But it has a unique design that’s intuitive yet realistically clumsy. To fire a gun, you have to hit a button to eject a magazine or crack open a chamber, grab new ammunition from behind your shoulder, fit the ammo into the gun, and cock it before firing. While that’s obviously still a simplified take on real firearms, it’s a fun and unique skill to master, as well as a fairly challenging one in the heat of combat. &lt;em&gt;Alyx&lt;/em&gt; is long for a VR game — which means it’s about as long as a traditional mid-length shooter — but the system never gets old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9KnLwF"&gt;Unlike most of my colleagues’ favorite games this year, lots of people can’t easily play &lt;em&gt;Alyx&lt;/em&gt;, since the game requires both a wired VR headset and a gaming PC. But it’s only become more accessible since launch. It’s easier to find a headset with the new wired HP Reverb G2 and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;convertible Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/valve-index-stock-check-headset-availability-shipping-countries/"&gt;some restocks&lt;/a&gt; of Valve’s Index, the best way to play the game. I went back to &lt;em&gt;Alyx&lt;/em&gt; this summer with the Quest 2, and nearly all the inconveniences I complained about in March were fixed or improved. I’m hoping &lt;em&gt;Alyx&lt;/em&gt; gets more of the attention it deserves in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zB1Fy0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Serene, unpretentious, and weird&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g7jjSE"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Alyx&lt;/em&gt; is my game of the year for more personal reasons, too. Because as it turns out, I find &lt;em&gt;Half-Life’s &lt;/em&gt;world as compelling in 2020 as I did years ago. (Well, maybe not compelling enough to dig up all the old comics again.) Like &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/em&gt;, it’s about a post-apocalyptic world that combines decaying brutalism with serene natural landscapes and lots of alien weirdness. Its story — surprisingly sweet, serious but unpretentious, and sometimes endearingly corny — focuses on Alyx Vance and her bonds with an older generation that still remembers the pre-alien invasion world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e9KMoI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alyx&lt;/em&gt; concludes with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21192318/half-life-alyx-episode-2-ending-gordon-freeman-crowbar"&gt;its own cliffhanger&lt;/a&gt; involving the G-Man, a powerful and enigmatic agent of some unknown power. It also teases a true sequel to &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/em&gt;. I’m not going to raise my hopes too much just yet. But I’m unreasonably excited already, because seriously, who is that guy working for? Why is he so interested in Alyx? What’s his &lt;em&gt;deal?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azPPTr"&gt;And again, I can logically explain why &lt;em&gt;Alyx&lt;/em&gt; is great, but not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; why it makes me so happy. 2020 has offered lots of strong contenders for the year’s best games; I’m certainly on board with universally beloved picks like &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; or the creepy and narratively innovative &lt;em&gt;World of Horror&lt;/em&gt;. But &lt;em&gt;Alyx&lt;/em&gt; is the only game that lets me hang out with a mystical three-armed alien before getting my face eaten by a headcrab, and that feels just as good as I remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEaQ3y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRh9J5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The year Instagram became Facebook</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kAvlFC"&gt;Instagram spent much of the past eight years fighting to maintain its independence from Facebook. In 2020, the fight was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2Opfs"&gt;Instagram has rolled out a series of features that are thoroughly Facebookian in nature. They’re largely focused around getting you to use the app for longer (and also tend to feel messy and incomplete). It’s hard not to see this as the moment that Instagram succumbed to Facebook’s worst tendency: a focus on growth at all costs, even if it means making a product that’s less enjoyable to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v7E0Sd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The most telling change was one of the less explosive&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QjJj9B"&gt;The changes are numerous. Facebook Messenger was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495068/facebook-messenger-instagram-cross-platform-messaging-integration"&gt;integrated into Instagram DMs&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;beat-for-beat TikTok clone&lt;/a&gt; was created and given its own section within the app, the primary “post a photo” button was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21561099/instagram-reels-shopping-home-screen-tab-update"&gt;tucked away into a corner&lt;/a&gt;, and an entire tab was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326120/instagram-shopping-facebook-pay-shop-app"&gt;given over to shopping&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4w9rb6"&gt;The most telling change was one of the less explosive ones: it was a tweak to the app’s classic photo feed. Instagram now displays &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21373809/instagram-suggested-posts-update-end-feed"&gt;an endless row of algorithmically recommended posts&lt;/a&gt; once you get through the pictures your friends put up. (On my feed, I’m mostly presented with vibey pictures of European models, with some ads mixed in between.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoqJne"&gt;This is a simple growth hack (see: Facebook injecting news stories and your friend’s friend’s dad’s questionable political group post into your News Feed), but it’s the kind of cheap trick that Instagram had avoided for a decade. It seems plainly antithetical to a goal outlined by Instagram’s founding CEO, Kevin Systrom, who said that any time spent on the app “should be positive and intentional.” At the time, Instagram was adding an alert that told you when you were out of new posts in the feed, which served as a gentle nudge that you might be able to close the app and move on to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="TGO7ts"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A behind-the-scenes shake-up in 2019 led to major changes in 2020&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rpq3tY"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg increasingly applied pressure on Instagram over the years to, in essence, play more like Facebook, despite an initial promise to leave the company alone, as detailed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21506016/instagram-10-year-anniversary-sarah-frier-interview"&gt;in Sarah Frier’s &lt;em&gt;No Filter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a chronicle of Instagram’s rise. The pressure culminated in Instagram’s co-founders walking out the door in late 2018, when they were replaced by Adam Mosseri, who previously ran Facebook’s News Feed. While the app mostly had a quiet 2019 on the surface — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523637/instagram-camera-redesign-create-mode-shopping-tags-facebook-f8-2019"&gt;tweaked the camera interface&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20956091/instagram-testing-hiding-likes-us-bullying-mosseri"&gt;hid like counts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20872711/instagram-weight-loss-cosmetic-procedures-restrictions-policy-wellness-influencer-marketing"&gt;restricted more&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18553821/instagram-anti-vax-vaccines-hashtag-blocking-misinformation-hoaxes"&gt;problematic content&lt;/a&gt; — behind the scenes, there was a significant shake-up of Instagram’s top leadership taking place, and more orders were starting to come down from Facebook proper, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/growing-pains-facebook-pushes-instagram-to-earn-its-keep?shared=c5d1ccaabc5ab55b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reported last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CztBE"&gt;That set the stage for this year, when those changes became visible to users. The home screen layout, which — aside from the addition of story bubbles at the top — had largely stayed unchanged since Instagram’s founding, has been shuffled around to make room for two new initiatives. The most notable of those, Reels, is a TikTok ripoff with no original ideas that’s purely meant to crush an innovative and competing product. The other addition, the Shop tab, presents an underwhelming array of product posts in a way that mixes the confusion of a Pinterest page with the blandness of Google Shopping ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDa6WB"&gt;None of this is to say Instagram has been “ruined” or even changed all that dramatically on the surface. The app has always been teeming with brands and influencers, Stories had ruthlessly sidelined Snapchat as the hot new app years ago, and Instagram’s aesthetic has long since gone from cultural phenomenon to ubiquitous cliche. It’s still fun to look through your friends’ photos, and the new features aren’t strictly bad — Reels offers creators another avenue to promote their work, and shopping is an obvious, if undercooked, addition to Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXfhyQ"&gt;The difference is that so many of Instagram’s prior changes felt like &lt;em&gt;Instagram&lt;/em&gt;. In 2020, the changes felt like new services shoehorned into Instagram so that the moment we got bored, we could find our next distraction without closing the app. If that feels familiar, maybe it’s because that’s what Facebook does, too. This year, Instagram didn’t just build more services — its service starting demanding more from you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Startup Astra reaches space for the first time — but barely misses orbit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q6zILd0lC-SJwh_86S1c1vNdYfs=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68522022/50725072431_027173020e_o.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astra’s 3.2 rocket launching from Alaska&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Astra / John Kraus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hv0rvc"&gt;Astra, a California-based startup aimed at launching small satellites, successfully launched its rocket to space for the first time yesterday from Alaska, but the vehicle barely missed reaching the right speed to achieve orbit. Still, the company says the test flight was a major success and is preparing to fly its next rocket, this time with a payload on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahmkyd"&gt;“This far exceeded our team’s expectations,” Chris Kemp, Astra’s CEO, said on a press call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rAdd8o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This far exceeded our team’s expectations.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ri9a6"&gt;Astra’s rocket, dubbed 3.2, took off from Alaska’s Pacific Spaceport Complex just before 4PM ET on Tuesday. The vehicle successfully climbed to space, performing all of its expected engine burns and separations. The rocket reached its target altitude of 390 kilometers, or about 242 miles, and a final speed of 7.2 kilometers per second, or more than 16,000 miles per hour. Unfortunately, that was just short of 7.68 kilometers per second, the speed the company needed to reach to make orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4q07Fp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A quick video recap of our 8.5-minute flight to space today! &lt;a href="https://t.co/gvElF4fbAZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gvElF4fbAZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Astra (@Astra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Astra/status/1338999451893915649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vVI2Rd"&gt;“We were just a few short seconds from putting the upper stage of the spacecraft in orbit,” Kemp says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Wh6z3"&gt;The company says it’s an easy fix for the next flight. Kemp blamed the problem on some residual liquid oxygen propellant leftover in the rocket’s tanks, which prevented the vehicle from getting where it needed to go. On the next flight, engineers simply need to adjust the ratio of the propellants in the tanks, Kemp said. “There are absolutely no design changes and no general hardware changes and no software changes,” Adam London, Astra’s co-founder, said during the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxDoCn"&gt;Kemp says that Astra has another rocket ready to go and a payload ready to fly on it. The company didn’t fly a payload on this flight, but the rocket did signal that it would have released a payload just fine if there had been one on the mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="56HMlB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A nice Christmas present for the whole team.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o1Kk6S"&gt;“This outcome surprised us and is certainly a nice Christmas present for the whole team,” Kemp said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bex7bO"&gt;This flight comes three months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/12/21433698/astra-rocket-launch-end-failure-orbit"&gt;Astra’s last launch attempt out of Alaska in September&lt;/a&gt;. During that flight, Astra’s Rocket 3.1, successfully took off, but the rocket started to drift and the vehicle’s engines shut down early. The rocket then fell back to Earth and exploded on impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jniSOi"&gt;Formed in 2016, Astra is one of many startups dedicated to launching small satellites into space. So far, just one other launch company, Rocket Lab, has been successful in the arena and has been launching small payloads into orbit since 2018. Astra has claimed that just one launch on its rocket will cost $2.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tt9mJq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zE7VuD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple AirPods Max review: luxurious sound for a luxury price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s over-ear headphones have tremendous build quality and sound, but there’s no denying they’re expensive&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1P4ReR"&gt;After a long lead-up of rumors, Apple managed to squeeze in the AirPods Max just under the wire as its last big hardware release of 2020. It wasn’t surprising to see the company launch its own over-ear, noise-canceling headphones after the meteoric rise and popularity of AirPods, which have come to define the category of true wireless earbuds; nobody really managed to crack it before Apple. The AirPods Max are entering a very different space, where many other companies have excellent options available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uH1aHX"&gt;There have been a lot of initial reactions to the AirPods Max, but the one that’s dominated them all is sticker shock: the $549 price is hundreds more than what established competitors like Bose and Sony are charging for their quite excellent noise-canceling headphones. And that’s the crux of the challenge Apple faces: unlike with AirPods, it’s late to this game, and there’s a lot to prove if consumers are going to be sold on spending so much more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uWfHLG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10230050"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1vL4m3"&gt;The price tag of the AirPods Max sits far above mainstream noise-canceling headphones, but there are many headphones that go for the same amount and beyond — wireless ones, too. I don’t think it makes sense to compare these against thousand-dollar (and wired) open-back headphones you’d plug into a DAC for listening sessions with a hi-fi music collection; fundamentally, these are Bluetooth headphones aimed at a large consumer audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r34qU7"&gt;Even so, Apple has tried to match that upper echelon of boutique headphones in terms of build quality and craftsmanship: the AirPods Max have a design heavy on aluminum, steel, and fabric that’s the polar opposite of something like Sony’s plastic-everywhere WH-1000XM4 headphones. There’s nothing &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; with plastic; those Sony cans have taken a beating in my bag and still work great. But everything about the AirPods Max exudes precision — even their unibody metal ear cups, bland as they might seem. (The widely ridiculed carrying “case” is antithetical to this whole notion, but I’ll get to that later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PwAWH5"&gt;This isn’t a review where I’m going to say that the AirPods Max are the best headphones for most people. They are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;. If all you want is a good, reliable set of noise-canceling headphones for commuting, travel, or working from home, save your money and stick with something like the Sony 1000XM4s, Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, or the Microsoft Surface Headphones 2, all of which cost at least $200 less. You’ll be well served by any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mWi6F_7pX1BvXr2Cs7-tQQUnOJs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173981/DSCF2705_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JWPBfk"&gt;That said, the AirPods Max &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; make sense for certain people who can immediately find a reason they’re “worth it.” The comfort and feel are top notch, they sound wonderful, the noise cancellation is up there with the very best, and they offer unique features like spatial audio that you really can’t get elsewhere. At least, not quite like this. So it’s worth breaking down some reasons why the AirPods Max could be worth buying if you’ve got the disposable cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WR83bg"&gt;Fit and finish top the list of pros. The AirPods Max have a stainless steel headband that’s wrapped in a soft polyurethane material. A knit mesh canopy does a good job of keeping the substantial weight of these headphones from putting irritating pressure on the top of your head. The rotating, pivoting aluminum ear cups are attached by telescoping steel stems that take some effort to extend but always stay in place at whatever length you leave them. (The headphones can’t fold up for more efficient storage, unfortunately.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ri-m_ZrRCZfn0dGhgLIZUzR-t9U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173665/DSCF2665.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s craftsmanship is on full display with the AirPods Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Silr6"&gt;The ear cushions are made from acoustic memory foam with a breathable mesh layer on top. Hopefully, that’ll make for less sweaty ears in warmer months. They attach magnetically, are easy to take off, and popping them back into place is immensely satisfying. The ear cushions are large and oval-shaped, so they won’t uncomfortably press against your ears like some circular ear pads can. Replacement sets (and other colors) are available for $69 a pair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kMyQZN"&gt;I’d recommend steering clear of the silver or other lighter colors; the white ear cushions on my review unit are already starting to look a bit dirty after just a few days of wearing them. Going for space gray or the blue color would be my recommendation. The trade-off of Apple’s high-style design is that these materials won’t stay pristine; the company &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208729"&gt;provides basic cleaning instructions&lt;/a&gt;, and the ear cushions are easy enough to pop off and wipe down, but I’m not sure what you’re supposed to do if, say, the headband fabric gets mucked up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HPKgoo8smrsie4vx_q7jiXawtV8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173682/DSCF2676.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cushions are super comfortable and should accommodate ears of any size.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s6qmek"&gt;Look around the AirPods Max and you’ll find just two buttons: there’s the Digital Crown — a much larger version than the dial on the Apple Watch — and a button that switches between noise canceling and transparency modes. I’ve really come to like the crown for controlling volume and playback; you don’t get the false inputs or missed swipes that can happen with touch gestures. It’s also easier to use with gloves in cold weather. You press it once to play / pause, twice to skip tracks, or three times to go back; holding it down will activate Siri. Sometimes my fingers will hit the steel stem when feeling for it since they’re close together, but that’s a minor gripe that muscle memory should overcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8liBs"&gt;You’ll notice I said nothing about a power button, and that’s because the AirPods Max lack one. They power on when placed on your head, and automatically pause music if removed (or if you lift one ear cup). Take them off fully, and they’ll go into a sleep mode when left on a table or around your neck for a few minutes. When slid into their case, the headphones enter a deeper ultra-low-power mode. I’ve left the AirPods Max out overnight several times without the case and they’ve barely lost any of their charge, so you don’t need to worry about battery drain. This design quirk has been deemed “very Apple” by some, but I wish they’d just stuck a power button somewhere for simplicity’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBpsVm"&gt;There are a lot of cutouts for microphones and sensors around the AirPods Max — there are nine microphones in all, with eight of them used for noise cancellation — and behind those ear cushions are powerful, custom-designed 40-millimeter drivers. Apple says the “dual-neodymium ring magnet motor” backing each driver is inspired by floor-standing speakers and is the reason you won’t hear any distortion even when the Max headphones are cranked to peak volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7YuNGcz8IBVQajdFqVk6GHwUE70=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173866/DSCF2681_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max feature 40mm drivers designed by Apple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hoZsPT"&gt;On that note, the second pro for the AirPods Max is sound quality. These headphones make for delightful listening. Apple has struck a great balance between the highs, mids, and lows, and there’s a broader soundstage with these than you’d get from the Sony or the Bose cans. The bass isn’t going to rattle your skull, but in my tests, I’ve consistently found there’s always enough to make songs shine as they’re supposed to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6gi0u"&gt;Apple uses “computational audio” with the H1 chips in each ear cup and the aforementioned mics to constantly measure what you’re hearing from the headphones, and it adjusts EQ to account for how the headphones fit your head and seal against your ears. The company says it aims for a faithful reproduction of your music, but don’t mistake these for flat or neutral studio headphones. If I had to pick two words to describe them, I’d say tight and refined. You get ample bass, and higher frequencies never sound harsh or fatiguing. Complex, multi-layered arrangements from Bon Iver or Phoebe Bridgers are immersive and uncluttered. Acoustic guitars come through with satisfying warmth and clarity. The low end is never muddy — regardless of genre — and the AirPods Max do a great job of showcasing every element of a well-produced track. With these headphones, you get the best of everything Apple has learned about audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6RLGDV"&gt;But a lot of people want to know whether the AirPods Max sound &lt;em&gt;so much better&lt;/em&gt; to justify their high price. And there’s no easy answer. If you’re nitpicky about audio quality, you’ll notice how great these sound. But the Sony 1000XM4s are popular for a reason, and one of them is booming bass, a criteria where they can still handily beat out the AirPods Max. Other noise-canceling headphones like the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless also give Apple a run for its money on sound quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="VMYlJT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10230439"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3qHDGB"&gt;When it comes to active noise cancellation, Apple is neck and neck with the very best. The AirPods Max do an equally good job as Sony and Bose at quieting the outside world. They might even be &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;, but it’s all very close. They aced my tests at the coffee shop, on the subway, and walking through Manhattan. When you do need to hear what’s happening, transparency mode sounds just as natural here — almost like you’re not wearing headphones at all — as with the AirPods Pro. Apple leads the pack on this feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vG6JDi"&gt;Another reason to consider the AirPods Max is spatial audio. Like the AirPods Pro, these can give you an immersive experience that mimics surround sound on an iPhone or iPad when you’re watching videos with supported apps like Apple TV Plus, Disney Plus, and HBO Max. (Audio from shows and movies with a 5.1 or 7.1 mix can be converted into spatial audio.) We’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18093348/dolby-dimension-headphone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Dolby&lt;/a&gt; and other companies pursue immersive surround sound headphones before, but Apple’s approach feels a bit more visceral and captivating and should only get better with time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUTgXf"&gt;Since iPhones and iPads have positional awareness from their built-in sensors, they can send that data to the headphones to keep the sound in front of you at all times; even if you turn your head side to side, the sound field stays planted wherever the device is. Spatial audio doesn’t quite stack up to an actual 7.1 Atmos system. How could it? But it’s a captivating experience that will come in handy once everyone starts traveling again. You’ll absolutely notice the downgrade if you switch back to regular stereo audio for a superhero flick. I really wish spatial audio worked with the Apple TV, so you could experience great sound in the living room — and from a big screen — even if you don’t have a soundbar or surround setup. This would also let you get absorbed in an action blockbuster with a partner sleeping beside you at night. But for now, the Apple TV can’t do spatial audio since it lacks the positional sensors in Apple’s mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOQQZE"&gt;The last big win for the AirPods Max is that they’re just… &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;. Like regular AirPods, they pair to your phone simply by holding the two close together. And with the latest iOS and macOS software updates, they can now automatically switch between an iPhone, iPad, and Mac depending on what device you’re using at that moment — without you having to do anything. If I’m paying $550 for headphones, I damn sure want that level of convenience. That said, the Sony, Bose, and many other headphones let you pair with two devices at the same time, so that might be enough flexibility for you, especially if not every device you use has an Apple logo on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZlwA5jb2W7XX8QvLNIoZ_s3hTXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173667/DSCF2672.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This AirPods Max “case” offers little in the way of everyday protection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CYVwwk"&gt;But now we come to the cons, and far and away the worst thing about the AirPods Max is their case. If you can call it that, which I consider generous. Look, putting aside all the memes about it looking like a handbag or bra, it’s a failure on every level at functionality, and I don’t know what Apple was thinking. It makes the AirPods Max easy to recognize at a distance — maybe that was the main goal — but in terms of doing &lt;strong&gt;case&lt;/strong&gt; things, it’s a joke that offers virtually no protection for your $550 headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtHwPE"&gt;I wouldn’t feel good about throwing this into a packed bag; the ear cups could get scratched since there are so many slits in the case, and something could poke through that exposed mesh canopy. The case also picks up dirt and smudges in no time. This is a bad enough misfire that it drags down the entire product. Everyone else gets this right, and it’s baffling that Apple could get it so wrong. I’d expect to see many third-party cases for the AirPods Max very soon, and I predict Apple will sell some of those directly — because this thing is just untenable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e-9dGrfhl27Chu-2MvPE2piYSpk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173805/DSCF2666_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max lack a 3.5mm jack and only have a Lightning port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q4OVWW"&gt;Another downside? No 3.5mm jack. The AirPods Max only have a Lightning connector, so if you want higher-quality wired audio or to plug them in on a plane, you’ve got to get a $35 cable. (No, putting an aux cord between two iPhone headphone dongles won’t work.) Ouch. I can live without the 3.5mm jack, but to not include the cable in the box? At this price?! Rude. Also, it’s worth mentioning that there’s no passive mode for the AirPods Max. When they’re out of juice, they stop working altogether — even if you’re wired. You can’t use the very good, clear-sounding voice mics on the headphones when plugged in, either. But the cable is good for eliminating all latency if you want to use the AirPods Max for recording or monitoring purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nBfHF"&gt;Battery life is rated at 20 hours with all the features like noise cancellation turned on, which is good and more than adequate for lengthy flights, but still 10 or so hours less than Sony’s total running time. On a drained battery, charging for five minutes will get you around 90 minutes of playing time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFKIvA"&gt;Now let me double back to just how much the AirPods Max weigh. The open mesh canopy does a good job of distributing their heft (even on my enormous head), and the ear cushions reduce any feeling of being weighed down. But at 385 grams, there’s no denying these are a good deal heavier than cans from Bose or Sony (254 grams). They’re not uncomfortable for me — even after a couple hours of nonstop listening — but I’m always very aware that they’re on. And it’s something to be mindful of if you’ve had any neck problems. These are definitely leisure headphones meant for the couch or sitting at your desk — and, eventually, they’ll be great travel headphones — but gym or running headphones they are not. The AirPods Max aren’t water resistant at all, but that’s true of most premium noise-canceling headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAkWfP"&gt;The last reason to hold off on the AirPods Max right now is what I consider unrealized potential. Most people are going to be streaming Apple Music or Spotify through these things. And that means (in the case of Apple Music) you’re limited to the same compressed 256kbps AAC files we’ve been listening to for years. Apple still doesn’t offer a lossless tier, and I have to ask, if not now, when? I can plug into my iPhone with the cable and get higher quality music from Amazon Music HD or Tidal than I can from Apple itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxgXqw"&gt;On the Android side, Sony’s headphones have LDAC, a wireless codec that can wirelessly stream music at near-CD quality. Apple is falling behind here, but there’s no indication that the company cares. You can make all the arguments you want about how it doesn’t matter or that people can’t hear any difference, but when we’re talking about $550 headphones — not to mention the powerful HomePod speaker — an option to enjoy higher-quality audio should at least be there. Apple moved to 256kbps AAC &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2007%2F05%2F30Apple-Launches-iTunes-Plus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22177494%2Fapple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;all the way back in 2007&lt;/a&gt; and we’ve been stuck there ever since. (“Mastered for iTunes” albums can offer improved dynamic range and subtle enhancements, but it’s no replacement for going lossless.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jg5OSk"&gt;Shipping estimates for the AirPods Max are already extending into March, but I hesitate to read too much into that. These headphones might end up a hit like the earbuds they share a name with, but they could also just coast by in the same vein as something like the HomePod, another Apple product that was priced higher than the competition when released (and hurt by it). If you’re the kind of person that knows you’ll love the AirPods Max, you shouldn’t hesitate to go for it. They sound killer for music and movies alike. And they &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like they should cost even more money. They’re about as luxurious as noise-canceling headphones get — but not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21409031/bang-olufsen-beoplay-h95-noise-canceling-headphones-announced"&gt;as expensive as they come&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="cv2URg"&gt;But there’s still no world where I recommend the AirPods Max to your average headphone shopper, especially when the AirPods Pro offer a lot of the same features for less. Many consumers will be perfectly happy sticking with the tried-and-true options from Sony, Bose, Microsoft, and elsewhere. At the very least, it’s probably worth waiting for Apple Music HD or spatial audio on the Apple TV or, for god’s sake, a better case.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2020 was the year of the Twitch streamer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fuDjeffS0ltx-dJvzsWi96Azrx0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68521738/acastro_201206_4327_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;We’re all now broadcasting from our bedrooms &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="oesI7Y"&gt;I’m calling it now: live-streaming won the pandemic. (Broadly speaking, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/billionaires-pandemic-1-trillion-wealth-gain/"&gt;so did billionaires&lt;/a&gt;.) At this point, the numbers are annihilating. In October, millions (including myself) spent 1.6 billion hours on Twitch, which represents a 99 percent jump in year-over-year growth, according to StreamElements and Arsenal.gg’s November report. And even that doesn’t account for just how many things were converted into streaming video — events, holidays, relationships, and more. In the early days of the pandemic, we tried to cram the offline world into the series of tubes we call online. Now, nine long months later, it’s hard for me to remember how novel Zoom socializing felt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AULNFU"&gt;I think about the many small adjustments we made to work and socialize a lot these days. Enough people cared about their video appearances that there were shortages of &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/11/ring-lights-for-all/617143/"&gt;ring lights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53506401"&gt;webcams&lt;/a&gt;; Zoom’s stock price even shot up. (It &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/09/zoom-and-other-stay-at-home-stocks-are-getting-crushed-on-the-positive-vaccine-news.html"&gt;dropped with news of a vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRIub5"&gt;Back in the beginning, when I was staring down the barrel of indefinite quarantine — as though through the wrong end of a telescope — I made a joke that was more of a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bijanstephen/status/1234266108309516288"&gt;confession about spending more time on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to take the whole thing more seriously, and staying inside felt like permission. “im going to start my twitch partner push while everyone is locked inside,” I wrote on March 1st, 2020. It was early enough into lockdown that the whole thing felt a little novel; things would eventually go back to normal, I surmised, and it seemed like the people around me in my city were committed to doing the right things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xThfl6"&gt;Eight months and more than a quarter of a million deaths in, that telescope has righted itself. It’s become clear that the federal government has deemed 2020’s chaos — widespread job losses and business closures, mass unemployment, unchecked viral spread — acceptable. I’ve been reporting on Twitch as a business and as a social space the entire time, and it occurs to me that while it’s felt a little useless talking to people about streaming, what I’ve noticed is that the work does seem to matter. I admire the streamers who have made it their whole business to bring people moments of joy, or at least a respite from how unrelentingly terrible this year has been. Streamers are important because they’re important to people, which feels obvious to write. But this crisis has underscored just how valuable those small, tenuous connections can be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okSttt"&gt;And it’s worked on me. These days I find myself tuning into West Coast streamers I like (or East Coasters who run late) just before bed, when I’m alone with my anxiety about the state of the world. I think there’s something noble in their broadcasts; I can’t imagine I’m the only one who needs to hear a soothing human voice sometimes, or one that’s only upset about the momentary ugliness of a fictional universe. As the writer Charlotte Shane eloquently put it in &lt;a href="https://www.bookforum.com/print/2704/notes-on-a-tiktok-quarantine-24264"&gt;a recent piece on TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, “But humor and distraction are my love language. I understand the necessity of comfort, but I don’t like being consoled, not by another human being discernibly laboring toward that end.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jT6pY"&gt;The virtual world is the actual one now, and it’s going to take a long while to tease out what that means. The thing I can’t stop thinking about is the lesson the Trump administration unintentionally provided: all we really have is each other. And it goes double in a socially distanced world, one where we can’t even hug our friends and family. So I watch streamers, some of whom are friends, and it’s almost like togetherness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQv6ma"&gt;In my own life, on the other hand, I’ve found that streaming regularly on Twitch has helped structure my weeks. A schedule provides a measure of accountability and some feeling of responsibility to a group of people with whom I enjoy spending time. It’s also helped me find a community of people I never would have met before, either online or off. And these, I think, are the small things that matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHGkvR"&gt;I’ve been thinking of 2020 as the year of the Twitch streamer for a while now. As the internet has become the main place people socialize over these last nine months, it feels like we’ve all become a little more like streamers — we present our whole selves online behind a webcam and a microphone, and we expect people to see us. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In 2020, the Trump administration declared war on dancing teens</title>

  &lt;p&gt;TikTok on the clock but the party don’t stop&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="l64zu1"&gt;On July 7th, Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, told Fox News &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21316062/tiktok-ban-app-mike-pompeo-government-china-bytedance-communist-party"&gt;he was considering a ban on TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, the Chinese-owned app best known for dancing teenagers, roller skating, and &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-10-02/nathan-apodaca-is-the-skateboarding-fleetwood-mac-loving-tiktok-star-that-2020-needs"&gt;Fleetwood Mac enthusiasts&lt;/a&gt;. You should only use TikTok “if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” Pompeo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjhKOO"&gt;All hell promptly broke loose. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320196/amazon-employees-tiktok-uninstall-email-trump-administration-pompeo-ban"&gt;Amazon banned and then unbanned&lt;/a&gt; TikTok from employees’ phones; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/11/21320935/wells-fargo-bans-tiktok-devices-amazon-pompeo"&gt;Wells Fargo asked employees to remove TikTok&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;their &lt;/em&gt;phones; and the &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/10/politics/dnc-warning-tiktok/"&gt;Democratic and Republican national committees found something to agree on&lt;/a&gt;: avoiding TikTok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ocqqQ1"&gt;On July 31st, President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/1/21350578/tiktok-ban-president-trump-comments-order"&gt;announced he’d ban the app&lt;/a&gt; from the US. Trump then issued an executive order &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358505/trump-tiktok-wechat-tencent-bytedance-china-ban-executive-order-legal-sanctions-rules"&gt;on August 6th&lt;/a&gt; banning “transactions” between people in the US and TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance. He also declared TikTok a “national emergency,” which is honestly the kind of publicity you can’t buy. A &lt;em&gt;national emergency! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5QZ55R"&gt;Understandably, TikTok’s CEO, Kevin Mayer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403698/tiktok-ceo-kevin-mayer-resigns-trump-administration-ban-microsoft-disney"&gt;quit on August 27th&lt;/a&gt;. He had joined the company in May, having left a lucrative post as Disney’s head of streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GyHxxb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;By December, the controversy had matured into a pile of lawsuits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WAuWCB"&gt;The administration’s fears aren’t really about the &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; of TikToks — though some of the content, such as Sarah Cooper’s Trump impression, or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ohheyjenna/status/1274558069876367361"&gt;the teens&lt;/a&gt; who are credited with organizing on TikTok to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/style/tiktok-trump-rally-tulsa.html"&gt;ruin one of his rallies&lt;/a&gt;, may have gotten under the president’s skin. Rather, the &lt;em&gt;stated&lt;/em&gt; concern was about how much data on US users the Chinese government should be allowed to gather. The privacy freak-out occurred shortly after the revelation that the app was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304228/tiktok-security-ios-clipboard-access-ios14-beta-feature"&gt;snooping on users’ clipboard data&lt;/a&gt;, a practice TikTok says it would stop. (For what it’s worth, LinkedIn and several other apps &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/tiktok-and-53-other-ios-apps-still-snoop-your-sensitive-clipboard-data/"&gt;were up to the exact same thing&lt;/a&gt;; while TikTok collects a lot of unnecessary data, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-says-it-sent-warning-about-tiktok-app-to-employees-by-mistake/"&gt;so does everyone else&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1E8dlT"&gt;By December, the controversy had matured into a pile of lawsuits — with judges ordering the TikTok ban should be entirely blocked. The entire farce seemed to demonstrate what the US in 2020 would be willing to do to competitive, non-US apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3t3Hw"&gt;It is trivially obvious that the debacle was less about TikTok and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322612/tiktok-security-china-bytedance-spying-app-privacy"&gt;more about anti-Chinese sentiment&lt;/a&gt;. Once upon a time, Americans might have pointed out that American companies running on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/6/3224100/steve-crocker-how-the-internet-was-created"&gt;commercial version of a military project&lt;/a&gt; were projecting American values: freedom of speech, including the freedom to dissent against one’s government. Of course, in 2013 Edward Snowden smashed that impression — the US was spying on &lt;em&gt;everyone,&lt;/em&gt; collecting bulk data from every US company in secret, with the help of American tech companies. The fear is that China &lt;em&gt;might be doing the exact same thing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lM24ZL"&gt;Any government collecting this kind of bulk data is a threat to freedom for all people, but that appears to be beside the point. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355465/tiktok-us-china-information-nationalism-online-propaganda"&gt;There is no moral reason&lt;/a&gt; to view China’s collection of bulk data as any different than American collection of bulk data, particularly after &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/12/trumps-farcical-inept-and-deadly-serious-coup-attempt/617309/"&gt;President Donald Trump attempted a coup to reject democratic election results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3UxeHR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Trump administration chose to try to strongarm TikTok into being sold to an American company&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LTLOyp"&gt;But let’s imagine an American government that is actually interested in its citizens’ privacy. One possible remedy for discovering that TikTok &lt;em&gt;and everyone else&lt;/em&gt; were collecting a scary amount of data is an internet privacy bill that treats every company the same, American or not. Legislation could also decree that companies dispose of the sensitive data they collect on their users after a certain period of time. And if the concerns are around state actors such as China or even the US collecting sensitive data through these companies, well, that seems like the kind of thing one sorts out at the United Nations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHma9z"&gt;The Trump administration, instead, chose to try to strongarm TikTok into being sold to an American company, highlighting the view that the problem was not that TikTok was collecting the data in the first place, but simply that it was collecting the data &lt;em&gt;for the wrong country&lt;/em&gt;. The August 6th executive order, which demanded that an American company purchase &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352878/trump-us-ban-tiktok-microsoft-acquisition-treasury-interview-deadline"&gt;TikTok’s US business&lt;/a&gt; within 45 days, was later extended to give &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21369753/bytedance-tiktok-trump-china-app-privacy-90-days"&gt;ByteDance 90 days&lt;/a&gt; instead, though — confusingly — the Department of Commerce was still operating with a 45-day deadline, on September 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nQWLL"&gt;Once TikTok was on the auction block, Walmart, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/8/21359720/bill-gates-microsoft-tik-tok-deal-comments-interview"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/8/21360259/twitter-and-tiktok-acquisition-trump-microsoft"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373225/oracle-tiktok-us-business-acquisition-ellison-trump"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; were reportedly among the interested parties. Except the Oracle / Walmart deal that emerged addressed &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of the purported security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="GdK4I5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The deal that emerged addressed &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of the purported security concerns&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h94Uhv"&gt;The deal — which has not yet closed — created a new company called TikTok Global. There is, however, some confusion about how that company is going to work. According to ByteDance, it will own 80 percent of the company and the Oracle / Walmart consortium will own 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irrq9x"&gt;Oracle, however, views this differently. “Upon creation of TikTok Global, Oracle/Walmart will make their investment and the TikTok Global shares will be distributed to their owners, Americans will be the majority and ByteDance will have no ownership in TikTok Global,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448983/tiktok-oracle-bytedance-chinese-ownership-global-trump-deal"&gt;Oracle said in a statement to reporters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cb9vsR"&gt;To add to the hilarity, the Oracle deal appears to be… for hosting on Oracle’s cloud servers, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436035/tiktok-oracle-deal-bytedance-president-trump-safety"&gt;accomplishes absolutely nothing&lt;/a&gt; in assuaging the security concerns that were the pretext for the deal’s existence in the first place. Oracle isn’t writing the code; even if they’re auditing it, it’s still possible for ByteDance to sneak stuff by. Oracle doesn’t get the algorithm &lt;em&gt;or &lt;/em&gt;moderation, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDXnSu"&gt;“A deal where Oracle takes over hosting without source code and significant operational changes would not address any of the legitimate concerns about TikTok,” former Facebook security chief Alex Stamos &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1305290677241085954"&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, “and the White House accepting such a deal would demonstrate that this exercise was pure grift.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YAn9yd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If TikTok is saved, you can thank me.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1isXom"&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/09/19/walmart-statement-about-potential-investment-in-and-commercial-agreements-with-tiktok-global#:~:text=TikTok%20Global%20will%20be%20an,five%20member%20Board%20of%20Directors.&amp;amp;text=TikTok%20Global%20will%20create%20more,dollars%20to%20the%20U.S.%20Treasury."&gt;Walmart has promised&lt;/a&gt; the new company, TikTok Global, will pay $5 billion &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; in taxes to the US. Bragging about new jobs and tax revenue isn’t necessarily unusual in the corporate world, but this time it feels weird — since Trump publicly said in August that the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/08/us/politics/trump-tiktok-deal-treasury.html"&gt;US Treasury ought to get a “very big proportion”&lt;/a&gt; of whatever price TikTok was sold at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JsLiC1"&gt;Incidentally, in October it came out that Oracle’s bombastic founder, Larry Ellison, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/17/21520356/oracle-tiktok-larry-ellison-lindsey-graham-super-pac-donation-jaime-harrison"&gt;donated a cool quarter-million&lt;/a&gt; to a super PAC that supported Lindsey Graham. In an August &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/08/qanon-is-batshit-crazy-lindsey-graham-talks-tiktok-online-conspiracies-and-why-hes-sticking-with-trump"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Graham said &lt;em&gt;he &lt;/em&gt;was the one who told Trump to find a US company to buy TikTok. “Let Microsoft or somebody buy it, put it in American hands and allow the platform to survive and thrive because so many people enjoy it,” Graham claims he told Trump. “If TikTok is saved, you can thank me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lwzepf"&gt;Twice now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160239/tiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department"&gt;judges have said&lt;/a&gt; the Trump administration can’t ban TikTok. But the wheels of justice turn slowly — and so TikTok has sustained plenty of damage while the courts have been catching up to the Trump administration’s pronouncements. In fact, there is another American business that benefits from this digital protectionism, besides Oracle and Walmart: Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfQ9vU"&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/asia/tik-tok-banned-india-china.html"&gt;India banned TikTok&lt;/a&gt; in June, a Facebook data scientist reported that use of Facebook products surged in response. “With TikTok gone, Instagram’s daily users increased 9 percent and were spending 19 percent more time within the app,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444203/facebook-leaked-audio-zuckerberg-trump-pandemic-blm"&gt;Casey Newton reported for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “With TikTok gone, they posted 5 million more stories and sent 214 million more messages on Instagram alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vItrPJ"&gt;So, what have we learned from this bizarre episode? The Trump administration has a shaky grasp on what’s legal; despite an order being potentially illegal, it can still do a great deal of damage before any judges catch up; Walmart apparently wants in on a social network; Graham is either the Trump tech whisperer or a shameless braggart; and no one in government really seems to give a shit about user privacy — from China or otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="474OsC"&gt;At least the teens kept dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook criticizes Apple’s iOS privacy changes with full-page newspaper ads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jZ8nzEUiHDRKZmMRbXSOmwDkXi8=/0x0:1980x1320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68521115/facebooknewspaperad.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s newspaper ad.&lt;/em&gt; | Dave Stangis (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/DaveStangis/status/1339183289349918721" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YtzT51"&gt;Facebook is publicly criticizing Apple’s upcoming iOS privacy changes in full-page newspaper ads today. “We’re standing up to Apple for small businesses everywhere,” reads the headline on an ad inside the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; today. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/facebook-attacks-apple-s-ios-changes-in-full-page-newspaper-ads"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the ads are related to Apple’s iOS 14 privacy changes that will make it more difficult for companies like Facebook to target users with ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FF9Wb"&gt;Developers will need to ask iOS 14 users for permission to gather data and track them across mobile apps and websites on an iPhone and iPad soon. Apple had planned to implement these changes with the initial iOS 14 release in September, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;delayed enforcing them until early next year&lt;/a&gt;. These changes will impact Facebook’s ad business, and in particular its ad network for developers and businesses, as end users are more likely to opt out of tracking prompts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDIFYM"&gt;Facebook claims Apple’s changes will be “devastating to small businesses” that rely on its ad network to generate sales. The newspaper ads direct small businesses to Facebook’s “&lt;a href="http://fb.com/speakupforsmall"&gt;speak up for small business&lt;/a&gt;” site, where a series of business owners speak out about Apple’s changes. “Small businesses deserve to be heard,” Facebook writes. “We hear your concerns, and we stand with you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5hXbSk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m pretty certain &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Facebook?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Facebook&lt;/a&gt; is fighting &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; to retain access to personal data. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PID?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PID&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/privacy?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#privacy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fullpagead?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#fullpagead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wsj?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#wsj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/029WwaGSs0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/029WwaGSs0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dave Stangis (@DaveStangis) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DaveStangis/status/1339183289349918721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdqX3z"&gt;While Apple hasn’t responded directly to today’s newspaper ads, the company did respond to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-19/apple-defends-decision-to-delay-privacy-feature-slams-facebook"&gt;similar Facebook claims&lt;/a&gt; last month. The iPhone maker accused Facebook of a “disregard for user privacy.” Apple is adamant that its iOS 14 privacy policies will be enforced in early 2021, and has &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=hx9s63c5&amp;amp;1599152522"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; it’s “committed to ensuring users can choose whether or not they allow an app to track them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ud375"&gt;Apple launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;new App Store Privacy labels&lt;/a&gt; this week, shining a light on how iOS apps use your data. Notably, the privacy label on Facebook’s iOS app expands across several pages, listing all the data that can be used to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YkmB4S"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple exposing all the ways Facebook tracks you with it iOS app is really quite something &lt;a href="https://t.co/hDhB85qk1L"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hDhB85qk1L&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1339174301564604418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dyHAKR"&gt;These full-page newspaper ads are the latest in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising"&gt;public spat between Facebook and Apple&lt;/a&gt; over privacy, policies, and more. Facebook slammed Apple’s App Store policies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358355/facebook-apple-app-store-policies-comments-facebook-gaming-ios"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, after it had to remove a mini games feature to pass Apple’s strict App Store approval process. Facebook also welcomed the EU’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA) this week. Both acts introduce new rules for digital platform holders, and aim to force companies to rapidly remove illegal content from the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKEjNj"&gt;“We hope the DMA will also set boundaries for Apple,” said a Facebook spokesperson in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/facebook-criticizes-apple-as-it-welcomes-europes-new-tech-rules.html"&gt;statement to &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Apple controls an entire ecosystem from device to app store and apps, and uses this power to harm developers and consumers, as well as large platforms like Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new password manager works across Edge, Chrome, and mobile devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AV9P_raGFSQNwxGrQ1pnb4-n0eQ=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68520716/microsoftauthenticator.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3NPvR3"&gt;Microsoft is building a new password manager that syncs credentials across its Edge browser, Google Chrome, and mobile iOS or Android devices. A preview version of the password manager is now built into Microsoft Authenticator, a free mobile app that’s used for multi-factor authentication. Like many other password managers, it can &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/securely-manage-and-autofill-passwords-across-all-your-mobile/ba-p/1751710"&gt;autofill passwords&lt;/a&gt; in apps or websites on iOS or Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgv9rP"&gt;Passwords are synced from the Microsoft Edge browser, and can be shared across multiple devices using a Microsoft Account. You can also sync these passwords to Google Chrome, using a &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/microsoft-autofill/fiedbfgcleddlbcmgdigjgdfcggjcion"&gt;new Microsoft Autofill extension&lt;/a&gt;. This will sync any passwords stored on your Microsoft Account.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yLhxxthXJ8AaB-rPnxn5sV7my3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22174351/T5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new autofill feature in Microsoft Authenticator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qj2H7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997034/microsoft-365-life-consumer-subscription-features-release-date-rumors"&gt;Rumors had suggested&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft would create a full password manager for its Microsoft 365 consumer service, but this appears to be the next best thing. The autofill feature will be useful for Microsoft Account users working across multiple devices, but a full password manager like 1Password or LastPass &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/24/15921282/best-password-manager-1password-lastpass-dashlane-how-to"&gt;is still a good option&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56V0Dd"&gt;This new autofill feature is available as a preview in Microsoft Authenticator today, and you’ll need to enable it as the default autofill provider in the iOS or Android settings of your device. Autofill only works with consumer Microsoft Accounts and is disabled for enterprise users who are using the app for phone sign in or multi-factor authentication. Businesses need to &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/user-help/user-help-auth-app-faq#autofill-for-it-admins"&gt;join an allow list&lt;/a&gt; to enable this for enterprise Microsoft Authenticator users.&lt;/p&gt;
