    <title>Biden calls for new funding to fight semiconductor shortage in budget request</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r85ZTR"&gt;In its first budget proposal to Congress on Friday, the White House called for new funding to fight the ongoing semiconductor shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSZgtK"&gt;Among other measures, the White House’s budget request includes $150 million to fund two new manufacturing programs, including one targeting domestic semiconductor manufacturing. It’s the latest effort from the White House to address the ongoing semiconductor shortage, which has stalled supply for consumer items like the PlayStation 5 and &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ford-semiconductor-gm-toyota-microprocessor-chip-shortage/"&gt;halted production at Ford assembly lines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOmbGb"&gt;The “American Jobs Plan,” the sweeping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359496/biden-american-jobs-package-broadband-semiconductors-electric-vehicles"&gt;$2 trillion infrastructure package&lt;/a&gt; unveiled in March, also included new funding to build domestic chip manufacturing capacity, allocating over $50 billion for investment in the sector. In February, President Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298376/biden-sign-semiconductor-shortage-executive-order-apple-amd-playstation"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; calling for government reviews into the semiconductor supply chain. These reviews were set to end in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SggiU"&gt;The global semiconductor shortage is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order"&gt;the result of a number of factors&lt;/a&gt; spurred on by the coronavirus pandemic. As more Americans began to work and learn online, the demand for products like laptops and other consumer electronics rose dramatically. The production of chips also slowed down largely due to former President Trump’s trade war with China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EELZ2b"&gt;On Monday, White House and cabinet officials are set to host a virtual CEO summit on semiconductor supply chain resilience. The conversation will focus on Biden’s jobs plan and ways to strengthen the semiconductor supply chain. Companies like Alphabet, AT&amp;amp;T, Ford, General Motors, Intel, and Samsung are expected to be in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google announces Pixel 5A 5G by denying rumors it’s canceled</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JWXFGGjH4XNIMpW3v5TvkISQS1Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69102351/akrales_201013_4137_0300.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zsVfLf"&gt;Google has officially announced a new Pixel phone, the Pixel 5A 5G. It’s done so in the same way it has announced a lot of recent Pixel phones: by reacting to a rumor. This time is a little less fun than usual, though, because the rumor in question is that the phone had been canceled entirely. In response, a Google spokesperson sent along the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ldx0Xl"&gt;Pixel 5a 5G is not cancelled. It will be available later this year in the U.S. and Japan and announced in line with when last year’s a-series phone was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5R83xJ"&gt;Earlier today, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-5a-reportedly-canceled"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;cited two independent sources claiming the Pixel 5A had been canceled, following a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jon_prosser/status/1380536151996559362"&gt;tweet from Jon Prosser&lt;/a&gt; claiming it was due to chip shortages. It does appear that the chip shortages are real, however, as Google is only planning to release the Pixel 5A 5G in the US and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyzxf6"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@onleaks/exclusive-first-look-at-the-google-pixel-5a-1614036211-183558310"&gt;rumors about the Pixel 5A 5G&lt;/a&gt; point to it being somewhat similar to the Pixel 4A 5G — another lower-end phone designed to broaden Google’s market reach by keeping the cost down. Code pointing to the existence of the Pixel 5A has &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/07/31/google-pixel-5a-makes-first-appearance-in-aosp-days-before-pixel-4a-launch/"&gt;been seen in the Android Open Source Project as early as July 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The Pixel 5A 5G is &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@onleaks/exclusive-first-look-at-the-google-pixel-5a-1614036211-183558310"&gt;expected to be similar&lt;/a&gt; (but not identical) in size to the Pixel 4A 5G, with a 6.2-inch FHD+ display, dual read cameras, and a headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKgOEo"&gt;Google’s statement says that it will be announced “in line with when last year’s a-series phone was introduced,” which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352032/google-pixel-5-4a-5g-price-release-date-specs"&gt;in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/07/google-i-o-2021-has-been-announced-and-its-the-first-free-i-o-in-memory/"&gt;many have speculated&lt;/a&gt; that it would be announced at this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371782/google-io-2021-date-announcement-virtual-online-event-date-android"&gt;year’s online-only Google IO developer’s conference&lt;/a&gt; alongside a lower-cost version of the Pixel Buds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iiz21T"&gt;Google is also rumored to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364543/google-pixel-6-custom-in-house-processor-gs101-whitechapel-arm-report"&gt;creating a higher-end flagship Pixel phone later this year&lt;/a&gt;. Assumed to be the Pixel 6, the big deal with that rumored phone is that it will begin to use more Google-designed chips, including the so-called “Whitechapel” system on a chip.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYQHR8"&gt;Google has a history of just admitting it has phones to announce in response to rumors. Back in 2019, it famously just tweeted out an image of the Pixel 4 after it started to leak in earnest. It was an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18662941/google-pixel-4-leak-editorial-premium-high-end-phone"&gt;innovative way to take control of the usual phone rumor hype cycle&lt;/a&gt; at the time. This time, Google’s response is a little less cheeky. Having to straight up deny cancellation rumors feels a lot less like hype and a lot more like damage control. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Phoebe Waller-Bridge will co-star with Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="77th Annual Golden Globe Awards - Arrivals" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZfQvebwz2BKdqNzejH9KSI8j0yM=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69102339/1197737728.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Steve Granitz/WireImage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wxYNUl"&gt;Phoebe Waller-Bridge is joining the as-yet-untitled fifth &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones &lt;/em&gt;film, co-starring as an as-yet-announced character opposite Harrison Ford (who’ll be returning as the titular adventurer, of course). Also set to return is John Williams, who has scored the previous four films and whose “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgncJgSbbck"&gt;Raiders March&lt;/a&gt;” theme is indelibly associated with the character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyIHHN"&gt;Disney hasn’t announced details on who Waller-Bridge (best known for her award-winning series &lt;em&gt;Fleabag&lt;/em&gt;, along with appearances in &lt;em&gt;Solo&lt;/em&gt; and the upcoming &lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt;) will be playing, although in a 2019 interview with &lt;em&gt;The Sun, &lt;/em&gt;franchise creator Steven Spielberg did acknowledge that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/5/17203922/steven-spielberg-indiana-jones-female-lady-heroine-woman"&gt;might be time for a female iteration of the character&lt;/a&gt;. Using the fifth film to pass the torch from the 78-year-old Ford to Waller-Bridge could be a good way to help rejuvenate the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7sKe4l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Indiana Joan Jones is the female lady heroine that women need","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/5/17203922/steven-spielberg-indiana-jones-female-lady-heroine-woman"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="qCnYA8"&gt;That said, the last time the &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt; franchise tried to hand things off to a younger actor — Shia LaBeouf, who played Jones’ song in the widely panned &lt;em&gt;Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&lt;/em&gt; in 2008 — things didn’t quite pan out. (It’s no surprise that Ford, not LaBeouf, is heading the upcoming film.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQ4WHo"&gt;Further complicating that theory is the fact that Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/indiana-jones-5-will-be-the-last-in-the-franchise/"&gt;previously confirmed&lt;/a&gt; at Disney’s investor event last December that the fifth &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt; film would be the final movie in the series. But presumably, in today’s world of reboots, sequels, and Disney Plus spinoffs, there’s plenty of room for Disney to continue the franchise if it chooses to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrG6tx"&gt;Unlike the first four films in the series, which were directed by Steven Spielberg, James Mangold will direct &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones 5&lt;/em&gt; (although Spielberg is still on board as an active producer of the film). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRw4ty"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones 5&lt;/em&gt; is set to hit theaters on July 29th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google updates YouTube ad targeting terms to remove hate speech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qB9Un6kPoAhiCH1f6exVnFZymcY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69102249/acastro_180806_1777_youtube_cancel_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fipdk5"&gt;Google says it has blocked several terms associated with hate speech from being used as ad keywords on YouTube videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxd96b"&gt;The move follows a &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2021/04/09/google-blocks-advertisers-from-targeting-black-lives-matter-youtube-videos"&gt;report by &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which found that advertisers could search for terms like “white lives matter” and “white power” when deciding where to place ads on YouTube: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6y5Psj"&gt;Google offered advertisers hundreds of millions of choices for YouTube videos and channels related to White supremacist and other hate terms when we began our investigation, including “all lives matter”—a phrase frequently used as a dismissive rejoinder to Black Lives Matter—and “White lives matter”—which the Southern Poverty Law Center &lt;a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/white-lives-matter"&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; as both a neo-Nazi group and “a racist response to the civil rights movement Black Lives Matter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Hl5ici"&gt;At the same time, &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; found, Google was blocking advertisers from using terms such as “Black Lives Matter” to find videos and channels to run ads against. After &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; reached out to YouTube parent company Google for comment, it says the company actually &lt;a href="https://github.com/the-markup/investigation-youtube-ad-placements"&gt;blocked more racial and social justice terms&lt;/a&gt;, including “Black excellence” and “civil rights.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6S0Nw0"&gt;“We take the issue of hate and harassment very seriously and condemn it in the strongest terms possible,” a Google spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Though no ads ever ran against this content on YouTube, because our multi-layered enforcement strategy worked during this investigation, we fully acknowledge that the terms identified are offensive and harmful and should not have been searchable. Our teams have addressed the issue and blocked terms that violate our enforcement policies. We will continue to be vigilant in this regard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HFEFOQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We fully acknowledge that the terms identified are offensive and harmful and should not have been searchable”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rNAm0T"&gt;YouTube says it has several layers of protection in place to prevent offensive or harmful ads from running on its platform, and that it regularly removes videos containing hate speech. Last year, the company says it blocked or removed more than 867 million ads for trying to evade its detection systems and more than 3 billion bad ads in total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2Zp4h"&gt;Google says it does not publicly disclose how it develops its enforcement tools, so that so-called bad actors can’t circumvent its rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnONCO"&gt;YouTube has battled hate speech on its platform for several years, with mixed results. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18652576/youtube-supremacist-content-ban-borderline-extremist-terms-of-service"&gt;2019, it banned white supremacist content&lt;/a&gt;, and the company said it would restrict channels from monetizing videos that “repeatedly brush up against our hate speech policies,” preventing them from running ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwVWJ2"&gt;In a blog post last June, &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/susan-wojcicki-my-mid-year-update-youtube-community"&gt;YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said&lt;/a&gt; the company’s hate speech policy “specifically bans videos alleging that a group is superior based on qualities like race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some Pixel 5 users can’t stream Netflix in HD because of a DRM issue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Pixel 5 (top) and the Pixel 4A 5G (bottom)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8-yq88lH2Qwde1dLphBc_pGpceo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69102063/akrales_201012_4137_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VAzoNH"&gt;Some Pixel 5 owners are &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/ml5l9w/widevine_changed_to_l3_after_april_updatepixel_4a/"&gt;apparently experiencing a bug&lt;/a&gt; with Google’s Widevine DRM platform that’s causing their phones to only play back Netflix videos in standard definition, instead of the usual HD and HDR10 quality that they should be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99e0Q1"&gt;Google is aware of the issue and is working on a firmware fix, but it still has to test and verify it so it’s not clear when it will be released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5if2hY"&gt;The issue, while not widespread, appears to be causing afflicted Pixel 5 devices to be downgraded to Widevine’s L3 status, instead of the usual Widevine L1 (which is what authenticates to allow for HD and HDR playback for Netflix, among other things). &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/06/pixel-widevine-l3/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; speculates&lt;/a&gt; that the issue appears to have been exacerbated by the recent April security update for the phone, although its not clear if the two are actually linked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOdrlT"&gt;Widevine is Google’s DRM service, which is used by a variety of premium streaming companies, including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney Plus, and Google Play Movies. Content is secured using a three-level system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mstutl"&gt;L1 is the most secure and ensures that all content processing and cryptography is handled within a trusted execution environment on the device’s processor. L2 devices only execute cryptography operations within that secure environment, while L3 devices don’t do any content processing or cryptography operations in a secure area of the chipset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZrn2O"&gt;Generally, in order to ensure that streamed content doesn’t get stolen, companies mandate that higher-quality HD, HDR, and 4K versions of movies and shows be limited to the more secure L1 devices. Google’s Pixel phones &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be L1-rated devices, but the aforementioned issue seems to be causing them to register as L3 hardware instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFJUNl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hans Zimmer’s ringtone for the Oppo Find X3 Pro is fit for a Hollywood score</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/THmENA15zQgYr6Suy6yWuuqijtk=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69101935/Hans_Zimmer_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Oppo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2JrrWE"&gt;Hans Zimmer, the legendary composer of &lt;em&gt;The Lion King&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt;, and other iconic soundtracks, has brought his epic compositions to a new audio medium: phone sounds. Yes, Hans Zimmer created a ringtone and other phone sounds for Oppo’s newest flagship, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22324860/oppo-find-x3-pro-flagship-announced-10-bit-microlens-specs"&gt;the Find X3 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGZoV7"&gt;The fact that Zimmer made these ringtones isn’t news. Oppo made a big deal about his involvement in March, posting a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaQEEHooI64"&gt;video interview with him&lt;/a&gt; and an entire song &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK2oi-JWoss"&gt;he composed just for Oppo&lt;/a&gt; (called “Colourful Future,” if you were wondering) on its YouTube channel. But these videos didn’t have what I wanted to hear: the actual Zimmer-composed sounds by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTXRKX"&gt;So I asked an Oppo PR rep if they could send the tones my way, and they did. Now, I can’t stop listening to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaK2xZ"&gt;I’ve embedded them in this post so you can hear them, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NySR4b"&gt;Ringtone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbvxaP"&gt;Here is the Zimmer-made ringtone — it’s beautiful. As my colleague Ian Carlos Campbell said, “Does he want me to cry every time the phone rings?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="EvAw0p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QK5iYy"&gt;“I want the ringtone to open a door that says there is the possibility to feel something,” Zimmer said about the ringtone in Oppo’s video interview. It worked, Hans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rOzB5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W9WW9Q"&gt;Alarm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5mC3nL"&gt;Here’s the Zimmer-composed alarm tone. It sounds like waking up to a beach sunrise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uzb85b"&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="265" src="https://clyp.it/4nsekecn/widget?token=c6dd755e66f4a5ba87ceec23f0a6eb46" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WqkLMo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="860BgG"&gt;Text tone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="khPUjq"&gt;Here’s the charming text tone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TEDSqK"&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="265" src="https://clyp.it/cpabpgwb/widget?token=8ff9f9d6894606db344b26a33b53ac72" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OCC8Mf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JfOsLu"&gt;Notification sound&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="z1JG7s"&gt;And here’s a generic notification sound, which I’d like all of my apps to use from now on, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0KMtwh"&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="265" src="https://clyp.it/21mar2a2/widget?token=c5f77c980e5ec3336b9e21e57abf1391" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HQ3LZw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bfe0Gb"&gt;These are so good that now I’m hoping Google or Apple will work with Zimmer to refresh their phone sounds next. (Just imagine Zimmer’s take on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTcXZqIZxbA"&gt;iPhone’s classic Marimba ringtone&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phTDXT"&gt;I also recommend you watch Zimmer’s full interview &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaQEEHooI64"&gt;on Oppo’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, where he describes how he hears colors. Honestly, I believe it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP’s Chromebook x360 14c is getting 11th Gen Intel processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HP Chromebook x360 14c in tablet mode on a black background. The screen displays sand dunes from above." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bFpZ_xlMBREZMNOU6czIUBR3BZs=/0x152:1650x1252/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69101864/HP_Chromebook_x360_14c_Tablet.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7Hsyge"&gt;HP has announced an update to its Chromebook x360 14c, its premium convertible Chromebook aimed at students and remote workers: the laptop now includes Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors. Configurations start at $649.99 and will be available for purchase &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?prodsku=6458047&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-14-2-in-1-touchscreen-chromebook-intel-core-i3-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-mineral-silver%2F6458047.p%3Floc%3DHP_6458047_PR%26ref%3D186%26skuId%3D6458047&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMuPUa"&gt;You can configure the 14c with up to a Core i5, as well as 256GB of PCIe SSD storage. It also comes with a 1920 x 1080 touch display, a 720p HD camera with a privacy switch, a backlit keyboard, and a fingerprint reader. HP hasn’t yet provided prices for the higher-spec models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Chromebook x360 14c seen from the back, angled to the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/03yOJ9ZRwODcdTzWtaJEV8K5H7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22432308/HP_Chromebook_x360_14c_RearLeft.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oGK0Ke"&gt;While $649.99 is a low price as laptops go, the Chromebook x360 14c will sit toward the premium end of the Chromebook market — it features some of the more powerful processors, nicer displays, and better port selections that you can find in a Chromebook. In fact, the device is one of our top picks for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; you can buy. &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/hp-chromebook-x360-14c"&gt;Reviewers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/hp-chromebook-x360-14c-review"&gt;praised&lt;/a&gt; the laptop for its high-quality design, excellent keyboard, and solid audio. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hitman’s best feature, the Elusive Target, has arrived in Hitman 3</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dbtFlJJV9o4eh16VpRXZAkTIc0c=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69101773/ET_BBLOG.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: IO Interactive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RmFCyG"&gt;Fans of &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt;’s excellent Elusive Target missions will be happy to hear that the first of these made for a &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt; level &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hitman/status/1380520882150416384"&gt;is now live&lt;/a&gt;. The mission tasks you with hunting down “The Collector,” aka Kody Haynes, in the game’s Dartmoor map. The mission is live for 10 days starting today. It’s not the first Elusive Target to have released since &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt; came out (there was a legacy mission set in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hitman/status/1365345892283293699"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hitman 1&lt;/em&gt;’s Sapienza map&lt;/a&gt;, for instance), but it’s the first available for one of the third game’s new levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SC65a"&gt;For those who might be unaware of &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt;’s Elusive Targets, they’re some of the funnest missions the game has to offer. Ever since the 2016 &lt;em&gt;Hitman &lt;/em&gt;reboot, developer IO Interactive has regularly added new missions as time-limited events to its games. You get a certain number of days to complete the mission, and once it’s gone, it’s gone. You also only get one shot — so players (read: me) can’t rely on their usual trial-and-error tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="d4SUj9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;HITMAN 3's first Elusive Target arrives TODAY! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take on the ultimate Hitman challenge and take down this unique, time-limited target in Dartmoor. Make your shots count, there are no second chances. The Collector will be available in HITMAN 3 for 10 days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck! &lt;a href="https://t.co/uSsqdNeH7a"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uSsqdNeH7a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— HITMAN 3 (@Hitman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hitman/status/1380520882150416384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HcP8BX"&gt;This time around, IO Interactive deserves kudos for coming up with a truly bizarre character for you to assassinate. Yes, he’s an art collector, but he’s also an art collector who went into hiding after embezzling money from his wife’s family’s fast-food empire (?) and insists on murdering any and all previous owners of the artwork he collects (?!). If ever a fictional character deserved to die, it’s definitely this bozo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNw2pE"&gt;The Collector joins a host of colorful Elusive Targets that IO has politely requested that its players murder. Perhaps most notably, &lt;em&gt;Hitman 2&lt;/em&gt;’s first such target was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/26/18026612/hitman-2-sean-bean-elusive-target-interview"&gt;played by none other than Sean Bean&lt;/a&gt;. “The player can kill me any way they want,” the famously death-prone actor told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview, “I don’t know what to say about that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFHBkt"&gt;After The Collector, &lt;em&gt;Hitman’s &lt;/em&gt;next Elusive Target will be The Politician, which will be available in &lt;em&gt;Hitman 2&lt;/em&gt;’s Hawke’s Bay level starting on April 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s ad delivery system still has gender bias, new study finds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tLONocKBDXQmb-TvwmitFLGPIaI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69101533/mdoying_180118_2249_facebook_0445stills_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vxiynI"&gt;An audit by researchers at the University of Southern California &lt;a href="https://ant.isi.edu/datasets/addelivery/"&gt;found that Facebook’s ad delivery system&lt;/a&gt; discriminates against women, showing them different ads than it shows to men and excluding women from seeing some ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmT5H2"&gt;“Facebook’s ad delivery can result in skew of job ad delivery by gender beyond what can be legally justified by possible differences in qualifications,” the researchers wrote in their report, “thus strengthening the previously raised arguments that Facebook’s ad delivery algorithms may be in violation of anti-discrimination laws.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cnkcm"&gt;The team of researchers bought ads on Facebook for delivery driver job listings that had similar qualification requirements but for different companies. The ads did not specify a specific demographic. One was an ad for Domino’s pizza delivery drivers, the other for Instacart drivers. According to the researchers, Instacart has more female drivers but Domino’s has more male drivers. Sure enough, the study found that Facebook targeted the Instacart delivery job to more women and the Domino’s delivery job to more men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0kdkT"&gt;The researchers conducted a similar experiment on LinkedIn, where they found the platform’s algorithm showed the Domino’s listing to as many women as it showed the Instacart ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PqEqoF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This isn’t the first time research has found Facebook’s ad targeting system to be discriminating against some users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kxcZxz"&gt;Two other pairs of similar job listings the researchers tested on Facebook revealed similar findings: a listing for a software engineer at Nvidia and a job for a car salesperson were shown to more men, and a Netflix software engineer job and jewelry sales associate listing were shown to more women. Whether that means the algorithm had figured out each job’s current demographic when it targeted the ads is not clear since Facebook is tight-lipped about how its ad delivery works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vrc8g"&gt;“Our system takes into account many signals to try and serve people ads they will be most interested in, but we understand the concerns raised in the report,” Facebook spokesperson Tom Channick said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We’ve taken meaningful steps to address issues of discrimination in ads and have teams working on ads fairness today. We’re continuing to work closely with the civil rights community, regulators, and academics on these important matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDHDct"&gt;This isn’t the first time research has found Facebook’s ad targeting system to be discriminating against some users, however. A &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race"&gt;2016 investigation by &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that Facebook’s “ethnic affinities” tool could be used to exclude Black or Hispanic users from seeing specific ads. If such ads were for housing or job opportunities, the targeting could have been considered in violation of federal law. Facebook said in response it would bolster its anti-discrimination efforts, but &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-advertising-discrimination-housing-race-sex-national-origin"&gt;a second &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 found the same problems existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSlM0r"&gt;And in 2019, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development &lt;a href="https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/Main/documents/HUD_v_Facebook.pdf"&gt;filed charges&lt;/a&gt; against Facebook for housing discrimination, after finding there was reasonable cause to believe Facebook had served ads in violation of the Fair Housing Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLln3v"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/Main/documents/HUD_v_Facebook.pdf"&gt;HUD said in a complaint&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook’s targeting tools were reminiscent of redlining practices, as it allowed ads to exclude men or women from seeing particular ads, as well as a map tool “to exclude people who live in a specified area from seeing an ad by drawing a red line around that area,” according to the complaint. Facebook settled the lawsuit and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18273018/facebook-housing-ads-jobs-discrimination-settlement"&gt;said in 2019 it had dropped&lt;/a&gt; ad targeting options for housing and job ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnylCV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated April 9th 11:53AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from Facebook spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airlines ground some 737 Max airplanes after Boeing discovers new problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-AVIATION-BOEING" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mSKtUshgJOCvsTkZBDvOzZVI8BI=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69101513/1229675092.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d9cZqR"&gt;Boeing has &lt;a href="https://boeing.mediaroom.com/news-releases-statements?item=130847"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; that airlines temporarily take the 737 Max out of service because of an issue with the plane’s electrical systems. It’s the latest in a now very long line of problems that have cropped up with this particular plane since two of them crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. But it’s the first to ground the plane since the Federal Aviation Administration approved its return and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165956/boeing-737-max-flight-brazil-gol-airlines"&gt;it went back into service late last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFon1x"&gt;The new problem has to do with whether there is “a sufficient ground path” for a particular component of the plane’s electrical power system, according to Boeing. Southwest Airlines, which is the most dependent in the US on the 737 Max, has already grounded 30 of the planes, while American Airlines has pulled 17 and United Airlines has pulled 16, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-boeing-737max-electrical-problem-idUSKBN2BW1EE?taid=607041c87cca5200012b62c6&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This all comes as air travel is rebounding in a big way in the US, thanks to a dramatic increase in vaccinations against the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7h6EWZ"&gt;That’s a different issue from the one that led to the two fatal crashes, which involved Boeing installing a piece of safety software &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18518176/boeing-737-max-crash-problems-human-error-mcas-faa"&gt;that it didn’t tell pilots or the government about&lt;/a&gt; as part of a rush to bring the plane to market. But it’s not the only one to come to light since those crashes. Boeing previously found &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/84be1490f98bbefca9e8efa7b05ccff2"&gt;debris in the fuel tanks of 737 Max aircraft&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hyDI0"&gt;The FAA — which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189609/faa-boeing-737-max-senate-report-coverup-tests-whistleblowers"&gt;accused in December by a Senate investigation&lt;/a&gt; of working with Boeing to manipulate tests during the recertification process of the 737 Max — said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FAANews/status/1380511841860866048"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that it “will ensure the issue is addressed.”&lt;/p&gt;
