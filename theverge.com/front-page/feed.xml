    <title>Microsoft’s own Windows 11 livestream runs into technical difficulties</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PoEjAU"&gt;Anyone trying to watch Microsoft’s Windows 11 reveal over on its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fevent" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt; may have noticed the stream ran into a number of technical issues, including buffering and dropouts. It got so bad that the technical adviser to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was forced to respond, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/matvelloso/status/1408080919894716416"&gt;tweeting a link&lt;/a&gt; for viewers to watch the livestream &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlNFEz72HCI"&gt;on YouTube instead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y20aLS"&gt;Only the YouTube livestream wasn’t actually an official Microsoft stream at all and was technically a repost from the retailer Newegg. It just goes to show that live video is pretty damn hard, even if you’re a massive &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-22/microsoft-rallies-to-join-apple-in-exclusive-2-trillion-club"&gt;$2 trillion juggernaut&lt;/a&gt; like Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CgLTgZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If your video stream is failing, watch from here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Y6b9tMzhIo"&gt;https://t.co/Y6b9tMzhIo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mat Velloso (@matvelloso) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/matvelloso/status/1408080919894716416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EAdcNE"&gt;For our part, we’ve found that the event’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1407353538875850752"&gt;Twitter livestream&lt;/a&gt; has been pretty reliable. If you want to get your Windows 11 info from an official Microsoft source, it might be the best way to go.

    <title>Microsoft is bringing Android apps to Windows 11 with Amazon’s app store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IH2xWGd6rXPSsCbw61QfwEoxhmc=/114x0:1323x806/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69499019/7JTO7hJ.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tv626q"&gt;Microsoft is bringing Android apps to Windows 11. The software giant revealed its surprise Windows 11 addition during its special Windows event today. Android apps will run natively on Windows 11 and will be downloadable from the new Windows store that’s included in the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcNU0y"&gt;Microsoft says it’s using Amazon’s app store to bring Android apps to Windows 11. Apps will be available directly from the new Windows store, and powered by Intel Bridge technology. Android apps on Windows 11 can be pinned to the taskbar, or snapped alongside traditional Windows apps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rk7oStmbADhhHxPeYC3oMd4ag3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679105/lcimg_9abbdc71_7b16_4ba0_b22a_2e6b359bcd82.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android apps in the Windows store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jlHuVw"&gt;Android apps on Windows 11 are an obvious answer to Apple’s progress with its M1 chips and running iOS apps on macOS. While there are many web equivalents to mobile apps, they’re often lackluster and certain apps like Snapchat, Ring, Venmo, Roomba, and the majority of home automation apps aren’t available on the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukmP1d"&gt;Microsoft demonstrated apps like TikTok running on Windows 11 today, but it’s not clear how many existing devices will support Android apps with Windows 11 and this partnership with Intel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aob5A"&gt;This surprise announcement follows Microsoft’s original plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/29/8511439/microsoft-windows-10-android-ios-apps-bridges"&gt;let Windows developers rework their existing Android apps&lt;/a&gt; for Windows in 2015. Project Astoria, as Microsoft labeled it, was a method to try to convince developers to port apps and make it easier to do so. The plan eventually fell apart less than a year later, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/25/11117430/microsoft-android-apps-windows-10-port-dead"&gt;Microsoft admitting&lt;/a&gt; that having “two bridge technologies to bring code from mobile operating systems to Windows was unnecessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJNOET"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22310870"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft reveals the new Microsoft Store for Windows 11, and it has Android apps too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/93ezC6rY6WG2z_xtdcwEvCGPbdc=/0x0:2448x1632/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498999/microsoft_store_windows_11_luca.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="atClc3"&gt;Windows 11 is real, and Microsoft has just revealed the brand-new app store that will go along with it — which could be a big deal, seeing how previous versions of the idea never really caught on. It will be called the Microsoft Store, not the Windows Store, just like it has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/22/16348986/microsoft-store-windows-10-app-store"&gt;since a rebranding in 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVFJXR"&gt;Here are some of the very first images of the new Store, and we’re adding more screenshots and details to this post right now. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"&gt;While Windows 11 was thoroughly leaked in mid-June&lt;/a&gt;, that leak notably did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; include any glimpse of an updated app store, so I figure you’re eager to see how it might look!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7FddY8i4L1pEkgPP0pmMQ5yyQKw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679069/1059_2021_06_24_1059_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RjFyoRbo0cm6TsFt2MmkSn8IqLM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679068/1058_2021_06_24_1058_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GreMDk"&gt;In a major move, Microsoft’s Panos Panay says developers will now be able to keep 100 percent of their revenue “if they bring their own commerce engine” — unlike app stores from Apple and Google that generally take 30 percent of developer revenue and insist on their own in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7AZvJW"&gt;Another huge surprise: the new Microsoft Store will also include Android apps that can natively run on your Windows 11 PC, thanks to a partnership with Amazon. The Amazon Appstore will live inside the Microsoft Store, and you’ll be able to drag and pin them side by side traditional Windows apps on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BBEZvIt4DBG4QaIZEPVUYCbN4ko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679116/1067_2021_06_24_1067_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/51JPQC5WJG9GBCknq6lmlQj0bsA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679118/1066_2021_06_24_1066_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qqy8Dd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393655/microsoft-windows-app-store-overhaul-apps-games-rumor"&gt;We’ve known since April&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft might have been planning to overhaul its Windows app store this year, and as usual, the devil’s in the details: will it actually be open to all apps and give developers what they want and need? The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645609/microsofts-universal-windows-app-dead-microsoft-store-windows-store"&gt;been haunted by its original vision of a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) ever since Windows 8&lt;/a&gt;, when it architected the store explicitly to house that new breed of cross-platform app instead of the legacy Win32 programs that developers and many users tended to prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OSPcNh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It also tried renaming the Windows Store to the Microsoft Store, which wasn’t at all confusing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a0tw4e"&gt;The company finally buried the UWP dream in 2019 with the news that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645250/microsoft-xbox-game-studios-publishing-valve-steam-32-bit-windows"&gt;it would accept native Win32 games in its store&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s tried many other tactics to attract developers over the years — including revised policies that allow app developers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17330600/microsoft-windows-store-apps-revenue-cut-build-2018"&gt;keep 95 percent of app revenue&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;88 percent of revenue from their games&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also tried to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21258697/microsoft-windows-project-reunion-win32-uwp-apps-apis-build"&gt;decouple APIs&lt;/a&gt; so Win32 apps can take advantage of modern Windows features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrCSUC"&gt;But at the end of the day, Microsoft’s app store has never made a truly convincing case for itself, to the point that the simple package manager Microsoft introduced last May &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21264739/microsoft-windows-package-manager-preview-download"&gt;felt like a breath of fresh air&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps Windows 11’s store will, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRdpdx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22310870"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap inks deal with Universal Music Group to bring major artists to the platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/riLsPTDc5GhtaESENwH7EA9N0rw=/0x0:2859x1906/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498949/snapchatsounds.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snapchat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UCzlSU"&gt;Snap wants people to discover and make content with music on Snapchat, and today, it secured a major deal to help it achieve that goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpsS52"&gt;The company has signed a multiyear partnership with Universal Music Group, the world’s largest record label group, to bring its artists’ tracks to the platform. This means Snapchatters can search for music from various artists like Justin Bieber, The Bee Gees, Katy Perry, and others, and include them in their content, whether that be a snap they send a friend or something they submit to Spotlight — Snapchat’s TikTok rival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oBHF9"&gt;Deals like this, and specifically with UMG, are critical for Snap’s future success as people discover music online and create viral content around it more frequently. TikTok, in particular, has been credited with the revival of certain songs, like &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/11/922554253/tiktok-sensation-meet-the-idaho-potato-worker-who-sent-fleetwood-mac-sales-soari"&gt;Fleetwood Mac’s “Dreams,”&lt;/a&gt; as well as the popularity of newer tracks like &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/tiktok-megan-thee-stallion-year-end-2020-1104458/"&gt;Megan Thee Stallion’s “Savage”&lt;/a&gt; after it became associated with a dance challenge. Snapchat needs to have as many tracks as possible on its platform to draw people to it. Then, it has to hope people will actually make viral videos. Snap says so far, 521 million videos have been created and viewed 31 billion times since the launch of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21516348/snapchat-snap-sounds-music-ios-update"&gt;Sounds feature&lt;/a&gt;, or music catalog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3bDsI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams will be directly integrated as part of Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bur3wkVILfSQa4PatR7HiRjoGwE=/161x0:1901x1160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498939/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_11.20.34_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k7xp1n"&gt;Microsoft Teams will be deeply woven into the upcoming Windows 11 update. During its preview of the new version of Windows, Microsoft’s Panos Panay detailed how it’ll be easier and quicker to create and join Teams meetings. The app will get prominent placement on the Windows 11 Start menu, and it’ll also be integrated throughout the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mw6nUh"&gt;Teams reached &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406472/microsoft-teams-145-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;145 million daily active&lt;/a&gt; users back in April. The service has had occasional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405300/microsoft-teams-down-outage-worldwide-issues"&gt;stumbles and outages&lt;/a&gt;, thanks in part to that massive growth. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439924/microsoft-teams-personal-version-launch-available-download"&gt;launched the free consumer version&lt;/a&gt; of Teams in May. Earlier this month, the company previewed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538166/microsoft-teams-front-row-video-layout-features"&gt;new “front row” layout&lt;/a&gt; that will come to the app later this year. It’s designed to help improve hybrid work situations where some people are at the office and others are joining meetings remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVKewk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22310870"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Windows 11 live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft announces Windows 11, with a new design, Start menu, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-b4_gXOfRNtcG6UutMPHDqdWeHg=/112x0:1317x803/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498859/jyOmrCq.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="foYGcV"&gt;Microsoft is officially confirming the name for the next release of Windows today: Windows 11. After months of teases, hints of the number 11, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"&gt;giant Windows 11 leak&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s new operating system is official. The big focus for Windows 11 is a simplification of the Windows user interface, a new Windows store, and improvements to performance and multitasking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQxdXz"&gt;Windows 11 includes a new Start menu and updated Start button that are both centered on the taskbar. This UI is very similar to what we first saw in Windows 10X, a project originally planned for dual-screen devices that Microsoft eventually canceled. A lot of the UI work that went into Windows 10X is appearing in Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sM0HLv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10622219"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4EXqY3"&gt;The new Start menu drops the Live Tiles that were originally introduced with Windows 8 and opts for more of the typical launcher you’d find in Chrome OS or Android. There are apps, recent documents, and a separate search interface. Much of the centered appearance is clearly influenced by macOS and Chrome OS, and Windows 11 also includes the rounded corners we’ve seen in both Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJqiVI"&gt;Windows chief Panos Panay says “the team has obsessed over every detail.” Windows 11 will also include updated dark and light modes, that look a lot better than what we’ve seen in Windows today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SLiAEeue9WyWXzgzDSn3lxsPTns=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679016/lcimg_00e7c70f_af00_4756_97d7_7b7dd6726cf8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 Snap layouts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i90Za9"&gt;There’s also something Microsoft is calling snap layouts, which allow you to quickly snap apps into the various modes that Windows 11 supports. This new version of Windows 11 will also remember where your apps are stored, thanks to something called Snap Group layouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EpVdg"&gt;It looks like a useful way to support multiple monitors, and ensure that apps always open on the correct screen. That’s particularly helpful if you’re using a laptop hooked up to a monitor, or a traditional desktop machine with multiple displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70MXex"&gt;Performance is also a big focus for Windows 11. Windows updates are 40 percent smaller, and more efficient as they now happen in the background. Hopefully that will mean that Windows 11 doesn’t disturb you in the middle of work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/azO6LihkmSoBIPe7EHfK6PxaZtk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679020/DrZo86L.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MkZNNW"&gt;Microsoft is also integrating Microsoft Teams directly into Windows 11, for both consumers and commercial users. Teams is integrated directly into the taskbar, allowing Windows 11 users to call friends, family, or coworkers. It’s clear that this is a big shift away from Skype, which was bundled as part of Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OA54Dw"&gt;Windows Widgets and touch gestures are also a big part of Windows 11. Widgets is a personalized feed, powered by AI, and builds on the widgets we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397237/microsoft-windows-10-taskbar-weather-news-widget-feature-available-now"&gt;Microsoft introduce in Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;. It slides in from the left-hand side of Windows 11 and you can also make it fullscreen. Built-in widgets include a news feed, weather, and maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="txWUIN"&gt;Interestingly, these widgets also include one that lets you tip local creators directly from within Windows 11. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ruHt3KvlrQU6z-wTAT89k6Vk_YQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679047/lcimg_b57980d8_1322_495d_9f39_6b649ad6330c.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Widgets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hDP0iB"&gt;Microsoft is also improving the gestures you can use on tablets, and the touch targets. Instead of flipping into a tablet mode, Windows 11 simply adapts to allow you to touch the OS easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BilMnE"&gt;Coupled with this are improvements to inking and voice typing. With certain pens, Windows 11 will also support haptic feedback here. That could mean we’ll see a lot of new hardware that will support these stylus changes in Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0eXiF"&gt;Xbox is a big part of Microsoft, and we also got to hear from Xbox executive Sarah Bond about PC gaming with Windows 11. Auto HDR, a feature in Xbox Series X / S, will be part of Windows 11. Enabling Auto HDR will add high dynamic range (HDR) to a large number of DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 games, as long as you have a compatible HDR monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lOhLziyz1c4FstYV8x9pPJDGwBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679063/lcimg_bdfcdd14_0740_4bfb_8e42_882b1c76f79c.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Xbox app in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ql9yvq"&gt;Microsoft is also promising speed and performance improvements for Windows 11. DirectStorage will be part of Windows 11, a big new feature from Xbox Series X / S. DirectStorage will require the latest NVMe drives to speed up game load times on Windows 11, and game developers will need to enable this technology to boost load times further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8N56ZW"&gt;Xbox Game Pass is also being integrated into Windows 11, thanks to a new Xbox app that the company has been testing for months. This also includes xCloud integrated into this Xbox app, so you can stream games from Microsoft’s cloud, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBfotu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22310870"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK carrier EE introduces EU roaming charges following Brexit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="EE logo is seen at one of their stores on Oxford Street in..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v5DKy0Xx0tmUb4Q_KcKgy39DZOo=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498687/1233588230.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Belinda Jiao/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4h0YM0"&gt;UK carrier EE is introducing roaming charges for customers traveling to almost all EU countries from January next year, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57595913"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The change applies to any customers who sign up or upgrade their plans after July 7th. From next year, these customers will be charged a flat fee of £2 (around $2.78) a day while in 47 “European destinations,” to get access to their plan’s existing data, minutes, and text allowances. The BT-owned carrier is also selling a 30-day Roam Abroad Pass, which is included with certain plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aJvPy"&gt;Roaming charges for UK customers visiting mainland Europe used to be commonplace until the European Union &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15418776/eu-mobile-roaming-charges-date-june-15"&gt;outlawed the practice in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. However, following the UK’s departure from the EU, which involved a transition period that ended on December 31st 2020, UK carriers no longer have to abide by these rules. The UK’s trade deal with the EU encourages them to have “transparent and reasonable rates” for roaming, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45064268"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the charges aren’t specifically prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wp67b3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The fees cover 47 European destinations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="16oFbv"&gt;The 47 European destinations include EU member states, plus other locations like the Canary Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, and Vatican City. Customers will not be charged an extra fee to use their phones in the Republic of Ireland, EE says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3h00Zj"&gt;EE’s decision makes it the first UK carrier to introduce roaming charges post-Brexit. It’s a marked shift from what it told &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45064268"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt; in January&lt;/a&gt;, when it said that its customers “enjoy inclusive roaming in Europe and beyond” and that it didn’t “have any plans to change this based on the Brexit outcome.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Eqfl0"&gt;Competitors Three and O2 have also made changes to how much data their customers can use while in Europe, but have stopped short of introducing blanket charges for all usage. &lt;a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2021/06/clarifying-o2-uks-tougher-excess-data-charges-for-eu-roaming.html"&gt;O2 is adding a fair use cap&lt;/a&gt; of 25GB a month for users in the EU, while Three is reducing its existing cap from 20GB to 12GB, &lt;em&gt;BBC News &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5t4lQ"&gt;In a statement, an EE spokesperson said the charges “will support investment into our UK based customer service and leading UK network.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Live blog: Microsoft’s Windows 11 event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xt8ztG-s9zhEbYlxgCMpiOQutPI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498586/VRG_ILLO_4030_Windows_10_Guide_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It’s time for a new Windows&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="U4FVM7"&gt;Microsoft is ready to usher in a new version of Windows, and it looks like 11 will be the magical number. After months of teasers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"&gt;Windows 11 leaked last week&lt;/a&gt; and provided us an early look at what Microsoft should announce today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wF18h"&gt;Microsoft responded to the leaks, hinting “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Windows/status/1404873374954758148"&gt;this is just the Start&lt;/a&gt;,” so we’re likely to see a lot more than what the early leaked build revealed. We’re expecting to hear more about Microsoft’s big plans for the Windows store, including a way to open it up to more apps and rival payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3ffT83"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What to expect from Microsoft’s Windows 11 event","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543253/microsoft-windows-11-event-date-time-what-to-expect-rumors"},{"title":"Windows 11 leak reveals new UI, Start menu, and more ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"},{"title":"Microsoft needs to show Windows 11 is more than just Windows 10.5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548367/microsoft-windows-11-more-than-windows-10-editorial"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RQ2Nkb"&gt;Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s CEO, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453222/microsoft-windows-next-generation-announcement-sun-valley-build-2021-keynote"&gt;has teased&lt;/a&gt; this next version of Windows as “one of the most significant updates to Windows of the past decade.” So it sounds like today’s announcements are going to be significant for Windows users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ol68Qf"&gt;We’re here to live blog all the announcements and what are likely to be some surprises along the way. Tune in to watch along with us!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK court rules Deliveroo couriers aren’t employees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Daily Life In Wales During The Coronavirus Pandemic" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lJ5l5jOo8vMzNKEJkVUQX58sqnA=/0x114:5940x4074/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498578/1323883651.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Huw Fairclough/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2M9qNQ"&gt;After several rounds in court, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deliveroo-ipo-amazon-com/amazons-deliveroo-stake-to-drop-to-11-5-after-london-ipo-idUSKBN2BF19O"&gt;Amazon-backed&lt;/a&gt; food delivery service Deliveroo has won the right to continue classifying its couriers as self-employed, CNBC &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/24/deliveroo-stock-surges-after-court-rules-riders-are-self-employed.html"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6G8pK"&gt;The case concerned the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain’s attempt to unionize a portion of the service’s delivery riders operating around Camden. While law obviously differs between the US and UK, a similar throughline in these types of cases is proving (or disproving) the amount of direct control the platforms have over their contractors — the more meddling into how, where, and when generally translates to a stronger case that these workers are, in fact, misclassified employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rU9iW0"&gt;The UK Court of Appeals, however, was convinced that a newer version of the Supplier’s Agreement, which Deliveroo pushed out to couriers a few weeks before the initial case hearing in 2017, allowed enough latitude that workers could still be considered self-employed. Even still, “it is reasonable to infer that Deliveroo’s reason for making the change was to strengthen its position in the context of IWGB’s claim for recognition,” the court wrote in its opinion, since the earlier Supplier’s Agreement “involved much more control and direction by Deliveroo –strict uniform requirements, a different attitude to substitutes and in other significant respects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FI54QE"&gt;Eleventh hour terms of service changes in the face of a legal challenge are par for the course with many gig economy companies, as Uber’s own &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/01/06/ubers-secret-project-bolster-its-case-against-ab-californias-gig-worker-law/"&gt;“project Luigi”&lt;/a&gt; rather infamously demonstrated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6mXxA"&gt;What cinched the win for Deliveroo, in this case, was it’s hands-off approach to riders subcontracting the deliveries they accepted. Even this, though, comes with a litany of caveats, as the court enumerated, including: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="q6syKI"&gt;Notifying the company if your subcontractor is using a different vehicle than you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="12T73H"&gt;Being responsible for your subcontractor completing training through Deliveroo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mcv6sF"&gt;Being unable to subcontract someone who [emphasis ours] “previously had their Supplier Agreement terminated by Deliveroo for a serious or material breach of contract or who (while acting as a substitute, whether for you or a third party) &lt;strong&gt;has engaged in conduct which would have provided grounds for termination&lt;/strong&gt; had they been a direct party to a Supplier Agreement”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="xisNuJ"&gt;A lower court also previously found that “in practice substitution is rare as there is no need for a Rider to engage a substitute.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kfYUXG"&gt;Nevertheless, Deliveroo had its day in court and has seemingly come out the victor, in spite of similar upsets in the UK with regard to Uber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnVjeO"&gt;After a protracted court battle, Uber drivers were ruled to be eligible for minimum wage, holiday time, and other benefits &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334771/uber-uk-drivers-workers-benefits-employees-decision"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;; two months later, those same drivers were able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455533/uber-union-uk-gmb-eats-labor"&gt;obtain collective bargaining rights&lt;/a&gt; and join a union — although in both cases, these wins were not extended to couriers with Uber’s Eats program. Strangely, that ruling did not seem to have any bearing on the plight of Deliveroo’s riders. The judges in the Deliveroo appeal even went so far as to say they were unaware of any “cases where persons who were not in an employment relationship had been found to fall within the scope of the trade union freedom right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fg8CCP"&gt;As with many gig economy jobs, Deliveroo has been criticized for an opaque system of payments, which led many riders to earn &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/25/some-uk-deliveroo-riders-earning-just-2-an-hour-survey-finds"&gt;well below minimum wage&lt;/a&gt; in the UK. As &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/08/deliveroo-losses-flotation-covid-ipo-london-stock-exchange"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, documents related to Deliveroo’s initial public offering revealed the company had set approximately $150 million aside as a war chest to continue fighting for non-employee status for its couriers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL’s wearable display glasses will go on sale in July starting in Australia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q3b46YwLlJplTwcmzi0FDXB8izM=/0x364:2456x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498420/Product_with_Model_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL’s wearable display plugs directly into your phone or laptop.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ucvKEu"&gt;TCL says its wearable display will go on sale in July starting in Australia for $899 AUD (about $680 US), with more markets to follow. The company has been teasing the concept for a couple of years now and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22221389/tcl-wearable-display-glasses-moveaudio-s600-pet-tracker-ces"&gt;showed it off earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; at virtual CES. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7SGtt"&gt;TCL calls it NxtWear G and emphasizes that it’s not a VR or AR device in its current configuration. Instead, it acts as an external display for your mobile device or laptop, with two 1080p Micro OLED panels that give the effect of looking at a 140-inch screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sTusS"&gt;The wearable display works with phones, tablets, and laptops that offer USB-C DisplayPort functionality, including recent MacBooks, iPad Pros, and Samsung S21 series phones. The glasses plug directly into your device, displaying content on a 16:9 screen in front of your eyes. The whole thing, cable included, weighs 130g (4.6oz), and stereo speakers are built into the frames, though TCL recommends using wireless earbuds or a headset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b2OGnU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10619182"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zXcHwq"&gt;Among other global announcements timed for Mobile World Congress, TCL is announcing a new screen-sharing function for its smartphones called Multi-Screen Collaboration. At launch, it will work only with the TCL 20 Pro 5G and will allow owners of the phone to wirelessly share files, photos, clipboard content, and messages with a compatible Windows 10 laptop or PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbHahI"&gt;Photos and videos can also be shared from the phone to a TCL TV. In this mode, the phone acts as a trackpad so you can move a cursor around the TV screen to select images or clips to play. TCL says the feature will come to the 20 Pro 5G via a software update in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Movetime Family Watch 2 is designed for school-aged kids who aren’t quite ready for a smartphone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z8sFnG"&gt;TCL is also previewing another new wearable — one for the kids. Movetime Family Watch 2 is a kid-oriented version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21419659/tcl-10-tab-max-mid-move-audio-s200-family-watch-announced"&gt;4G-enabled smartwatch designed for seniors&lt;/a&gt;. It features a 1.54-inch screen along with voice and video calling. There’s real-time location tracking and a geofencing feature, an IP65 rated housing, and up to seven days of standby time on its battery. It will be sold in Europe starting mid-August for €149.&lt;/p&gt;
