    <title>Doctors are testing a prescription video game for COVID-19 ‘brain fog’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m71F2M"&gt;A research team is testing a prescription video game to see if it can help people who have lingering memory and attention problems after recovering from COVID-19. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/health/covid-survivors.html"&gt;Many people&lt;/a&gt; who survived the disease say that they’re often confused and have difficulty focusing, and research studies show that the symptoms can stick around for months after they recover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXfVRb"&gt;Faith Gunning, a neuropsychologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, thinks the &lt;a href="https://www.endeavorrx.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;EndeavorRX&lt;/em&gt; video game&lt;/a&gt; might be able to treat some of those symptoms. The game, made by Akili Interactive, made history last summer when it became the first video game to get the Food and Drug Administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21292267/fda-adhd-video-game-prescription-endeavor-rx-akl-t01-project-evo"&gt;sign-off&lt;/a&gt; to be prescribed as a medical treatment. It’s cleared as a treatment for kids between the ages of eight and 12 with ADHD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZdaXf"&gt;But Gunning thinks it could help other groups of people. “I was already interested in the game,” she says. Then, she started to see the signs that people who had COVID-19 might be struggling with some of the same symptoms the game can target. She’s &lt;a href="https://jcto.weill.cornell.edu/open_clinical_trials/improving-cognitive-health-in-covid-19-survivors-through-digital-therapeutics"&gt;launching a study&lt;/a&gt; to test if it can help those patients. One group of people who had COVID-19 and have cognitive problems will play the game, and the study will check if their symptoms improve more than a group of COVID-19 survivors with similar symptoms who don’t play the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fItUxj"&gt;“We need more interventions in general, in cognitive and mental health, that we can get out into the community,” Gunning says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rl2WOE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke to Gunning about why the game, if it proves to be effective, could be one good strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjoEAL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMI1uI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What sorts of cognitive issues are you seeing in people who have had COVID-19? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dPWikI"&gt;We did a study on patients following an infection with COVID-19. I’m going to give the caveat that these are individuals who required hospitalization and had rehab before they were discharged home. So these were individuals who had moderate to severe COVID-19 — so it’s not representative of the general population. What we found is that a very high percentage of individuals had disturbances that ranged from mild to severe in their cognitive function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEzpM4"&gt;We found a pattern that included things like disruption in attention and in the ability to do more than one thing at once. We found a high percentage had difficulty with working memory, which is the ability to hold information in your head while doing something else. All of these are skills that are important for everything we do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WEwFt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why were you interested in the Akili Interactive video game? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NguLgn"&gt;The game has always intrigued me. I’d already been working with the video game for a few years. It really does target an important function: the ability to do more than one thing at a time. It improves it, and we’ve seen the game improve it in people with ADHD, in older adults, and there’s some indication it helps in people with multiple sclerosis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sz2CLY"&gt;It targets these really important cognitive skills, and it’s really engaging. One of the issues that you often find with cognitive interventions is that, frankly, they’re boring. So people won’t do them. And if people won’t do them, they’re not going to work.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bspQe4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has your non-COVID-19 research on this video game found? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCfN49"&gt;We’re using it in older adults who have some cognitive issues and middle-aged and older adults who have depression and some other cognitive issues. And what we’ve found is that those people do show changes in their brains. We showed that there’s improvement in connectivity within brain networks that support attention and executive skills, and we have some preliminary data showing improvement in mood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8hUKB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you think this could help COVID-19 survivors? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpAHig"&gt;We don’t think everybody who’s recovering from COVID-19 needs cognitive intervention. But there is enough data that suggests that a significant number of people who have suffered from COVID-19 will have some cognitive issues. These disturbances aren’t just specific to people recovering from COVID-19; we see them across a lot of conditions that impact the brain. I think if we can improve those functions, regardless of what’s causing them, we can improve their daily lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKIBnR"&gt;We’re looking for two main outcomes: cognitive skills and daily functioning. Because really, that’s the goal. We’re talking about COVID-19 disrupting people’s ability to function in their everyday lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9r0yE"&gt;A video game is also scalable. It’s something that can be given to lots of people. We need things we can get out into the community. Even if it’s a small subset of people who had COVID-19, the sheer number of people who had COVID-19 means we need interventions that are effective and can be disseminated widely. We’re not going to have the workforce to have one-on-one cognitive intervention for all the people who were sick. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volvo will provide cars for Didi’s autonomous vehicle division</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M-NZhHEq4bZoXy6Rfk3VFbGKEcY=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69148794/Volvo_XC90_DiDi_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DbDuUc"&gt;Volvo will provide vehicles for Didi Chuxing’s self-driving taxi fleet, according to a new deal between the two companies. The Swedish automaker, which is owned by China’s largest private automaker Geely, will supply XC90 SUVs to Didi Autonomous Driving, the self-driving technology division of China’s vehicle-for-hire company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qtEo0a"&gt;Didi said it would use Volvo’s SUVs when it eventually launches a commercial robotaxi operation at a later date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/30/20840954/china-didi-chuxing-self-driving-car-robot-taxi-launch-experiment-shanghai"&gt;The company has been testing its autonomous technology in Shanghai since 2019&lt;/a&gt; as part of a pilot approved by the Chinese government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrRX9P"&gt;It’s an interesting twist, considering Volvo used to be a partner in another global ride-hailing firm’s autonomous ambitions. Volvo had an agreement with Uber to deploy a fleet of self-driving taxis by 2019, but that plan was scrapped after an Uber test vehicle (an XC90 SUV) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17174636/uber-self-driving-crash-fatal-arizona-update"&gt;struck and killed a pedestrian&lt;/a&gt; in Tempe, Arizona, in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RqOiCb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s an interesting twist&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jXzDlA"&gt;Still, the Swedish automaker maintained its partnership with Uber’s autonomous division, announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18662626/uber-volvo-self-driving-car-safety-autonomous-factory-level"&gt;a jointly developed self-driving version of the Volvo XC90 SUV&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. Last year, under pressure from investors, Uber sold its autonomous division to self-driving startup Aurora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lu6DLp"&gt;Notably, Volvo says the vehicles it will be supplying to Didi will be “equipped with necessary backup systems for functions such as steering and braking.” Those functions, such as automatic emergency braking, were disabled by Uber in the self-driving SUV that killed the pedestrian in Arizona in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrZhZX"&gt;Didi isn’t the only company to use Volvo’s Swedish engineered vehicles as part of a robotaxi fleet. Waymo, the self-driving division of Alphabet, announced last year that it would be the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303324/volvo-waymo-l4-deal-electric-self-driving-robot-taxi"&gt;“exclusive global L4 partner”&lt;/a&gt; for Volvo and its sub-brands Polestar and Lynk &amp;amp; Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUWRdE"&gt;Volvo also has plans to sell customers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248415/volvo-luminar-lidar-self-driving-highway-pilot-spa2"&gt;partially automated vehicles equipped with LIDAR sensors made by US startup Luminar&lt;/a&gt;. The automaker said its vehicles will be able to drive themselves on highways hands-free, with no human intervention, and will start rolling off the production line in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYg13v"&gt;Didi started its ride-hailing business in China in 2012. It nabbed $1 billion from &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/12/11669178/apple-invests-1-billion-in-chinese-transportation-service-didi-chuxing"&gt;Apple in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, the same time it was locked in an intense competition with Uber for China’s rapidly growing ride-hail market and had started poaching engineers from Silicon Valley to come work for its nascent self-driving program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74lcXr"&gt;Eventually, the battle grew too costly for Uber, which was reportedly burning through $1 billion a year to compete with the Chinese firm. In August 2016, then-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said he would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/1/12339950/uber-didi-chuxing-china-merge"&gt;sell Uber’s Chinese business to Didi&lt;/a&gt; for a 17.7 percent stake in Didi and a seat on the company’s board. In exchange, Didi invested $1 billion in Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlHSdt"&gt;Didi has also invested in many of Uber’s rivals, including Lyft, India’s Ola, Singapore-headquartered Grab, Estonia’s Taxify, Careem in the Middle East (which was later acquired by Uber), and Brazil’s 99. Didi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/7/16748178/didi-chuxing-mexico-expand-ride-hail-uber"&gt;expanded into Mexico&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, intensifying its global rivalry with Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Qv1Mn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is making it easier to export text posts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMN9DlW580ilPCiEPYhQ6dVQIe8=/0x50:1200x850/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69148632/DataPortabilityGIF.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KbAIdj"&gt;Facebook is rolling out a new feature today, allowing users across the globe to have the option to archive their posts and notes created on the social media site and transfer a copy of that data onto Google Docs, WordPress, or Blogger. It’s expanding on a similar tool the company released last year that allows you to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241093/facebook-google-photos-transfer-tool-data"&gt;transfer photos from its platform onto Google Photos&lt;/a&gt;. In both cases, the tool allows users leaving Facebook to preserve a version of the content associated with their account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6FvjV"&gt;Users can access the tool by opening Facebook settings and clicking on “Your Facebook Information,” then selecting “Transfer a Copy of Your Information.” There, you can select which destination to transfer the data to (Google Docs, WordPress, or Blogger), log in to the account you select, and confirm the transfer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EaLIwh"&gt;The new feature is part of the Data Transfer Project, a cross-company data-sharing initiative that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17589246/data-transfer-project-google-facebook-microsoft-twitter"&gt;launched in 2018&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of allowing you to move data across various online services and platforms seamlessly. Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter are also involved in the project, offering similar data-export tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vi9gfL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook hopes to advance the conversation with policymakers, developers, and experts regarding data portability&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="omsDXY"&gt;The feature is convenient for users who want to share specific posts or notes they created through Facebook. Still, it is important to note that data ported will not archive comments from other users since those comments are seen as belonging to a separate account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0xhwh"&gt;The new data export tools help bring Facebook in line with two recent tech regulation laws — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/31/21039228/california-ccpa-facebook-microsoft-gdpr-privacy-law-consumer-data-regulation"&gt;California’s Consumer Privacy Act&lt;/a&gt; and the European Union’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172548/gdpr-compliance-requirements-privacy-notice"&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt;. Both laws require that companies provide personal information in a readily usable format upon request, although the specifics of the format and interoperability measures are left unspecified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pQDBf8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Everything you need to know about GDPR","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172548/gdpr-compliance-requirements-privacy-notice"},{"title":"No one is ready for California’s new consumer privacy law","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/31/21039228/california-ccpa-facebook-microsoft-gdpr-privacy-law-consumer-data-regulation"},{"title":"Facebook’s new tool makes it easy to transfer photos and videos to Google Photos","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241093/facebook-google-photos-transfer-tool-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter achieves historic powered flight on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bczUGNi9xolJo7xKvCbsRPHD36o=/0x52:1310x925/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69148358/Screen_Shot_2021_04_19_at_6.54.46_AM.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first image from Ingenuity’s historic flight on Mars, showing the helicopter’s shadow as it hovers midair.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA / JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0dZYqV"&gt;NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter nailed a successful debut test flight on Mars, engineers confirmed early Monday morning. The tiny spacecraft lifted itself 10 feet off the Martian surface for 39 seconds, marking the first powered flight on another world. The historic demonstration opens up tantalizing possibilities for a new mode of planetary travel that could send future rotorcraft far beyond the reach of traditional rovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8Opmu"&gt;The four-pound Ingenuity helicopter lifted its tissue box-sized body at 12:34PM Mars time (3:34AM ET, Earth time), spinning its twin rotor blades to achieve its first flight in the ultrathin atmosphere of Mars. Those blades spun faster than 2,500 rpm — much faster than the roughly 500 rpm helicopters need to fly on Earth. The craft hovered for about 30 seconds above the surface before descending for touchdown, concluding a fully autonomous 39.1-second flight test, NASA said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PxuYz"&gt;The rotorcraft arrived on the Red Planet, 173 million miles from Earth, on February 18th, clinging to the underbelly of NASA’s Perseverance rover. It was deployed from Perseverance over a month later, on April 4th, starting a 31-day clock to carry out five flight tests. Monday’s successful flight sets the stage for more ambitious attempts in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EIwoXS"&gt;Engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory broke out in cheers upon confirmation that Ingenuity’s flight attempt appeared flawless. “Confirmed, that Ingenuity has performed its first flight of a powered aircraft on another planet,” Ingenuity chief pilot Håvard Grip declared, prompting applause inside JPL Mission Control. “We can now say that humans beings have flown a rotorcraft on another planet,” Ingenuity project manager MiMi Aung told NASA engineers in the room after confirmation of the helicopter’s successful flight test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6lxYIh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A red-letter day on the Red Planet! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarsHelicopter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MarsHelicopter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Qow8JwhYEo"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Qow8JwhYEo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA JPL (@NASAJPL) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1384099533026566148?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bk1I97"&gt;“This gives us amazing hope for all of humanity. I couldn’t be more proud,” Thomas Zurbuchen, associate NASA administrator for science, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Dr_ThomasZ/status/1384102594319032329"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. Upon successful confirmation, Zurbuchen said NASA named Ingenuity’s flight zone Wright Brothers Field, as a nod to the Wright brothers’ revolutionary flight in 1903 and “in recognition of the ingenuity and innovation that continue to propel exploration.” The helicopter carries on its body a postage stamp-sized piece of the Wright brothers’ iconic plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQpgv6"&gt;A black-and-white image from Ingenuity’s down-facing navigation camera was the first visual confirmation of the copter’s flight, showing the experimental craft’s shadow from roughly 10 feet above the surface. Minutes after flight confirmation, a sequence of images taken by Perseverance, watching from about 211 feet away, arrived at Mission Control and put Ingenuity’s flight in motion for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fv7fr3cMhaETmkz8j1V2PJkFw3Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22453946/Apr_19_2021_07_01_51.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Video: NASA / JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ingenuity soared 10 feet off the ground over Mars’ Jezero Crater.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Vyg7DV"&gt;The flight was delayed a few times from April 11th, with one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381554/ingenuity-mars-first-flight-delayed-nasa-fixes-software-bug"&gt;delay last week&lt;/a&gt; requiring engineers to reupload Ingenuity’s entire flight software after running into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377299/nasa-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-flight-delayed-wednesday"&gt;glitch&lt;/a&gt; during preflight tests. The helicopter has a running track-shaped flight zone at Mars’ Jezero Crater, the site of a dried-out lakebed that Perseverance will scour for signs of past microbial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOh6Mg"&gt;Ingenuity’s main mission is to demonstrate flight, with no objectives to explore Mars or carry out science experiments. Those jobs are reserved for Perseverance, whose primary life-hunting mission involves caching Martian soil samples that a future rover will send back to Earth as early as 2031.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2dRYq"&gt;Engineers will analyze loads of data from Ingenuity’s first flight to set the parameters for its next four flights in the coming weeks, with the second one scheduled for April 22nd, NASA said. For those tests, Ingenuity will soar higher and travel across its flight zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzyrLT"&gt;“Like the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk, we know that our time to make a difference at Jezero Crater, Mars is not yet over,” Aung told engineers in Mission Control. “This is just the first great flight.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="PNiLU4"&gt;Microsoft is testing out a new performance mode for its Edge browser. The new mode is available to some testers using the Microsoft Edge Canary version of the browser, and others can enable it manually with a flag. “Performance mode helps you optimize speed, responsiveness, memory, CPU and battery usage,” &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/discussions/introducing-performance-mode-in-microsoft-edge-new-feature/m-p/2270856"&gt;says Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. “Performance improvements might vary depending on your individual specifications and browser habits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DiWHiB"&gt;It’s not clear exactly how the performance mode changes Edge, but it does affect the Sleeping Tabs feature. If you enable performance mode then the Sleeping Tabs timeout will be locked to five minutes. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242622/microsoft-edge-new-themes-icons-sleeping-tabs-feature"&gt;introduced sleeping tabs in Edge&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, allowing the browser to automatically release system resources for inactive tabs when you have a number of tabs open, which helps new tabs run better or stop the browser from hogging memory and CPU resources in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlkSzm"&gt;Performance mode in Edge will likely prove most useful for laptop users, as browsers can often have a big impact on battery life. Google has also been working on improving Chrome performance and battery usage over the past six months. An &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571832/google-chrome-2020-speed-memory-improvements"&gt;update in November&lt;/a&gt; significantly improved CPU usage, and an update earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22326952/google-chrome-89-resource-efficiency-memory-hog-startup-speed-improvements"&gt;improved RAM and GPU usage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says no ‘Oculus Quest Pro’ this year</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h2DFbY"&gt;Andrew Bosworth, VP at Facebook’s Reality Labs, has given some more hints as to what’s in store for future Oculus hardware. In an audio Q&amp;amp;A with John Carmack on Twitter Spaces &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/facebook-oculus-quest-pro/"&gt;transcribed by &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Bosworth suggested that while last year’s Quest 2 will be sticking around for some time yet, the company is working on headsets with greater capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAEIn3"&gt;“People are also asking about the Quest 3, which doesn’t exist yet, and [for] everyone who is listening to us who is a reporter — there isn’t a Quest 3, there’s only a Quest 2.” Bosworth said. “But I did hint at an &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-quest-pro-facebook-bosworth/"&gt;AMA&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year about Quest Pro because we do have a lot of things in development where we want to introduce new functionality to the headset along the kinds that people theorize that we would want to introduce, and that’s a little ways off still. It’s still not gonna happen this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9KI16"&gt;“For those who are curious, Quest 2 is going to be in the market for a while — for a long while,” Bosworth continued. “And it’s going to be, you know, I think the best bet for the most accessible way to get into VR and have a great experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DX3zSs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 12 best new and updated games for the Oculus Quest 2","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21535909/oculus-quest-2-best-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="HsYxmH"&gt;The discussion is particularly relevant right now because last week &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386496/resident-evil-4-vr-remake-oculus-quest-2-announced"&gt;Facebook announced the first title that’s exclusive to the Quest 2 headset — &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; won’t run on the original Quest. While the Quest 2 hardware is significantly more powerful than its predecessor, the announcement could have made owners of either headset wary about Facebook’s long-term support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7sQzi"&gt;Carmack, now a consulting technical officer at Facebook, said he was “supportive of Quest 2-only exclusives but believes there’s “still a pretty substantial market there in Quest 1 users.” Bosworth agreed, saying “I expect the incentives to be for developers to support Quest 1, absolutely. You are unlocking, you know, seven figures of additional users who could potentially buy your software — which is a pretty good deal when you can get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGHioH"&gt;“The formal answer is that we may eventually allow developers who have really high-end apps to target Quest 2 alone, but our very strong recommendation is to support both, and that’s actually what we expect to have happen based on historical norms,” Bosworth added, implying that the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 VR&lt;/em&gt; situation may not be all that common for now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Audi teases the future of its electric sedans with the A6 E-Tron concept</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tBWv1IegZJ4UCvqs7PRWGwH_Obo=/100x180:1984x1436/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69148007/XS21Outdoor52201.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Audi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dTE8rI"&gt;Audi has debuted a concept version of an all-electric A6 sedan, which is coming to all major global markets and will be built on a new EV platform the company is co-developing with Porsche. A production version won’t be revealed until at least the second half of 2022, but the German automaker is targeting around 700 kilometers (more than 400 miles) of range for the new car, which will be called the A6 E-Tron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWqNvt"&gt;The A6 E-Tron concept Audi showed off on Monday at Auto Shanghai 2021 is pretty straightforward as far as concepts go, which is in keeping with how the automaker has handled these reveals lately. To wit, the Q4 E-Tron electric SUV that Audi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382663/audi-q4-etron-sportback-electric-suv-volkswagen-price-specs-release-date"&gt;debuted just last week&lt;/a&gt; is a dead ringer for the “concept” version it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251528/audi-q4-etron-ev-concept-geneva-auto-show-2019"&gt;first showed off at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show&lt;/a&gt;. While there are plenty more details and specifics to be learned about the production A6 E-Tron — including price — what we’re seeing now will likely translate closely to what will eventually go on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LCjLFo"&gt;That includes not only a really healthy range target (thanks to a battery pack capacity of “around 100kWh,” according to Audi), but a fresh take on the A6’s sporty sedan look, as well as a bunch of high-tech upgrades, especially to Audi’s lighting systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j2kZdv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Audi is building its electric vehicles on many different platforms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QjJGez"&gt;First, though, a note on that underlying EV platform. Audi and Porsche call it the Premium Platform Electric, or PPE. The two Volkswagen Group companies first started &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2020/04/02/audi-porsche-ppe-platform-electric-cars/"&gt;talking about it around a year ago&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s slated to power the larger vehicles in Audi’s and Porsche’s forthcoming electric stables. It’s at least the &lt;em&gt;fourth&lt;/em&gt; different EV platform Audi is building its electric cars on. Audi adapted one of its internal combustion platforms to include batteries and electric motors for the original E-Tron and E-Tron Sportback. Audi is using the Porsche Taycan’s J1 platform to power &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274376/audi-etron-gt-rs-electric-car-specs-price"&gt;the E-Tron GT&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s building the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382663/audi-q4-etron-sportback-electric-suv-volkswagen-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Q4 E-Tron and Q4 Sportback E-Tron&lt;/a&gt; on Volkswagen’s modular MEB platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Yfhsyj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10453761"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gt1o1S"&gt;A lot of this ultimately won’t matter much to consumers, as it’s not like these Audi EVs will say “powered by Porsche” on the steering wheel or the exterior badging. But there are vast resources in the Volkswagen Group — especially as it tries to break Tesla’s early hold on the EV market — and Audi is clearly trying to leverage the best of what’s being developed across the larger conglomerate to make a big mark with its electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wp4wt1"&gt;That’s not to say Audi isn’t doing its own work. The company has spent years developing electric motor technology for its motorsports division (including fielding a team in the all-electric racing series Formula E). And in the A6 E-Tron concept, Audi says it’s even going to squeeze an extra few miles out of the PPE’s battery pack thanks to a special paint that can reflect “a significant percentage of the thermal radiation in sunlight,” meaning drivers will have to rely less on the air conditioning system, which can draw a significant amount of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YCPyu"&gt;And anyway, Audi’s cars and SUV’s are as much about the premium in-car experience as they are about what powers them. With that in mind, Audi is touting some notable upgrades to its already advanced lighting tech with the A6 E-Tron concept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="rysiAL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An upgrade to Audi’s already advanced lighting systems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WtaKnF"&gt;For one thing, the company says its so-called “Digital Matrix LED” headlights (which are only available outside the US) have gained new capabilities. These lights, which use a complex shutter system to sculpt the LED light into specific shapes and animations, can now project an Audi-developed video game on a nearby wall or garage door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2oyxu"&gt;Four LED projectors in the corners of the vehicle can create turn signal animations on the road. And three of them embedded in each side of the bodywork can do everything from present welcome messages on the ground for the driver and their passengers, to warn cyclists that a door is about to open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfQD18"&gt;Sedan sales have practically cratered in the US as buyers continue to be swayed by the high seating position and storage space of SUVs and trucks. Car companies — Audi included — are also incentivized to push consumers into these vehicles, which are typically profit centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJODiP"&gt;As high-end automakers push further into electric vehicles, though, they’re apparently willing to bet they can still make the case for these low-slung luxury vehicles, as Mercedes-Benz &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385437/mercedes-benz-eqs-electric-ev-photos-specs"&gt;just last week revealed what is essentially an all-electric S-Class sedan&lt;/a&gt;. The A6 E-Tron won’t be a pound-for-pound competitor to that offering, just like the gas-powered A6 doesn’t directly compete with the internal combustion S-Class. But the concept version announced Monday is a tease in two senses. One, it gives people a rough idea of what to expect from the ultimate production version of the A6 E-Tron. And two, it’s a first look at what Audi will do with the electric cars it’s building on that PPE platform — the same platform that will almost certainly power electric versions of other high-end A-series sedans.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter, Facebook, and Snap are part of White House vaccination campaign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NKb-MWIRmrMPFz7vukLtzpOT-Hk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69147042/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lHzUjO"&gt;Facebook, Twitter, and Snap are among the companies that will assist with the Biden administration's promotional campaign for vaccine eligibility, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-vaccine-eligibility-push-e438587b-9b34-4b75-9132-7395c2768ed7.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The White House had set a date of May 1st for states to open coronavirus vaccine eligibility to all adults, but later pushed it to April 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGoEoE"&gt;The White House is hoping to reach populations who may have higher rates of vaccine hesitancy with the effort. Anthony Fauci, the president’s chief medical adviser, will do video clips on Snapchat, according to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;, and Facebook and Twitter will send out push alerts to notify users that they’re eligible to receive the vaccine. Vice President Kamala Harris will also be involved with the social media push.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAkKnu"&gt;Half of all US adults have &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-anthony-fauci-coronavirus-pandemic-infectious-diseases-coronavirus-vaccine-6e3b18b44a05d1e49ed35337ec7ce969"&gt;received at least one COVID-19 vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), But the administration appears concerned that last week’s decision to pause the use of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine may have made people already hesitant to receive a vaccine even more wary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pYg4Q"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CDC recommended last week that the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381469/covid-vaccine-pause-blood-clots-johnson-fda-cdc"&gt;pause the use&lt;/a&gt; of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine after six people who received the shot experienced unusual blood clots. The agencies wanted time to investigate whether there’s a connection between the clots and the vaccine. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/18/politics/fauci-jj-vaccine-friday/index.html"&gt;Fauci said on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; that he believes the pause will be lifted by Friday, perhaps under some kind of restriction or warning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2JL7h"&gt;“We can confirm that Snap has been in touch with the White House regarding efforts to spread awareness of vaccine eligibility among Snapchatters,” a spokesperson said in an email to The Verge, “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21187176/snap-mental-health-coronavirus-anxiety-stress"&gt;building on our continued efforts&lt;/a&gt; to support our community during the COVID-19 pandemic.” The spokesperson did not elaborate on details of the efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKb9x8"&gt;Likewise, a Twitter spokesperson confirmed in an email to The Verge that the company was “working in partnership with the White House to elevate authoritative information in regard to COVID-19,” but did not share further details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dduq6p"&gt;Facebook and the White House did not reply to requests for comment on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4fy0l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 18th 8:32PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added comments from Twitter and Snap &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Live: NASA’s first flight on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/icW-WuYceTNDBgSNe1fh5NCw75k=/0x61:1591x1122/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69146578/Mars_Perseverance_ZL0_0048_0671199786_638ECM_N0031708ZCAM05012_110085J.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter stands prepped and set for its debut flight on Mars. | NASA/JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S4dNJU"&gt;NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter is slated to attempt the first-ever powered flight on another world at 3:30AM ET on Monday. The twin-blade rotorcraft will try to ascend 10 feet above ground and hover in place for 30 seconds while cameras on NASA’s Perseverance rover record the historic attempt from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLekK0"&gt;The four-pound Ingenuity copter landed on Mars February 18th attached to the underbelly of Perseverance, NASA’s latest Mars rover whose main mission is to search for signs of ancient Martian life. Perseverance has set aside time to witness Ingenuity’s flight attempt and report the results back to Earth. Ingenuity’s Monday flight test is the first of five planned within a 31-day window that kicked off last week. If all goes well, engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California will start planning for the next four, which could see the craft soar higher and travel farther, depending the results of its first attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahAw1M"&gt;JPL engineers have sought to set expectations for the test flight during recent press conferences: “This is really hard,” said Elsa Jensen, an operations lead for one of the cameras aboard Perseverance that’ll be fixed on Ingenuity. Tests have gone well over the last week, Jansen added. “But we know there’ll be surprises.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TmwxrF"&gt;How to watch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5NV9qE"&gt;If the flight takes off as planned on Monday, NASA will have livestreams beginning around 6:15AM ET on Monday hosted on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&amp;amp;ab_channel=NASA"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/NASA/videos/891028594799991"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nasa"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwQ9Sh"&gt;Because of the long data delay between Mars and Earth, we won’t see live video of the flight attempt — it will probably take a few days to get that footage. Instead, NASA’s livestreams will show engineers gradually analyzing data from Mars that will confirm whether or not Ingenuity survived its attempt. Did it fly as expected, or did it get swept away by a gust of wind? Did an alien steal it? We’ll know as soon as engineers find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIjXD4"&gt;Tune in early on Monday to see how the historic flight goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QXTFHC"&gt;What Happens Next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fG3Q9o"&gt;Ingenuity’s power supply will be exhausted upon landing, so it needs to beam data to Perseverance in the most efficient way possible. That landing data dump will include a few low-resolution black-and-white images captured by its down-facing navigation camera under its tissue box-sized body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e9Rx7C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is definitely a high-risk, high-reward experiment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kbRE96"&gt;Sometime Monday, engineers will get other images captured by two cameras on Perseverance — Navcam and Mastcam-Z — with much higher resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrTfmX"&gt;The images from Ingenuity, along with troves of summary data, will radio signals to a so-called Mars Base Station situated on Perseverance’s body, which will relay those signals to a satellite orbiting Mars, which will then shoot the data through NASA’s Deep Space Network all the way back to Earth. Ingenuity will go into sleep mode and re-charge its batteries for the rest of the day using the small cutting board-sized solar panel above its little rotor wings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLhBsT"&gt;On the next Mars day, or sol, engineers will wake Ingenuity back up and retrieve the first 13-megapixel color images taken by its other, horizon-facing camera. More flight data will be sent throughout the following day — “that’s kind of the prize of this project,” Tim Canham, Ingenuity’s operations lead, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U51c8e"&gt;“This is definitely a high-risk, high-reward experiment,” MiMi Aung, Ingenuity project manager at NASA JPL, said Friday during a press conference. Based on several hours of tests, simulations and Martian weather analyses, Aung said “confidence is high” among the engineering team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="P9Gf5W"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22368208/nasa-helicopter-mars-perseverance-ingenuity-pre-flight-test"&gt;Ingenuity’s&lt;/a&gt; four-foot-long carbon fiber blades successfully unlocked last week after it planted its feet on the surface, and engineers were able to conduct a brief spin test at 50 rpm. For the craft’s actual flight, those blades will be spinning as quickly as 2,400 rpm — fast enough to achieve lift in Mars’ ultra-thin atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iFoDG"&gt;How Ingenuity does on its first flight test will determine the parameters of its upcoming flight tests. Aung said the helicopter’s “lifetime will be determined by how well it lands,” suggesting engineers could be able to carry out more flight tests within the 31-day window if things are successful. After that window, however, it’s likely Ingenuity will retire. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Army of the Dead, The Underground Railroad, Resident Evil, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QpZ-XEcuhDeJuLGskH1tty9pbIw=/200x0:1549x899/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69146155/army_of_the_dead.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Here come the zombies in &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI1JGPhYBS8&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8XwaEA"&gt;I finished &lt;em&gt;This is a Robbery&lt;/em&gt;, and I won’t spoil the ending but if you’re thinking there will be a huge reveal at the end, well, you might be disappointed. What I found interesting throughout the four-part series was how the storyline relied on the voices of newspaper reporters who have covered the heist —and its aftermath —over the years. Considering the filmmakers are Colin and Nick Barnicle, sons of longtime &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; columnist and current MSNBC contributor Mike Barnicle, it makes sense they’d center journalists in the story. Go watch it, Boston looks absolutely beautiful and the Boston accents are more authentic than anything else you’ll watch this year. Plus, if you can figure out the central mystery of the series there’s a $10 million reward in it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7yFtq"&gt;Here are this week’s trailers (which are heavier on the zombie content than usual): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9wV3u5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tI1JGPhYBS8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0sMBWf"&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8HIzxL"&gt;We got a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300924/army-of-the-dead-trailer-zack-snyder-netflix-vegas-heist-movie"&gt;teaser&lt;/a&gt; a couple of months ago but this is the first official full-length trailer for Zack Snyder’s big-budget heist flick. A group of mercenaries shoot their way into Las Vegas to get $200 million buried underneath the Sunset Strip before the government nukes the entire city. Plot twist: Vegas has been overrun by zombies— not the shambling, mindless creepers from &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;, mind you; these zombies are organized and smart. And fast, like the &lt;em&gt;World War Z&lt;/em&gt; zombies.  (Side note: Kenny Rogers’ &lt;em&gt;The Gambler &lt;/em&gt;is the perfect music for this trailer: “you got to know when to hold ‘em/Know when to fold ‘em/Know when to walk away/ Know when to run.”) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvvKQs"&gt;Dave Bautista plays the zombie war hero who leads the ragtag group into battle. &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; hits Netflix May 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4ENAji"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Pq5Usc_JDA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Bd2Vhw"&gt;The Underground Railroad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XPW0zc"&gt;Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Colson Whitehead, &lt;em&gt;The Underground Railroad &lt;/em&gt;is set in the novel’s alternate history, making the railroad of the title an actual 19th-century railroad that helps slaves escape the South. Thuso Mbedu plays Cora Randall, who is fleeing a Georgia plantation and being pursued by a bounty hunter (Joel Edgerton). Directed by Barry Jenkins, all episodes of &lt;em&gt;The Underground Railroad— &lt;/em&gt;a sure Emmy contender that looks hauntingly beautiful— will premiere on Amazon Prime Video on May 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XGYVK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KTnMDg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Di_PJyDGIg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="T5PlKd"&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious 9 &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KHYtsf"&gt;This is one of many movies delayed by the coronavirus pandemic (the last trailer was in January 2020 and the movie was supposed to come out last May) but is finally back on the schedule with a new release date. Many familiar faces will return for &lt;em&gt;F9&lt;/em&gt;, including (of course) Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, John Cena and Helen Mirren. The latest installment in the &lt;em&gt;Furious &lt;/em&gt;franchise hits theaters June 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e469fM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_mOAXaPVtD0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="58Rf7m"&gt;Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bPDZrN"&gt;Don’t you hate when zombies invade the White House and you have to go in and save the day? This teaser trailer gives some more clues into Netflix’s new anime series set two years after the events of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4. &lt;/em&gt;While an earlier teaser showed Claire walking around in what appeared to be a haunted house, this latest teaser shows that she and Leon are in the White House for separate reasons, and then: zombies.&lt;em&gt; Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness &lt;/em&gt;hits Netflix in July.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFKyOf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
