    <title>Quibi reportedly in talks to sell its shows to Roku</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pl0qBr_VqgOM5mipiu2SejUaIsg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68614488/gblackmon_200403_3960_quibi_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ziikWs"&gt;Failed mobile-first streaming service Quibi is in advanced discussions to sell the rights to its content library to Roku, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/roku-nears-deal-to-buy-rights-to-quibis-content-11609725389"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The report doesn’t indicate a potential price for the acquisition, and notes that the two parties may not reach a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzf2ge"&gt;If it were to happen, the deal could give the Roku Channel exclusive access to Quibi’s slate of programming. None of Quibi’s shows ever really took off, but Roku may feel that the content would stand a better chance when available on the best-selling streaming devices in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Bynurc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside the final days of Quibi","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21559189/quibi-final-days-streaming-platform-coronavirus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="exg5Je"&gt;Quibi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527197/quibi-streaming-service-mobile-shutting-down-end-katzenberg"&gt;announced it was shutting down&lt;/a&gt; back in October, just six months after its much-hyped launch. The service was headed by former HP CEO Meg Whitman and former Disney chairman and movie producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21165312/quibi-funding-investors-jeffrey-katzenberg-launch-date-price"&gt;managed to raise almost $2 billion in funding&lt;/a&gt; before the app was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGGbMF"&gt;Katzenberg had already tried to get companies including Facebook and NBCUniversal to pick up Quibi programming ahead of its demise, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527131/quibi-shutdown-sale-streaming-jeffrey-katzenberg"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVxt62"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company. Vox Media also has a deal with Quibi to produce a show, and there were early talks about a &lt;/em&gt;Verge&lt;em&gt; show as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung officially confirms Galaxy S21 event for January 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ajbzQ8Yvb3jHk4X3AL3VmkfYTpA=/52x0:616x376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68613886/samsung_galaxy_s21_668_leak.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/08/exclusive-here-are-the-official-galaxy-s21-s21-and-s21-ultra-teasers/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="at34Jk"&gt;Samsung will officially be announcing its latest lineup of Galaxy flagship phones — rumored to be the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra — on January 14th, the company confirmed through invitations to a new Galaxy Unpacked event. The tagline: “Welcome to the Everyday Epic.” The event will kick off at 7AM PT / 10AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPqWI5"&gt;The company is widely expected to announce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202864/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-specs-leak"&gt;three new smartphones at the event&lt;/a&gt;, successors to last year’s Galaxy S20 lineup: a pair of matching S21 and S21 Plus phones (that are expected to be largely similar, except for size), and a more premium S21 Ultra model that will offer even better specs and cameras, similar to its 2020 counterpart, in addition to a curved display and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22196897/s-pen-uwb-comfirm-galaxy-s21-ultra-fcc"&gt;support for Samsung’s S-Pen stylus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApD5hc"&gt;There’s not a lot to glean from the event teaser video you can watch at the top of this post, which appears to simply be the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/8/22163632/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-5g-teaser-video-leak"&gt;Galaxy S21’s camera module&lt;/a&gt; floating inside a translucent cube. But practically every detail of these new phones already seems to have leaked, including sharper animated GIFs of what those modules should look like:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S4zp2zRZ7UOWkc2_K4LUD2HHGqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154918/samsung_galaxy_s21_668_leak.gif"&gt;

We wouldn’t be surprised if one or both appeared alongside the new phone lineup.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some T-Mobile customers’ call records may have been accessed in a recent breach</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-kXV0ACzrur5TiGSMEB2-j6Gmqc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68613397/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B5xWYh"&gt;T-Mobile suffered a security breach in December that may have exposed call-related information and phone numbers for some of its customers. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/t-mobile-data-breach-exposed-phone-numbers-call-records/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the information affected by the breach did &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; include names on customers’ accounts, physical or email addresses, financial data, credit card information, Social Security numbers, tax IDs, passwords, or PINs, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YeCFC"&gt;T-Mobile said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it had notified “less than 0.2 percent” of its customers— which works out to about 200,000 people— that some account information may have been illegally accessed. That information “may have included phone numbers, number of lines subscribed to and in a small number of cases some call-related information collected as part of normal operation and service.” T-Mobile says it “identified this attack in early December and quickly shut down the incident.” Affected customers were notified via text message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzJhiJ"&gt;In a notice on its website, T-Mobile said its security team “shut down malicious, unauthorized access,” and it began an investigation to determine what information was involved. The company reported the situation to federal law enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwKFwg"&gt;T-Mobile has been victim to several data breaches in recent years; in 2018, hackers accessed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/24/17776836/tmobile-hack-data-breach-personal-information-two-million-customers"&gt;personal information for roughly 2 million customers&lt;/a&gt; that included names, addresses, and account numbers. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20978498/tmobile-security-disclosed-breach-prepaid-customers"&gt;2019, some of the company’s prepaid customers&lt;/a&gt; were affected by a breach that accessed names, addresses, and account numbers. And in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fresponsibility%2Fconsumer-info%2Fpii-notice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F3%2F22211839%2Ft-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;March 2020, a breach&lt;/a&gt; exposed some T-Mobile customers’ financial information, Social Security numbers, and other account information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sc6JPR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1vgFX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Land, The Human Voice, and Pretend It’s a City</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LImNrcIjHKfAHPpjc04Am5F3k7w=/182x0:1445x842/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68612684/robib_wright.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robin Wright in Land&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOw20FDNnHA&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;amp;ab_channel=FocusFeatures" target="_blank"&gt;Focus Features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hB7lKx"&gt;The best thing I have watched in 2021 so far is the &lt;a href="https://ratatousical.com/"&gt;Ratatouille TikTok musical&lt;/a&gt;, it’s charming and the performances —by some big Broadway stars— are excellent. If you haven’t purchased your ticket yet (prices are on a pay-what-you-can scale), there’s still time; it will stream until January 4th. Ticket proceeds benefit the &lt;a href="https://actorsfund.org/"&gt;Actors Fund&lt;/a&gt;, a worthy cause. Be warned that the songs will definitely get stuck in your head, just like any good musical number does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9miaXp"&gt;In other news I just started &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;... will report back. Saucy so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJYtgV"&gt;It’s kind of slim pickins this week for new trailers, but I found a couple of interesting ones that all happen to feature strong female protagonists, a fine tone to set for 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RxvDHa"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MClMxqD-HNA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mokhj9"&gt;Pretend It’s a City&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="YqjVrO"&gt;It’s no secret that Fran Lebowitz has &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; about many things, including her native New York City. Martin Scorsese directed this documentary featuring the legendary essayist doing what she does best: opining. She talks about tourists, Times Square, real estate, and notes that “it would take one subway ride for the Dalai Lama to turn into a lunatic, crazy person.” &lt;em&gt;Pretend It’s a City&lt;/em&gt; debuts on Netflix January 8th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gP687x"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G3lGM39dKuY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pCQhrc"&gt;The Human Voice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAVb8G"&gt;Director Pedro Almodovar makes his English-language debut with&lt;em&gt; The Human Voice&lt;/em&gt;, a 30-minute short film based on the Jean Cocteau one-act play of the same name. Tilda Swinton stars as a woman waiting for her ex to return to pick up his luggage (metaphor alert) but he never shows. I’m pretty much down for anything with Tilda in it. &lt;em&gt;The Human Voice&lt;/em&gt; is due for release later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eesIfK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sOw20FDNnHA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3JRoQj"&gt;Land&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zkKetR"&gt;Robin Wright directed and stars in this movie about a woman who ventures into the wilderness of the Rocky Mountains to get away from a tragedy— the trailer suggests it has to do with the loss of a child. She underestimates how brutal and difficult it will be to survive on her own and is rescued by a local hunter played by Demian Bichir. &lt;em&gt;Land&lt;/em&gt; is slated to be released in theaters February 12th (though it seems likely with everything going on that may get pushed back).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9WjXN4"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>SolarWinds hack may be much worse than originally feared</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UFY6KYwZUR4OQ9lSCD0TsTSfkxI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68610303/acastro_170621_1777_0007_v2_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="engadget-post-contents"&gt;The Russia-linked SolarWinds hack which targeted US government agencies and private corporations may be even worse than officials first realized, with some 250 federal agencies and business now believed affected, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/us/politics/russian-hacking-government.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBv42J"&gt;Microsoft has said the hackers compromised &lt;a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory"&gt;SolarWinds’ Orion monitoring and management software&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to “impersonate any of the organization’s existing users and accounts, including highly privileged accounts.” The &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;reports that Russia exploited layers of the supply chain to access the agencies’ systems.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9VzH4"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reports that early warning sensors that Cyber Command and the NSA placed inside foreign networks to detect potential attacks appear to have failed in this instance. In addition, it seems likely that the US government’s attention on protecting the November elections from foreign hackers may have taken resources and focus away from the software supply chain, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times. &lt;/em&gt;And conducting the attack from within the US apparently allowed the hackers to evade detection by the Department of Homeland Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5crqX"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/31/microsoft-internal-solorigate-investigation-update/"&gt;said earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; it had discovered its systems were infiltrated “beyond just the presence of malicious SolarWinds code.” The hackers were able to “view source code in a number of source code repositories,” but the hacked account granting the access didn’t have permission to modify any code or systems. However, in a small bit of good news, Microsoft said it found “no evidence of access to production services or customer data,” and “no indications that our systems were used to attack others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wn0yDw"&gt;Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; the hack looked “much, much worse” than he first feared. “The size of it keeps expanding,” he said. “It’s clear the United States government missed it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The delightful Ratatouille TikTok musical has already sold more than $1 million in tickets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RzesL8d4tDwRI5b7KsCzj9-Ovdc=/190x0:1680x993/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68609787/ratatouille_tituss.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Titus Burgess as Remy in Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gUsqrc"&gt;The TikTok &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; musical— aka the &lt;em&gt;Ratatousical&lt;/em&gt;— debuted online on New Year’s Day and has already sold more than $1 million in tickets, in quite the feel-good start to 2021. A portion of the ticket sales will benefit The Actors Fund, which supports performers and workers in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FB21CY"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NnB7jp"&gt;The musical &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166215/ratatouille-the-tiktok-musical-broadway-show-todaytix-streaming-one-night-date-viral-disney"&gt;came together on TikTok&lt;/a&gt; over several months, with creators including composers, fans, set designers, costumers, and choreographers devising musical numbers, songs, and even a fake Playbill for the fictional “show” based on the 2007 Disney/Pixar animated film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYBMX6"&gt;Then suddenly it was actually happening: &lt;a href="https://seaviewprods.com/work/ratatouille-the-tiktok-musical/"&gt;Seaview Productions announced&lt;/a&gt; it was producing the show in association with TikTok, and even Disney/Pixar gave its blessing. The show got some big name Broadway stars to perform the crowdsourced songs, including Wayne Brady going all in with rat makeup as Django, Andrew Barth Feldman as Linguini, Ashley Park as Colette, Kevin Chamberlin as Auguste Gusteau, Andre de Shields as Anton Ego, Adam Lambert as Emile, and Tituss Burgess playing Remy, the rat who loves to cook. The 20-piece Broadway Sinfonietta orchestra was on board as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="io1cd0"&gt; “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjU_p3uvlkU"&gt;The Rat’s Way of Life&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvI0Lg8JmPQ"&gt;Ratatouille Tango&lt;/a&gt;” created by TikToker &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@blakeyrouse?lang=en"&gt;Blake Rouse&lt;/a&gt; are featured in the musical, along with “Anyone Can Cook” and the song that started it all, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danieljmertz/status/1336765015911768069"&gt;“Remy the Ratatouille.”&lt;/a&gt; It did not have all the glitz and glamour of a high-end Broadway production, but the caliber of the performances given from their homes by the actors, musicians, and dancers (yes, even a kick line!) are top-notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDajsN"&gt;Feldman summed it up after the debut: “fantastic.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t0gJKS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Holy. Shit. That was fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;— Andrew Barth Feldman (@andrewbfeldman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andrewbfeldman/status/1345172987062988800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W6iaIb"&gt;Near the end of the show, we also get to see many of the TikTok creators who helped bring it all together. I’m not a theater critic by any stretch of the imagination but I love musicals, and I found the &lt;em&gt;Ratatousical&lt;/em&gt; to be a creative triumph, sorely needed at a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21177162/new-york-coronavirus-ban-public-gathering-broadway-concerts-museums"&gt;time when Broadway&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the world have been disrupted by the pandemic. And I agree with the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2021-01-02/tiktok-ratatouille-musical-theater"&gt;critic from &lt;em&gt;The Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who says the show may signal a new way forward for musical theater, one without gatekeepers preventing new talent from having their chance to shine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WXGfYV"&gt;I won’t spoil the plot, but it sticks pretty closely to the original movie’s storyline.

    <title>Apple will let Amphetamine app stay in the App Store after wrongly telling developer it violated App Store rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Ph2yeuD9W7VLUTasBEqQ1R6nDY=/0x0:1452x968/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68609629/Screen_Shot_2021_01_02_at_11.46.06_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amphetamine’s developer says Apple told him to change the app’s name and remove the pill from its logo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HgpyKh"&gt;The developer of Amphetamine, an app that prevents Macs from going into sleep mode, says Apple told him it violated App Store guidelines, even though it’s been in the App Store since 2014, and has nothing to do with drug use. Not long after &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reached out to Apple for comment on Saturday however, the company reversed its decision, and the app will be able to stay up with its current name and logo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58AFnz"&gt;William C. Gustafson said in January 1st posts on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/koeyok/will_you_help_save_amphetamine/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/x74353/SaveAmphetamine"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; that Apple had informed him he had two weeks to “remove all references to the word ‘amphetamine’ and remove the pill from the icon.” If he failed to do so, Gustafson wrote, Apple said it would remove the app from the App Store on January 12th. The logo features a cartoon image of a pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNXbti"&gt;Gustafson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he got a call Saturday from Apple granting his appeal— but he didn’t have insight into how the app was flagged in the first place. “I specifically asked Apple on the phone if this was a result of customer complaints and Apple’s response was ‘I don’t think so,’” he said. “I found it odd that this issue came up out of nowhere. I wasn’t in the middle of trying to update Amphetamine or anything. Just sitting at home with my kids enjoying our holiday and got the violation/rejection email from Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0sgsld"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just got off a call with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt;. Appeal accepted and Amphetamine will remain on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you all for your comments, opinions, and action. We may not all agree, but I am happy we all still have the freedom to express ourselves today. ❤️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/PV7eB9aUfn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PV7eB9aUfn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— William C. Gustafson (@x74353) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/x74353/status/1345421211677949957?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BAe1qX"&gt;Gustafson says Apple contacted him on December 29th and told him Amphetamine “appears to promote inappropriate use of controlled substances. Specifically, your app name and icon include references to controlled substances, pills.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jU5tv"&gt;The free macOS app has been downloaded more than 432,000 times, with a 4.8 rating, Gustafson said, noting that Apple even featured &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1470456860"&gt;Amphetamine in an Mac App Store story&lt;/a&gt;. He said he had numerous interactions with Apple employees for updates to the app since its launch, with no one objecting to the name or logo until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJQCs3"&gt;The specific App Store guideline Gustafson was accused of violating is &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#safety"&gt;this one, which states&lt;/a&gt; “Apps that encourage consumption of tobacco or vape products, illegal drugs, or excessive amounts of alcohol are not permitted on the App Store. Apps that encourage minors to consume any of these substances will be rejected. Facilitating the sale of marijuana, tobacco, or controlled substances (except for licensed pharmacies) isn’t allowed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jv9a5Q"&gt;Gustafson says Amphetamine does none of these things, and said changing the name of the app would have wrecked its brand recognition and potentially made it harder for users to find future updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mcu5HS"&gt;Gustafson initially said he didn’t expect his appeal to be successful, and indeed, Apple typically hews pretty closely to its App Store rules in most cases. The company has faced pushback from developers on several fronts in recent months, with big industry companies including Spotify, Tile, and Epic Games forming a group called the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453745/spotify-epic-tile-match-coalition-for-app-fairness-apple-app-store-policies-protest"&gt;Coalition for App Fairness&lt;/a&gt;. It says Apple’s rules create an uneven playing field in its App Stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5nGl1"&gt;Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;battled with Apple last summer&lt;/a&gt; over the mobile app design of his company’s email client, Hey. And Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;filed a lawsuit against Apple&lt;/a&gt; in August after the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt; iOS version of its battle royale game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was removed&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;from the App Store. Epic had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;implemented its own payment processing system&lt;/a&gt; into the iOS version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, which goes against App Store rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjkrPb"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately comment on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0FkpL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qgdzr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5KlfD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla fell just short of delivering 500,000 vehicles in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gRcgOKOJsEehix3Qs8o0Ad3kJKs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68609206/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pAn996"&gt;Tesla fell just shy of hitting CEO Elon Musk’s goal of delivering 500,000 vehicles in 2020, the &lt;a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q4-2020-vehicle-production-deliveries"&gt;company announced Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, having shipped a record 499,550 throughout the year — or 99.91 percent. Tesla said the final tally could vary by as much as 0.5 percent, though, so it’s possible that it will eclipse the 500,000 mark by the time it reveals the ultimate figures in its full year results, due out at the end of January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5Z4XR"&gt;Either way, that’s &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/463741/global-plugin-car-sales-november-2020/"&gt;more than double what the next-largest sellers of electric vehicles did in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, like China’s BYD or Germany’s Volkswagen. And it’s a remarkable recovery for Tesla considering the impact the coronavirus pandemic had on its operations during the first half of the year. While Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113987/tesla-q4-2019-earnings-results-profit-revenue-model-3"&gt;said in January 2020&lt;/a&gt; that it expected to “comfortably exceed” Musk’s goal of shipping 500,000 cars worldwide by the end of the year, the company had to close its new factory in China as well as its vehicle plant in Fremont, California for several weeks as the virus spread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y5HNfD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So proud of the Tesla team for achieving this major milestone! At the start of Tesla, I thought we had (optimistically) a 10% chance of surviving at all. &lt;a href="https://t.co/xCqTL5TGlE"&gt;https://t.co/xCqTL5TGlE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1345382294966571008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FX27u2"&gt;Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241728/tesla-q1-earnings-financial-results-elon-musk-coronavirus-profit"&gt;maintained that Tesla would still be able to reach his goal&lt;/a&gt;, and the company followed suit, especially after it launched the Model Y SUV ahead of schedule in March. Tesla delivered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21205932/tesla-q1-sales-deliveries-production-china-factory-coronavirus"&gt;88,400 vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in Q1, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21311128/tesla-q2-2020-vehicle-delivery-numbers-factory-shutdown"&gt;90,650 vehicles in Q2&lt;/a&gt;. In October, Tesla said it delivered &lt;a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q3-2020-vehicle-production-deliveries"&gt;139,300 vehicles&lt;/a&gt; during the third quarter, slightly better than the 137,000 Wall Street had expected. It also had its fifth consecutive profitable quarter in Q3. All of this helped send the company’s stock price into the stratosphere, making it the most valuable automaker on the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgxYYx"&gt;Tesla ostensibly met the 500,000-car goal with another classic end-of-quarter push, one that even saw the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/woodhaus2/status/1344804566827638786?s=21"&gt;company’s chief designer Franz von Holzhausen out delivering cars&lt;/a&gt;. Musk himself &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/26/tesla-achieve-milestone-500000-cars-in-2020-elon-musk-email-go-all-out/"&gt;prodded Tesla workers last week&lt;/a&gt; to go “all out” to hit the mark. “This is a great milestone to rally the company around achieving,” he wrote. “All the critics who, as recently as two years ago said that we’d never make it, also called our target of half a million in 2020 ‘impossible.’ The heck with them, we are doing it!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxxqW1"&gt;Tesla said Saturday that it ultimately produced 179,757 vehicles in the fourth quarter and delivered 180,570, bringing its totals to 509,747 and 499,550 for the year, respectively. The company wound up selling around 130,000 more vehicles than it did in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cOLhTb"&gt;The self-imposed 500,000-car sales goal is part of Musk’s attempt to drag the auto industry into the clean energy age, though it is more modest a bar than he once set. Musk had once predicted Tesla would deliver 1 million vehicles in 2020. But he &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-hedges-on-tesla-making-1-million-cars-by-2020-2018-8"&gt;later backed away&lt;/a&gt; from that number after the company ran into trouble ramping up production of its first mass-market electric car, the Model 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXPxh7"&gt;“So proud of the Tesla team for achieving this major milestone! At the start of Tesla, I thought we had (optimistically) a 10% chance of surviving at all,” Musk tweeted Saturday. “Tesla is responsible for 2/3 of all the personal &amp;amp; professional pain in my life combined. But it was worth it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SuTTlu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWNG9V"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUmVbZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 website promised free DLC in early 2021 — but don’t bet on ‘soon’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQ0R0TG97dimgvD34HWo-renXuc=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68607847/Cyberpunk2077_No_Future_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mCTvcR"&gt;In my opinion, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; isn’t quite the disaster some have suggested. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia"&gt;game is fun&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;bugs are fun&lt;/a&gt;! The bugs that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22198029/cyberpunk-2077-106-update-patch-corrupted-save-file-crashes"&gt;really&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22170547/cyberpunk-2077-update-hotfix-cd-projekt-red-epilepsy-risk-braindance"&gt;&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; weren’t fun have been patched. Refunds were made widely available, and despite that refund option, the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195728/cyberpunk-2077-sales-copies-sold-launch-refunds"&gt;sold 13 million copies in just two weeks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhO6QP"&gt;But publisher CD Projekt still has &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22178913/cyberpunk-2077-launch-controversy-cd-projekt"&gt;a broken reputation to fix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/25/22199768/cdprojekt-cyberpunk-2077-lawsuit-launch"&gt;an investor lawsuit to fight&lt;/a&gt;, so I wouldn’t put too much stock in the headline you might have read today: that we’re all getting free DLC for the game in early 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mlv7V"&gt;It’s possible! And it’s totally what &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/dlc"&gt;this official website promises&lt;/a&gt;. But that promise may be out of date. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K-SkcBCgkJknCDyiLo1-m82-hPc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22208798/cyberpunk_dlc_free.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HpoQ5s"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-dlc-211442122.html"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Engadget &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine shows that this promise may have been live on the internet the same day the game launched — before the outcry began, and definitely before CD Projekt held an emergency conference call on December 15th to discuss how the company would react. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJ71WV"&gt;On that call (&lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2020/12/call-transcript_en.pdf"&gt;PDF transcript&lt;/a&gt;), CD Projekt president and co-CEO Adam Kiciński told investors that it was “too early to judge” when the company might be able to release DLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MPVBy"&gt;Specifically, he was asked: “How do you feel about your ability to release a couple of DLCs next year, and, obviously, multiplayer in 2022?” (CD Projekt had previously said &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/16/21069351/cyberpunk-2077-developer-multiplayer-release-date-2021"&gt;that multiplayer would miss 2021&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmGcW6"&gt;The full answer: “To be honest, it’s too early to judge. At the moment please let us handle the situation, and please let us make some more assessments – that’s still ahead of us; we don’t know yet, and we’re now focused on improving Cyberpunk. We’ll discuss this early next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23RGse"&gt;Currently, we’re expecting two major patches for the game in January and February respectively, like the company promised &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1338390123373801472"&gt;on December 13th in its apology post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XLG3MT"&gt;Beyond that, some free DLC would of course be nice. Personally, I just want NPCs that know how to drive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Wing warns new drone laws ‘may have unintended consequences’ for privacy</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Wing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oClRBf"&gt;This past week, the US government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22203398/faa-remote-id-rules-location-night-over-people"&gt;made the single biggest, most impactful set of changes to drone law we’ve yet seen&lt;/a&gt; — ruling that almost every drone in US airspace will need to broadcast their locations, as well as the location of their pilots, in order to “address safety, national security, and law enforcement concerns regarding the further integration of these aircraft into the airspace of the United States”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bk53fJ"&gt;Google (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/12/5/20995520/alphabet-obsolete-sundar-pichai-ceo-page-brin"&gt;technically, Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;) isn’t too happy about those new rules, as it turns out. The company’s drone delivery subsidiary Wing &lt;a href="https://wing.com/resource-hub/articles/remote-id-rule/"&gt;wrote a somewhat fearmongering post&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-drones-faa-alphabet-idUSKBN2951T3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) titled “Broadcast-Only Remote Identification of Drones May Have Unintended Consequences for American Consumers,” which argues that the FAA’s decision to have drones broadcast their location might let observers track your movements, figuring out where you go, where you live, and where and when you receive packages, among other examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYZHgs"&gt;“American communities would not accept this type of surveillance of their deliveries or taxi trips on the road. They should not accept it in the sky,” Wing argues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxFHdv"&gt;With that kind of language, you might think Wing is arguing that drones shouldn’t broadcast their location, yes? Amusingly, no: the Alphabet subsidiary just wishes they’d send it through the internet instead of broadcasting it locally. I think my former &lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;colleague Ian Sherr’s tweet is apt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F9dj3U"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I am shocked — shocked — that a company being investigated for antitrust concerns over abusing its power on the internet would recommend the FAA ditch its newest radio-frequency ID program for internet-based tracking. &lt;a href="https://t.co/d6VNMPapth"&gt;https://t.co/d6VNMPapth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ian Sherr (@iansherr) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iansherr/status/1344795377522892801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 31, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rKr8S1"&gt;Internet-based tracking is exactly what the FAA had originally intended to do when it first proposed the Remote ID rules back in December 2019, by the way — before it received a laundry list of reasons from commenters why internet-based tracking might be problematic and decided to abandon it. Here are just a few of the ones mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vDXgO4"&gt;The cost of adding a cellular modem to a drone to begin with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="L1fB3n"&gt;The cost of paying for a monthly cellular data plan just to fly a drone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gV55WZ"&gt;The lack of reliable cellular coverage across the entirety of the US&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="loNRhS"&gt;The cost of paying a third-party data broker to track and store that data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PLAlAI"&gt;The possibility of that third-party data broker getting breached&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kAbAFm"&gt;The possibility of that data broker or network getting DDoS’d, grounding drones in the US&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="3axAsi"&gt;If you want to read the whole argument for yourself, the FAA spends 15 pages laying out and contemplating all the objections to internet-based Remote ID &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/media/attachments/RemoteID_Final_Rule.pdf"&gt;in its full rule (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; starting at page 60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhfkmt"&gt;Personally, I think it’s pretty ridiculous that the FAA felt it had to choose between “everyone has to broadcast their location to everyone within earshot” and “everyone has to pay gobs of money to private industry and trust some data broker with their location,” but the reasons why we aren’t going with internet-based tracking make some sense to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lldLM7"&gt;Most proponents of Remote ID technology, including Wing, like to explain that it’s merely a “license plate” for the skies, perhaps nothing more intrusive than you’d already have on your car. Here’s Wing on that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="iYfuif"&gt;This allows a drone to be identified as it flies over without necessarily sharing that drone’s complete flight path or flight history, and that information, which can be more sensitive, is not displayed to the public and only available to law enforcement if they have proper credentials and a reason to need that information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="aNEOAW"&gt;But the thing about license plates is, traditionally, you have to be within eyeshot to see them. You’d have to be physically following a car to track it. That’s not necessarily true of a broadcasting transmitter, and it’s potentially &lt;em&gt;far &lt;/em&gt;less true of a internet-based solution like the one Wing seems to wish the FAA had offered instead. Naturally, it depends on who owns the internet-based solution and how much you trust them and their security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrhLjd"&gt;Either way, it’s going to be a while before we find out how secure or vulnerable, how broad or narrow these Remote ID broadcasts are truly going to be. That’s because the FAA’s final rule doesn’t actually mandate what kind of broadcasting tech drones will be required to use: companies have the next year and half to figure that out, and they have to submit it to the FAA for approval. The FAA is also clear that broadcast Remote ID is just a first step, an “initial framework,” suggesting that internet-based Remote ID might still be an option in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
