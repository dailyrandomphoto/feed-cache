    <title>Leaked Surface Duo 2 photos reveal new triple camera system</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surface Duo 2.&lt;/em&gt; | Tech Rat (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PQJOndIdGk" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZHkkw1"&gt;Microsoft is readying a Surface Duo 2 for release later this year. Leaked images have revealed the dual-screen device will include a new triple camera system. The leaked images first appeared in a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8PQJOndIdGk"&gt;YouTube video last month&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/images-microsofts-upcoming-surface-duo-2-leak-revealing-triple-camera-setup?utm_source=wc_tw&amp;amp;utm_medium=tw_card&amp;amp;utm_content=86625&amp;amp;utm_campaign=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central &lt;/em&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; they’re legitimate. Microsoft is expected to launch its Surface Duo 2 device in September or October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="REaUu6"&gt;The camera system on the Surface Duo 2 appears to be the main significant hardware change on this device. It’s rumored to include a telephoto, ultrawide angle, and standard lens. The leaked photos show a bump at the rear of the device, just like many existing flagship Android phones. It also appears that Microsoft has moved its fingerprint reader into the power button on the Duo 2 and centered the USB-C port on the right-hand side.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mrWeUA1iyKNEZhoewoQVd7w4TSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22740413/surfaceduo2leak.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tech Rat (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PQJOndIdGk" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Duo 2 reportedly includes a triple camera system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XgE5JJ"&gt;The Surface Duo 2 is expected to have relatively minor design tweaks overall, with most of the significant changes appearing in the camera system and internal specs. Rumors suggest the Surface Duo 2 will include Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 processor, 5G support, and an NFC chip for contactless payments. Microsoft may even slightly increase the size of each display on the Surface Duo 2, with slightly thinner bezels and options for both black and white color variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAkMuw"&gt;Microsoft appears to be sticking with separate screens on the Surface Duo 2, instead of opting for a truly foldable screen like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt;. That means all eyes will be on how well Microsoft improves the software side of the Surface Duo 2. The original device has had a variety of software updates, but Android 11 still hasn’t appeared yet. That’s left the Surface Duo as a buggy device, with regular issues with multitasking and gestures, a screen turning off during book mode, and lockups using the fingerprint reader.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s new true wireless earbuds have a privacy-conscious ‘Whispering Mode’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f1DEwcUWwGaCaBTSDDiQEaGJp0c=/0x0:1724x1149/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69631996/LG_TONE_Free_FP8_Pearl_White_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s Tone Free FP8 wireless earbuds.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6JXuLj"&gt;LG’s &lt;a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/07/new-additions-to-lg-tone-free-lineup-deliver-enhanced-performance-greater-convenience/"&gt;new Tone Free FP true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; feature a “Whispering Mode” where you can hold the right earbud next to your mouth during calls to use it as a dedicated microphone. It’s a neat privacy-conscious feature for those moments when you don’t want to have to speak loudly enough for the sound to be picked up by the earbuds in your ears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myfucm"&gt;There are three new earbuds in the lineup — the FP5, FP8, and FP9 — and they share a lot of the same specs. All are noise cancelling, have three microphones per earbud, and have an IPX4 water resistance rating to withstand light splashes. Their earbud stems are 4.4mm shorter than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534509/lg-tone-free-fn7-true-wireless-earbuds-announced-anc-uv-case"&gt;LG’s previous models&lt;/a&gt;, and they have improved drivers and diaphragms which LG claims offers more bass without impacting clarity. Headphone Spatial Processing and 3D Sound Stage provides an audioexperience that surrounds the listener. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lVuIde8Ec7JohOQeiUAaVoEjh5U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22740343/LG_TONE_Free_FP9_Pearl_White.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The FP9 earbuds, whose case doubles as a wireless transmitter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Wgd5F"&gt;However, there are individual features exclusive to one or two of the headphones. The most interesting of these is reserved for the FP9 earbuds, whose case can double as a wireless transmitter to allow the earbuds to be used with non-Bluetooth devices. Using a USB-C to aux cable, the case can be plugged into anything from a games console to an in-flight entertainment system, removing the need to use a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20982261/airpods-in-flight-entertainment-bluetooth-adapter-twelvesouth-airfly-pro-review-price"&gt;separate Bluetooth adapter&lt;/a&gt;. It’s similar to what we saw from Bowers and Wilkins’ PI7 earbuds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395276/bowers-and-wilkins-pi7-pi5-true-wireless-earbuds-noise-cancelling-in-flight-entertainment-price"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zp7g7W"&gt;The FP8 and FP9 earbuds feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/3/20896563/lg-tone-plus-free-true-wireless-earbuds-features-uv-light-bacteria-hygiene-google-assistant"&gt;LG’s bacteria-killing UV tech&lt;/a&gt;, which the company says can kill 99.9 percent of the bacteria on the earbuds’ speaker mesh in five minutes to reduce the chance of inner ear infections. These two earbuds also have improved battery life compared to the FP5, and can run for 10 hours on a charge, or up to 24 hours when used with their charging case (the FP5 is rated for 8 and 22 hours, respectively). Only the FP8 model supports wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZDqK2"&gt;LG’s new true wireless earbuds will be available starting this month in “key markets” at a price that’s yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Good night’ or ‘bedtime’, Alexa routines now support multiple phrases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tKTddb5NHk1-zMi772sv7y8-GWE=/0x0:1520x1013/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69631936/alexa_custom_phrases.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alexa routines now support up to seven custom phrases.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fZqBCn"&gt;Alexa routines can now be triggered using multiple custom phrases making it easier for everyone in a household to initiate smart home automations without having to remember the exact wording (&lt;a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/alexa-routines-can-now-be-launched-with-multiple-phrases/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;AFTVnews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrNsB6"&gt;For example, instead of having to remember to say “Alexa, good night” to kick off a nighttime routine that locks the doors and shuts off the lights, you can now assign additional phrases like “Alexa, bedtime” or “Alexa, night night.” You can even add “Alexa, bonne nuit” to the same routine thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22088394/amazon-alexa-multilingual-support-italian-german-french-shopping-fire-tv"&gt;Amazon’s support for multilingual households&lt;/a&gt;. Up to seven custom phrases can be assigned to the same routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOF1yv"&gt;It’s a small but welcome change for smart homes built around Alexa. It follows a big week for Alexa, where we saw it get a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588961/alexa-voice-echo-male-female-celebrity-how-to-change"&gt;masculine voice option&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586033/amazon-alexa-widgets-featured-skill-api-developers-echo-show-screen"&gt;huge developer push&lt;/a&gt; to drive Alexa’s expansion beyond the &lt;a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2021/07/more-than-50-features-to-build-ambient-experiences?ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22350074%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD"&gt;more than 140,000 smart home devices&lt;/a&gt; that the ambient assistant currently controls.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Flight Simulator is an impressive Xbox Series X workout</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BYqfS8nLCLl2gqlIIxuJzD98ZMI=/110x0:1291x787/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69631857/apps.36297.13763447606987253.cdd9ae82_b2b3_40ef_a711_e5f137b50b22.ea3e204a_c28b_4506_b14b_4bcc8e03220f.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r5xfcU"&gt;Nothing has pushed my PC further than &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;. That might sound odd for a “game” that’s largely about flying around empty skies by yourself, but Asobo’s latest iteration of the classic franchise is technically groundbreaking and ambitious, with all manner of wizardry going on beyond the scenes to stream in accurate city data, real-time weather effects, and so on. I’ve still had a great time with it, but compared to most AAA games, &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; asks a lot more of your CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1id5Y"&gt;That’s why I was intrigued by the new version for Xbox Series consoles, which comes out on Game Pass tomorrow. In fact, it’s the first Microsoft game for Xbox Series consoles that won’t run natively on any Xbox One model at all, though an xCloud version is also coming to mobile and will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536418/microsoft-xbox-series-x-games-on-xbox-one-xcloud-streaming"&gt;eventually hit older Xbox consoles&lt;/a&gt; as well. I’ve been playing a preview build provided by Microsoft on my Series X for a few days, and as with my PC, I think it’s the strongest workout for the hardware so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jx7kGw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Microsoft Flight Simulator returned to the skies","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21347809/microsoft-flight-simulator-2020-preview-interview-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NKRTzB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is essentially the same proposition on Xbox as it is on PC, offering players the chance to pilot a variety of aircraft around a beautifully rendered version of our planet. The tutorials have been tweaked a little, with a series of shorter missions that should make it easier to get up to speed, and the various commands have been mapped to the Xbox controller in a straightforward, accessible way. You can make the flight model just as complex as the PC version if you want, although right now there aren’t a lot of Xbox-compatible flight stick options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vYttVG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator on the Xbox Series X looks absolutely stunning in 4K. It's a true graphical showcase for this next-gen console&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; full video: &lt;a href="https://t.co/e3MyKEuImC"&gt;https://t.co/e3MyKEuImC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;⬇️ preview &lt;a href="https://t.co/JR2MFK52Dm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JR2MFK52Dm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1419327063656439808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kHSc2I"&gt;On the Series X, &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; runs at 4K resolution and targets 30 frames per second. Overall, I got a more stable experience on the Series X than my own i5 6600K/GTX 1080 rig, which was impressive when I put it together five years ago but somewhat less so now. The frame rate isn’t perfectly smooth — you can drop below 30 when flying low in dense areas like downtown Manhattan, for example, and that’s noticeable. It helped that I played on an LG CX OLED TV, which is capable of variable refresh rates and means you don’t experience tearing or stuttering when the frame rate does fluctuate above or below 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoU6V1"&gt;Graphical settings are broadly comparable to what you’d get on a good gaming PC, if not quite at the top of the line. The game consistently looks stunning when you’re high in the air, and any seams in the experience are only really apparent when flying close to the ground. That tends to be more to do with how the photogrammetry streaming technology works — again, if you fly quickly into Manhattan or Shinjuku, not every skyscraper is always going to be loaded into memory at once, meaning some buildings might appear a little wobbly at first. I also noticed a few amusing glitches from time to time, like cars driving on the surface of the River Thames in London instead of on Tower Bridge directly above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GtKFk9"&gt;As for the Series S, my colleague Tom Warren has spent some time testing that version, and the results are impressive for a tiny $299 box. The game runs at 1080p with reduced graphical effects and draw distances, but as you’ll see from the video, it delivers a solid Flight Simulator experience and will be by far the cheapest way to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7RzTPd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQju16fUY70?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CtBiVc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; has improved a lot since its launch last year, with “world updates” that expand the more detailed photogrammetry data further across the globe. That’s all there in the Xbox version, too, including the most recent Nordics update that includes hand-rendered airports and points of interest across Scandinavia, Iceland, and Finland. (It’s also worth noting that the PC version is getting a further update this week that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558803/microsoft-flight-simulator-pc-performance-improvements-patch"&gt;Microsoft promises should dramatically improve performance&lt;/a&gt; across the board — stay tuned for how that works in practice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qz2MPU"&gt;If anything, the Xbox version can feel a little too close to the PC version at times, with an occasionally clunky cursor-driven interface. It’s a little conspicuous to have a graphic settings menu where the only option is to turn HDR on and off, for example. But it’s better to leave too much in than to cut too much out: what matters is that the flying experience is as good as it could be given the hardware on hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWPsy2"&gt;From what I’ve played of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; on the Xbox Series X, I don’t feel like Asobo has left much on the table. It’s still an incredible technical achievement, and one well worth checking out when it hits Game Pass tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon reportedly has a ‘key’ to thousands of apartment buildings in US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jnywrdyfhjY8CexEM2hDcSjW724=/0x0:1487x991/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69631825/kfb_lp_en_desktop_pg004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A promotional image for Amazon Key for Business.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="01dhHM"&gt;Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=18530497011"&gt;Key for Business&lt;/a&gt;, a system that allows its delivery drivers to gain access to apartment buildings without having to be buzzed in, has been installed in thousands of buildings across the US, according to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-amazoncom-inc-a322a1aa0b29a58b0cb2a287ba0bac6f"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company is reportedly pushing to get the system installed in more buildings, using a combination of free installations and $100 gift cards as incentives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8gzpX"&gt;The system is designed to make it easier for Amazon’s drivers to make deliveries to apartment buildings. Rather than having to be buzzed in by residents or a concierge, a driver can use the system to gain temporary access to lobbies via the Amazon Flex app. Then packages can be delivered directly to residents or safely left behind in a mail room or with a doorman. In a technical breakdown of the system &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/building-a-virtual-fob-with-amazon-key-for-business-and-aws-iot/#:~:text=post.-,Results,scheduled%20for%20the%20future.,-Summary"&gt;published in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon says in a pilot program the system increased the success of first time deliveries from 96 to around 98 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j3kxtr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Building managers reportedly don’t have to tell tenants about the system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VvA9yr"&gt;The technology arrived as a pilot in 2018 before getting an official launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18167425/amazon-key-garage-business-home-deliveries-prime-ces-2019#:~:text=Amazon-,Amazon%20is%20also%20launching%20Key,Key,-for%20Business"&gt;the following year&lt;/a&gt;. But unlike a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16538834/amazon-key-in-home-delivery-unlock-door-prime-cloud-cam-smart-lock"&gt;similar system&lt;/a&gt; from Amazon for homeowners to install in private properties, Key for Business is installed by building managers who reportedly aren’t under any obligation to tell their tenants when the system is in use. This raises potential security concerns for residents about an internet-connected entry device that gives drivers, vetted by Amazon, easy access to their buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZNtxb"&gt;Amazon is reportedly pushing hard to expand the number of buildings the system is installed in. According to the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;, it’s pitching Key for Business to building managers and partnering with locksmiths to offer installations, sometimes free of charge. A spokesperson from Amazon was not immediately available to respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and declined to confirm a total number of installations to &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBC29d"&gt;As well as making deliveries easier and potentially quicker, the system may give Amazon’s delivery drivers a competitive advantage over its rivals. Buildings are unlikely to install similar systems for multiple delivery companies, ultimately incentivizing their residents to use Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This YouTube channel is using AI to gloriously remaster classic game cutscenes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dTuHf0AOKlKVkX7HK_wVw2NDgy4=/234x0:2766x1688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69631065/yuna_dance_ffx.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tk4E9K"&gt;Twenty years ago, when photorealistic games were still just a faraway dream, companies like Square sent our imaginations soaring &lt;em&gt;before &lt;/em&gt;we played, with big-budget intros and cutscenes. Long before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/23/16176894/blizzard-overwatch-animated-short-rise-and-shine-mei-arctic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; normalized the practice&lt;/a&gt; of releasing Pixar-quality animated shorts for each new character, Blizzard’s &lt;em&gt;Diablo II &lt;/em&gt;and Capcom’s &lt;em&gt;Onimusha 3&lt;/em&gt; put us in the demon slaying mood with incredible mini-movies stretching to six minutes each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PV4Iv"&gt;But if you dare try watching these classics on a modern 4K TV or even a 1080p monitor, they’ll look like a pixelated mess. That’s where &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC33rC3GO1UZFAkMcCCwjyWg"&gt;a YouTube channel named Upscale&lt;/a&gt; and machine learning comes in — making them look nearly as good as they did on your old CRT. Or perhaps even better. It just depends how well the game’s art style works with the AI algorithms bringing it back to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2erHNs"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; intros, for instance, look incredible. I scanned around, and I’m willing to call these the definitive versions currently in existence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AfHVgB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OtMliCS80ZU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Rr0GNe"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QOxDW8RqFvc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2prPHn"&gt;You &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to check out the hair in &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;’s intro. It left me in awe, and the video includes a before-and-after comparison, too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lkmxy0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pg_FL37jn04?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vCN6Ts"&gt;Here’s the legendary six-minute &lt;em&gt;Onimusha 3&lt;/em&gt; opening cinematic at 4K 60 fps. It’s not perfect, but it’s the best I’ve ever seen it. More than good enough to share with people who need to understand this piece of gaming history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hHUsnQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FVo0l2ASMrY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lA02WA"&gt;And here’s 1999’s &lt;em&gt;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver &lt;/em&gt;in 8K. Can you believe this is a PS1 game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wRvNfV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wq-ObzoPjA0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OylN7w"&gt;Upscale can’t quite seem to nail &lt;em&gt;Chrono Cross&lt;/em&gt;, I’m afraid, but its second or third stab at &lt;em&gt;Chrono Trigger &lt;/em&gt;looks pretty amazing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gl2Kja"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KZvmvlCtbhM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="4Dxhlv"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/noximJJuF6w?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FHFmbk"&gt;And I’m not particularly fond of Upscale’s attempt at &lt;em&gt;Dirge of Cerberus&lt;/em&gt;. Thankfully a handful of other YouTube channels are also trying these machine learning techniques, and I think &lt;em&gt;The Gaming Restoration&lt;/em&gt; nailed it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ADEYzf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fTFQ14eTKuk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1sBdf"&gt;These enhancements are all made possible through a piece of software called Topaz Video Enhance AI, aka Topaz Gigapixel, and we’ve written a bit about it before — it’s the same generated adversarial network technique &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/18/18311287/ai-upscaling-algorithms-video-games-mods-modding-esrgan-gigapixel"&gt;some modders are using to upscale the graphics of playable games themselves&lt;/a&gt;, now applied to their cutscenes as well. For $299, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/18/18311287/ai-upscaling-algorithms-video-games-mods-modding-esrgan-gigapixel"&gt;the company will sell you an app&lt;/a&gt; that can spit out videos like these in a handful of hours, depending on your PC’s GPU, how long, and how high a resolution you need. I know, because I took it for a spin with a handful of anime music videos and game trailers myself, and was impressed just how easy it could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ay9jR"&gt;The important thing to know, though, is the images the computer spits out aren’t necessarily “truth” — it can invent details that aren’t there, or smudge ones that are, in the sometimes-inappropriate pursuit of clarity. I found 4K videos would sometimes look better than 8K, and you really have to pick the right algorithm for the content you’re trying to upscale and compare quick previews before you commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqFTID"&gt;Here’s two different algorithms trying to enhance the same scene in &lt;em&gt;Gundam Wing, &lt;/em&gt;so you can see what I mean. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L6eMLO05cC98bgmnxLLgWcUnJIw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22739857/gundam_wing_ahq.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Topaz’s “high quality” setting gets rid of the intentional blur / bokeh and flattens the image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aC0WAAIZUvTNf1MAmMOjMNYSQsc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22739856/gundam_wing_aaa.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A lower quality “aliased and moire” setting does a more faithful job at the expense of clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mT5zPT"&gt;To be clear, these are &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; enhanced images, but one is arguably wrong: this is an ethereal, dream-like sequence where the background is supposed to be soft and blurred, not sharp and flat. Of course, the algorithm doesn’t know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qVel0"&gt;If you’d like to see a couple examples where I tried to enhance some old content myself, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/-SRnlI4Mmqc"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/PAjkqRNc00k"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and make sure to change your YouTube quality setting. &lt;em&gt;ExtremeTech&lt;/em&gt;’s Joel Hruska also has a great series &lt;a href="https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/314653-remastering-deep-space-nine"&gt;about trying to remaster &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUS5xe"&gt;Truth be told, I’ve hesitated to write about Upscale for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, because I figured lawyers would shut it down any minute, or Upscale’s creators would get bored and stop posting. But I’ve been waiting and watching for nearly a year, and it hasn’t gone away yet. If you’re a big video game industry executive, would you perhaps consider &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;firing ze copyright missiles? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODzICC"&gt;At least until you’ve done a better job of remastering these cutscenes yourself, I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MLB will try encrypted transmitters and bone conduction to stop sign stealing </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BdtFXHcxZOCY5gqGSZtVty2akCw=/26x0:725x466/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69630711/mlb_test_bone_conduction.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2mFDhG"&gt;Baseball has a sign stealing problem — or at least, a technological one, seeing how reading another team’s pitches &lt;a href="https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2019/11/12/20961911/houston-astros-sign-stealing-cameras-mlb"&gt;is technically legal&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2017/9/5/16257450/red-sox-apple-watch-cheating-yankees-stealing-signs"&gt;using Apple Watches&lt;/a&gt; or telephoto cameras and then &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros_sign_stealing_scandal"&gt;suspiciously banging on trash cans&lt;/a&gt; is very much not. But soon the MLB may try fighting fire with fire: on August 3rd, it plans to begin testing an encrypted wireless communication device that replaces the traditional flash of fingers with button taps, &lt;a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/31869009/mlb-test-electronic-device-catchers-give-signals-pitchers"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;ESPN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NTB0m"&gt;The device, from a startup called PitchCom, will be tested in the Low-A West minor league first. As you’d expect from something that’s relaying extremely basic signals, it’s not a particularly complicated piece of kit: one wristband transmitter for the catcher with nine buttons to signal “desired pitch and location,” which sends an encrypted audio signal to receivers that can squeeze into a pitcher’s cap and a catcher’s helmet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vthbrD"&gt;The receivers use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/24/13383616/bone-conduction-headphones-best-pair-aftershokz"&gt;bone-conduction technology&lt;/a&gt;, so they don’t necessarily need to be up against an ear, and might theoretically be harder to eavesdrop on. (Bone conduction stimulates bones in your head instead of emitting audible sound.) That said, it sounds like introducing the tech may come with other risks. Here’s a list of restrictions as cited by &lt;em&gt;ESPN&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YJ4Ujf"&gt;Players found to be wearing a receiver while batting will be ejected; only the active catcher, and no other players or coaches, is allowed to use the transmitter; a backup transmitter is provided, but it must remain in the carrying case during games; and if players and coaches need to confer because of an issue with the device, they can notify the umpires and not be charged a mound visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QbBfcJ"&gt;MLB seems optimistic about the idea so far. “The PitchCom devices were tested in side-sessions during major league spring training, and the feedback from players, coaches, and front office staff was extremely positive,” reads part of an internal memo &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/minor-league-to-experiment-with-electronic-catchers-signals/2021/07/23/5ebd28b0-ec0e-11eb-a2ba-3be31d349258_story.html"&gt;obtained by the Associated Press.&lt;/a&gt; “Based on those preliminary results, we are optimistic that these devices have the potential to be a viable long-term option to reduce sign-stealing risk and improve pace of play, particularly with runners on second base.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/doWN6HtHnVKZH0Cl6LATjBsbNmM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22739716/crayons_fcc_promystic.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: FCC OET&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qw3ScG"&gt;I wasn’t able to find records for a startup named PitchCom, but one of its founders, a Craig Filicetti, appears to be the same one &lt;a href="https://promystic.com/"&gt;who sells “ProMystic” wireless tech for magicians and mentalists&lt;/a&gt;, such as a box of crayons that can wirelessly send a signal corresponding to the crayon that someone removes. ESPN cites Craig Filicetti and John Hankins as co-owners of Pitchcom, and two men by those names formed a “JHCF, LLC” in November 2020. Both ProMystic and JHCF have a Scottsdale, Arizona address in common.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pentagon says DJI drones still pose a threat, disavowing its own earlier report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T-VIqtyzzEElicY--QTI7jQBVeY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69375023/vpavic_042029_4003_0162.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VViqYH"&gt;After months of government bans on DJI drones, with lawmakers questioning whether the company was sending information to the Chinese government, the Pentagon has admitted that the drones being used might actually be safe (&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/556370-pentagon-report-clears-use-of-drones-made-by-top-chinese-manufacturer?rl=1"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), with a report saying that &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-technology-government-and-politics-business-5854cf8b5eccd03f85d5eba2aef10a22"&gt;two “Government Edition” DJI drones&lt;/a&gt; are “recommended for use by government entities.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cC19E5"&gt;However, on July 23rd, the Department of Defense &lt;a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2706082/department-statement-on-dji-systems/"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; on the report, saying that its release was “unauthorized,” and reiterating its position that DJI’s drones “pose potential threats to national security.” (&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pentagon-says-reports-da-jiang-innovations-systems-approved-by-us-government-are-2021-07-23/"&gt;via Reuters&lt;/a&gt;) It says that its policy around the drones is unchanged, and that there is an investigation into how the “inaccurate and uncoordinated” report was released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2I7cC"&gt;Last year, the Department of the Interior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113533/us-interior-department-chinese-drone-ban-grounding-security-dji"&gt;grounded all its drones&lt;/a&gt;, citing concerns of potential spying by the Chinese government, and the Department of Commerce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188789/dji-ban-commerce-entity-list-drone-china-transaction-blocked"&gt;put DJI on its Entity List&lt;/a&gt; after the company allegedly provided the Chinese government with surveillance tech for its Uyghur Muslim detention camps. That second claim wasn’t addressed at all by the Pentagon’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Qo7cn4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The report isn’t necessarily an all-clear for DJI’s relationship with the government&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WZK8gA"&gt;But, according to &lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt;, the Pentagon’s (unauthorized) report said that it didn’t find any malicious code when it analyzed two drone models. The Department of Homeland Security previously &lt;a href="https://www.auvsi.org/sites/default/files/DHS%20report.pdf"&gt;ran tests on the DJI Mavic Pro and Matrice 600 Pro in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and didn’t find evidence of data being sent places it shouldn’t, and a new administration has seemingly come to a similar conclusion today. Another report &lt;a href="https://www.precisionhawk.com/blog/unmanned-aerial-intelligence-technology-center-of-excellence-conducts-risk-assessment-of-drone-technology"&gt;that looked at three DJI drones&lt;/a&gt;, including the Government Editions of the aforementioned drones, came to the same conclusion in early 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nApNCS"&gt;The Pentagon’s report wasn’t an all-clear for DJI’s relationship with the US government, even before the DOD’s statement on July 23rd. As of &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/06/01/2021-11304/addition-of-entities-revision-of-entries-and-removal-of-entity-from-the-entity-list-and-revision-of"&gt;June 1st’s revision&lt;/a&gt;, DJI is still on the Entity List, which prevents US companies from selling any of their technology for DJI to use, and the Pentagon’s report comes as Congress is &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-technology-government-and-politics-business-5854cf8b5eccd03f85d5eba2aef10a22"&gt;considering a law&lt;/a&gt; that would ban the government from buying Chinese drones for five whole years, starting in 2023. They’d have to rely on other approved drones from companies in the US and France instead; as restrictions have been placed on DJI, others have made drones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21376917/drone-us-government-approved-dod-diu-uas-blue-china"&gt;with hefty price tags&lt;/a&gt; to fill the government’s needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8EmAFe"&gt;We’re also talking about pretty old DJI drones that have gotten the all-clear; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/4/13508560/dji-mavic-pro-drone-review-price"&gt;we reviewed the consumer model of DJI’s Mavic Pro in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and the company’s offered many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22384692/dji-mavic-air-2s-drone-2021-review"&gt;far more competitive models&lt;/a&gt; since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSFRAr"&gt;None of the government scrutiny keeps you from buying a DJI drone. Despite all the accusations, DJI has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22193660/us-government-dji-drone-entity-list-export-ban-effects"&gt;still been able&lt;/a&gt; to continue creating and selling its consumer products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEQVE7"&gt;Lawmakers are still trying to decide what to do about other Chinese products perceived to be a security risk as well: while the Department of Defense &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454292/xiaomi-blacklist-removed-communist-chinese-military-company"&gt;has rolled back the designation&lt;/a&gt; of Xiaomi as a “Communist Chinese military company”, the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274575/huawei-fcc-lawsuit-national-security-ban-broadband-rollout"&gt;seems like it still intends&lt;/a&gt; to keep a ban on Huawei products from being used in US infrastructure. The government has been so worried about equipment from Chinese companies like ZTE and Huawei acting as part of its network infrastructure that it’s even considered removing the parts already in use. Last September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21422939/huawei-zte-us-phone-networks-fcc-congress-reimbursement-cost"&gt;the FCC estimated it would cost $1.8 billion&lt;/a&gt; to “rip and replace” Chinese telecom equipment currently embedded in US networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWK12e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 25th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to reflect that the Department of Defense has released a statement, calling the release of the Pentagon’s original report “unauthorized” and “inaccurate.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Doctor Who’s 13th season is a single story, and here’s the first trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5GLFxH0x7VMAE82glz255hmowPg=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69630360/doctor_who_season_13.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PB0vgO"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who &lt;/em&gt;to do something it hasn’t done in the modern era — dedicate an entire season to a single story. That’s the word from showrunner Chris Chibnall in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzDthngLyDU"&gt;a new &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; panel&lt;/a&gt; at the online-only San Diego Comic-Con today. Oh, and did I mention we’re getting our very first fleeting glimpse at Series 13 in a teaser trailer? Hit that video play button above to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOFKlP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.doctorwho.tv/news/?article=doctor-who-series-thirteen-begins-filming"&gt;We’d learned last year&lt;/a&gt; that the new season would just be eight episodes long, but Chibnall says it pushed the BBC to go big: “The big thing that we’re going to be doing this year is it’s all one story, so every episode is one chapter in a bigger story,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCXO6J"&gt;More:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3oFNZN"&gt;There were two ways you could go: we’re just going to do lots of tiny episodes in one room with no monsters, or we could throw down the gauntlet and go “we’re going to do the biggest story we’ve ever done, we’re going to go all kinds of different places, we’re going to have all kinds of characters and monsters, and it’s all going to be part of a bigger whole.” I think it’s definitely the most ambitious thing we’ve done since we’ve been on the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UolBjx"&gt;While many previous seasons of &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who &lt;/em&gt;slowly introduce a mystery and then resolve it by the end (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Wolf"&gt;“Bad Wolf,”&lt;/a&gt; the crack in the wall, and so on), this sounds a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrcEPz"&gt;Want to watch the panel yourself? It’s free and features stars Jodie Whittaker (The Doctor), Mandip Gill (Yas), and new cast members John Bishop and Jacob Anderson too! (Anderson played Grey Worm in &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones, &lt;/em&gt;if you’re wondering why he looks familiar.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1mXSA"&gt;Here you go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hSoDcf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QzDthngLyDU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4mYt5Y"&gt;Don’t expect any spoilers, though: “We pick it up with the Doctor and Yas who’ve been traveling together for some time, we come and meet them mid-adventure, and they stumble across some man named Dan Lewis, that’s all I’m going to tell you,” says Chibnall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="804gKp"&gt;The show actually teased Dan Lewis, Bishop’s character, during the holiday special on January 1st:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1LwZvy"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hlNIbyS3bsA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MZ2oHl"&gt;Whittaker’s only hint for Whovians: she’s most looking forward to “some incredible interactions with old monsters,” too. We don’t have a release date for Series 13 yet, just that it’ll be out later this year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750546/hbo-max-doctor-who-exclusive-streaming-the-office-luther-top-gear-att-warnermedia"&gt;likely exclusively streaming on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; and BBC America in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Banned brand Aukey is still selling earbuds on Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UjAJLvtD_xo9pL848lAjvWoyGXQ=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69630141/aukey_key_series.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zMGP3E"&gt;When Amazon started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567530/amazon-choetech-removed-pulled-aukey-mpow"&gt;cracking down on mobile electronics companies&lt;/a&gt; with shady reviewer programs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"&gt;Aukey and Mpow were the first to get whacked&lt;/a&gt; — and yet Aukey is still selling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=key+series&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss"&gt;at least three sets of wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; at the giant online retailer, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9cJh0"&gt;Two weeks ago, I pointed out to Amazon PR that both Aukey and Mpow had seemingly found a way around their bans. Mpow had an “xMpow MFly” set of wireless Bluetooth headphones, and Aukey was selling several different sets under its “Key Series” sub-brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOj7u7"&gt;I’ve been watching their product pages ever since, and today I noticed that &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-xMpow-Bluetooth-Earphones-Headphones/dp/B0924DCSYS?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=7&amp;amp;imprToken=30bd6f5a-5100-ccc2-9ce&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22331571%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the xMpow MFly has disappeared&lt;/a&gt;. But Key Series is alive and well with three products. Aukey appears to be paying Amazon extra to promote them in search, too, as you can see from their “sponsored” disclaimers:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6lwWvAlLczXmTI2wDyT2iCQLKCQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22739467/key_series_sponsored.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aukey is paying to promote two of its wireless earbud sets at Amazon despite being thrown off the platform two months ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c9S9R1"&gt;There’s no question that these are Aukey products. You can see the Aukey brand printed on top of the charging case for those EP-N7 earbuds above. Aukey introduced the brand &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aukey-expands-into-premium-audio-with-key-series-300859685.html"&gt;with an official press release&lt;/a&gt; in May 2019, and at least two Key Series products, including these T-10 wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AukeyOfficial/search?query=key%20series"&gt;have YouTube videos on the Aukey channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzuYzS"&gt;It’s vaguely possible that Key Series was spun off, or that these Amazon listings are run by a reseller, though. The Key Series website contains no official references to Aukey, but it does have one mention of a Primtech Limited based in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eJAncC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon-first gadget brands Aukey and Mpow are suddenly, suspiciously disappearing","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"},{"title":"Amazon confirms it removed RavPower, a popular phone battery and charger brand ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536976/amazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon"},{"title":"Another Amazon-first gadget brand has suspiciously vanished: Choetech","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567530/amazon-choetech-removed-pulled-aukey-mpow"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kArOcy"&gt;But it also seems that Key Series had additional products on Amazon that did disappear. Similar to other electronics companies that were booted from Amazon, there are several blank spots &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/97D0F472-35CA-4D44-AA5B-6C48E9EA6459"&gt;on the brand’s Amazon seller page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQxzYp"&gt;Related: I’m still collecting photos of your inserts from Amazon packages, whether they’re suspicious or not. They’ll help me with a future story. If you haven’t already, could you send me pictures of them at sean@theverge.com? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8IojLe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today is Amazon Prime Day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Humble request: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you get any insert cards in your new purchases (they don't need to look this suspicious), please send me photos of them at sean@theverge.com for a story. &lt;a href="https://t.co/7337ookNPp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7337ookNPp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1407416198623494144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
