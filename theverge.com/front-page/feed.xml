    <title>PS4 and PS5 owners can get Final Fantasy VII Remake for free with PlayStation Plus in March</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hTd6Ck"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;, the modern retelling of the 1997 PlayStation classic, will &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/02/26/playstation-plus-games-for-march-final-fantasy-vii-remake-maquette-remnant-from-the-ashes-and-farpoint/#sf243430485"&gt;be free for PlayStation Plus subscribers beginning March 2nd&lt;/a&gt;. It is important to note the PS4 version of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; available for users with an active PS Plus subscription &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;be able to receive a PS5 digital version of the game, which was announced yesterday at Sony’s State of Play event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kr6KYr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; launched last April exclusively on PlayStation 4 and serves as the first of an unknown number of entries in an episodic retelling of the original game. The game is also backward compatible on PlayStation 5, but yesterday's State of Play confirmed that a next-gen version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;the game will release on June 10th&lt;/a&gt; and will take full advantage of Sony’s next-gen console, with faster loading times, different graphical mode options, and a new episode focusing on the character Yuffie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2FBM61"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake, Maquette, Remnant: From the Ashes and Farpoint are your PlayStation Plus games for March: &lt;a href="https://t.co/tQFJNoURI9"&gt;https://t.co/tQFJNoURI9&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/cPOmwsKxHN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cPOmwsKxHN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PlayStation (@PlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1365285827580993547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>LG Stylo 6 review: great stylus features, sketchy performance</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Its built-in stylus is useful and enjoyable, but the Stylo 6 is too slow to recommend&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="h4S2g0"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733319724591682516" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG Stylo 6&lt;/a&gt; is a sub-$300 phone with a built-in stylus, which puts it in exclusive company: the $299 Motorola Moto G Stylus is more or less its only direct competition. For its $270 price, the Stylo 6 offers good battery performance; a big, bright screen; and the handy pen-derived features that stylus life offers. But as much fun as I had doodling on its generously sized screen, it’s just too slow to recommend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hL5PdO"&gt;That’s a shame because I genuinely enjoyed aspects of using this phone. I couldn’t seem to drain the battery below the 30 percent mark even on a day of heavy usage, and I experienced real enjoyment texting my spouse a precisely drawn, animated doodle of a farting butt. Photos look good on its vivid, wide 6.8-inch screen, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover while rewatching &lt;em&gt;Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt; (don’t worry, I talk to my therapist about this) that it has stereo speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUhKMV"&gt;Unfortunately, that enjoyment was overshadowed every time the phone took an extra beat to switch between apps, open Twitter, load my Instagram feed, or start my Google Maps navigation. It’s not unusably slow, but it is quite noticeably slow. If you have the patience of a small insect like I do, there’s a fine line between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UqXxuN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10361691"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BDKppqf5SpMvj0nAigrnc53mNuo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320967/ajohnson_210222_4437__004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stylo offers a large 6.8-inch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QjkepT"&gt;LG Stylo 6 screen and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8Uz8fQ"&gt;The Stylo 6 is a large phone, as you’d expect a phone with a stylus to be. It offers a 6.8-inch 1080p LCD with a standard 60Hz refresh rate and modest bezels. Its dimensions are similar to the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, also a large phone, except that it’s slightly taller. The screen itself is plenty bright and vivid, and the aforementioned stereo speakers make watching videos that bit nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNK9sC"&gt;I found the phone overall too big to use comfortably one-handed, and it felt awkward in even large coat pockets. That’s beside the point, though, if you’re considering the Stylo then you probably already know you want a large phone, so to each their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZOWPT"&gt;The Stylo 6 offers a Mediatek Helio P35 chipset and 3GB of RAM. Herein lies the Stylo 6’s troubles: this processor and RAM combination just doesn’t offer enough power for this phone. I noticed stuttering often as I scrolled through media-rich screens on Twitter and Instagram. Ditto the previously mentioned slowness opening and switching between apps, and the camera suffers from laggy processing speeds, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="y6tvY0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not unusably slow, but it is quite noticeably slow&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ob9G3z"&gt;I sometimes tapped the screen, then wondered if the phone had recognized the tap a split second before it opened an app or whatever I was trying to do. Conversely, I’d tap the screen too lightly or quickly and wait an extra second before realizing it hadn’t registered, just because I’d gotten used to giving the phone a little extra time to do everything. This would all be more forgivable (if still frustrating) on a $200 phone, but depending where you get the Stylo 6, it’s pushing closer to $300 and should really do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2sAoc"&gt;If there’s a bright spot to the phone’s processing woes, it’s that battery life is great — possibly as a side effect. The Stylo 6 has a 4,000mAh battery, and after a typical day with two-plus hours of screen-on time, I was usually down to only 70 percent. I was sure a day of heavier use with Google Maps navigation, Spotify, and more social media scrolling than usual would challenge it, but nope. I didn’t even drain it enough for a low battery warning before plugging it in at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8IYJSw"&gt;There’s just one configuration offered with 64GB of built-in storage, which isn’t great, but it’s expandable by way of microSD. It ships with Android 10 and, unfortunately, a lot of preloaded apps and games that you probably don’t want. LG isn’t known for a generous upgrade schedule so it’s very unlikely the Stylo 6 will see an Android 11 update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vRcl5BKl_rXx6u_nliCoGGMhhlE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320964/ajohnson_210222_4437__001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Popping out the stylus brings up some shortcuts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aJgWhZ"&gt;LG Stylo 6 stylus features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rkox7W"&gt;Of course, the stylus features are a big (sorry) draw here. The stylus is tucked away and spring-loaded into the lower-right corner of the device, and it activates a set of shortcuts when it’s removed. You can take a quick note, grab a screenshot or a GIF of whatever’s on your screen, and mark it up with notes, or draw something immature to text to your partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XdqUY1ak7gao0vM5Lb1VW1i4_AY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328590/IMG_20210225_092209.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can do useful, productive things with a stylus, but you can do this, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NzV0Qp"&gt;Despite Samsung’s Galaxy Note being the de facto stylus phone, LG has been making phones with styluses for ages, and it shows with little UI touches like automatically toggling off gesture navigation when you start a note so that you don’t accidentally swipe out of it. You won’t find advanced features like the (much more expensive) Galaxy Note series offers here such as handwriting-to-text conversion or the ability to use the stylus as a remote control. Basically though, it does all of the things you’d expect it to do, and these features work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLVOBQ"&gt;I was surprised by how much I enjoyed having the stylus available. It’s much easier to draw or write silly notes on images with the pen rather than your finger, which I had basically given up on doing because they always look terrible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qJM5e"&gt;The ability to also jot down a quick note without even turning the screen on is something I really appreciated. I feel like I’m always fumbling to unlock my phone, find the notes app, and open a new note just to type out something quick like an email address or a song title. None of this is unique compared to a Galaxy Note, of course, but the Stylo 6 has a set of genuinely useful features that aren’t very common, especially at this price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vLKC-lmsKjADAsgqK63vIZ9GrSs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320968/ajohnson_210222_4437__005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stylo 6 features standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras, plus a depth sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="P1fCne"&gt;LG Stylo 6 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="cjD45v"&gt;The Stylo includes a 13-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, a 5-megapixel depth sensor, and a 13-megapixel selfie camera. That’s not a lot of resolution to work with, but it’s enough to allow the Stylo to take decent-quality images in good light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjHUA9"&gt;White balance occasionally leans a little too magenta or too green, which sometimes gave an effect I liked — kind of a nostalgic film-like quality. At other times, images just looked too cool and washed out. I like how the Stylo handles high-contrast scenes; the HDR effect doesn’t look too strong. Your preview image will look overly dark, but an HDR icon on the screen indicates that the final image will look much more balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mwvw8"&gt;Images in low light or moderate indoor lighting look okay for social media but show a lot of smeared detail if you look closely. The ultrawide lens is somewhat limited by its low-res sensor. Even in bright daylight shots details look smoothed over, and it’s just not up to low light photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UfnwHC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10361491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5cDMaZ"&gt;The camera is also a victim of the phone’s underpowered processor, particularly in portrait mode. The live preview is quite laggy, which gets worse once you push the shutter and wait for the phone to process the image. This can take as long as six seconds, during which you’re unable to take another image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1iNah"&gt;It’s hard to know if you got the right frame of your subject, and it’s a frustrating experience trying to photograph a subject that’s moving even just a little bit because you can’t “spray and pray.” The camera keeps shutter speeds relatively low, too, so blurry subjects can be a problem. By sheer luck I got a portrait mode photo of my cat mid-yawn, but I wouldn’t count on being able to do that again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfLINq"&gt;I captured a few images with the Stylo that I really like, but I felt like it was more in spite of the camera rather than because of it. The images this phone captures will look okay on Instagram and Facebook, but overall, the Stylo’s camera capabilities lag behind most other devices at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VhETtn7zE5XDblbQ0DDcTTKR-ME=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320965/ajohnson_210222_4437__002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stylo 6 offers a lot of likable stylus-based features, but it’s ultimately too slow to recommend.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="F0GltV"&gt;The Stylo 6 has a few good things going for it: an affordable price, built-in stylus, big screen, and great battery life. But factoring in its shortcomings, namely an underpowered processor, it’s not a device I can easily recommend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sgRTD8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even around its $270 price, there are many other more capable options&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="neYcAs"&gt;Even around its $270 price, there are many other more capable options. The $300 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; offers a better camera and processor. The 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Motorola Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt; includes a massive battery and better processor performance for $200. Neither of those comes with a stylus, of course, but I don’t think the Stylo 6 is even your best bet for an inexpensive phone with a stylus: for just a little more, the 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218732/motorola-moto-g-stylus-power-play-2021-one-5g-ace-specs-price-release-date-budget"&gt;Moto G Stylus&lt;/a&gt; offers better performance and an upgraded camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCkXdH"&gt;If speed isn’t a concern, a stylus is a must-have, and the price is right, I think you can live a reasonably happy life with this phone. Maybe my patience is just too thin, and a more enlightened person can coexist peacefully with it. The rest of us would do best to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Security researcher recommends against LastPass after detailing 7 trackers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sugEk3HY0X1rJt3O87VjM9W47E0=/0x0:1395x930/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68878964/msedge_qX48b5uD4r.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LastPass&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SjjrIA"&gt;A security researcher is recommending against LastPass password manager after detailing seven trackers found in the Android app, &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/25/lastpass_android_trackers_found/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Register &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Although there is no suggestion that the trackers, which were analyzed by researcher &lt;a href="https://www.kuketz-blog.de/lastpass-android-drittanbieter-ueberwachen-jeden-schritt/"&gt;Mike Kuketz&lt;/a&gt;, are transferring a user’s actual passwords or usernames, Kuketz says their presence is bad practice for a security-critical app handling such sensitive information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zh6AuU"&gt;Responding to the report, a spokesperson from LastPass says the company gathers limited data “about how LastPass is used” to help it “improve and optimize the product.” Importantly, LastPass tells &lt;em&gt;The Register &lt;/em&gt;that “no sensitive personally identifiable user data or vault activity could be passed through these trackers,” and users can opt out of the analytics in the Privacy section of the Advanced Settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zbrjW5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Users can opt out in the advanced settings menu&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXLcXg"&gt;LastPass’s trackers include four from Google which handle analytics and crash reporting, as well as one from a company called Segment, which reportedly gathers data for marketing teams. Kuketz analyzed the data being transmitted and found it included information about the smartphone’s make and model, as well as information about whether a user has biometric security enabled. Even if the data transmitted isn’t personally identifiable, just integrating this third-party code in the first place introduces the potential for security vulnerabilities, according to Kuketz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wteBlt"&gt;“If you actually use LastPass, I recommend changing the password manager,” wrote Kuketz (via machine translation). “There are solutions that do not permanently send data to third parties and record user behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLor7b"&gt;LastPass isn’t the only password manager to include trackers like this, but it appears to have more than many popular competitors. Free alternative Bitwarden has just two &lt;a href="https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.x8bit.bitwarden/latest/"&gt;according to Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.siber.roboform/latest/"&gt;RoboForm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.dashlane/latest/"&gt;Dashlane&lt;/a&gt; have four, and &lt;a href="https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.agilebits.onepassword/latest/"&gt;1Password &lt;/a&gt;has none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vH2wIl"&gt;The report comes on the heels of LastPass’s announcement to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;severely limit functionality in its free tier&lt;/a&gt;. While free users are currently able to store an unlimited number of passwords across devices without limitation, soon they’ll have to pick one category of devices to view and manage their passwords on — “Mobile” or “Computer” — unless they want to pay for the service. The changes will come into effect on March 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOtWUQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FQUbh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pn0Kfl"&gt;Nvidia has started to roll out support for Resizable BAR, a feature of PCI Express that can boost frame rates in certain games by up to 10 percent. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;new RTX 3060 graphics card&lt;/a&gt; is the first to include Resizable BAR, which allows certain CPUs to access the full graphics frame buffer, instead of being limited to reading just 256MB blocks. Support for other 30-series GPUs will be available in late March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MeMfbt"&gt;You’ll need the right CPU, motherboard, and graphics card to utilize this new feature, and Nvidia is working with both AMD and Intel to provide chipset support. AMD’s Zen 3 CPUs are supported, alongside Intel’s 10th Gen processors and the company’s upcoming 11th Gen S chips.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hmg_B8csTEdoeAD4meLSt5UmpQs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330488/ezgif.com_gif_maker.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s Resizable BAR support gives CPUs access to the full graphics frame buffer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="08f84e"&gt;Much like AMD’s Smart Access Memory, Resizable BAR on Nvidia GPUs can boost frame rates in certain games by up to 10 percent. The boost is really game dependent, and resolution can also impact how much performance will increase. “In our testing, we’ve found some titles benefit from a few percent, up to 10 percent,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fgeforce-rtx-30-series-resizable-bar-support%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F26%2F22302679%2Fnvidia-rtx-3060-resizable-bar-support-30-series-gpus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;says Nvidia&lt;/a&gt;. “However, there are also titles that see a decrease in performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrtJQ7"&gt;Nvidia is pre-testing titles and using special game profiles to enable Resizable BAR only where the performance increases. The following games are currently supported:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="sqrpSg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pFOxuZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fvtgsl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zaVxD7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vDgLf1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YY9tGW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="enjyF7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pELBqe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="GqaAwb"&gt;Additional games will be supported in late March, when Nvidia launches VIOS updates for the rest of its 30-series GPUs. Nvidia will supply VBIOS updates for all Founders Edition 30-series cards, and board partners will also release their own updates. You’ll also need a motherboard update that includes the necessary CPU support, and Nvidia says Asus, Asrock, Colorful, Evga, Gigabyte, and MSI have all started supporting Resizable BAR on select motherboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O8J76S"&gt;Resizable BAR support on the AMD side has been tested widely, and &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/article/2178-amd-smart-access-memory/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechSpot &lt;/em&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that some games making use of Smart Access Memory could see nearly a 20 percent boost at 1440p and 4K.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple forced to add iPhone and MacBook repairability scores to comply with French law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TkRQKsXpTE9l4N2Ea9NM6Wo3i1U=/0x0:1224x816/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68878727/msedge_fQb0Uhm8bF.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The repairability score can be seen on the lower right of the product page.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.apple.com/fr/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-12-pro/%C3%A9cran-de-6,1-pouces-128go-bleu-pacifique" target="_blank"&gt;Apple.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qPAqwf"&gt;Apple has added iPhone and MacBook repairability scores to its online store in France to comply with a new French law that came into effect this year. &lt;a href="https://www.macg.co/aapl/2021/02/apple-affiche-lindice-de-reparabilite-des-iphone-et-des-mac-119889"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacGeneration&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the rating takes into account features like how easily a device can be disassembled and the availability of repair manuals and spare parts. Links to each product’s final score, with details for how they were calculated, are available on &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/fr-fr/circular-economy-repairability-indices"&gt;this support page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAW5UV"&gt;The ratings for Apple’s products vary between products and generations. Its iPhone 12 lineup all have scores of six out of 10 for example, while the previous year’s iPhone 11s are rated lower at between 4.5 and 4.6. The improvement, according to the detailed scoring assessment, is due to the newer iPhones being easier to dismantle than the previous year’s models, and spare parts being cheaper compared to the cost of the phone itself. There’s less of a spread between the company’s different MacBook models, whose scores range from 5.6 to 7.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8x8bDNAE_3zqwEYvB6zKupYQhJw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330472/msedge_ZX88h9uN5a.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ffr%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-air&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F26%2F22302664%2Fapple-france-repairability-scores-index-law-right-to-repair" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;Apple.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scores are also shown for MacBooks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hlNiVA"&gt;The repairability scores are required by a new French law which came into effect on January 1st with new anti-waste legislation. A &lt;a href="https://www.indicereparabilite.fr/"&gt;website cataloging scores across different manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; notes that last year only 40 percent of France’s electrical devices were repaired after they broke down. The government aims increase this to 60 percent within five years by using the scores to educate consumers and pressure manufacturers to make improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9d5qP0"&gt;It’s not a perfect system. &lt;a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20210211-france-launches-worlds-first-repair-index-for-smartphones-laptops-consumer-products-environment-waste-durability-europe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Radio France Internationale&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that manufacturers calculate their own scores (albeit based on strict guidelines), and they can gain easy points with simple measures like giving more information about software updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ue0d3n"&gt;At least one manufacturer has already made a change in response to the law. A &lt;a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2021/02/01/droit-a-la-reparation-des-appareils-electroniques-premiers-succes-pour-l-indice-de-reparabilite_6068400_4408996.html"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Le Monde&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes that Samsung offered an online repair guide for its Galaxy S21 Plus, in an apparent attempt to boost its repairability score compared to the previous year’s model. The EU has used a similar initiative in the past to encourage energy efficiency, where &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_energy_label#:~:text=The%20energy%20efficiency%20of%20the,they%20choose%20between%20various%20models."&gt;labels&lt;/a&gt; have offered simple information about the energy consumption of household products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGKLo0"&gt;France’s new law is still in its early stages, and it won’t be until 2022 that companies will begin facing fines for failing to comply. But there are already hopes that the initiative — which currently covers smartphones, laptops, TVs, washing machines and lawnmowers — might be expanded to more product categories in the future. And with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719701/european-parliament-right-to-repair-resolution-hardware-eu-commission-2021"&gt;European Parliament voting in favor of right to repair rules last year&lt;/a&gt;, there are hopes similar initiatives might be rolled out across the continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQddgX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony will reportedly enable PS5 SSD expansion this summer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9QJP6xncFnanqwVgFwcojpZknH4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68878635/vpavic_4278_20201030_0041.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="znT5vv"&gt;Sony will allow the PlayStation 5 to make use of expanded SSD storage from this summer, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/sony-to-open-playstation-5-for-storage-upgrades-in-summer"&gt;report in Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. The functionality is said to be coming in a firmware update that will activate the PS5’s M.2 expansion slot, which is currently disabled. Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551165/sony-ps5-playstation-5-no-m2-ssd-expansion-launch"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the PS5 launch that the feature was “reserved for a future update.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6gEdx"&gt;Bloomberg’s sources say that the firmware update will allow for an increase in the speed of the PS5’s cooling fans. The PS5 has an extremely fast built-in SSD, and any compatible third-party drive will need to be equally fast in order to store and run PS5 games; that’s going to generate some extra heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LOEuFe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="W09jwi"&gt;The PS5 comes with an 825GB SSD right now, leaving users with only 667GB of usable space when formatted. With game sizes ever increasing — you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22302057/call-of-duty-warzone-black-ops-modern-warfare-500gb-size"&gt;can’t fit all the content from the latest &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; on a 500GB PS4&lt;/a&gt;, for example — PS5 owners will welcome the possibility of storage upgrades. As long as the fan noise isn’t too loud, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony winds down Japan Studio to focus on Astro’s Playroom team</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ip54rbKKwPOR702f-RPqYGoZNI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68877812/vpavic_4278_20201030_0234.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ffdtbx"&gt;Sony has confirmed that Japan Studio, its internal video game developer based in Tokyo, will essentially wind down and refocus around a single team. In a &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-reportedly-downscales-sony-japan-studio"&gt;statement to IGN&lt;/a&gt;, Japan Studio said as of April 1st it would be “re-centered to Team Asobi, the creative team behind &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt;, allowing the team to focus on a single vision and build on the popularity of &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt;.” In other words, get ready for more &lt;em&gt;Astro&lt;/em&gt; games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEAz83"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt; is a well-received title packaged with every PlayStation 5 console. It’s a 3D platformer designed to show off the advanced haptic feedback of the new DualSense controller. Before that, the same team developed &lt;em&gt;Astro Bot: Rescue Mission&lt;/em&gt;, widely considered to be the standout exclusive PlayStation VR title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="B9n4ok"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Astro’s Playroom is the PS5’s Wii Sports","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="98hW9Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-playstation-is-winding-down-sony-japan-studio/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VGC&lt;/em&gt; previously reported today&lt;/a&gt; that the “vast majority” of Japan Studio staff were being let go as Sony declined to renew their annual contracts, which run until the end of the fiscal year on March 31st. Some staff are said to have been reassigned to Team Asobi, while others are reportedly joining Bokeh, a new studio founded by &lt;em&gt;Silent Hill&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Gravity Rush&lt;/em&gt; director Keiichiro Toyama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXGsrl"&gt;While Team Asobi’s work to date is acclaimed, Japan Studio has been an important part of Sony’s first-party PlayStation development efforts for decades. It created series like &lt;em&gt;Ape Escape&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Patapon&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;LocoRoco&lt;/em&gt;, while also assisting with development on titles like &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Last Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. Before leaving last year, Toyama led a division that was responsible for the &lt;em&gt;Siren&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Gravity Rush&lt;/em&gt; games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cloud Strife’s muscle mass on PS5: a very important investigation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lVVxPg7ra7B-tSoVq2GTNP_L4Q=/0x101:2938x2060/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68877723/Cloud_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hzIs7B"&gt;Square Enix just announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a PS5-enhanced version of &lt;em&gt;FF7 Remake&lt;/em&gt; that includes graphical improvements like “improved textures, lighting, and background environments.” But &lt;a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/cloud-with-the-power-of-ps5-got-buffer.385082/"&gt;some users on ResetEra&lt;/a&gt; noticed one other potentially huge graphical upgrade: Cloud’s &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/cloud-anatomy-final-fantasy-7-vii/"&gt;famously skinny arms&lt;/a&gt; may have gotten a bit beefier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BOoHze"&gt;Did Cloud get more swole for next-gen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/6/12/21289471/playstation-5-sony-estimate-size-internet-massive-console-tv-stand"&gt;like the PS5 itself&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHwCR4"&gt;Clearly, this warranted a full investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2qZcI"&gt;Check out this image, from &lt;a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/cloud-with-the-power-of-ps5-got-buffer.385082/post-59531075"&gt;user Tyaren&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZawaFo"&gt;Convincing, right? These two images make a strong argument. But my &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleagues and I weren’t totally sure. Like our &lt;em&gt;brothers in arms&lt;/em&gt; at Reddit suggested, it could be a trick of the improved lighting or slightly different angles in the images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVFwzF"&gt;We needed sturdier evidence, and because we’re &lt;em&gt;professional &lt;/em&gt;journalists here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, we knew we had to dig in deep to try to solve this question — like we did when comparing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261405/resident-evil-village-tall-lady-dimitrescu-height"&gt;the tall lady in &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village &lt;/em&gt;to other tall things&lt;/a&gt;. So we’ve spent the better part of an hour arguing about the issue in Slack, zooming in super closely on photos of Cloud’s arms, and poring over trailers frame-by-frame to find a noticeable difference in a video game character’s nonexistent muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgIaQS"&gt;Unfortunately, a few side-by-side images from Square Enix itself made it harder to settle the argument. See for yourself in these screenshots captured from &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/DTjvkpAEtZA"&gt;this official &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade &lt;/em&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="7yD853"&gt;We needed proof, darn it. Thankfully, my colleague Mitchell Clark had the powerful idea to colorize images from the PS5 and PS4 versions of the game and overlay them on top of each other. Check out the result &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/bhst6W7isag"&gt;in the video below&lt;/a&gt; (the PS5 version is red, while the PS4 version is blue). To me, this is the strongest evaluation yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="guUtzk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhst6W7isag?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2adsJU"&gt;Disappointingly, it also makes it appear as if Cloud’s arms haven’t changed in size at all from PS4 to PS5. Womp womp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FN0VT6"&gt;I’ll leave it up to you to decide if Cloud actually beefed up or not for his PS5 debut. But I think we can all agree on one thing: Cloud’s a lot more swole in both versions of &lt;em&gt;Remake&lt;/em&gt; than he was in the original game.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision admits the complete Call of Duty experience no longer fits on an original PS4</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pghfe0W4wdB1B3G7JYJ7TLOvxrI=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68877510/AGB_WZ_Strategy_Guide_Personalized.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Activision&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AygN9X"&gt;The latest &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; game collection may now be too big to fit the base 500GB PlayStation 4 hard drive (&lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-500gb-ps4-may-no-longer-be-able-to-fit-call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-and-warzone"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to &lt;a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2021/02/Season-Two-Briefing-and-File-Size-Intel"&gt;the official Call of Duty blog&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to have the latest &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; update and the full &lt;em&gt;Black Ops: Cold War &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare&lt;/em&gt; package on your PS4, you’ll have to uninstall content you don’t use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okWYNd"&gt;The games make that somewhat easy to do by letting you remove certain modes — for example, if you only want to play &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, you could &lt;a href="https://support.activision.com/black-ops-cold-war/articles/black-ops-cold-war-storage-management"&gt;uninstall &lt;em&gt;Black Ops&lt;/em&gt;’s single player, Zombie, and arcade modes&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems a bit ridiculous that you can’t fit three (or really, two and a half) games on an &lt;em&gt;entire game console&lt;/em&gt;. That’s especially true since Activision sort of treats these three games as one thing: Warzone blends the content from &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Cold War&lt;/em&gt;, acting as a bridge between the two, with players being able to add and remove the parts they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WarBQO"&gt;To be fair, PS4 Pros and the newer PS4 Slim have all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/18/15344360/sony-ps4-slim-1tb-hard-drive-announced"&gt;come with a 1TB hard drive since 2017&lt;/a&gt;, so they should be able to have the full experience. The PS5, however, may have a problem sometime soon: &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/playstation-4/PlayStation_4_Actual_Hard_Drive_Space#PS4_Install_File_Sizes"&gt;according to IGN&lt;/a&gt;, the PS4 has about 400GB of usable space, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21450334/playstation-5-ps5-sony-news-price-features-specs-hardware-games"&gt;the PS5 has 667.2GB&lt;/a&gt; — and, unlike the PS4, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551165/sony-ps5-playstation-5-no-m2-ssd-expansion-launch"&gt;that SSD storage is not upgradable (yet)&lt;/a&gt;. While you might be able to squeeze another non-Call of Duty game onto the PS5, you may find yourself deciding what to delete next time there’s an update.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telegram update adds auto-delete option to all messages, expiring invites, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4wPLt53eGo3fE1HuGhq53pQ4DZM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68877478/acastro_180417_1777_telegram_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8fbrHy"&gt;Telegram is updating its messaging app with options for auto-deleting messages, expiring invite links, and new unlimited groups, the company &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/autodelete-inv2"&gt;shared in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Much like Signal, Telegram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;received a burst of new users&lt;/a&gt; in the confusion over WhatsApp’s privacy policy and now the company is adopting features that were already part of its competitors’ apps, features which offer more security and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7yZYj"&gt;Auto-deleting messages were already possible in Telegram’s encrypted Secret Chats, but this new update for iOS and Android adds the option to make messages disappear in any kind of chat. Auto-delete can be enabled inside of chats, and set to delete either 24 hours or seven days after messages are sent. Auto-delete won’t remove every message though; if a message was sent before the feature was turned on, it’ll stick around. Telegram’s competitors have had similar features: WhatsApp introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550634/whatsapp-disappearing-messages-feature"&gt;a feature in 2020&lt;/a&gt; and Signal has had disappearing messages &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/disappearing-messages/"&gt;since at least 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mAUhhCNzCkl3DyjKNSkMkB69h4g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328934/telegram_auto_delete_1.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Telegram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Messages can auto-delete after 24 hours or seven days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bYzqM1"&gt;Telegram’s also making changes to groups that might allow for the kind of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261435/elon-musk-clubhouse-podcasts-robinhood"&gt;immediate, informative audio experiences&lt;/a&gt; that have become popular on Clubhouse. New “Broadcast Groups” allow for an unlimited number of members, but limit creating posts to group admins so they can, well, broadcast. Voice chats on the other hand are open to everyone in a broadcast group, and Telegram thinks the feature should be “ideal for large communities, where people can follow along and catch exclusive interviews, news, or just casual talks”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIbBnv"&gt;To help keep these groups exclusive (or grow them fast) Telegram is adding in expiring invite links that can be set to expire after a certain number of uses, a certain amount of time, or both. With the new invites, group admins should be able to better moderate who joins and keep private subject matter a little more private.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eyzJbIQJuQi50OtVWI-JZhwtGjQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328939/telegram_invite_links_1.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Telegram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invite links can be set to expire after a certain number of uses or a set duration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4uHoi2"&gt;Many users left WhatsApp for Telegram out of concern that Facebook would read their messages. Expanding privacy features like auto-delete seems like a good way for Telegram to address those concerns. But even with new privacy options, Telegram still doesn’t universally offer a feature many users expect — end-to-end encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpLWdT"&gt;All messages on Telegram are technically encrypted, but Secret Chats are the only ones that are exclusively viewable on the devices of the people participating. It’s a difference that Telegram says &lt;a href="https://telegra.ph/Why-Isnt-Telegram-End-to-End-Encrypted-by-Default-08-14"&gt;enables features like the new broadcast groups&lt;/a&gt;, but even with auto-delete it might be a dealbreaker for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWLDw2"&gt;You can see &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/autodelete-inv2"&gt;the full list of new features&lt;/a&gt; on Telegram’s blog.&lt;/p&gt;
