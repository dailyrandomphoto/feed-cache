    <title>Huawei founder says company should dodge sanctions by pivoting to software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CHINA-TAIYUAN-HUAWEI-REN ZHENGFEI-INTERVIEW (CN)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/olJ--rvA6LuO1reJRcwQ5pd3rP4=/0x0:5302x3535/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69337761/1231073698.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DbcmVw"&gt;Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei has reportedly urged the Chinese tech giant’s staff to turn the company into a major software force as a way to alleviate the impact of devastating US sanctions. In an internal memo &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/huawei-founder-urges-software-push-counter-us-sanctions-2021-05-24/"&gt;viewed by Reuters&lt;/a&gt;, Ren says that Huawei should focus on software because the industry is “outside of US control and we will have greater independence and autonomy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPLXK1"&gt;Huawei is presently unable to mass-produce much of its hardware products because of sanctions forbidding US firms from doing business with it. The company stockpiled chips and components in an attempt to mitigate the sanctions, but the reserves are limited and in some cases will be swiftly obsoleted. Huawei is also blocked from using Google apps and services on its smartphones. The Biden administration hasn’t suggested that it will reverse any of the Trump-era sanctions, although the US has eased off its moves against other Chinese companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22431838/xiaomi-us-blacklist-remove-trump-lawsuit"&gt;like Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt; and TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IMVYwq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A HarmonyOS announcement is coming next week&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ut1TGT"&gt;Because of this climate, Ren reportedly told employees that Huawei is to focus on software including MindSpore, its cloud AI platform, and its HarmonyOS operating system for various devices. The company is said to be planning to compete in major markets other than the US. “Once we dominate Europe, the Asia Pacific and Africa, if US standards don’t match ours, and we can’t enter the US, then the US can’t enter our territory,” Ren wrote, according to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGdKxH"&gt;It may not be long before an important part of Huawei’s software strategy is revealed. Today, the company sent out a promotional image on WeChat teasing a major HarmonyOS-related announcement for June 2nd. The operating system is yet to launch on smartphones, with the initial focus being IoT devices and TVs upon its early release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>J.J. Abrams says the Valve Portal movie is ‘finally on the rails’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Portal GLaDOS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sr0Wsl863WQSOnDJiLSu0cTOBlY=/68x0:1100x688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69337264/portal-glados.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s been a long time. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tax4e4hBBZc" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How have you been?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RVNv7u"&gt;J.J. Abrams has said that a movie based on Valve’s &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; is still in the works, and that a script is finally being written, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/portal-half-life-jj-abrams-news"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Abrams is light on details, but says that Warner Brothers is excited about the direction the movie is going in, and that it “feels like that thing’s finally on the rails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpVM0T"&gt;We originally heard about the movie &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/6/3960164/half-life-portal-movie-gabe-newell-jj-abrams"&gt;all the way back in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, when Abrams and Gabe Newell were on stage together at the DICE Summit. At the time, Abrams apparently &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/2/6/3960520/jj-abrams-valve-half-life-portal-movies"&gt;told Polygon&lt;/a&gt; that the plan was “as real as anything in Hollywood ever gets.” That was eight years ago, so it seems he was right to couch it like that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt='via &amp;lt;a href="http://d35lb3dl296zwu.cloudfront.net/uploads/photo/image/10009/2013-02-05_22-38-24-1020.jpg"&amp;gt;d35lb3dl296zwu.cloudfront.net&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;' data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wPVfTY1wB376RKSktVA-U2HqvzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14229168/2013-02-05_22-38-24-1020.1419979261.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the archives: Abrams and Newell on stage at DICE 2013 Summit, talking about movies and games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0Hwhlq"&gt;We’ve heard confirmations that both the &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt; movies were still in the works from both &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/12/jj-abrams-portal-half-life-movies-still-happening"&gt;Abrams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Gaben/comments/5olhj4/hi_im_gabe_newell_ama/dck96v9/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Newell&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 and 2017 respectively, but news about either movie has been scarce since then. Talking to &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;, Abrams did mention that his production company, Bad Robot, isn’t actively involved in the “&lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt; thing” at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CmHgo"&gt;Like games, movies can also suffer from development hell, though some do make it out: Zach Snyder’s &lt;em&gt;Army of The Dead&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421065/zack-snyder-army-of-the-dead-netflix-theater-release"&gt;released on Netflix on May 21st&lt;/a&gt;, was &lt;a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/149679/Snyder-Raises-Another-Army"&gt;announced in 2007&lt;/a&gt;. This is to say that, while it does seem like there’s signs of life for the movie, it’s not time to break out the ca— er, celebratory muffins just yet. It seems like it’s still in early development, and we’ll just have to wait and see if it actually manages to solve the puzzle of how to make a movie in the &lt;em&gt;Half-Life &lt;/em&gt;universe, or if it gets stuck flying between two portals (or companies, in this case).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Evidence is piling up that Netflix wants to be the Netflix of games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gORAwq_MiM3G9uBXYL-m5ARGfHU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69337057/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DFgGfT"&gt;Netflix has dipped a toe in gaming on occasion, with perhaps the hugely-successful “choose your own adventure”-style film &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as the most prominent example. But the streaming giant may be expanding further into gaming with a new bundle for Netflix subscribers, according to several reports over the past few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDsDM0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; had the &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/netflix-seeks-executive-to-expand-game-efforts"&gt;first report on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, writing that Netflix wants to hire an executive to oversee new gaming efforts, and that the company is considering a bundle of games similar to Apple Arcade. (Hours later, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/netflix-looking-hire-executive-gaming-expansion-information-2021-05-21/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; corroborated&lt;/a&gt; that a gaming exec is a planned hire at Netflix.) The company has also chosen not to include ads in the games, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. But &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; also said that Netflix’s plans are still “very much in flux.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CsUhBQ"&gt;In a report published Monday, however, &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; shared more details from &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/netflix-gaming-expansion-cde0f3ae-15de-4378-b2b8-fd0aaf0e91f6.html"&gt;its own reporting.&lt;/a&gt; An &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; source said to think of the upcoming service, which would be offered to Netflix subscribers, as “a smaller Apple Arcade” bundle that would include both licensed Netflix IP and games commissioned from indie studios. The service could be a ways out, though, “possibly launching in 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWEmB4"&gt;While Netflix hasn’t publicly confirmed the potential expansion of its gaming efforts, in a statement published by both &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22447410/netflix-executive-games-expansion-the-information-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company left the door open to the idea that it is indeed planning to do more with gaming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="029bIB"&gt;Our members value the variety and quality of our content. It’s why we’ve continually expanded our offering — from series to documentaries, film, local language originals and reality TV. Members also enjoy engaging more directly with stories they love — through interactive shows like &lt;em&gt;Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;You v. Wild,&lt;/em&gt; or games based on &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;La&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Casa de Papel&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;To All the Boys&lt;/em&gt;. So we’re excited to do more with interactive entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HLKHeC"&gt;Netflix has &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of titles based on popular video games that are out now or in the works, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/7/15938192/netflix-castlevania-review-animated-video-game-adaptation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403849/netflix-resident-evil-tv-series-original-live-action-announcement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075927/netflix-the-witcher-viewer-numbers-length-metrics-q4-2019-earnings"&gt;one of Netflix’s biggest shows&lt;/a&gt;), so the company clearly sees the value of video games as IP. It’s not outlandish to think that the company would want to market its series through new games, or, in the ultimate ouroboros, make a new game that eventually becomes a new &lt;em&gt;Netflix&lt;/em&gt; show in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqC2vE"&gt;Netflix seemed to be on its way in 2019 — it had partnered with Telltale Games on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18510849/stranger-things-secret-games-telltale-studio-closed"&gt;a secret &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; game that died before it was announced&lt;/a&gt;, with a source telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “Netflix was just getting into the space and didn’t really have a games group in place yet.” Telltale’s &lt;em&gt;Minecraft: Story Mode&lt;/em&gt; did survive, though, and is still at least partially playable &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80227995"&gt;on Netflix now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3ApuPF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The tragic end of Telltale Games","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17934166/telltale-games-studio-closed-layoffs-end-the-walking-dead"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hovQyS"&gt;Many companies are trying to build a service that’s “Netflix, but for games.” Apple Arcade and Xbox Game Pass are just two that come to mind. But these reports and Netflix’s curious non-denial suggest Netflix might like to eat its own lunch this time around.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google now lets you password-protect the page that shows all your searches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lyCsln3VB1_nWpdXpUBKqZnetyI=/0x0:1578x1052/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69336891/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_3.45.59_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yNRerP"&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7028918?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;added a way to put a password&lt;/a&gt; on your Web and Activity page, which shows all your activity from across Google services, including your searches, YouTube watch history, and Google assistant queries (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/05/22/you-can-now-password-protect-your-google-accounts-my-activity-history/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Without the verification, anyone who picks up a device you’re logged into could see that activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFCqxY"&gt;To activate the verification, you can go to &lt;a href="https://activity.google.com"&gt;activity.google.com&lt;/a&gt;, and click the Manage My Activity verification link. From there, you can select the Require Extra Verification option, save, and enter your password to confirm that you’re the one trying to make the change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sIME1BIfephVnlZaDs8FS3ESf4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22537120/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_3.39.49_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The page can be very revealing, but also lets you manage a ton of your data in one place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gBINmw"&gt;If you don’t have the verification turned on, visiting &lt;a href="https://activity.google.com"&gt;activity.google.com&lt;/a&gt; will show a stream of your Google activity from across your devices, without asking for a password.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UfjlNRGKXrjYqburxMJ0UegJQW8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22537113/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_3.33.31_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Search history can show a lot about a person.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gOvbLK"&gt;Turning on verification, however, will require whoever’s trying to see the information to click the Verify button and enter the Google account password before it’ll show any history. For those who share a computer, or who sometimes lets others who aren’t exactly trustworthy use their device, this could be a very useful toggle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CPZ6NRHw8YWGticGnLTxetfU_2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22537115/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_3.30.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now no one will know.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sIME1BIfephVnlZaDs8FS3ESf4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22537120/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_3.39.49_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ULk7wg"&gt;While you’re on the Web and App Activity page, you can also take a look at what activity Google is saving, and whether it’s being auto-deleted. Then, you can decide if you’re happy with those settings. If not, this is the page to change them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxvWxE"&gt;At Google’s I/O keynote last week, it talked a lot about privacy with its announcement of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22436367/google-io-android-private-computer-core-machine-learning-data-privacy"&gt;Android’s new Private Compute Core&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442416/google-photos-locked-folder-private-hidden-pictures"&gt;locked photos folder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-io-android-12-chrome-features-lock-up-photos-browsing-history-location-data/"&gt;the ability to quickly delete&lt;/a&gt; your past 15 minutes of browsing in Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple stayed on message while Epic filled out the record</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G8klKtHRvaVYWrvOmobOmGIRUsY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69336515/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1FSSBv"&gt;Sure, “hot-tubbing” &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; fun, but in a court context, it’s just a judge encouraging lawyers to argue — which is how &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; ended today. Not with a bang but with a quarrel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbuGmB"&gt;In honor of the trial’s final day, a raft of spare lawyers were in the gallery, representing Epic and Apple. But everyone who spoke to the judge — Epic’s Gary Bornstein and the three lawyers who handled the end of the case for Apple, Dan Swanson, Veronica Smith Moye, and Richard Doren — had their backs to the gallery the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OU1n2W"&gt;Throughout the trial, Epic’s general strategy appears to have been to stuff the record as full of evidence as possible — just in case it’s needed on the inevitable appeal. To do that, Epic sacrificed telling a coherent story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4vmxWH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple had a clear story and it spent the entire trial hammering it home&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AxNHLE"&gt;Apple, on the other hand, was on brand. It had a clear story and it spent the entire trial hammering it home: Apple controls the App Store because the alternative would be a security and privacy nightmare. Whether it was Swanson, Moye, or Doren at the podium, this story didn’t waver, just as it mostly didn’t waver throughout the rest of the trial. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;Tim Cook biffed this&lt;/a&gt; by citing a business model and not mentioning security.) Phil Schiller, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441304/apple-phil-schiller-epic-iphone-testimony-app-store"&gt;Apple’s marketing guru&lt;/a&gt;, sat at the table with the lawyers throughout the trial; from time to time, I found myself wondering how involved he was in crafting the lawyers’ messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDbVsS"&gt;Both parties agreed that the top two issues of the day were market definition and remedies. Who you will agree with in the end is going to depend on how the market is defined, I suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bt1hH4"&gt;For Epic, we’re talking mobile app stores, and the question of the operating system on the phone is key. After all, even though Samsung and LG and whoever else make phones, from a developer’s point of view that doesn’t matter. You’re making games for Android or iOS. This seems fairly sensible, particularly after Schiller &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441304/apple-phil-schiller-epic-iphone-testimony-app-store"&gt;cited extremely minor competition&lt;/a&gt; in his testimony: Amazon’s Fire tablets and Microsoft’s failed Windows phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X57l1x"&gt;It is less clear to me why game consoles should be excluded as competition. Apple, obviously, wants to say there’s a &lt;em&gt;great deal&lt;/em&gt; of competition — but to tell the truth, my initial reaction to this antitrust trial was, “But can’t you just play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on a console?” Epic’s Bornstein mentioned that most consoles aren’t mobile; as the owner of a handheld Nintendo Switch, I strongly disagree! Bornstein had, of course, thought of this — the Switch doesn’t connect to wireless networks, he said, and thus is not truly “mobile.” By this standard, anyone who owns an iPhone that has the functionality for data over the cellular network switched off — perhaps because they are a child and a parent handled this setting, or perhaps because they are just cheap — also doesn’t truly own a mobile phone. That seems incorrect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6o8Lwo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“But can’t you just play ‘Fortnite’ on a console?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0myP52"&gt;Hilariously, Apple’s Swanson pointed out that it is not the ‘90s. What he meant was that we don’t just have one device — multiple devices are much more the norm than they used to be. If all these devices are substitutes for each other, then what does it matter to users if they have to use a PC or a console to get to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;? Some testimony we heard from Apple’s experts earlier in the trial suggested that 80 percent of iOS players were making their in-app purchases elsewhere, Swanson reminded us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARkpvM"&gt;The reason the market definition matters so much is clear: if I agree with Apple’s view that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is a game, and the competitive market is basically anywhere I can buy a game, Epic has no case. But if I agree with Epic’s view that the relevant market is mobile app distribution, then Apple’s refusal to allow any apps that aren’t in the app store on the iPhone is pretty unquestionably monopolistic. This is where Epic’s failure to tell a clear, simple, and coherent story sets its case back. Even if I agree that Apple has at times deliberately hamstrung its competition — and I do agree with this, otherwise there would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;no green bubbles on iMessage&lt;/a&gt; — I still can’t say in simple language why consoles aren’t an acceptable substitute for gaming on mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipjXDh"&gt;But leave that aside. I’m not the judge, after all! And Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers pointed out that it was possible Epic’s proposed remedy — allowing other app stores onto the iPhone and allowing side-loading of apps — &lt;em&gt;destroyed&lt;/em&gt; consumer choice. After all, she suggested, people are generally aware of Apple’s tightly controlled ecosystem and are choosing it on purpose. Besides, she noted, the cost of apps in Google’s store was roughly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iF8g7z"&gt;Well, Epic’s Bornstein said, that’s because it’s a duopoly. There is only one place in the record where Apple concerns itself with pricing pressure: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418828/apple-app-store-commission-30-percent-phil-schiller-2011-epic-lawsuit"&gt;a 2011 email from Schiller&lt;/a&gt;, asking if at some point Apple may have to lower their commission. Apparently, pricing competition still hasn’t caused Apple to lower its commission, unless a lawsuit counts as “competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zYgfwN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This line of questioning suggested that Gonzales Rogers agreed there isn’t competitive pressure on Apple’s pricing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="batGhH"&gt;See, Apple’s small developer program, which dropped the commission for certain studios, seemed to be the result of &lt;em&gt;this lawsuit&lt;/em&gt; more than anything else. (“The issue with the $1 million Small Business Program, at least from what I’ve seen thus far: that really wasn’t the result of competition. That seemed to be a result of the pressure that you’re feeling from investigations, from lawsuits, not competition,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;Gonzales Rogers said last week&lt;/a&gt;.) This skeptical line of questioning suggested, at least to me, that Gonzales Rogers agreed there isn’t competitive pressure on Apple’s pricing. That’s probably welcome news for Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nsP7c"&gt;The day’s other hot topic was remedies — if Apple does indeed have a monopoly and is acting anti-competitively with it, what should be the outcome? Epic wanted to prohibit the restrictions that make the App Store the sole option for downloading apps on iOS — which would mean allowing both side-loading and other game stores on the iPhone. Epic also wanted to get rid of the requirement that in-app transactions for digital goods must use Apple’s in-app purchase processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iBo2lk"&gt;To Apple, this just meant that Epic wants to use Apple’s IP — like developer tools — without paying for it. After all, Apple’s Doren pointed out, the company could have only allowed its own apps on the iPhone, as it did with the very first one (which was promptly jailbroken so other apps could be loaded, but never mind).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gq9539"&gt;Gonzalez Rogers seemed skeptical about the remedies. Besides the IP question, which there was a healthy back-and-forth about, she asked Epic’s Bornstein to cite some cases where courts required businesses to totally change their business model. Well, there’s Microsoft, Bornstein said. Yes, but that case had been brought by the government, and Epic is not the government. In fact, Gonzalez Rogers said, Epic hadn’t shown her a single comparable antitrust case where the kind of ruling Epic was requesting had been granted by a court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gtNJV"&gt;Setting aside the fact that I am not a mind reader nor a judge, what I heard in court today didn’t sound like a win for Epic. Yes, the record is stuffed full of times Apple behaved badly. But the question isn’t whether Apple has always behaved well. I walked out of court feeling Apple had the upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYxTTz"&gt;Of course, all the evidence Epic crammed on the record may serve them beyond an appeal. After all, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404493/amy-klobuchar-interview-antitrust-book-hearings-big-tech"&gt;Amy Klobuchar has said she’s watching this trial closely&lt;/a&gt;. So even if Epic loses this battle, its strategy may win the war — by creating new antitrust laws.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk and Bitcoin miners say they want to address crypto’s sustainability problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4SZ1Vd2Zzv2NMfI2C6JmD5eZlWk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69336385/acastro_bitcoin_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Soup7D"&gt;MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor tweeted Monday that after a weekend meeting with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and “leading Bitcoin miners in North America,” the group has agreed to form a Bitcoin Mining Council, “to promote energy usage transparency [and] accelerate sustainability initiatives worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijrn2K"&gt;Musk tweeted earlier in the day that the group “committed to publish current &amp;amp; planned renewable usage &amp;amp; to ask miners WW to do so. Potentially promising.”  According to Saylor, the group included representatives from Argo Blockchain, Blockcap, Core Scientific, Galaxy Digital, Hive Blockchain Technologies, Hut 8 Mining, Marathon Digital Holdings, and Riot Blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2iIeuW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yesterday I was pleased to host a meeting between &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@elonmusk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; the leading Bitcoin miners in North America.  The miners have agreed to form the Bitcoin Mining Council to promote energy usage transparency &amp;amp; accelerate sustainability initiatives worldwide. &lt;a href="https://t.co/EHgLZ9zvDK"&gt;https://t.co/EHgLZ9zvDK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1396915801492439044?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TuHGDA"&gt;Emails to each of the companies Saylor referenced were not immediately returned Monday, but a spokesperson from Galaxy &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-bounces-back-above-37-120715542.html"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that a representative participated in the call. Several other of the companies mentioned tweeted their support for the plan.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hut8Mining/status/1396918166257901573"&gt;Hut 8 Mining&lt;/a&gt; confirmed it was part of the discussions Saylor referenced, tweeting that it would “educate the market that sustainable mining is possible and a priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVljm1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeterGWall/status/1396916203587870722"&gt;Argo Blockchain CEO Peter Wall tweeted&lt;/a&gt; “as a founding member of the Bitcoin Mining Council, Argo will push hard for sustainable mining and more transparency. This is the way!” Merrick Okamoto, executive chairman at Marathon Digital Holdings &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mokamoto/status/1396918030987259904?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; the company would do its part “to contribute to sustainable mining and transparency.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PSD1N"&gt;While Tesla began accepting Bitcoin as payment for vehicles in March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433153/tesla-suspend-bitcoin-vehicle-purchase-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;Musk reversed that position&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, as he expressed concern for the environment. “Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203"&gt;Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. Since then he’s made note several times of cryptocurrency’s sustainability problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNKVja"&gt;Bitcoin mining uses a significant amount of electricity, using as much annually &lt;a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption"&gt;as the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, according to one estimate. That’s at odds with Tesla’s stated mission to “accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.” Specifics about how the miners planned to tackle Bitcoin’s environmental issues — whether through making changes to the blockchain or using carbon offsetting measures as large corporations do — weren’t available Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCeSK2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WC5HY4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Sweeney concludes Epic v. Apple trial by repping fried chicken</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NbTtvW"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney is a man who says what’s on his mind, even if it’ll ruffle a few feathers. And apparently the first thing on his mind, following today’s closing remarks in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt;, was chicken dinner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EobiP5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Epic vs Apple trial has now concluded! I won’t be commenting before the verdict is delivered. Thanks to everyone whose efforts made this possible, and to Popeyes for building a fine restaurant next door to the Oakland federal courthouse. &lt;a href="https://t.co/xma2xyRBtW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/xma2xyRBtW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1396919697409417218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="Fe1eu4"&gt;Winner winner, wishful thinking? Perhaps. After all, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; competitor &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; does love its chicken, and there’s been plenty&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;of time &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timsweeneyepic/status/1019852527007944704?lang=en"&gt;for Apple’s subliminal messaging&lt;/a&gt; to kick in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgSdZG"&gt;Besides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H5Jm6B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;TIM SWEENEY WENT TO POPEYES BEFORE SHOWING HIS NEXT GEN ENGINE &lt;a href="https://t.co/ckSXCRMJte"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ckSXCRMJte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— KZ  ️ (@KZXcellent) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KZXcellent/status/1260590366295760904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 13, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>‘Rogue’ Commerce unit scanned social media for Census disinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y0yoqH0EV_9jYqaH5iMl9ZV1Fv4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69335634/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6A1oOW"&gt;A security unit within the US Commerce Department monitored Americans’ Twitter accounts for posts critical of the US Census and conducted unauthorized surveillance to gather information about US citizens and foreign visitors, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536492/ITMS_Fact_Sheet_05_18_2021_FINAL.pdf"&gt;according to a fact sheet&lt;/a&gt; released Monday by the ranking Republican on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yz9SfT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/05/24/commerce-department-monitoring-itms/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; first reported on the existence of the unit&lt;/a&gt;, which is called the Investigations and Threat Management Service (ITMS). According to the fact sheet, ITMS had its operations suspended as of May 14th, after an investigation launched in February by Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS) showed that the service had conducted “a variety of improper activities dating back to the mid-2000s, involving abuse of authority, mismanagement, and reprisal against [Commerce] Department employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9nXp3"&gt;Wicker’s memo claims that ITMS “surveilled social media activity on Twitter to monitor accounts that posted commentary critical of processes used to conduct the US Census.” The apparent goal of this surveillance was to show off ITMS’s “intelligence-gathering capabilities by linking those accountholders— members of the general public— to disinformation campaigns orchestrated by foreign governments.” This kind of misinformation campaign typically involves troll farms: groups of people paid by governments sowing wrong or misleading information on social media. But there’s no evidence such an effort was ever aimed at discrediting the census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4Fr8F"&gt;The social media posts collected by ITMS were added to a spreadsheet called the Social Media Tracker, which was used to conduct searches on secure intelligence databases of social media account holders, the&lt;em&gt; Post&lt;/em&gt; reported. One example: the ITMS opened a case after a 68-year-old retiree in Florida with around 100 Twitter followers tweeted that the Census would “be corrupted and falsified to benefit the Trump Party.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqIQBG"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; reported that ITMS referred information about social media posts to the FBI, which declined to investigate since the posts constituted protected speech. It did not appear from Wicker’s memo or the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; story that any of these social media “investigations” ever led to charges of any kind; indeed, the ITMS opened some 1,000 cases but “few resulted in arrests or criminal charges,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZyNtZ"&gt;The Commerce Department did not reply to a request for comment Monday. Wicker said an official report on the ITMS’s activities will be released in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n52hot"&gt;“Over time, the ITMS began regularly conducting criminal investigations and eventually began using counterintelligence tools to gather information about both foreign visitors and U.S. citizens––despite lacking any proper form of authorization,” Wicker wrote in his fact sheet, adding that “ITMS has mutated into a rogue, unaccountable police force without a clear mission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLKrI4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The X950H model also sports four HDMI ports, compatibility with both Alexa and Google Assistant, and a host of Android TV features. It’s one of the best deals we’ve seen on Sony’s premium LED in recent months, especially when you consider that BuyDig is throwing in a $100 Visa gift card with each purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1L0oMz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10516242"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PdPnUY"&gt;We’ve gushed about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; on many occasions — and why shouldn’t we? The wireless headphones remain our top picks for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; you can buy, namely due to their excellent noise-cancellation capabilities and support for two simultaneous Bluetooth connections. The latest model also features enhanced microphones, allowing for improved voice chats, and the same all-day comfort as its predecessors. If you happened to have missed the previous sales on the WH-1000XMH4, the black option is still available via &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F284230046954%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeSony75inchTV052421%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F24%2F22451512%2Fsony-4k-tv-noise-canceling-headphones-apple-airpods-pro-amazon-echo-dot-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay retailer Pro-Distributing&lt;/a&gt; for $260, a $90 discount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="f1VPh1"&gt;If you prefer noise-canceling earbuds over traditional headphones, you’re in luck. Both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeSony75inchTV052421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;t&lt;/a&gt; are still offering 21 percent off the AirPods Pro, meaning you can pick up a pair of Apple’s iconic earbuds for $197. If you’re unfamiliar with the popular Bluetooth earbuds, just know that they offer superb sound with active noise cancellation, along with deep software integration with iOS and an in-ear design that should accommodate most people. If you’re an Android user or simply prefer an alternative, we’ve also rounded up the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S7 FE is like a Tab S7 Plus without the high-refresh screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cwm-U9YgqP0NKUNMDjRqcuObNPQ=/128x0:2399x1514/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69335427/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_10.34.20_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sB9UIL"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE (Fan Edition) could be officially launching soon according to &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/de/tablets/galaxy-tab-s/galaxy-tab-s7-fe-5g-black-64gb-5g-sm-t736bzkaeub/#benefits" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new German product page&lt;/a&gt; spotted by &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,123088.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The tablet appears to be a renamed version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356129/samsung-tab-a7-lite-tablet-leak-camera-specs-display-s7"&gt;the previously leaked “Galaxy Tab S7 Plus Lite”&lt;/a&gt; that first made the rounds in March 2021. The Galaxy Tab S7 FE is the first Fan Edition of one of Samsung’s tablets, a tweaked version of the earlier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;iPad Pro-inspired 12.4-inch Tab S7 Plus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AA5fpw"&gt;While the Tab S7 FE shares the same 12.4-inch screen size as the older Tab S7 Plus, it appears to be using a TFT LCD display, like the 11-inch Tab S7, rather than the OLED found in the Tab S7 Plus. Another cost-saving measure is found in the processor: the Tab S7 FE has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449747/qualcomm-snapdragon-750g-5g-faster-cpu-gpu-ai-engine-smartphone-processor"&gt;a Snapdragon 750G&lt;/a&gt; octa-core processor and 4GB of RAM. For storage, the tablet comes with 64GB of UFS memory, which is partially used by the device’s One UI skinned version of Android 11, and expandable with a microSD card. The Tab S7 FE hangs on to the optional 5G support of its more expensive siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8iwJg0K1HsfvNb29-tamgYYxNE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536507/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_11.16.22_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S7 Fan Edition with optional S Pen stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nqsnFB"&gt;If you happen to be a tablet photographer, the Tab S7 FE includes an 8-megapixel back camera and a 5-megapixel front camera. In a plus for anyone who’s complained about camera orientation on the iPad Pro, the Tab S7 FE’s front-facing camera is in landscape orientation, perfect for long Zoom calls. To get the device through those long calls, the FE has a 10,090mAh battery, which Samsung claims should last up to 12 hours on LTE (oddly, no estimate is given for 5G), and 13 hours specifically for video playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FPLR8a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10516396"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IXFYNY"&gt;The FE can come with an optional S Pen for note-taking tricks like converting handwriting to text. The tablet also has Samsung DeX, which can add Windows-esque interface elements like a taskbar, window-ing, and a “Start menu” automatically when you attach a keyboard. Whether any of those tablet features can elevate the FE into a true productivity device for you is harder to say. We found the Tab S7 and S7 Plus to still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;work best for simpler tablet tasks&lt;/a&gt; like video watching and web browsing rather a whole day of work. Nothing about the Fan Edition suggests that will be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yk1uaE"&gt;The Galaxy Tab S7 Fan Edition currently isn’t for sale in Germany (you can sign up to be notified when it’s available) and is priced at €649 (approximately $792) for either the silver or black version. That’s less than the typical price of a base Galaxy Tab S7 in Germany (€698) and for the larger screen size of a €979 S7 Plus. Should the Tab S7 FE come to the US, it will likely cost less than the rough conversion of the German price to US dollars. We’ve reached out to Samsung and will update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qp7wMI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; says Samsung has other colors and models with different specs in the works as well. We’ll keep an eye out for an official announcement in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
