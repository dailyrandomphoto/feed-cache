    <title>Older adults struggle to access COVID-19 vaccine appointment websites</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ldq1rx"&gt;Buggy websites and complex online tools are being used to schedule COVID-19 vaccine appointments across the United States. The systems are hard to navigate for many people, but they’re particularly inaccessible for older adults. People over the ages of 65 and 75 are prioritized for early waves of vaccination and are most at risk from COVID-19 — but they’re also often uncomfortable and unfamiliar with technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nTa4y"&gt;“The most vulnerable people are left behind even more so than if we hadn’t used more of a technology-oriented solution,” says Ethan Basch, a medical oncologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and physician-in-chief at the North Carolina Cancer Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9KrrM"&gt;Across the country, registration websites for vaccine appointments have been slammed with demand as soon as they launch, filling up &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/world/vaccine-registration-sites-are-opening-across-the-country-and-filling-up-in-minutes.html"&gt;within minutes&lt;/a&gt;. Many Florida county health departments &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213307/covid-vaccine-florida-eventbrite"&gt;turned to the event management platform Eventbrite&lt;/a&gt; to schedule &lt;a href="https://www.poynter.org/locally/2021/how-a-florida-reporter-became-a-one-woman-help-desk-for-anxious-seniors-navigating-the-covid-19-vaccine/"&gt;appointments&lt;/a&gt;. New York City has multiple registration websites, some of which have &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/new-yorkers-eligible-vaccine-report-frustrations-city-registration-websites"&gt;dozens of fields&lt;/a&gt; to fill out and ask people to upload attachments. Navigating those platforms quickly enough to secure an appointment slot may be challenging for anyone not comfortable with computers or the internet and impossible for someone who doesn’t have access to those tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSn4IO"&gt;Only around half of people over the age of 75 use the internet at all, says Susan Nash, a visiting scholar at the Stanford Center on Longevity studying digital literacy options for older adults. “The great irony of this problem is that the people we need to reach with the vaccine and get information to are the ones who are least likely to be online,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YnvcnI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The people we need to reach with the vaccine and get information to are the ones who are least likely to be online”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7HrPe0"&gt;Through the pandemic, gaps in internet access and digital literacy have made other aspects of health care delivery challenging for people who struggle to use technology. Many doctors moved to telehealth, but people without internet access — who tend to be older, non-white, and low income — are &lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200505.591306/full/"&gt;less likely&lt;/a&gt; to schedule telehealth appointments and are at risk for cracks in their care. They were left out of other services as well: someone without internet access wouldn’t have been able to order groceries through an online service, for example, Nash says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y3aEkp"&gt;“There have been these equity issues all the way through with older people. As we’ve experienced the pandemic, some of the easiest fixes have been to go online — and that leaves this whole population behind,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uhv1nn"&gt;During the vaccine rollout, the need for speed and scale pushed officials toward digital scheduling tools. But local health departments around the US have been underfunded for the last decade, and they haven’t been given the funding over the past few months to create vaccine distribution systems. When the shots first became available, many scrambled to set up platforms to allocate the doses to people who were eligible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGuZXs"&gt;Many small departments, particularly in rural areas, are overwhelmed, says Charles Wallace, an associate professor of computer science at Michigan Technological University who runs digital literacy programs. “Some poor person has had to take some time out of what’s got to be an incredibly busy schedule to put this information on the web, and designing a good interface takes time,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwmaJ8"&gt;Quickly developed, jury-rigged digital registration platforms are likely to have elements that are challenging or stressful to people less familiar with technology, Wallace says. One local Michigan health department, for example, sent people to a second webpage through a pop-up warning users that they were leaving the health department’s website. “These pop-ups and warnings are exactly the kind of thing that throws people off when we’re dealing with newcomers,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyyib9"&gt;Many registration sites in Florida and New York City forced people to move as quickly as possible to input their information or they’d lose a selected appointment slot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="C9MDdL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We can easily lose sight of how thin people’s competencies are”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QnQhRA"&gt;“We can easily lose sight of how thin people’s competencies are,” Wallace says. “There’s a false sense of accomplishment. We put everything on the website and can say, great, we’re done. For a lot of people, the assumptions that people are up for adding attachments and things like that are wildly off.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WocAtx"&gt;Asking people to use these complex systems to schedule something as important as a COVID-19 vaccination appointment compounds the anxiety, Nash says. “There’s more to be worried about, and there’s more reason for someone to talk to a human to find out, ‘Do I really have an appointment? Tell me about the side effects,’” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdJOkq"&gt;Basch and his colleagues recognized that problem for their patients at the North Carolina Cancer Hospital — a public facility that serves a rural population and groups with low levels of education and health literacy. The state just opened up vaccination to people over 75, and their patients in that age bracket who have cancer are especially in need of vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1RZWp"&gt;The hospital planned to contact patients through their electronic health records and patient portals, but many patients don’t use that system to communicate with their physicians. “We realized that we would leave people behind,” he says. They’ve started compiling a list of every patient over 75 that doesn’t use the portal, and they plan to call them by phone to schedule vaccination appointments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDj78m"&gt;Outsourcing to doctors to contact patients directly is one way to sidestep the problem of the digital divide, Nash says. But that puts the burden on already overtaxed health care providers. “It’s another thing to place on them, but it does work,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9b1kq"&gt;Older adults are also turning to children or grandchildren to navigate webpages or schedule appointments on their behalf. That’s another temporary solution, Nash says — but it only solves the problem for people who have relatives who can access the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4JLnxh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There isn’t a defined group taking responsibility&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H1HY2t"&gt;In the chaos and inconsistency of the initial vaccine rollout, there isn’t a defined group taking responsibility for connecting people with vaccine resources. Guidelines are changing quickly, and there isn’t clear communication to support people who need help. Instead, many of the people who would benefit most from the vaccine are being left to figure out how to get one on their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuN0Bn"&gt;“Is it on the patient to make themselves aware, and get themselves connected? Or is it the health system, or the state?” Basch says. “There’s a lack of clarity about whose responsibility it is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEzxk4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus updates Zephyrus G14 and G15 with latest AMD and Nvidia chips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Zephyrus G15 in Moonlight White faces the camera, open. The screen displays the ROG logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zx9rp1AI7h3uu2wggbfYF9qLxbE=/0x764:5000x4097/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657434/G15_white_03_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Zephyrus G15 in “moonlight white.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OdEkT8"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best laptops we saw in 2020, in part due to its exceptional Ryzen 9 4900HS processor. Asus has updated the Zephyrus G14 (plus its larger sibling, the Zephyrus G15) with the latest chips from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224490/nvidia-rtx-3000-mobile-laptops-gpu-launch-ces-2021"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPcm1l"&gt;In addition to the chip upgrades, both models have new display options. The G14 now comes with a 144Hz panel. There’s a 2K 120Hz model as well, which Asus says covers the full DCI-P3 color gamut. The G15 has a 165Hz QHD display, also with 100 percent DCIP-3 coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CB026m"&gt;Asus has also added new animations to its Anime Matrix (the grid of LED lights that cover the lid of the G14). There’s now a virtual pet that can live on the display and interact with you. That sounds very cute (and also potentially odd-looking to onlookers). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXRFi2"&gt;The G15 has gotten a bit of a redesign. It’s inherited the G14’s ErgoLift hinge, which lifts the keyboard deck slightly off the ground to improve cooling (and conveniently hide some of the bottom bezel). It also has a bigger touchpad than its predecessor does — 20 percent bigger, to be precise. Asus also added an additional microphone (there were two, and there are now three).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Zephyrus G15 in Eclipse Gray open, angled to the right. The screen displays the ROG logo." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kaPTsdKEVEpNKc_Cux9XVnsklWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230913/G15_gray_05_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is in “eclipse gray.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AjyFCF"&gt;Both models have bigger 90Wh batteries (and the G14’s battery life was already pretty good). Asus says you’ll get over 10 hours to a charge from the G15. Both also feature improved speakers with brand-new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225010/dolby-voice-audio-voice-calls-background-noise-levels-zoom"&gt;Dolby Atmos software&lt;/a&gt; and two-way AI noise cancellation. There are still no webcams to be seen, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4slFR"&gt;The G14 and G15 will be available in Q1 of 2021. Asus hasn’t yet announced whether pricing will change. Current models start at $1,049.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell updates its Alienware m15 and m17 laptops with Nvidia’s new RTX 3000 GPUs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HXfgBy3qlFA0CAw70Csbu8oeZtg=/0x1:1280x854/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657236/Alienware_m15_lifestyle.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Alienware m15 R4 | Photo: Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qWrWit"&gt;Alienware is upgrading its m15 and m17 gaming laptops with some boosted specs at CES 2021, with the new R4 models offering Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226544/nvidia-rtx-3080-laptops-gpus-ces-2021"&gt;latest RTX 3000 series GPUs for laptops&lt;/a&gt;, faster memory options, more internal storage, and — for the m17 R4, specifically — an optional 360Hz display, a first for Alienware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LvpSZ1"&gt;Both the 15-inch and 17-inch models still offer Intel’s 10th Gen Intel Core i7-10870H and Core i9-10980HK CPU options, but they can now be configured with up to 32GB of 2,933MHz memory and up to 4TB of PCIe storage. There’s newly added HDMI 2.1 support for better output to your fancy new TV — especially for gaming. And the aforementioned 360Hz display option gives the 17-inch model a 1080p, 360Hz panel with G-Sync for folks who need the absolute fastest refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZLF8KsfKXEgM34av0l8mDVM3zpA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230885/Alienware_m17_R4_White_with_Tobii_Faced_Left.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alienware m17 R4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SXe633"&gt;Of course, there’s the biggest update: Nvidia’s new RTX 3000 series GPUs, which should help boost gaming performance even more (although Dell hasn’t said which RTX 3000 options will be available just yet). Both the m15 R4 and m17 R4 will start at $2,150 and will be available on January 26th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We gave this laptop a 7, then a Swedish metal band turned it up to 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lenovo commercial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4h3F9O21kejtOotldDDTaTRv8WE=/1x0:1494x995/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657174/10thgen.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ckCm0j"&gt;If you’re interested in learning about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335740/lenovo-legion-5i-gaming-laptop-review-intel-nvidia"&gt;Lenovo Legion 5i&lt;/a&gt; gaming laptop, I now have &lt;em&gt;much more&lt;/em&gt; than a mere written review to share with you. Swedish metal band Iron Savages was paid by an ad agency that’s representing Lenovo to scream a few choice lines from my review, and producer Claudio Marino made the video above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRNBUR"&gt;To be clear, this is an ad. The agency asked for my permission to use some quotes from our review, and I said yes. That was in early November, and I quite honestly forgot about what I had agreed to. Then today, at the height of our collective &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces"&gt;CES 2021&lt;/a&gt; grind at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, it appeared in my inbox. It gave all of us some much-needed dumb delight, and maybe you’ll get a laugh out of it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo commercial" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMHuE2TYOt3VZKGCXKmeBC-dXEU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230591/10thgen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QektrP"&gt;There’s nothing like hearing the lines “10th Gen Intel Core processors” and “attractive, yet plainly designed gaming laptop” screamed in a guttural tone, while the Legion 5i just idly sits there during the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2425p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T TV Now is now AT&amp;T TV — here’s what that means</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="AT&amp;amp;amp;T stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BX0aDnxWYKYdS2IYkkOtm6hoIUA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657130/att1_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dF3KyV"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV Now is no more. New customers can no longer sign up for telecom’s skinny bundle TV service, similar to YouTube TV or Hulu with Live TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzMJnE"&gt;Instead, customers can only &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/att-tv-national-launch-directv-pricing-cord-cutting-1203520138/"&gt;sign up for AT&amp;amp;T TV&lt;/a&gt;. Simply put: AT&amp;amp;T now has one virtual TV service instead of two. Existing customers will be able to continue accessing the service and shouldn’t experience any disruptions, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pebvro"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has rolled in parts of AT&amp;amp;T TV Now into AT&amp;amp;T TV, including getting rid of the annual contract and not requiring people to own the AT&amp;amp;T TV hardware. Instead, people can use their own compatible devices (Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, etc.) to stream, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.atttvnow.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F12%2F22226881%2Fatt-tv-now-streaming-skinny-bundle-cord-cutting-youtube-hulu-fubo#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to AT&amp;amp;T’s website&lt;/a&gt;. There are three different pricing tiers that customers can choose from depending on what channels they want, including add-ons like additional sports and premium channels like HBO. Prices range from $70 to $95, more than double AT&amp;amp;T TV Now’s original starting price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Z8WFP"&gt;“We’re bringing more value and simplicity by merging these two streaming services into a single AT&amp;amp;T TV experience,” Vince Torres, senior vice president of marketing at AT&amp;amp;T, told &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pKnWp"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV Now has been a tumultuous bet, even if you look beyond the fact that AT&amp;amp;T took an already confusing naming scheme (DirecTV and DirecTV Now) and made it &lt;em&gt;even worse &lt;/em&gt;(they became AT&amp;amp;T TV and AT&amp;amp;T TV Now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/30/20747190/directv-now-rebrand-att-tv-streaming-app"&gt;respectively, in 2019&lt;/a&gt;). Launched in 2016 at $35 a month for 65 channels, the idea was to hop on the cord-cutting trend. It worked for a minute, but as AT&amp;amp;T faced continuous rising costs, licensing woes, and increased competition from new players, numbers started dropping. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUyTViMSBgO7vK_Y6sovxYI3CEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230337/unnamed__16_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The light blue box keeps shrinking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CwVWIK"&gt;In September 2018, AT&amp;amp;T TV Now controlled 25 percent of internet TV subscriber market share; by September 2020, that dropped to just 8 percent, according to data from analytical firm Antenna. While Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, and Fubo are all seeing some growth, AT&amp;amp;T TV Now has radically shrunk. Throw in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17525240/directv-now-price-att-40"&gt;rising prices&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2019/11/12/tv-station-blackouts-are-accelerating-heres-why/?sh=38f9e74b7f6c"&gt;channel blackouts&lt;/a&gt; caused over licensing disagreements, and it’s not difficult to see why AT&amp;amp;T TV Now failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MxKsE"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV Now went from a peak of 1.86 million customers in the third quarter of 2018 to less than 685,000 in September 2020. More often than not, trying to find the balance between the cost to run skinny bundle TV services and keeping monthly subscription prices low results in a path to a profitless future. Even if former AT&amp;amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson thought otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5Ri0h"&gt;“[We are absolutely convinced that this is going to be very, very attractive for a large group of customers who really aren’t even in the market today,” Stephenson said in 2016 ahead of DirecTV Now’s (then AT&amp;amp;T TV Now) launch, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/att-tv-now-shutting-down-1234883328/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhMHKK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ztb66O"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AvKvtQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="q9RyRc"&gt;The first &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 2021 focuses on the topic we’re thinking about the most at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this month (and probably the foreseeable future): &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"&gt;content moderation on the internet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6a3VJ4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, Adi Robertson, and Casey Newton chronicle the past week of social media platforms taking action since the Capitol riot: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Trump getting banned &lt;/a&gt;from sites like Twitter and Facebook and social app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Parler being removed from app stores&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11F92t"&gt;The crew also dives into what this means for the future of content moderation for Big Tech, regulation surrounding Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and the role of competition for social media platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6Ffo3"&gt;You can listen here or in your preferred podcast player to hear the full discussion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer has created a concept N95 mask with RGB and voice projection</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hE1lj1zR7MLVdGkpUEwXrbhH35o=/20x0:620x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657047/razer_mask_smaller.5.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bsAXqu"&gt;Razer claims to have made the world’s smartest mask: its new reusable N95 respirator called Project Hazel. It’s a concept design with a glossy outside shell made of waterproof and scratch-resistant recycled plastic, which is transparent to allow for lip-reading and seeing facial cues when you chat with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQfnyR"&gt;Currently, there isn’t a price or release date attached. Razer refers to Project Hazel as a surgical N95, but it hasn’t yet earned any of the necessary approvals and certifications from the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or Occupational Safety and Health Administration. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Razer said it is working with a team of medical experts and scientists who are helping to develop the mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXYGro"&gt;The main features of this mask lie within its two circular zones that flank your mouth. They’re used for ventilation, giving the device an almost futuristic gas mask look. Razer claims Project Hazel will use active disc-type ventilators, filtering air that’s breathed in, as well as the CO2 that’s being exhaled. The company adds that it will be certified to filter 95 percent of airborne particles, including the COVID-19 virus and other common pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MsGRl"&gt;These ventilators are detachable and rechargeable, though Razer is still hammering out the details on two very important factors: how long they’ll be effective and how Razer will alert the user when it’s time for a new one. A spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the ventilators’ longevity is still being tested, and when the filters need to be changed, Razer envisions users being notified via a mobile companion app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TFg4Vb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FvWiCclESL8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ahEE8V"&gt;Microphones and amplifiers embedded in the ventilators will project your voice through the mask, so you won’t have to worry about sounding muffled. We haven’t seen this in action yet or had the chance to try it out ourselves. Razer told us that it’s working with THX sound engineers to find a balance in terms of how loud the speakers should be for accessibility purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOYXaU"&gt;Razer asserts that Project Hazel is comfortable despite all of the tech inside. The mask makes a seal around your nose and chin with a silicon guard, and it uses adjustable ear loops so that most people should be able to find the right fit (though it is likely quite a bit heavier than your average mask).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmehwQ"&gt;Of course, this wouldn’t be a modern Razer product if it didn’t support Chroma RGB LEDs. Each of the respirator-meets-amplifier rings can glow in the color of your choosing. And when it gets dark, a set of LEDs activate automatically to shine light on your mouth so others can still see you talk. It’s tough to tell just how effective these LEDs will be in fully illuminating your mouth, but they may be helpful nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Project Hazel" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jnx4UmRFWu7CkemWUzDgnv5oDn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228437/hazelnight.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LEDs automatically switch on inside of the mask once it’s dark out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ48tB"&gt;Razer envisions that each Project Hazel mask will include a large charging case that sterilizes the mask with UV light when it’s not in use, although this is still in the concept stage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilEhdE"&gt;Most of us already have countless masks, but there’s certainly a place for Project Hazel in the world — if it ever comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Project Brooklyn" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8gux6ZiJ31Thu_YiTi15b56gbkA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228440/projectbrooklyn.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rollout OLED is a great idea, but it’s just an idea for now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kFaRZM"&gt;Razer has one more announcement for CES 2021, and it’s purely conceptual. It’s called Project Brooklyn, and (since you can’t tell from the name) it’s a high-end gaming chair with built-in haptics and a rollout curved OLED screen. Theoretically, it supports inputs from all of your gaming sources, making it the ultimate game station. But without an in-person CES, it seems like Razer didn’t feel the need to churn out a physical mockup of Project Brooklyn. We’ll see if some aspects of this idea make it into future products; the rumbling haptics seem like the most practical components.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ ROG Claymore II mechanical keyboard has a handy detachable number pad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Asus Claymore II" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B_4md1mgNZrOsScaq72xiGng5Uo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656969/asusrogclaymoreii.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0yIXOr"&gt;Asus announced a new mechanical keyboard at CES 2021 called the ROG Claymore II. It’s designed for gamers, with customizable macro keys and per-key RGB backlighting. It’s also the first device to feature Asus’ own ROG RX Blue or Red optical switches with a claimed 100 million keypress lifespan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGtIO1"&gt;This model gives a nod to people who just can’t totally quit the numpad: you can detach it to make the Claymore II an 80 percent keyboard if you need to save space or magnetically attach it when you need to crunch some numbers. The numpad also offers more intuitive media controls, like a volume dial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVYCJx"&gt;The ROG Claymore II connects either via a USB-C cable or wireless via 2.4GHz. If you use it wirelessly, its 4,000mAh battery is supposed to last for up to 40 hours. Asus says the USB-C port supports fast charging and USB passthrough for other devices. This model will be released in Q2 2021; Asus hasn’t yet shared a price.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus Gladius III Wireless" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eYmkr9FyGcJ91Afo4vggFT0WvNs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230700/asusgladiusIII.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MK12Tu"&gt;Asus has also announced its new ROG Gladius III Wireless gaming mouse. The mouse doesn’t have a final price or a specific release date (beyond its Q2 2021 target), but the design and specs are worth knowing about. The Gladius III Wireless looks similar to the Razer DeathAdder V2, which we cited as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;the best wired gaming mouse to buy&lt;/a&gt;. The new device’s sensor supports up to 19,000 DPI, and it can be connected with a wire or wirelessly via 2.4GHz or Bluetooth. Asus says a purely wired version of this mouse will release at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqbRC0"&gt;Notably, the ROG Gladius III allows for user-replaceable switches so you can find the right feel for your needs — even letting you swap between three-pin mechanical and five-pin Omron optical switches. Most people likely will never put their mice under such stress that they’ll reach the end of their switches’ lifespan, but having the option to swap them out is certainly a nice feature.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Univision enters the streaming race with PrendeTV, a free, ad-supported Spanish platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="View of the Univision Building in Los An" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/knVITThfkJZoajpSmbmy2MjD5_Q=/0x0:3504x2336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656898/71309339.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QR7ySe"&gt;Created “exclusively for the U.S. Hispanic audience,” PrendeTV is Univision’s entry into the streaming wars, offering a collection of free Spanish programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8Mzwm"&gt;PrendeTV, which gets its name for the Spanish phrase for “switch on,” will launch this quarter, &lt;a href="https://corporate.univision.com/blog/2021/01/12/univision-announces-prendetv-1st-premium-free-ad-supported-streaming-service-built-exclusively-for-u-s-hispanics/"&gt;according to Univision&lt;/a&gt;. The service will have “an unprecedented collection of high-quality, curated Spanish-language series [and] movies,” as well as some other entertainment. PrendeTV will also offer 30 live channels and more than 10,000 hours of on-demand content at launch, according to the company, with the goal to expand that offering once launched. It will be available on desktop and mobile, as well as a free app on connected TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlBlfD"&gt;Univision’s biggest competitor in the Spanish marketplace for US customers, Telemundo, does not have its own streaming service. Owned by NBCUniversal, Telemundo instead has a hub and several “channels” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216867/peacock-office-subscription-streaming-ad-free-premium-plus-netflix"&gt;on Peacock&lt;/a&gt;, NBCUniversal’s own ad-supported streaming platform. Univision CEO Wade Davis, who previously worked on ad-supported streaming strategy at ViacomCBS, told &lt;em&gt;Deadline &lt;/em&gt;in 2020 that “it’s remarkable” there’s not really a “high-quality, differentiated OTT service for this audience that is at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiSm0H"&gt;“It’s a huge opportunity that is completely open from a competitive standpoint,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="752NaA"&gt;Although Univision is entering an already crowded market, with services like Disney Plus, HBO Max, Peacock, Apple TV Plus, and more launching all within the last 14 months, Univision is banking on PrendeTV being “the only premium, free ad-supported streaming service designed and curated exclusively for U.S. Hispanics.” The fact that it’s free, something that ViacomCBS is also reportedly seeing success with on its own ad-supported platform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/22/6054639/the-genius-of-pluto-tv"&gt;Pluto TV&lt;/a&gt;, should also help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxeiVd"&gt;Exact launch dates, new exclusive series, and what platforms it will be available on will be announced closer to launch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus has a 32-inch 4K gaming monitor with HDMI 2.1 shipping later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Swift PG32UQ" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pkY_gvaUWofSeGTO_8wF_Qao5bs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656715/asusswifthero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ROG Swift PG32UQ will be a G-Sync-compatible gaming monitor&lt;/em&gt; | Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="53bQpD"&gt;Asus is gearing up to release its first gaming monitor to support HDMI 2.1, which boasts enough bandwidth to display up to 4K resolution at 120 frames per second when connected to a compatible Windows PC, Xbox Series X, or PS5. The ROG Swift PG32UQ is, according to Asus, the world’s first 32-inch HDMI 2.1 gaming monitor, and both of its HDMI ports support the latest standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0YZpl"&gt;Connecting via DisplayPort 1.4 allows this monitor to display 4K at a 144Hz refresh rate on PC if you have components capable enough to soar that high. For this feature, Asus credits a technology called Display Stream Compression (DSC) that compresses UHD streams without a perceptible drop in visual quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRcvFb"&gt;Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22216979/acer-gaming-monitors-nitro-predator-xv28-xb27-xb32-ces-2021-may-price-specs-hdmi-21"&gt;Acer Nitro XV28 announced last week&lt;/a&gt;, the ROG Swift PG32UQ won’t ship until sometime in Q2 2021. Asus hasn’t shared a price for this model, but don’t expect anything under $899 — that’s Acer’s price for the smaller 28-inch Nitro XV28. Both have a 4K 144Hz IPS panel with a 1ms response time, but the Asus device might end up being the preferred choice among PC gamers since it has a bigger screen with Nvidia G-Sync compatibility. (The XV28 has FreeSync Premium.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCDP2S"&gt;Asus says the Swift is currently undergoing the certification process, but at launch, it should be compatible with Nvidia’s variable refresh rate mode to eliminate screen tearing and artifacts. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CfM6Qx"&gt;The ROG Swift PG32UQ supports HDR 600, allowing it to reach 600 cd/m2 peak brightness. That’s a bit brighter than the aforementioned Acer Nitro but still comparatively dim next to many other HDR-ready displays. The display is factory-calibrated for color accuracy, with full coverage of the sRGB gamut and 98 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.&lt;/p&gt;
