    <title>Teslas made in Texas will likely have to leave the state before Texans can buy them</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0yIfCq"&gt;Tesla is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334860/tesla-cybertruck-factory-austin-texas-location-model-y"&gt;building a factory in Texas&lt;/a&gt; to make some of its cars, but when it’s up and running, the cars made there may have to go on a roundabout journey to get to Texan buyers (&lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/40779/tesla-will-have-to-ship-its-texas-built-cars-out-of-state-to-sell-back-to-residents"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Because of state laws banning car companies from selling directly to consumers, Tesla could end up shipping the cars from its Austin factory to other states, before they’re sent back to their Texan buyers. The state’s lawmakers were debating legislation that would have prevented the situation, but they’ve now missed their chance to pass it before they have to go on break until 2023 — &lt;a href="https://communityimpact.com/austin/southwest-austin-dripping-springs/development/2021/01/18/story-to-watch-in-2021-teslas-gigafactory-set-for-completion-by-years-end/"&gt;the factory is expected to be completed&lt;/a&gt; by the end of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICDTZg"&gt;Laws preventing automakers from selling their vehicles directly to consumers aren’t unique to Texas, nor are they targeted at Tesla: they were &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/cant-buy-tesla-states-161318245.html"&gt;originally put in place&lt;/a&gt; in many states to keep manufacturers from undercutting their franchised dealers, and putting them out of business. Tesla doesn’t have franchised dealers to protect, but that doesn’t matter to Texas law as it’s currently written. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tiWZO4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, recently moved to Texas himself&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2gNDwm"&gt;It’s an embarrassing situation for the state, where a worker at the new factory (where Tesla plans on investing a billion dollars) would have to wait for a car they made to travel to a dealership in another state for processing, and then return to them. That could even be the case for Elon Musk himself, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163805/elon-musk-texas-moved-california-tesla-spacex"&gt;who said he had moved to the state earlier&lt;/a&gt; this year. It’s also a little embarrassing for Tesla, which decided to build a factory in the state without securing a deal to sell its cars there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVEm2V"&gt;&lt;a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/87R/billtext/html/HB04379I.htm"&gt;There was a bill&lt;/a&gt; proposed in the Texas legislature seemingly tailored to help Tesla: it would have let companies sell their cars directly to consumers if they were completely driven by electricity or battery-power, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; only if those companies never had franchised dealerships in the state. That could rule out companies like Ford, even though it sells EVs, but might also allow other EV makers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21319899/rivian-2-5-billion-funding-round-amazon-soros-r1t-r1s-truck-suv-ford"&gt;Rivian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21514294/lucid-motors-air-electric-luxury-sedan-base-price"&gt;Lucid&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324096/canoo-goev-ev-pickup-truck-specs-photos-revealed"&gt;Canoo&lt;/a&gt; to sell directly, once they start producing vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SteqWf"&gt;Tesla and other EV manufacturers have been fighting in many states to get permission to sell directly for years, and have even had a few recent successes: Tesla has been allowed to sell in Colorado (where &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/03/25/rivian-wins-big-as-colorado-passes-electric-vehicle-direct-sales-law/"&gt;Rivian recently got access as well&lt;/a&gt;) and Tesla was able to work out a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21077062/tesla-deal-sell-service-cars-michigan-law-ban-lawsuit-reversal"&gt;legal loophole in Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. As many as 12 states allow Tesla to sell directly to customers, and others let Tesla &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_US_dealership_disputes#States_with_limited_sales"&gt;open a limited number of dealerships&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwvBKD"&gt;But there are many states where hopeful buyers still have to jump through hoops, like having to mail paperwork across state borders to get temporary tags, or drive to other states to make the purchase: Oklahoma, Nebraska, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Alabama, South Carolina, New Mexico, and, of course, Texas have all proposed direct sales, but the bills have all been shut down, tabled indefinitely, or ignored for years. Tesla &lt;a href="https://engage.tesla.com"&gt;even has a page on its website&lt;/a&gt; where it asks customers to engage with their elected officials about these cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f4o7Nf"&gt;Connecticut, another state where direct selling isn’t allowed (though Tesla can lease cars to customers there), &lt;a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2021/03/24/tesla-lucid-rivian-other-ev-makers-scored-a-win-in-connecticut"&gt;currently has legislation in the works&lt;/a&gt; to allow direct sales, and Tesla and Rivian are working together to try and get legislation through &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/ev-rivals-tesla-rivian-unite-to-target-direct-sales-legislation/"&gt;in other states this year&lt;/a&gt; as well. In many of the states, Tesla has found a way to get cars to customers, but not without hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jG9loa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gubernatorial reprieve is possible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c23bYq"&gt;For Texas, though, the wait for legislation could be a while. Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1398029410289127424?s=20"&gt;tweeted in response&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt;’s article about lawmakers running out of time, pushing for a change in the state. It’s not impossible that it could happen, even with the legislature on break until 2023: Governor Greg Abbott (who called Tesla “one of the most exciting and innovative companies in the world” when it announced its Texas factory) could call a special session to focus on the un-passed law. Abbott did not respond to a request for comment about whether he intends to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CpZkVV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tesla sure would appreciate changing the law, so that this is not required!&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1398029410289127424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3xvP6"&gt;It’s also possible a legal loophole could be created, like in Michigan. However, it doesn’t seem like Texas lawmakers are in a rush to go that route: Tesla also tried to win the right to directly sell cars to Texans &lt;a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1084622_tesla-loses-legal-battles-to-texas-north-carolina-dealers"&gt;in 2013&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/general/tesla-sales-texas-model-s-4657066/"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;, and lost both times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eS3tj1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google reportedly made it difficult for smartphone users to find privacy settings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DWair89X0nMbjVVmvU0othS_7w8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69361888/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V23zVS"&gt;Unredacted documents in Arizona’s lawsuit against Google show that company executives and engineers were aware that the search giant had made it hard for smartphone users to keep location information private, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/unredacted-google-lawsuit-docs-detail-efforts-to-collect-user-location-2021-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1Ugl4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.azag.gov/media/interest/updated-redacted-google-complaint"&gt;The documents suggest&lt;/a&gt; that Google collected location data even after users had turned off location sharing, and made privacy settings difficult for users to find. &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; also reports that the documents show Google pressured phone manufacturers into keeping privacy settings hidden, because the settings were popular with users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzizJk"&gt;Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272625/arizona-ag-sues-google-location-tracking-android-allegations"&gt;filed a lawsuit against Google last May&lt;/a&gt;, alleging the company illegally tracked Android users’ location without their consent, even if users had disabled location tracking features. The lawsuit suggested Google kept location tracking running in the background for some features, and only stopped the practice when users disabled system-level tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pUtOhK"&gt;The unredacted documents show one Google employee asked if there was “no way to give a third party app your location and not Google?” adding that it didn’t sound like something the company would want revealed to the media, according to &lt;em&gt;Insider. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXoSf2"&gt;Google spokesperson José Castañeda said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Brnovich “and our competitors driving this lawsuit have gone out of their way to mischaracterize our services. We have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data. We look forward to setting the record straight."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXaxrR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 29th, 8:11PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Google spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Curiosity rover has captured amazing images of clouds on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CUBpErRuXuTOmEZIqqQDvn_I9eo=/318x0:1475x771/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69361779/curiosity_clouds_on_mars.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover captured these clouds just after sunset on March 19th, the 3,063rd Martian day, or sol, of the rover’s mission. The image is made up of 21 individual images stitched together and color corrected so that the scene appears as it would to the human eye. | NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="isYpxg"&gt;NASA’s Curiosity rover has captured images of clouds on Mars— as described in its &lt;a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-curiosity-rover-captures-shining-clouds-on-mars"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;: “wispy puffs filled with ice crystals that scattered light from the setting sun, some of them shimmering with color.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxWQxj"&gt;According to NASA clouds are rare in the thin atmosphere of Mars, but usually form at its equator during its coldest time of year. Scientists noticed that last year — two years ago in Earth time— there were clouds beginning to form earlier than expected, so this year they were ready. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/unBdvByvJnYD1lRE2c8NeXp3Hz4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22548199/clouds_over_mt_sharp_on_MARS.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A gif of clouds drifting above Mount Sharp on Mars, taken by NASA’s Curiosity rover on March 19th.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="weDYau"&gt;The images are not only stunning, they’ve provided new insights to the Curiosity team at NASA. The early clouds are at higher altitudes than most Martian clouds— which typically hover about 37 miles above the planet’s surface and are made up of water ice. The higher-altitude clouds are likely made of frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice, NASA says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsBKRz"&gt;Curiosity provided both black-and-white and color images— the black-and-white photos show the rippled details of the clouds more clearly. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lRkl2S7AUJiLod7gN8U43OUMY3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22548211/black_and_white_clouds_on_mars.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Curiosity took these images of clouds on Mars just after sunset on March 31st.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eQnTsI"&gt;But it’s the color photos taken from the rover’s mast camera and stitched together from multiple images that are really breathtaking. NASA describes them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LkmcX5"&gt;Viewed just after sunset, their ice crystals catch the fading light, causing them to appear to glow against the darkening sky. These twilight clouds, also known as “noctilucent” (Latin for “night shining”) clouds, grow brighter as they fill with crystals, then darken after the Sun’s position in the sky drops below their altitude. This is just one useful clue scientists use to determine how high they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WAP5sM"&gt;Curiosity also captured images of iridescent “mother of pearl” clouds, with pastel colors throughout. Mark Lemmon, an atmospheric scientist with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado said in NASA’s post that those colors come from cloud particles nearly identical in size. “That’s usually happening just after the clouds have formed and have all grown at the same rate,” he explained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQaV11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FW5aI-eJj3b4rfNPmIkE0QA03ys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22548169/shiny_mars_clouds_curiosity.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover spotted these iridescent, or “mother of pearl,” clouds on March 5th, the 3,048th Martian day, or sol, of its mission.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HL9ck6"&gt;Lemmon said he marvels at the colors that show up in these clouds; reds and greens and blues and purples. “It’s really cool to see something shining with lots of color on Mars.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iS8LgV"&gt;Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXXVFt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrYDYg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US soldiers reportedly leaked nuclear info online accidentally, by using flashcard apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YEL2fyeaBOoK7NaRF5fzDqx_IzM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69361550/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wrSrPl"&gt;US soldiers stationed in Europe may have accidentally exposed information about the United States’ nuclear weapons stockpile when they used flashcard apps to help them remember details about the information, according to a report from open-source intelligence outlet &lt;a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2021/05/28/us-soldiers-expose-nuclear-weapons-secrets-via-flashcard-apps/"&gt;Bellingcat.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKdZyj"&gt;Foeke Postma, a researcher with Bellingcat, wrote that the soldiers used study apps such as Chegg, Cram, and Quizlet to create flashcards where they stored information about bases in Europe where US nuclear weapons were likely located, secret codes, passwords, and other details about security. It appears that they forgot to set the settings for the apps to “private,” so that their usernames and photos were public-facing, and since some of the soldiers used the same photos as they had on their LinkedIn profiles it would not have been difficult to connect them to the nuclear information, according to Postma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKIYuo"&gt;Why the soldiers used unsecured study apps to remember the information wasn’t clear. Postma contacted officials with the US Department of Defense, NATO, and European Command several weeks before publishing his report, and the flashcards with the sensitive information have since been taken down (although may still be visible on the archival Wayback Machine site, as &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7ebmd/us-military-personnel-spilled-nuclear-secrets-in-online-flashcards"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="thRxn9"&gt;The study apps did not reply to requests for comment Saturday. An email to the Department of Defense asking whether the soldiers involved could face any disciplinary action was not immediately returned Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitbit may soon be adding snoring detection to its devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r5U_zkxBZ2q0e6aF7cL2MWmJqi8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69360799/akrales_190903_3635_0025.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4YAWwp"&gt;Fitbit may soon add snoring and noise detection to its devices, a move that will likely please the spouses and partners of the snoring population and be of interest to people for whom snoring is a sign of a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/snoring/symptoms-causes/syc-20377694"&gt;possible health condition&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZuhZE"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/27/fitbit-snore-and-noise-detection-your-sleep-animal/"&gt;a report in &lt;em&gt;9to5 Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which decompiled the latest version of the Fitbit app in Google’s Play Store, the feature allows a Fitbit’s microphone (in devices that have one) to listen to “ambient noise including your potential snoring,” after you’ve fallen asleep. Not only would the feature be a major drain on the device’s battery, the idea of a sleep tracker monitoring noise “throughout the night,” as the release notes state, is a little creepy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sb8LB7"&gt;The&lt;em&gt; 9to5 Google&lt;/em&gt; report says the feature is called Snore &amp;amp; Noise Detect, and it monitors “noise including snores from you or someone next to you.” It analyzes noise level, and tries to find “snore specific” sounds. When the Fitbit detects a noise event louder than the baseline noise level, it tries to determine whether it’s picking up snoring or something else. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="1ElNzn"&gt;The snore tracker can’t distinguish who is snoring, of course; the Fitbit wearer or someone else in the bedroom. The release notes recommend users not play white noise or other ambient sounds in the bedroom which can interfere with the snore detection, and suggests users charge their Fitbit to at least 40 percent before they go to bed because “this feature requires more frequent charging.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGZPRf"&gt;The notes don’t indicate what users are supposed to do with the information about snoring, but since snoring and the conditions that can lead to it can be seriously disruptive to sleeping, it may be a useful metric to be aware of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEN1uO"&gt;Fitbit also will be introducing “sleep animals” as part of a separate upcoming feature, according to &lt;em&gt;9to5 Google&lt;/em&gt;, although it appears to be in much earlier stages of development than the snore detector. It looks like each different style of sleeping will correlate with an animal— and again, it’s not totally clear what users do with the information, or how the animal images would be displayed in the app. But according to the report, a restless sleeper would be a bear, a short sleeper would be a hummingbird, a solid sleeper would be a tortoise, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m more of a bear when I first wake up tbh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QMQ18t"&gt;Snore &amp;amp; Noise Detect isn’t available to all users yet, and while &lt;em&gt;9to5 Google&lt;/em&gt; enabled the feature long enough to set it up, it wasn’t able to fully test it. Fitbit didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The future of COVID-19 immunity looks good  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Larry Flynt’s Hustler Club Hosts Pop-Up Vaccination Site In Las Vegas" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k-RY7D_Hkd5C_NVOOC-igm8ZZYk=/67x0:3355x2192/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69360695/1319347246.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z8lIaF"&gt;Our COVID-19 vaccines have passed their first tests with flying colors. They work unbelievably well, and they’re helping to slow the spread of disease in countries where they’re widely available. Now, scientists are turning to the next key question: how long will they work that well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWq4ZW"&gt;In people who were sick with COVID-19 and then got vaccinated, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/health/coronavirus-immunity-vaccines.html"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; shows that they probably work for years. That group has powerful memory cells in their bone marrow that produce new antibodies when they’re needed. And they work so well that they can even block variants of the virus, studies show. These people may not even need vaccine boosters to stay protected long term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Ecr9rP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vdpmvE"&gt;Protection may be different for people who got vaccinated but never had COVID-19, Michel Nussenzweig, an immunologist at Rockefeller University in New York, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/health/coronavirus-immunity-vaccines.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The immune system responds differently to vaccines than it does to natural infection, so they might need boosters against variants — even if they have strong and long-lasting protection against the original coronavirus strain. “That’s the kind of thing that we will know very, very soon,” Nussenzweig said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w84gJz"&gt;Luckily, other research is charging ahead to figure out exactly what those potential boosters might look like. Scientists are &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01377-8"&gt;honing in&lt;/a&gt; on the levels of antibodies someone needs to be protected against COVID-19. That benchmark, known as the immune correlate of protection, will give them an idea of the safety threshold — if someone’s antibodies drop below it, they might be more vulnerable to infection again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfMXFq"&gt;Zeroing in on that threshold does two things. First, it gives scientists a way to monitor protection in people who have already been vaccinated. They can watch to see how long it takes for antibodies to decline below it, and get an idea of when people might need that booster shot. Antibodies naturally decline over time, and they’re not the only measure of protection (those long-lasting memory cells in bone marrow are another, for example). But they’re an early look at how immunity might be changing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pKSLYs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;having a threshold for protection opens up a shortcut to creating any needed booster shots against COVID-19 variants&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rzO9ix"&gt;Second, having a threshold for protection opens up a shortcut to creating any needed booster shots against COVID-19 variants. COVID-19 vaccine trials included tens of thousands of people. They took months to run, because researchers needed to watch how frequently people with and without the shots got sick. Once we have a good idea of the immune response that stops infections, though, they can test boosters — which are functionally the same vaccine, with small tweaks — in smaller groups of people. We already know the shots are safe, so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255198/covid-vaccine-variant-update-mutation-south-africa-moderna"&gt;all they may need to do&lt;/a&gt; is check if the new version also pushes people’s immune system above the cutoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVIvTy"&gt;Together, this research outlines a way to keep people safe from COVID-19 going forward. It starts to ease fears that protection against the coronavirus would start to fade over time, putting communities at risk for outbreaks down the road. The virus is tricky, and variants are a curveball, but — luckily — the human immune system has ammunition as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6G96lf"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kjFvjM"&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id="CiL3lp"&gt;Finding and analyzing the rare cases of COVID-19 in people who have been vaccinated can give us crucial information about variants. But testing vaccinated people too often can have drawbacks, as well. (Katherine Wu / &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="qg1kyP"&gt;The shot could be the second vaccine available for people under 18 and key toward safely reopening schools in the fall. (Nicole Wetsman / &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KwSuh3"&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id="hPSCDe"&gt;The country hit this huge milestone in less than six months. (Bill Chappell / &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ueQpFU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/28/opinion/herd-immunity-covid-us.html"&gt;The U.S. may never hit the herd immunity threshold. That’s OK.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LyZUj6"&gt;In places like the United States, where half of the population has been vaccinated, the pandemic will slow and stop being a threat even without reaching the level needed for herd immunity. (Erin Mordecai, Mallory Harris and Marc Lipsitch / &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytPsYh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458230/covid-origins-lab-leak-biden-vaccines-pandemic"&gt;We have bigger problems than COVID-19’s origins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Glk1YS"&gt;Spending too much time arguing over the lab leak speculation is a distraction from the important steps governments need to take to end this pandemic and prepare for the next one. (Nicole Wetsman / &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="16POVD"&gt;Perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="1uCWOB"&gt;During a brainstorming session at the end of April, we discussed a number of ideas, including gift cards, direct payments and free tickets to sporting events. My chief adviser, Ann O’Donnell, who has been with me since my time in Congress, hesitantly suggested the idea of a lottery. She almost didn’t mention it because of its seeming absurdity. “This is kind of a wacky idea but ….”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="XQwDv0"&gt;—Ohio Governor Mike DeWine wrote &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/opinion/ohio-vaccine-lottery-mike-dewine.html"&gt;in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about the decision to give $1 million to five vaccinated adults through a lottery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TCzxef"&gt;More than numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MilWBe"&gt;To the people who have received the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/"&gt;1.8 billion vaccine doses&lt;/a&gt; distributed so far: thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AoQoH"&gt;To the more than 168,927,298 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wV5TE"&gt;To the families and friends of the 3,509,402 people who have died worldwide — 592,938 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKgofl"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAYi1O"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Memorial Day has brought about some fantastic tech deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 Pro Max is huge, but it has the best camera system on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zRkWPvx-QieAEmasEeRkIRezugI=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69360519/bfarsace_201106_4269_002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you have an iPhone, you owe it to yourself to get accessories that allow for fast charging.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ruUBlP"&gt;Memorial Day is Monday, May 31st, but many of the best deals in commemoration of the holiday are already live ahead of the weekend. We’ll always give you the most essential deals you need to know about in this column. But if you’re hungry for more (like, way more), my colleague Brandon Widder compiled the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/5/28/22453053/best-memorial-day-sales-2021-tech-deals-tvs-headphones"&gt;best Memorial Day deals&lt;/a&gt; on video games, headphones, TVs, and other odds and ends you might find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4oHtQ"&gt;Here are a few of the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oOtu7l"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="w5HO3v"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailysteals.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-20w-usb-c-power-adapter-usb-c-to-lightning-cable-bundle%3Fvariant%3D39311427207255&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F29%2F22458509%2Fmemorial-day-deals-tech-apple-usb-c-charger-beats-headphones-among-us-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Load up on fast charging accessories for your iPhone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oImSzs"&gt;If you own an iPhone 8 or a more recent iPhone model, it supports fast charging. But to obtain fast charging speeds, you’ll need the right hardware. Conveniently, we’ve worked with Daily Steals to secure a deal on a bundle that includes Apple’s 20W USB-C charger and a Lightning to USB-C cable. Normally $40, it costs a mere $15 when you use the code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEUSBC &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HbMKbP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10523257"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="4DNr3y"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ll8K2T"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/among-us"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is free for PC until June 3rd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UnL2n0"&gt;The multiplayer whodunnit game &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/among-us"&gt;is free to download&lt;/a&gt; for Windows on the Epic Games Store until June 3rd. It normally costs $5, so it isn’t a tremendous savings, but it’s a fantastic game with a healthy player base. To pick it up, however, you’ll need an account for Epic Games Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uk1zWU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10521776"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="L1W0In"&gt;

&lt;p id="rIWip6"&gt;Amazon has the best price yet on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931329/beats-solo-pro-review-noise-canceling-on-ear-wireless-headphones-features-price"&gt;Beats Solo Pro&lt;/a&gt; on-ear wireless headphones. Normally $300, they’re down to $150 in the gray colorway. The Solo Pro headphones feature active noise cancellation and Apple’s H1 wireless chip, which allows for hands-free voice commands and a fast, easy connection to an iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="NzqVAl"&gt;Through Monday, May 31st, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers can receive a few dollars off the cost of a $50 PlayStation Store gift card, which can be used on either the PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5. To claim the deal, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22220764%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;ued=https://www.eneba.com/us/psn-playstation-network-card-psn-50-usa-psn-key-united-states/jetpak" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;visit Eneba, click “Buy Now,”&lt;/a&gt; and type in the offer code &lt;strong&gt;50USDVERGE&lt;/strong&gt;. As for what you use the gift card on, check out &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/518b9425-a874-447f-b286-002ceca36cbf/"&gt;Sony’s Days of Play sale&lt;/a&gt; that’s bringing down the cost of several PS4 and PS5 games, including &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;, seen above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="PIH2B7"&gt;If you have oodles of Qi-ready devices, like a phone, AirPods, and a smartwatch, you can charge them all at the same time with Nomad’s Base Station Pro. This charging pad usually costs $200, &lt;a href="https://www.pjtra.com/t/8-10090-88849-119386?sid=VergeDealExclusiveApril2021&amp;amp;website=309942&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fbase-station-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but you can get it for $100 through Saturday&lt;/a&gt;. Just use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGE &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0bw81"&gt;Nomad’s high-end model is compatible with several devices from Apple, Samsung, and Google, with a few exceptions, including the Pixel 5 and Pixel Buds. Nomad also recently improved support for iPhone 12 devices that feature the MagSafe charging system. Long story short, the iPhone 12’s built-in magnet made recharging slower with the Base Station Pro, but it has recently been improved.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="X3AgWQ"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1398504702988390400?s=20"&gt;tweeted Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that deliveries of the automaker’s Model S Plaid would be delayed until June 10th because the car needs “one more week of tweak.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7iV0M"&gt;“This car feels like a spaceship,” tweeted Musk, who is also CEO of SpaceX. “Words cannot describe the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_resonance"&gt;limbic resonance&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wj6Kp"&gt;The company has been teasing the Plaid since 2019, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1395286896842985479?"&gt;Musk tweeted on May 20th&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla would hold a delivery event June 3rd at its factory in Fremont, California. &lt;/p&gt;

It’s a step up from Tesla’s Ludicrous trim level, and can reach 0-60 mph in less than two seconds, reaching top speeds up to 200 mph, according to Musk. &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/models/design#overview"&gt;The current specs on Tesla’s website&lt;/a&gt; show the Plaid will have range between 390 and 412 miles, with the forthcoming Plaid Plus at a range of more than 520 miles. Prices on Tesla’s website as of Saturday show the Model S Plaid purchase price starting at $119,990, and the Plaid Plus at $149,990. The Plaid Plus is listed as “available in mid-2022.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVneKY"&gt;The Plaid debuted in September 2019 at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20862105/tesla-model-s-plaid-laguna-seca-nurburgring-porsche-taycan"&gt;Laguna Seca raceway,&lt;/a&gt; where it ran the course in 1 minute and 36 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Venmo leaked Joe Biden’s friends, but you can now keep yours a secret</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Venmo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W46wb25jB5GMIgQLdPkUgUiWs1g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69359211/venmo1_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Venmo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0ZfrMK"&gt;Venmo has added new privacy controls for friend lists following a jaw-dropping incident where &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; was able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436847/venmo-contact-friends-list-not-private-president-joe-biden"&gt;track down President Joe Biden’s Venmo account&lt;/a&gt; because of the app’s leaky privacy protocols. App researcher Jane Manchun Wong discovered &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1398383802146168833"&gt;earlier on Friday&lt;/a&gt; that Venmo was working on the new controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJeRiD"&gt;“We’re consistently evolving and strengthening the Venmo platform for all of our customers. As part of these ongoing efforts, we are enhancing our in-app controls providing customers an option to select a public, friends-only, or private setting for their friends list,” a Venmo spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UlIHno"&gt;To find the new controls, tap the hamburger icon while on the main feed, then tap “Settings,” “Privacy,” and then “Friends List.” The Friends List menu appeared for me and another &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer while I was writing this article, so if it hasn’t rolled out to you just yet, sit tight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QI6yrB"&gt;In the new menu, you can pick if you want your friends list to be public, visible to friends, or private. You can also toggle whether or not you want to appear in others users’ friends list.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/buKJForJKGv1Vlo__xMkhgmM8x8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22547066/IMG_0591.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqMdsB"&gt;The new toggles fix a major privacy hole in Venmo that has been known for years: there previously was no way to keep your list of Venmo contacts private, meaning that you could see the contact list of any other user on the platform. The hole was bad enough that following a brief mention of Biden using Venmo in a recent &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/us/politics/joe-biden-policy-decisions.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; profile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/we-found-joe-bidens-secret-venmo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was able to track down the president’s account in less than 10 minutes. The publication also found the accounts for many in his inner circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kHpuC"&gt;While you’re in your privacy settings, I’d also recommend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/8/22374698/venmo-feed-matt-gaetz-public"&gt;setting your Venmo feed to private&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2rB0PM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PSA for US Congresspeople: here’s how to set your Venmo feed to private","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/8/22374698/venmo-feed-matt-gaetz-public"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cgcYj4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: Clarified that Venmo’s previous friend settings included a privacy flaw, not a security flaw.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple delays Podcasts subscriptions to June</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4N2LqGV-Go2B5YClyIs2R8yGGgs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69359138/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n0NyLH"&gt;Apple is delaying the launch of its upcoming Podcasts subscriptions until June, the company announced in an email sent to creators Friday (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/28/apple-delaying-podcasts-subscriptions-launch-until-june-promises-improvements-to-podcasts-app/amp/?__twitter_impression=true"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The service was previously set to launch this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjbNaY"&gt;Apple’s Podcasts subscriptions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;will allow people&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe to participating podcasts to get extra perks like ad-free listening or early access to episodes. In April, Apple said the subscriptions would launch in 170 countries, and that initial partners include Pushkin Industries and NPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bq5QCY"&gt;The shifted launch comes as some creators using Apple Podcasts &lt;a href="https://podnews.net/article/apple-podcasts-lemon-bugs?utm_source=podnews.net&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=podnews.net:2021-05-28"&gt;have recently run into some issues&lt;/a&gt;, such as being unable to log in to Apple’s Podcast Connect portal or seeing a delay in the availability of new episodes. In its email sent Friday, Apple said it has fixed the “disruptions” that presented problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7UXzb"&gt;You can read Apple’s full email to creators below, which the company shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ka4avf"&gt;We’re writing to provide an update on the availability of Apple Podcasts Subscriptions and channels. We’ve been delighted by the response to last month’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-leads-the-next-chapter-of-podcasting-with-apple-podcasts-subscriptions%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F28%2F22459129%2Fapple-delays-podcasts-subscriptions-june" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; and it’s exciting to see the hundreds of new subscriptions and channels submitted from creators across the globe every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvdhoL"&gt;To ensure we are delivering the best experience for creators and listeners, Apple Podcasts Subscriptions and channels will now launch in June. We will communicate further updates on availability, and best practices to help you prepare your subscriptions and channels, through this newsletter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nna6d5"&gt;Over the last few weeks, some creators have experienced delays in the availability of their content and access to Apple Podcasts Connect. We’ve addressed these disruptions and encourage creators experiencing any issues to &lt;a href="https://podcastsconnect.apple.com/contactus"&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LY27Uc"&gt;We’ve also heard from listeners and made adjustments based on their feedback with iOS 14.6, which was released on Monday. We will introduce additional enhancements to Library in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCvcwF"&gt;Thank you for your understanding. We can’t wait to see your new subscriptions and channels and we are looking forward to launching them to listeners around the world soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
