    <title>Microsoft and Qualcomm team up to create a Windows on ARM developer PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cVi05IIyr1pS3-0DFGGXmik9n5w=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69338185/windowsarmdevkit.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ePU7Bp"&gt;Microsoft has teamed up with Qualcomm to create a Windows on ARM-based dev kit for developers. The miniature PC will be sold at the Microsoft Store this summer, and is designed to be more affordable to encourage developers to create ARM64 apps for Snapdragon-based PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kjiTx"&gt;Until now, developers have had to purchase devices like the Surface Pro X to fully test their ARM64 apps on Windows. That’s a costly exercise for developers, particularly when the Surface Pro X retails from $999 and up. While Microsoft and Qualcomm haven’t put a price on this new dev kit, there are promises it will be more affordable than what developers can buy today. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xy6uWmfsi2MmwjF-ZXyVqMyL13I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19249917/akrales_190930_3688_0325.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Pro X was one of only a few options for devs previously.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xxo2dB"&gt;“This developer kit provides an affordable alternative to other consumer and commercial devices,” &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/05/24/qualcomm-enhances-support-developers-new-snapdragon-developer-kit-windows"&gt;says Miguel Nunes&lt;/a&gt;, senior director of product management at Qualcomm. “With the smaller desktop configuration, this kit gives developers more flexibility than notebook options, and at a lower price point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmfvMb"&gt;The announcement of the dev kit comes just as Qualcomm reveals its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451392/qualcomm-snapdragon-7c-gen-2-arm-processor"&gt;second-generation Snapdragon 7c ARM-powered processor&lt;/a&gt;. It’s designed for entry-level Windows PCs and Chromebooks, with a clock speed bump over the original. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLKRd5"&gt;This dev kit will also help developers test Microsoft’s new x64 app emulation for Windows on ARM. This &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168542/x64-emulation-windows-on-arm-surface-pro-x"&gt;went into testing&lt;/a&gt; for Windows in December, and allows users to run 64-bit apps that haven’t been compiled for ARM-based devices yet. The emulation layer will bring a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495510/microsoft-windows-on-arm-x64-app-emulation"&gt;whole host of app compatibility&lt;/a&gt; to Windows on ARM once it’s fully available to end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkMnwT"&gt;Microsoft and Qualcomm are promising to reveal more about this dev kit during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452640/microsoft-build-2021-live-stream-watch-how-to-event"&gt;Build 2021 today&lt;/a&gt;, at a session entitled “What’s new for Windows desktop application developers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read iFixit’s damning take on Samsung’s ‘ruined’ upcycling program</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kxbFoJ96YvzR9z6mJTyOiV5CCVI=/233x0:2393x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69338167/Screen_Shot_2021_05_11_at_6.32.02_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from Samsung’s 2017 trailer.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Djd6ED"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F50450%2Fsamsung-galaxy-upcycling-unlocked-smartphone-smarthome-project&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22452693%2Fifixit-samung-galaxy-upcycling-e-waste-initiative-program" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new blog post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt; heavily criticizes Samsung’s recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395694/samsung-galaxy-phone-upcycle-smart-home-sensor-iot"&gt;Galaxy Upcycling program&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/ifixit-tells-the-sad-story-of-how-samsung-ruined-its-upcycling-program/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ArsTechnica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), an initiative which the repair specialists helped launch in 2017. It’s a damning look at how the initiative morphed from its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9ujIbdi33g"&gt;ambitious origins&lt;/a&gt; to a “nearly unrecognizable” final form, and completely sidelined &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt; in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3URVN"&gt;Here’s how &lt;em&gt;iFixit &lt;/em&gt;describes the original plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qpTbL7"&gt;The original Upcycling announcement had huge potential. The purpose was twofold: unlock phones’ bootloaders—which would have incidentally assisted other reuse projects like LineageOS—and foster an open source marketplace of applications for makers. You could run any operating system you wanted. It could have made a real dent in the huge and ever-growing e-waste problem by giving older Samsung devices some value (no small feat, that). It was a heck of a lot more interesting than the usual high-level pledges from device makers about carbon offsets and energy numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fbQLjc"&gt;You can see this original vision on display in a Samsung trailer from 2017 (embedded below). Samsung outlined how an old smartphone could be turned into a sensor for a fish tank, simultaneously re-using an old phone while at the same time helping to stop people from needing to buy a dedicated single-use device. Other potential ideas included turning old phones into smart home controllers, weather stations and nanny cams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qTg5CG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9ujIbdi33g?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4pTUhi"&gt;It sounds like a cool initiative, and &lt;em&gt;iFixit &lt;/em&gt;was initially&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;heavily involved. It lent its branding to the launch, and its CEO Kyle Wiens helped announce the project onstage at Samsung’s developer conference. It had even planned to expand its support pages and spare parts program for Samsung phones had the project shipped, but...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8esRul"&gt;Instead, we heard crickets. The actual software was never posted. The Samsung team eventually stopped returning our emails. Friends inside the company told us that leadership wasn’t excited about a project that didn’t have a clear product tie-in or revenue plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TegTdG"&gt;So what’s the problem with the program in its 2021 form? Two things: it only goes back three years to the Galaxy S9, and it only gives it basic smart home functionality. Less, in other words, than what’s possible from a cheap $40 Raspberry Pi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ujMEdO"&gt;So instead of an actually-old Galaxy becoming an automatic pet feeder, full-fledged Linux computer, retro game console, a wooden-owl Alexa alternative, or anything else that you or a community of hackers can dream of, the new program will take a phone you can still sell for $160 and turn it into something like a $30 sensor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cvIlqh"&gt;Most will have probably just shrugged and moved on when they saw Samsung’s upcycling announcement &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-latest-innovations-for-a-better-normal-at-ces-2021"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s disappointing to realize that the project could have been so much more. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F50450%2Fsamsung-galaxy-upcycling-unlocked-smartphone-smarthome-project&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22452693%2Fifixit-samung-galaxy-upcycling-e-waste-initiative-program" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iFixit’s &lt;/em&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; is well worth reading in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Microsoft’s Build conference</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W7R61V9MPcapanSXAW_vjGjQZJc=/0x0:1517x1011/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69338080/msedge_JeBCq3Q4cI.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pJbeGe"&gt;Microsoft Build, the company’s annual developer conference, is &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/build2021/#webcast"&gt;kicking off today, May 25th&lt;/a&gt;. Just like last year, the conference is happening in an online-only format rather than in-person in Seattle. The developer conference is typically where Microsoft details upcoming changes to its Windows, Office, and cloud platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p76c3a"&gt;There’ll be around 48 hours of Build content in total taking place over the next two days, kicking off with a keynote today on May 25th starting at 11AM ET. A full agenda is available over on the &lt;a href="https://mybuild.microsoft.com/home"&gt;Microsoft Build website&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a mix of keynotes, technical deep dives, and breakout sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OY9t3n"&gt;How do I watch Microsoft Build?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="W6myAg"&gt;You’ll need &lt;a href="https://register.build.microsoft.com/"&gt;to register&lt;/a&gt; to attend the virtual Build conference, but doing so is free and gives you access to over 300 sessions as of this writing. You can use Microsoft’s scheduler to plan out which sessions to attend &lt;a href="https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions?t=%257B%2522from%2522%253A%25222021-05-25T00%253A00%253A00%252B01%253A00%2522%252C%2522to%2522%253A%25222021-05-27T23%253A59%253A00%252B01%253A00%2522%257D"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VHa3N"&gt;Microsoft is also streaming Build over on its developer YouTube channel. We’ve embedded a link to the first day’s livestream below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sLVMjP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xB7vqWEgifc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9SUY49"&gt;What time does Microsoft Build start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pztMT7"&gt;If you’re watching along, Microsoft’s stream begins at 8AM PT / 11AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IITCfG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDdxxD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Terrible news, everyone: AI is learning how to post cringe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-rZmMUeo7srA3D2y6Zfrr-Qe2Vs=/57x0:594x358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69337999/replica_ai_rap.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="35dvIM"&gt;People like to argue that technology is value neutral; that it’s neither inherently good nor inherently bad, but can simply be put to different uses. As a rebuttal, I’d like to direct the court’s attention to exhibit a), a video of “digital humans” rapping using AI-synthesized voices, that is intrinsically awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2qISq"&gt;Indeed, I’d argue that the video above not only disproves the whole value-neutral thing, but makes a decent case for shutting down this “technology” lark altogether and heading back to the trees before it’s too late. What I mean is: AI is posting cringe and I don’t like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvn0lc"&gt;Okay, so I’m being a little harsh here and the video is obviously a joke. It’s the work of &lt;a href="https://replicastudios.com/"&gt;Replica&lt;/a&gt;, an AI startup that does interesting things with synthetic speech. The company tells us that during a recent hackathon, one employee worked out how to capture live audio of himself rapping and transfer “the timing, cadence and energy of his delivery onto one of our AI voices.” Combined with a little 3D animation and rendering, this video is the result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhy8EU"&gt;For fairness, here’s Replica’s &lt;em&gt;mea culpa&lt;/em&gt;, sent to us via email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="gdsljN"&gt;“DISCLAIMER - we know this video is deep in the heart of the uncanny valley. That’s not because the tech is bad, it’s because we’re amateurs at using 3D real-time rendering software - that’s not our speciality. The only reason this video exists is because the team created this during an internal company hackathon for fun using a new feature that’s under development, not yet open to the public.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HzFlYT"&gt;That feature in question is an upcoming integration due to be announced at GDC in July between Replica’s speech synthesis tools and Unreal Engine’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276265/epic-games-digital-human-creator-unreal-engine-realistic-human-faces"&gt;MetaHumans&lt;/a&gt; software, which generates realistic CGI humans. By combining the two tools, says Replica, anyone will be able to “create lip sync dialogue for games and movies, and even rap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ByW0x6"&gt;As a reminder, though, you can also &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; do that. Just a thought.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new Fuchsia OS arrives first on old Nest Hub</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XpGAQ3p0lV9oJJ3E0c1UKTyKdxo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69337895/dseifert_181018_3039_1211.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Nest Hub.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fDPc1f"&gt;Google’s long-awaited Fuchsia OS is starting to quietly roll out on its first consumer device, the first-generation Nest Hub, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/25/google-releases-fuchsia-os-nest-hub/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Google’s work on Fuchsia OS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/15/12480566/google-fuchsia-new-operating-system"&gt;first emerged in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and the open-source operating system is notable for not being based on a Linux kernel, instead using a microkernel called Zircon. “You don’t ship a new operating system every day, but today is that day,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/petrh/status/1397088244337049603"&gt;tweeted a Google technical lead&lt;/a&gt; on the Fuchsia OS project, Petr Hosek. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ro1I12"&gt;While the rollout on the Nest Hub (which originally released as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Google Home Hub&lt;/a&gt; before being renamed) begins today, the whole release process will take several months. It’ll come to users in the Preview Program first, before slowly releasing more broadly. We’ve known for a while that the operating system &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2018/10/10/google-home-hub-fuchsia-os/"&gt;has been tested on the Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, and earlier this month more evidence for a release emerged thanks to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/03/google-nest-hub-bluetooth-sig-fuchsia-1-0/"&gt;a Bluetooth SIG listing&lt;/a&gt; that showed the Nest Hub running Fuchsia 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3rqXzx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You don't ship a new operating system every day, but today is that day.&lt;/p&gt;— Petr Hosek (@petrh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/petrh/status/1397088244337049603?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="poNbaZ"&gt;Although the Nest Hub will swap its current Cast OS for Fuchsia OS, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes that the experience is likely to be almost identical, and most users are unlikely to even notice the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FiQbNg"&gt;All of this raises the question of what exactly Fuchsia OS is meant to achieve. Google calls it a “production-grade operating system that is secure, updatable, inclusive, and pragmatic.” We know that the OS could eventually power laptops and smartphones (Google was spotted testing it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/2/16840242/google-fuchsia-operating-system-pixelbook"&gt;on the Pixelbook back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently it proposed a solution for how it could &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/12/google-fuchsia-os-android-linux-programs-starnix/"&gt;run Android and Linux apps&lt;/a&gt;), but Fuchsia is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18563521/google-fuchsia-os-android-chrome-hiroshi-lockheimer-secrets-revealed#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re,other%20products"&gt;not meant to be a one-for-one replacement&lt;/a&gt; of Android or Chrome OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21ktIO"&gt;“Fuchsia is about just pushing the state of the art in terms of operating systems and things that we learn from Fuchsia we can incorporate into other products,” Android and Chrome chief Hiroshi Lockheimer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18563521/google-fuchsia-os-android-chrome-hiroshi-lockheimer-secrets-revealed"&gt;said cryptically in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Google’s smart display is unlikely to be the last device or even form-factor to receive an update to Fuchsia OS. But the exact implications for the switch might take longer to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVVNL7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei founder says company should dodge sanctions by pivoting to software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CHINA-TAIYUAN-HUAWEI-REN ZHENGFEI-INTERVIEW (CN)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/olJ--rvA6LuO1reJRcwQ5pd3rP4=/0x0:5302x3535/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69337761/1231073698.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DbcmVw"&gt;Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei has reportedly urged the Chinese tech giant’s staff to turn the company into a major software force as a way to alleviate the impact of devastating US sanctions. In an internal memo &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/huawei-founder-urges-software-push-counter-us-sanctions-2021-05-24/"&gt;viewed by Reuters&lt;/a&gt;, Ren says that Huawei should focus on software because the industry is “outside of US control and we will have greater independence and autonomy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPLXK1"&gt;Huawei is presently unable to mass-produce much of its hardware products because of sanctions forbidding US firms from doing business with it. The company stockpiled chips and components in an attempt to mitigate the sanctions, but the reserves are limited and in some cases will be swiftly obsoleted. Huawei is also blocked from using Google apps and services on its smartphones. The Biden administration hasn’t suggested that it will reverse any of the Trump-era sanctions, although the US has eased off its moves against other Chinese companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22431838/xiaomi-us-blacklist-remove-trump-lawsuit"&gt;like Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt; and TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IMVYwq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A HarmonyOS announcement is coming next week&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ut1TGT"&gt;Because of this climate, Ren reportedly told employees that Huawei is to focus on software including MindSpore, its cloud AI platform, and its HarmonyOS operating system for various devices. The company is said to be planning to compete in major markets other than the US. “Once we dominate Europe, the Asia Pacific and Africa, if US standards don’t match ours, and we can’t enter the US, then the US can’t enter our territory,” Ren wrote, according to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGdKxH"&gt;It may not be long before an important part of Huawei’s software strategy is revealed. Today, the company sent out a promotional image on WeChat teasing a major HarmonyOS-related announcement for June 2nd. The operating system is yet to launch on smartphones, with the initial focus being IoT devices and TVs upon its early release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>J.J. Abrams says the Valve Portal movie is ‘finally on the rails’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Portal GLaDOS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sr0Wsl863WQSOnDJiLSu0cTOBlY=/68x0:1100x688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69337264/portal-glados.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s been a long time. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tax4e4hBBZc" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How have you been?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RVNv7u"&gt;J.J. Abrams has said that a movie based on Valve’s &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; is still in the works, and that a script is finally being written, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/portal-half-life-jj-abrams-news"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Abrams is light on details, but says that Warner Brothers is excited about the direction the movie is going in, and that it “feels like that thing’s finally on the rails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpVM0T"&gt;We originally heard about the movie &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/6/3960164/half-life-portal-movie-gabe-newell-jj-abrams"&gt;all the way back in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, when Abrams and Gabe Newell were on stage together at the DICE Summit. At the time, Abrams apparently &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/2/6/3960520/jj-abrams-valve-half-life-portal-movies"&gt;told Polygon&lt;/a&gt; that the plan was “as real as anything in Hollywood ever gets.” That was eight years ago, so it seems he was right to couch it like that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt='via &amp;lt;a href="http://d35lb3dl296zwu.cloudfront.net/uploads/photo/image/10009/2013-02-05_22-38-24-1020.jpg"&amp;gt;d35lb3dl296zwu.cloudfront.net&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;' data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wPVfTY1wB376RKSktVA-U2HqvzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14229168/2013-02-05_22-38-24-1020.1419979261.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the archives: Abrams and Newell on stage at DICE 2013 Summit, talking about movies and games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0Hwhlq"&gt;We’ve heard confirmations that both the &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt; movies were still in the works from both &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/12/jj-abrams-portal-half-life-movies-still-happening"&gt;Abrams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Gaben/comments/5olhj4/hi_im_gabe_newell_ama/dck96v9/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Newell&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 and 2017 respectively, but news about either movie has been scarce since then. Talking to &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;, Abrams did mention that his production company, Bad Robot, isn’t actively involved in the “&lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt; thing” at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CmHgo"&gt;Like games, movies can also suffer from development hell, though some do make it out: Zach Snyder’s &lt;em&gt;Army of The Dead&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421065/zack-snyder-army-of-the-dead-netflix-theater-release"&gt;released on Netflix on May 21st&lt;/a&gt;, was &lt;a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/149679/Snyder-Raises-Another-Army"&gt;announced in 2007&lt;/a&gt;. This is to say that, while it does seem like there’s signs of life for the movie, it’s not time to break out the ca— er, celebratory muffins just yet. It seems like it’s still in early development, and we’ll just have to wait and see if it actually manages to solve the puzzle of how to make a movie in the &lt;em&gt;Half-Life &lt;/em&gt;universe, or if it gets stuck flying between two portals (or companies, in this case).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Evidence is piling up that Netflix wants to be the Netflix of games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gORAwq_MiM3G9uBXYL-m5ARGfHU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69337057/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DFgGfT"&gt;Netflix has dipped a toe in gaming on occasion, with perhaps the hugely-successful “choose your own adventure”-style film &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as the most prominent example. But the streaming giant may be expanding further into gaming with a new bundle for Netflix subscribers, according to several reports over the past few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDsDM0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; had the &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/netflix-seeks-executive-to-expand-game-efforts"&gt;first report on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, writing that Netflix wants to hire an executive to oversee new gaming efforts, and that the company is considering a bundle of games similar to Apple Arcade. (Hours later, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/netflix-looking-hire-executive-gaming-expansion-information-2021-05-21/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; corroborated&lt;/a&gt; that a gaming exec is a planned hire at Netflix.) The company has also chosen not to include ads in the games, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. But &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; also said that Netflix’s plans are still “very much in flux.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CsUhBQ"&gt;In a report published Monday, however, &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; shared more details from &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/netflix-gaming-expansion-cde0f3ae-15de-4378-b2b8-fd0aaf0e91f6.html"&gt;its own reporting.&lt;/a&gt; An &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; source said to think of the upcoming service, which would be offered to Netflix subscribers, as “a smaller Apple Arcade” bundle that would include both licensed Netflix IP and games commissioned from indie studios. The service could be a ways out, though, “possibly launching in 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWEmB4"&gt;While Netflix hasn’t publicly confirmed the potential expansion of its gaming efforts, in a statement published by both &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22447410/netflix-executive-games-expansion-the-information-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company left the door open to the idea that it is indeed planning to do more with gaming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="029bIB"&gt;Our members value the variety and quality of our content. It’s why we’ve continually expanded our offering — from series to documentaries, film, local language originals and reality TV. Members also enjoy engaging more directly with stories they love — through interactive shows like &lt;em&gt;Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;You v. Wild,&lt;/em&gt; or games based on &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;La&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Casa de Papel&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;To All the Boys&lt;/em&gt;. So we’re excited to do more with interactive entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HLKHeC"&gt;Netflix has &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of titles based on popular video games that are out now or in the works, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/7/15938192/netflix-castlevania-review-animated-video-game-adaptation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403849/netflix-resident-evil-tv-series-original-live-action-announcement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075927/netflix-the-witcher-viewer-numbers-length-metrics-q4-2019-earnings"&gt;one of Netflix’s biggest shows&lt;/a&gt;), so the company clearly sees the value of video games as IP. It’s not outlandish to think that the company would want to market its series through new games, or, in the ultimate ouroboros, make a new game that eventually becomes a new &lt;em&gt;Netflix&lt;/em&gt; show in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqC2vE"&gt;Netflix seemed to be on its way in 2019 — it had partnered with Telltale Games on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18510849/stranger-things-secret-games-telltale-studio-closed"&gt;a secret &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; game that died before it was announced&lt;/a&gt;, with a source telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “Netflix was just getting into the space and didn’t really have a games group in place yet.” Telltale’s &lt;em&gt;Minecraft: Story Mode&lt;/em&gt; did survive, though, and is still at least partially playable &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80227995"&gt;on Netflix now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3ApuPF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The tragic end of Telltale Games","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17934166/telltale-games-studio-closed-layoffs-end-the-walking-dead"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hovQyS"&gt;Many companies are trying to build a service that’s “Netflix, but for games.” Apple Arcade and Xbox Game Pass are just two that come to mind. But these reports and Netflix’s curious non-denial suggest Netflix might like to eat its own lunch this time around.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google now lets you password-protect the page that shows all your searches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lyCsln3VB1_nWpdXpUBKqZnetyI=/0x0:1578x1052/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69336891/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_3.45.59_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yNRerP"&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7028918?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;added a way to put a password&lt;/a&gt; on your Web and Activity page, which shows all your activity from across Google services, including your searches, YouTube watch history, and Google assistant queries (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/05/22/you-can-now-password-protect-your-google-accounts-my-activity-history/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Without the verification, anyone who picks up a device you’re logged into could see that activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFCqxY"&gt;To activate the verification, you can go to &lt;a href="https://activity.google.com"&gt;activity.google.com&lt;/a&gt;, and click the Manage My Activity verification link. From there, you can select the Require Extra Verification option, save, and enter your password to confirm that you’re the one trying to make the change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sIME1BIfephVnlZaDs8FS3ESf4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22537120/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_3.39.49_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The page can be very revealing, but also lets you manage a ton of your data in one place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gBINmw"&gt;If you don’t have the verification turned on, visiting &lt;a href="https://activity.google.com"&gt;activity.google.com&lt;/a&gt; will show a stream of your Google activity from across your devices, without asking for a password.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UfjlNRGKXrjYqburxMJ0UegJQW8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22537113/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_3.33.31_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Search history can show a lot about a person.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gOvbLK"&gt;Turning on verification, however, will require whoever’s trying to see the information to click the Verify button and enter the Google account password before it’ll show any history. For those who share a computer, or who sometimes lets others who aren’t exactly trustworthy use their device, this could be a very useful toggle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CPZ6NRHw8YWGticGnLTxetfU_2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22537115/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_3.30.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now no one will know.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sIME1BIfephVnlZaDs8FS3ESf4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22537120/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_3.39.49_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ULk7wg"&gt;While you’re on the Web and App Activity page, you can also take a look at what activity Google is saving, and whether it’s being auto-deleted. Then, you can decide if you’re happy with those settings. If not, this is the page to change them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxvWxE"&gt;At Google’s I/O keynote last week, it talked a lot about privacy with its announcement of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22436367/google-io-android-private-computer-core-machine-learning-data-privacy"&gt;Android’s new Private Compute Core&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442416/google-photos-locked-folder-private-hidden-pictures"&gt;locked photos folder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-io-android-12-chrome-features-lock-up-photos-browsing-history-location-data/"&gt;the ability to quickly delete&lt;/a&gt; your past 15 minutes of browsing in Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple stayed on message while Epic filled out the record</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G8klKtHRvaVYWrvOmobOmGIRUsY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69336515/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1FSSBv"&gt;Sure, “hot-tubbing” &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; fun, but in a court context, it’s just a judge encouraging lawyers to argue — which is how &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; ended today. Not with a bang but with a quarrel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbuGmB"&gt;In honor of the trial’s final day, a raft of spare lawyers were in the gallery, representing Epic and Apple. But everyone who spoke to the judge — Epic’s Gary Bornstein and the three lawyers who handled the end of the case for Apple, Dan Swanson, Veronica Smith Moye, and Richard Doren — had their backs to the gallery the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OU1n2W"&gt;Throughout the trial, Epic’s general strategy appears to have been to stuff the record as full of evidence as possible — just in case it’s needed on the inevitable appeal. To do that, Epic sacrificed telling a coherent story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4vmxWH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple had a clear story and it spent the entire trial hammering it home&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AxNHLE"&gt;Apple, on the other hand, was on brand. It had a clear story and it spent the entire trial hammering it home: Apple controls the App Store because the alternative would be a security and privacy nightmare. Whether it was Swanson, Moye, or Doren at the podium, this story didn’t waver, just as it mostly didn’t waver throughout the rest of the trial. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;Tim Cook biffed this&lt;/a&gt; by citing a business model and not mentioning security.) Phil Schiller, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441304/apple-phil-schiller-epic-iphone-testimony-app-store"&gt;Apple’s marketing guru&lt;/a&gt;, sat at the table with the lawyers throughout the trial; from time to time, I found myself wondering how involved he was in crafting the lawyers’ messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDbVsS"&gt;Both parties agreed that the top two issues of the day were market definition and remedies. Who you will agree with in the end is going to depend on how the market is defined, I suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bt1hH4"&gt;For Epic, we’re talking mobile app stores, and the question of the operating system on the phone is key. After all, even though Samsung and LG and whoever else make phones, from a developer’s point of view that doesn’t matter. You’re making games for Android or iOS. This seems fairly sensible, particularly after Schiller &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441304/apple-phil-schiller-epic-iphone-testimony-app-store"&gt;cited extremely minor competition&lt;/a&gt; in his testimony: Amazon’s Fire tablets and Microsoft’s failed Windows phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X57l1x"&gt;It is less clear to me why game consoles should be excluded as competition. Apple, obviously, wants to say there’s a &lt;em&gt;great deal&lt;/em&gt; of competition — but to tell the truth, my initial reaction to this antitrust trial was, “But can’t you just play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on a console?” Epic’s Bornstein mentioned that most consoles aren’t mobile; as the owner of a handheld Nintendo Switch, I strongly disagree! Bornstein had, of course, thought of this — the Switch doesn’t connect to wireless networks, he said, and thus is not truly “mobile.” By this standard, anyone who owns an iPhone that has the functionality for data over the cellular network switched off — perhaps because they are a child and a parent handled this setting, or perhaps because they are just cheap — also doesn’t truly own a mobile phone. That seems incorrect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6o8Lwo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“But can’t you just play ‘Fortnite’ on a console?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0myP52"&gt;Hilariously, Apple’s Swanson pointed out that it is not the ‘90s. What he meant was that we don’t just have one device — multiple devices are much more the norm than they used to be. If all these devices are substitutes for each other, then what does it matter to users if they have to use a PC or a console to get to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;? Some testimony we heard from Apple’s experts earlier in the trial suggested that 80 percent of iOS players were making their in-app purchases elsewhere, Swanson reminded us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARkpvM"&gt;The reason the market definition matters so much is clear: if I agree with Apple’s view that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is a game, and the competitive market is basically anywhere I can buy a game, Epic has no case. But if I agree with Epic’s view that the relevant market is mobile app distribution, then Apple’s refusal to allow any apps that aren’t in the app store on the iPhone is pretty unquestionably monopolistic. This is where Epic’s failure to tell a clear, simple, and coherent story sets its case back. Even if I agree that Apple has at times deliberately hamstrung its competition — and I do agree with this, otherwise there would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;no green bubbles on iMessage&lt;/a&gt; — I still can’t say in simple language why consoles aren’t an acceptable substitute for gaming on mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipjXDh"&gt;But leave that aside. I’m not the judge, after all! And Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers pointed out that it was possible Epic’s proposed remedy — allowing other app stores onto the iPhone and allowing side-loading of apps — &lt;em&gt;destroyed&lt;/em&gt; consumer choice. After all, she suggested, people are generally aware of Apple’s tightly controlled ecosystem and are choosing it on purpose. Besides, she noted, the cost of apps in Google’s store was roughly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iF8g7z"&gt;Well, Epic’s Bornstein said, that’s because it’s a duopoly. There is only one place in the record where Apple concerns itself with pricing pressure: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418828/apple-app-store-commission-30-percent-phil-schiller-2011-epic-lawsuit"&gt;a 2011 email from Schiller&lt;/a&gt;, asking if at some point Apple may have to lower their commission. Apparently, pricing competition still hasn’t caused Apple to lower its commission, unless a lawsuit counts as “competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zYgfwN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This line of questioning suggested that Gonzales Rogers agreed there isn’t competitive pressure on Apple’s pricing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="batGhH"&gt;See, Apple’s small developer program, which dropped the commission for certain studios, seemed to be the result of &lt;em&gt;this lawsuit&lt;/em&gt; more than anything else. (“The issue with the $1 million Small Business Program, at least from what I’ve seen thus far: that really wasn’t the result of competition. That seemed to be a result of the pressure that you’re feeling from investigations, from lawsuits, not competition,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;Gonzales Rogers said last week&lt;/a&gt;.) This skeptical line of questioning suggested, at least to me, that Gonzales Rogers agreed there isn’t competitive pressure on Apple’s pricing. That’s probably welcome news for Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nsP7c"&gt;The day’s other hot topic was remedies — if Apple does indeed have a monopoly and is acting anti-competitively with it, what should be the outcome? Epic wanted to prohibit the restrictions that make the App Store the sole option for downloading apps on iOS — which would mean allowing both side-loading and other game stores on the iPhone. Epic also wanted to get rid of the requirement that in-app transactions for digital goods must use Apple’s in-app purchase processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iBo2lk"&gt;To Apple, this just meant that Epic wants to use Apple’s IP — like developer tools — without paying for it. After all, Apple’s Doren pointed out, the company could have only allowed its own apps on the iPhone, as it did with the very first one (which was promptly jailbroken so other apps could be loaded, but never mind).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gq9539"&gt;Gonzalez Rogers seemed skeptical about the remedies. Besides the IP question, which there was a healthy back-and-forth about, she asked Epic’s Bornstein to cite some cases where courts required businesses to totally change their business model. Well, there’s Microsoft, Bornstein said. Yes, but that case had been brought by the government, and Epic is not the government. In fact, Gonzalez Rogers said, Epic hadn’t shown her a single comparable antitrust case where the kind of ruling Epic was requesting had been granted by a court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gtNJV"&gt;Setting aside the fact that I am not a mind reader nor a judge, what I heard in court today didn’t sound like a win for Epic. Yes, the record is stuffed full of times Apple behaved badly. But the question isn’t whether Apple has always behaved well. I walked out of court feeling Apple had the upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYxTTz"&gt;Of course, all the evidence Epic crammed on the record may serve them beyond an appeal. After all, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404493/amy-klobuchar-interview-antitrust-book-hearings-big-tech"&gt;Amy Klobuchar has said she’s watching this trial closely&lt;/a&gt;. So even if Epic loses this battle, its strategy may win the war — by creating new antitrust laws.&lt;/p&gt;
