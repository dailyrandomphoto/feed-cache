    <title>Ikea is working with Sonos on a hidden speaker built into art you hang on the wall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gGae2NmCSMaP9XKPgFdN9f7Vzo4=/111x0:1755x1096/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085093/Screen_Shot_2021_04_06_at_2.32.32_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pyVQSv"&gt;Ikea and Sonos are starting to tease the next products that the two companies have collaborated on. The furniture giant today &lt;a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/speakers/news/sonos/156425-sonos-confirms-new-ikea-symfonisk-speaker-is-coming"&gt;posted an Instagram story&lt;/a&gt; that directly mentions the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound"&gt;“Symfonisk” line&lt;/a&gt; and flashes the Sonos logo at the end, so there’s little doubt that new hardware is coming soon. Two fresh filings have also just appeared at the Federal Communications Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfg6so"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; can exclusively share details on what’s coming. The first new product, &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/FHO-920-00632"&gt;covered in this filing&lt;/a&gt;, is a revamped version of the Symfonisk table lamp. It’s expected to be sold for around the same price ($179) as the original product, which basically stuffed the sound quality of a Sonos Play:1 into the body of a lamp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KVJwc"&gt;But from what &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; understands, the $99 Symfonisk bookshelf speaker — the most affordable gateway into the Sonos platform — is not due for any major updates. Instead, the second product that Ikea and Sonos will announce in 2021 is completely new: a piece of wall art with an integrated speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bA8mj97J1mfqbKBAaGNxjMWwC44=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18332906/cwelch_190724_3559_2256.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ikea and Sonos are also preparing an updated table lamp speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7EOksw"&gt;Companies like Soundwall have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/21/14686272/soundwall-nova-launch-speaker-art"&gt;produced artwork speakers before&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s safe to assume that Ikea and Sonos are targeting a price point that’s dramatically lower than those expensive products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfwlz6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has seen an early image of this product, codenamed “Titan,” but details about how it functions couldn’t yet be learned. Specifically, it’s unclear whether the entire artwork print is the product or if the speaker unit can be transferred between different exterior art housings. One of the two new FCC filings from Ikea and Sonos is for &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/FHO-920-00632"&gt;a “wireless module.”&lt;/a&gt; At a distance, it could look like any of Ikea’s wall prints, only with much more tech on the other side (and a power cord running down from the bottom).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="dPk7BM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10432368"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="au8RD2"&gt;All of the Symfonisk products so far have been designed with a dual purpose in mind. The lamp combines a speaker and light source; the bookshelf speaker can literally be used as a shelf when mounted to a wall. And they’re also meant to blend into home decor. From that angle, combining artwork and a music speaker seems like a natural progression for the Symfonisk series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5A99o"&gt;I’ve heard from a fair number of Sonos customers who use the Symfonisk bookshelf speakers as rear surrounds for Sonos’ Arc and Beam soundbars. They work very well for that purpose, but a stereo pair of wall art speakers could make for an even sleeker home theater setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2V8Em"&gt;Ikea and Sonos have not yet revealed exactly when they plan to announce their latest collaborative efforts. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Sonos for comment. In the immediate future, Sonos is gearing up for the launch of its new Sonos Roam, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313451/sonos-roam-leak-features-specs-price-release-date"&gt;a product first leaked by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which starts shipping on April 20th. You can read my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22368487/sonos-roam-bluetooth-speaker-review-features"&gt;full review of that excellent portable speaker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal is testing a payments feature that lets you send cryptocurrency to friends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7krYp4GTId4FksGKcsb8NJz0nNM=/48x0:2073x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69084630/payments_hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Signal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bYv2gU"&gt;Signal &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/help-us-test-payments-in-signal/"&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; it’s now testing a new peer-to-peer payments system in the beta version of its apps. Appropriately called Signal Payments, the new feature right now supports only one protocol: the MobileCoin wallet and its companion cryptocurrency MOB. MobileCoin has a close relationship with Signal co-founder and CEO Moxie Marlinspike, who advised the company prior to its &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/mobilecoin-a-cryptocurrency-involving-signal-founder-moxie-marlinspike-just-raised-venture-funding/"&gt;most recent round of funding announced last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uc7YcI"&gt;“The first payments protocol we’ve added support for is a privacy focused payments network called MobileCoin, which has its own currency, MOB,” wrote Jun Harada, Signal’s head of growth and communication, in a &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/help-us-test-payments-in-signal/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “As always, our goal is to keep your data in your hands rather than ours; MobileCoin’s design means Signal does not have access to your balance, full transaction history, or funds. You can also transfer your funds at any time if you want to switch to another app or service.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L6_fQUckH7quKkzlE6YPQUuKLaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424615/payments_product.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Signal&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7rOAFc"&gt;The company says those interested in trying out the feature must live in the UK for now, and those who qualify can sign up for MobileCoin and access the feature through the &lt;a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-How-do-I-join-Signal-s-beta-"&gt;Signal beta&lt;/a&gt;. “This is a beta feature in a &lt;a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-How-do-I-join-Signal-s-beta-"&gt;beta build&lt;/a&gt;, but for those in the United Kingdom living life on the edge, please help us test and give feedback,” Harada writes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says it’s no longer replenishing Oculus Rift S supplies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DdsR_YTG0naX8qvqM2cWpIsJrGw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69084618/nstatt_190318_3307_9378.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nick Statt / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fjAZn4"&gt;Facebook says Oculus Rift S headsets “generally” won’t be replenished as they disappear from store shelves, marking the end of the virtual reality system’s life span. &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/rift-s-dead"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, Facebook has confirmed that “generally speaking, as channels sell out of stock, they won’t be replenished moving forward.” The PC-tethered headset is unavailable through Oculus’ store, and it’s out of stock on retail platforms like Amazon and Walmart in the US, except from third-party sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RyNG5W"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21422717/facebook-oculus-rift-s-discontinued-quest-2-vr-connect"&gt;announced last year&lt;/a&gt; that it would discontinue the Oculus Rift S in 2021. While the headset was a successor to the landmark Oculus Rift, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523941/oculus-rift-s-review-vr-headset-price-specs-features"&gt;compromised on features&lt;/a&gt; like screen resolution and refresh rate, particularly compared to high-end PC-based competitors like the Valve Index. Meanwhile, Facebook shifted its focus to the self-contained Oculus Quest, a mobile headset that can also be plugged into a desktop PC — making it functionally a replacement for the Rift S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqUCat"&gt;According to some reports, that strategy was a marked departure from Oculus’ earlier plans. Oculus co-founder Brendan Iribe left the company in 2018, reportedly after Facebook &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/oculus-co-founder-is-leaving-facebook-after-cancellation-of-rift-2-headset/"&gt;canceled a higher-end&lt;/a&gt; “Rift 2” headset. Also-departed Oculus founder Palmer Luckey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1379260970090946562"&gt;alluded to that rumor&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter today, saying he was “imagining a world where Rift 2 was not cancelled shortly before going into production and then cancelled again in favor of a much lower spec Lenovo rebadge.” (The Oculus Rift S was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273152/oculus-rift-s-vr-headset-announced-pricing-release-date-features-gdc-2019"&gt;produced in partnership&lt;/a&gt; with Lenovo.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roIvSx"&gt;Moving to standalone designs, though, has apparently worked well for Facebook so far. Facebook says last year’s Oculus Quest 2 has &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/quest-2-outsells-oculus-headsets-combined/"&gt;outsold all previous&lt;/a&gt; Oculus headsets combined. The device has established Facebook as the dominant VR headset company at the price of ceding high-end PC-based VR to competitors including Valve, HTC, and HP. And Facebook has indicated that it’s continuing the Quest line for the near future — with CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319737/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vr-ar-face-sensors"&gt;saying he’s already imagining&lt;/a&gt; “Quest 3 and 4” headsets.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jimmy Fallon will play Among Us with streamers and the cast of Stranger Things in Twitch debut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon - Season 8" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4i4U7QDvZyCvCtv96Z9KUzy2UcQ=/1x0:3000x1999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69084365/1231930197.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By: Andrew Lipovsky/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZpQzLf"&gt;Jimmy Fallon is making his Twitch debut on Tuesday evening in what promises to be some hilarious rounds of &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; with a star-studded group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5IYuv"&gt;Fallon will be joined by The Roots’ Questlove, Tariq Trotter, and Kirk Douglas; &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things &lt;/em&gt;stars Noah Schnapp (who plays Will Byers) and Gaten Matarazzo (who plays Dustin Henderson); streamers Sykkuno and Rachel “Valkyrae” Hofstetter; YouTuber Corpse Husband; and &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; developer InnerSloth’s community director, Victoria Tran. With so many big names participating, Fallon’s stream has the potential to be huge, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-NY) two streams of &lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21526164/aoc-among-us-twitch-debut-top-concurrent-viewers"&gt;last&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/aoc-returns-twitch-playing-among-us-jagmeet-singh-xqc-disguisedtoast/"&gt;year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLap02"&gt;The group will be playing Tuesday starting at 6:45PM ET, and you can watch it &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jimmyfallon"&gt;on Fallon’s Twitch channel&lt;/a&gt;. Parts from the stream will air on &lt;em&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/em&gt; next week, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jimmy-fallon-tonight-show-twitch-among-us-stranger-things"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmvFyi"&gt;The group will be playing on &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;’ huge new Airship map, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338782/among-us-airship-map-accounts-update-innersloth"&gt;was released on March 31st&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362177/among-us-airship-update-map-sneaky-crewmate-imposter"&gt;The new map is full of ways&lt;/a&gt; for imposters to be sneaky, which I’m sure will lead to some ridiculous moments during Tuesday’s stream. (The game also now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353088/among-us-airship-update-poop-hat-chocolate-ice-cream"&gt;has a poop hat&lt;/a&gt;. I wonder if anyone will wear it?)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned Nvidia’s RTX Voice works on older GTX graphics cards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="nvidia geforce gtx 1080" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VUqOLwarugZW9PxNuJhow9X60Sg=/164x0:3676x2341/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69083253/WwBCPl4.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6DceaT"&gt;Nvidia’s RTX Voice feature that eliminates background noises that would otherwise come through your microphone debuted exclusively on costly RTX graphics cards. My colleague Taylor Lyles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444508/nvidia-broadcast-download-rtx-voice-noise-app"&gt;wrote back in September 2020&lt;/a&gt; that the company patched RTX Voice software to run on older GeForce GTX, Quadro, or Titan-branded GPUs all the way back in September 2020, but I was just reminded of it today from &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/rtx-voice-works-on-pascal-maxwell-kepler"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4O5WU"&gt;Given that Nvidia’s newest RTX 30-series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;graphics cards are pricey and tough to find&lt;/a&gt; (as are just about any kind of somewhat capable GPU), this is a good way to extend the utility of older hardware if you don’t want to upgrade yet. If your graphics card is running Nvidia’s 410.18 driver, models down to the GTX 600-series released in 2012 should be able to run the feature once you download it. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fguides%2Fnvidia-rtx-voice-setup-guide%2F%23RTX-Voice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F6%2F22369740%2Fnvidia-rtx-voice-noise-canceling-features-gtx-geforce-quadro-titan-graphics-cards-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Here’s a link to the download&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zuwLj"&gt;Once you have that installed, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229508/nvidia-rtx-voice-background-noise-reduce-graphics-card-improve-call-quality"&gt;check out the how-to guide&lt;/a&gt; that my colleague Jon Porter wrote that goes through the steps on configuring your sound settings to take advantage of RTX Voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJYHNR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally written as if this feature coming to non-RTX GPUs was new. Nvidia confirmed to The Verge that it has been available since late September 2020 when &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444508/nvidia-broadcast-download-rtx-voice-noise-app"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia debuted its Broadcast app&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yahoo Answers was the most earnest place on the internet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Playa Vista Exteriors And Landmarks - 2020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DYmOgSiGXd2IaJrA5NSs7xKWWfU=/0x243:5100x3643/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69084333/1229095599.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fEfH0Y"&gt;“Who do you blame for Yahoo Answers getting shut down?” reads &lt;a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20210405155122AA3yax3"&gt;one of the final queries&lt;/a&gt; ever submitted to the venerable advice service. As of press time, it has garnered more than 250 responses, all from those who’ve regularly doled out their imperfect observations to countless eighth-graders, chronic hypochondriacs, political firebrands, and curious stoners throughout the 15-year life span of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eIs6ii"&gt;The premise of Yahoo Answers was simple: ask any question you want and receive solutions from anyone in the world. “[It] likely doesn’t turn a profit … instead of spending the money necessary to moderate they just decided to close the whole thing down,” theorizies a user named Bill, who has penned 11,182 of these answers during his career on the forum. Elsewhere, veterans blame the liberals or the conservatives, or lay the fault at the feet of the parent company, Verizon. There is no right or wrong way to contend with the death of an internet giant, especially when the inevitable is on the horizon. On May 4th, Yahoo Answers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368488/yahoo-answers-shutdown-may-4-internet-era-over-rip"&gt;will enter a permanent read-only mode&lt;/a&gt; and functionally cease to exist. We may never know &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll-lia-FEIY"&gt;how babby is formed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5T3MWF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A public good mutated into yet another exhausting battlefront&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EvC55d"&gt;It’s unclear why Yahoo Answers is being sunset now. The company isn’t terminating any of its other services. Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Sports, and Yahoo Mail will all continue to exist. Yahoo simply said the product has become “less popular over the years” and suggested that it does not “deliver on Yahoo’s promise of providing premium trusted content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YxuoQ"&gt;Forum habitués speculate that this execution is a result of the site’s glacial rhetorical shift toward psychedelic conspiracy and heated partisanship in recent years. Currently, the front page includes such burning inquiries like, “&lt;a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20210405002134AAlHJl0"&gt;Will America survive 4 years of Joe Biden?&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20210403163008AAeHjyO"&gt;Will the summer be record riots by BLM and antifa?&lt;/a&gt;” In the thread where a user asks who is responsible for the site coming to an unceremonious end, someone replies: “left-wingers, they don’t want people to know the truth.” In that sense, maybe Bill’s postulation is right. Perhaps the powers that be at Yahoo simply grew tired of watching a public good mutate into yet another exhausting battlefront in the interminable American culture war and opted to cut their losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="cqwal5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I can still misbehave!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5PVVpd"&gt;That is the great tragedy of Yahoo Answers. Long before aggrieved reactionaries became barnacles to its abandoned underside in order to spout talking points imported directly from &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ingraham Angle&lt;/em&gt;, it existed as an extremely sincere, extremely harebrained epicenter of mindless juvenile interests. You can still see shadows of that former life, even now, if you look hard enough. “What does it feel like to be 50 years old?” writes one poster, a day before the announced shuttering. “I’m 17 I can’t even imagine what it must feel like to have been on planet Earth for that long.” The Yahoo Answers braintrust immediately mobilized to sate the thirst for knowledge. As usual, the results were scattershot in their saliency and applicability. “I am 61 and at that awkward age for men between 16 and 70,” answers an anonymous user, who has Phil beat with a whopping 18,066 total posts. “I can still misbehave!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3BzC2"&gt;That was the spirit of the site; dubious questions met with dubious answers, the end result of trusting the ravenous pursuit of knowledge to those who possess enough free time to spend their days offering unverifiable insight to anonymous patrons. So many of the classic Yahoo Answers threads are written in a distinct mangled keyboard patois that belongs to both elementary-aged children and hunt-and-pecking sexagenarians alike. In 2021, when it feels like everyone in our life is chronically online, there is a strange, wistful sublimity in paging through the archives. Yahoo Answers represents an era where social media wasn’t chronically poisoned with irony and restless posturing; when the denizens of the internet were a little less afraid of the dreaded self-own. I already mentioned “How Is Babby Formed,” but who could forget, “&lt;a href="https://buzzghana.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Funny-Yahoo-Questions-And-Answers-11.jpg"&gt;Will my laptop get heavier if I put more files on it?&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href="https://runt-of-the-web.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/yahoo-questions-dog-sex-education.jpg"&gt;What is the right age to start teaching my dog about sex?&lt;/a&gt;” It was the most earnest place on the internet. There are no dumb questions, only Yahoo Answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0THyop"&gt;But unfortunately, nothing is safe from the great polarization of American society, where every scrap of digital terrain — from the subdivisions of 4Chan to your grandmother’s Facebook page — has been transformed into a focal point of perpetual political resentment. Not even Yahoo Answers, whose name implies a wholesome search for utilitarian, objective truth, was immune to the rising tide of boneheaded nationalism. It’s instructive, I think, to know that basic human courtesies, like posing and answering questions, have been irredeemably poisoned by the bad-faith instincts of the cursed, modern internet. There is simply no feasible way to subsist as a True Neutral web entity anymore. Yahoo Answers is just the latest casualty. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM is building an electric Chevy Silverado with 400 miles of range</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Chevrolet 2019 Silverado Reveal Event Ahead Of The 2018 North American International Auto Show" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2-xxH31jpEgUBjQihF3YmpsGaO4=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69084057/904641536.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0m6wKY"&gt;General Motors just &lt;a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/apr/0406-factory0.html"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it’s making an all-electric version of the Chevy Silverado pickup truck, the company’s bestselling vehicle. The new truck will be powered by GM’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;new EV battery&lt;/a&gt; and will offer around 400 miles on a full charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izXau9"&gt;The company did not immediately say when the electric Silverado will go on sale, but GM president Mark Reuss said at an event on Tuesday that the company will also make commercial fleet-focused versions of the truck. GM has been &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34732462/gm-chevy-electric-truck-teased/"&gt;teasing an electric Silverado&lt;/a&gt; for months now. It previously said &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a31227446/chevy-electric-pickup-confirmed-2025/"&gt;it may not release a pickup EV until mid-decade&lt;/a&gt; and hadn’t officially announced the truck was coming until Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBPerP"&gt;The electric Silverado will be made at “Factory Zero,” the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519358/gm-factory-zero-detroit-hamtramck-electric-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;recently rebranded Detroit-Hamtramck plant&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to EVs and AVs that GM is currently retooling at a cost of more than $2 billion. It’s the same plant where GM will build the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22362072/hummer-suv-electric-price-specs-release-date"&gt;all-electric Hummer SUV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;Hummer pickup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vl6Nq2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Announcing the first-ever electric &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Silverado?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Silverado&lt;/a&gt; full-size truck, with a GM-estimated range of more than 400 miles on a full charge, will be built at Factory ZERO, Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center.&lt;a href="https://t.co/7i5bqRNUt7"&gt;https://t.co/7i5bqRNUt7&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/1ONRFOfuAR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1ONRFOfuAR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chevrolet (@chevrolet) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chevrolet/status/1379467520911015936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1nU3w2"&gt;An electric Silverado is a big step for GM and its Chevy brand — the automaker is planning to sell some 30 electric vehicles globally by 2025 — but it’s not too surprising considering that rival Ford already has an electric F-150 in the works. Ford’s electric pickup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288000/ford-electric-f-150-2022-sale-launch-jim-farley"&gt;is due out next year&lt;/a&gt;. The Silverado is so important to GM that it’s currently selling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331766/gm-pickups-semiconductor-shortage-fuel-economy-emissions"&gt;versions of the truck that are missing a microchip that helps improve fuel economy&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the global semiconductor shortage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHT7z9"&gt;A slew of other electric pickups are supposed to hit the market in the next few years. Rivian’s R1T pickup is due out later this year. Tesla’s Cybertruck is supposed to start shipping sometime around the end of this year or early 2022. GM’s own electric Hummer pickup is meant to go on sale around that same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6MX02"&gt;Many other startups are working on electric pickups, too, including Lordstown Motors — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352433/gm-lordstown-motors-electric-truck-startup-public-merger-spac"&gt;which is backed by GM&lt;/a&gt; and is planning to manufacture its trucks at the legacy automaker’s former factory in Lordstown, Ohio. GM was at one point negotiating to take a stake in electric trucking startup Nikola, which was working on a pickup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726594/gm-nikola-deal-equity-badger-truck-hydrogen"&gt;before it became mired in scandal&lt;/a&gt;. Before that, GM reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/24/gm-wanted-too-much-from-ev-start-up-rivian-opening-door-for-ford.html"&gt;wanted an exclusive deal with Rivian&lt;/a&gt;, which left room for Ford to partner up with that EV startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZT0fzv"&gt;The Silverado EV will undoubtedly be a flagship vehicle of the custom electric vehicle platform GM announced last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;called Ultium&lt;/a&gt;. Designed to be modular, the Ultium platform is what will power most of GM’s forthcoming electric vehicles. The company has promised the platform will be able to provide as much as 400 miles of range in the biggest configurations, and that the trucks built on Ultium will feature 800-volt architecture that allows for really fast charging. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wisk Aero accuses rival flying taxi firm Archer Aviation of ‘brazen theft’ in a new lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qidf5rkOp1WesIiZnxkh-u5zWuU=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69084051/download.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V2mVoR"&gt;Wisk Aero, a joint venture between Boeing and Kitty Hawk, is suing rival air taxi firm Archer Aviation for allegedly stealing its trade secrets and infringing on its patents. Wisk is seeking unspecified monetary damages and an injunction against Archer to prevent it from using the allegedly stolen technology. In response, Archer says it has “no reason to believe” that it possesses any of Wisk’s intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxkSbd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://wisk.aero/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021.04.06-Wisk-Complaint-Against-Archer.pdf"&gt;In a complaint filed in the US District Court of Northern California&lt;/a&gt;, Wisk said it is suing Archer “to stop a brazen theft of its intellectual property and confidential information, and protect the substantial investment of resources and years of hard work and effort of its employees and their vision of the future in urban air transportation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XM8npk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“to stop a brazen theft of its intellectual property and confidential information”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i71xag"&gt;Santa Clara-based Archer came out of stealth in the spring of 2020 after having poached key talent from Wisk, a joint venture of Boeing and Kitty Hawk, the flying taxi company bankrolled by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/19/17586878/larry-page-flying-car-opener-kitty-hawk-cora"&gt;Google co-founder Larry Page&lt;/a&gt;. The company also hired engineers away from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/1/16961688/airbus-vahana-evtol-first-test-flight"&gt;Airbus’ Vahana&lt;/a&gt; project. &lt;a href="https://www.aviationtoday.com/2020/04/06/stealth-air-taxi-startup-driving-cost-uam-engineers/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Avionics International&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Archer was able to lure these engineers by offering higher salaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YKMHUS"&gt;Archer was founded by Adam Goldstein and Brett Adcock, co-founders of Vettery, a marketing software-as-a-service company, which the two sold to Switzerland-based staffing firm Adecco Group in 2018 for $100 million. But Wisk argues that Archer didn’t just steal talent — it also stole trade secrets. Wisk accuses Archer of misappropriating “thousands of highly confidential files containing very valuable trade secrets, as well as the use of significant innovations Wisk has patented.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVPh5i"&gt;Archer’s emergence “surprised the industry,” Wisk claims, based on its shortened time frame for going to market with its electric aircraft with just a fraction of the staff of other, more established urban air mobility firms. &lt;a href="https://wisk.aero/blog/040621-blog-post/"&gt;According to Wisk&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6uDfkc"&gt;Archer’s stated timeline for releasing an aircraft was a fraction of the time taken by its serious competitors, using a fraction of the number of employees of those competitors. The development of an entirely new kind of passenger aircraft requires years of engineering and significant expertise to get right, as demonstrated by Wisk and the other leading players in this space. For example, after 10 years of hard engineering and testing, Wisk is currently developing its sixth-generation aircraft, which it plans to certify with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). We believe it is virtually impossible for Archer to have produced an originally-designed aircraft in this timeframe that has gone through the necessary testing and is ready for certification with the FAA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZyCp2"&gt;Most surprising to Wisk was the design of Archer’s prototype aircraft — mainly because it closely resembled Wisk’s own prototype. Both aircraft feature six front rotors, each with five blades, that can tilt either horizontally or vertically, as well as six rear rotors that each consist of two blades and remain fixed in a vertical position. Archer’s aircraft also includes an “unconventional” V-shaped tail, similar to Wisk’s patented design. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3KUuj-dbsU8ks3UdSYYaXt2f-oY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424267/400621_Wisk_Blog1_900x530_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wisk&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RL2xtm"&gt;“The striking similarity in these designs could not have been a coincidence,” Wisk says. The month that Wisk filed its patent application was the same month that Archer hired away 10 of Wisk’s engineers, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5ppu2"&gt;With its suspicions raised, Wisk said it hired a forensic investigator, who returned with some “troubling” information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qlqZlk"&gt;We discovered that one of those engineers downloaded thousands of Wisk files near midnight, shortly before he announced his resignation and immediately departed to Archer. Those files contain our valuable trade secrets and confidential information about Wisk’s aircraft development spanning the history of the company, accumulated over countless hours of incremental progress by scores of engineers. Another engineer downloaded numerous files containing test data just before departing for Archer. Yet another wiped any trace of his computer activities shortly before leaving for Archer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UKnSzd"&gt;Wisk also points out that among its competitors, no two prototypes look the same, which makes Archer’s alleged theft of its trade secrets stand out even more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K58Fjf"&gt;Archer has recently made news by raising $1.1 billion by &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/archer-lands-1-1b-order-from-united-airlines-and-a-spac-deal/"&gt;going public through a reverse merger&lt;/a&gt; with a special acquisition company, or SPAC. The merger, which is valued at $3.8 billion, is also backed by Stellantis, the parent company of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, and United Airlines. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/united-airlines-orders-electric-vertical-aircraft-invests-in-urban-air-mobility-spac.html"&gt;United has placed a $1 billion order&lt;/a&gt; for 200 Archer electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, with an option to purchase 100 more for $500 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWl4rv"&gt;In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last month, the startup’s co-founders gave a lot of credit to Page’s Kitty Hawk and Wisk for helping launch the eVTOL industry, while also acknowledging having poached many of the key players from Wisk to help start Archer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEWGuM"&gt;“We started the business three or four years ago. And our team here is a team that basically kind of started the space,” Adcock told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “So Larry Page basically invented the space in a large way. In 2010, he started a company that’s now called Wisk. It used to be called Kitty Hawk, and then Zero, but it’s called Wisk now. That was like the big, big group in the space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9YRuKZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You know, Larry’s spent a considerable amount of money and time over 10 years basically maturing the technologies”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mOBCHT"&gt;Adcock continued to heap praise on Page, saying, “You know, Larry’s spent a considerable amount of money and time over 10 years basically maturing the technologies, like motors, batteries, flight control, software, aircraft design, these type of things.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDdsMp"&gt;But that didn’t prevent him from hiring away many of the key players at Wisk and Airbus’ Vahana, including Tom Muniz, who ran engineering at Wisk and is now chief operating officer at Archer; and Geoffrey Bower, who was chief engineer at Vahana and now holds that same title at Archer. “We’ve basically been bringing over kind of the best folks in the world here to kind of tackle this problem last several years,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Ma3eb"&gt;A spokesperson for Archer called the lawsuit “regrettable” and denied the allegations that the company had stolen Wisk’s intellectual property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nc6C5"&gt;“It’s regrettable that Wisk would engage in litigation in an attempt to deflect from the business issues that have caused several of its employees to depart,” the spokesperson said. “The plaintiff raised these matters over a year ago, and after looking into them thoroughly, we have no reason to believe any proprietary Wisk technology ever made its way to Archer. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="heVEdq"&gt;Air taxis, sometimes misidentified as “flying cars, “are essentially helicopters without the noisy, polluting gas motors. A number of startups have emerged in recent years with prototype aircraft that are electric-powered, able to carry a handful of passengers, and intended for short flights within a city or regionally. Analysts predict that the flying taxi market could grow to $150 billion in revenue by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJULho"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 6th 1:08PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated to include Archer’s response.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this powerful story about how the internet never lets you forget</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5rjOQuwEBERUbe5S26likiSwM3Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69083992/acastro__171016_1777_0001_v1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrator by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SRjWKo"&gt;The technology and social media we use every day constantly bombard us with things we’ve shared in the past or advertise to us based on who they think we are. Those past posts can be fun to relive, and every once in a while, those targeted ads do actually work. But &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; senior writer (and former &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer) Lauren Goode published &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/weddings-social-media-apps-photos-memories-miscarriage-problem/"&gt;a powerful and personal story&lt;/a&gt; about how these technologies can also haunt us with memories of times we may want to forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="takeBZ"&gt;In the essay, Goode describes how she called off her wedding in May 2019, and ever since, she has grappled with technology reminding her of her former relationship and the wedding that didn’t happen. Here is just one devastating passage: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QKXn3A"&gt;Social media and photo apps were by now full-on services, infused with artificial intelligence, facial recognition, and an overwhelming amount of presumption. For months, photos of my ex appeared on the Google Home Hub next to my bed, the widgets on my iPad, and the tiny screen of my Apple Watch. So yeah: My ex’s face sometimes shows up on my wrist. As I write this, Facebook reminds me that nine years ago I visited him in Massachusetts and met his family’s dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="t1pvg0"&gt;Goode also writes about how difficult it is to escape these reminders because of the near-impossibility of removing your data from the internet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="rtSvMW"&gt;I managed to do half the work. But that’s exactly it: It’s work. It’s designed that way. It requires a thankless amount of mental and emotional energy, just like some relationships. And even if you find the time or energy to navigate settings and submenus and customer support forms, you still won’t have ultimate control over the experience. In Apple Photos, you can go to Memories, go through the collage the app has assembled for you, delete a collage, untag a person or group of people, or tell the app you want to see fewer Memories like it. The one thing you can’t do? Opt out of the Memories feature entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="39i5bg"&gt;But she also shares how this technology and the data we keep can still give us meaning, even if it is from a time that may no longer represent what it once did: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QvbztQ"&gt;Never mind that I’m wearing a white silk dress in the photo, that there’s a ring on my finger and a hazy row of bridal gowns on racks behind us. I still won’t delete it. I won’t archive photos from the half-marathon I ran with my ex, the one finish line we crossed, because I ran 13.1 miles and I’d prefer to remember how that felt on days when I have nothing left in the tank. I won’t delete the albums I have from half a dozen Christmases, because I need to believe holiday gatherings will happen again. I won’t unfollow our wedding photographer on Instagram, because—even though she never shot our photos—I appreciate her work as a keeper of other people’s memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OQPWgr"&gt;No matter what I write here, I can’t do Goode’s incredible story justice. &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/weddings-social-media-apps-photos-memories-miscarriage-problem/"&gt;Just go read it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube claims it’s getting better at enforcing its own moderation rules</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dlrimL"&gt;YouTube wants the world to know that it’s doing a better job than ever of enforcing its own moderation rules. The company says that a shrinking number of people see problematic videos on its site — such as videos that contain graphic violence, scams, or hate speech — before they’re taken down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHGKrz"&gt;In the final months of 2020, up to 18 out of every 10,000 views on YouTube were on videos that violate the company’s policies and should have been removed before anyone watched them. That’s down from 72 out of every 10,000 views in the fourth quarter of 2017, when YouTube started tracking the figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dnsPo7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The figure measures enforcement of YouTube’s own rules&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FfuGsm"&gt;But the numbers come with an important caveat: while they measure how well YouTube is doing at limiting the spread of troubling clips, they’re ultimately based on what videos YouTube believes should be removed from its platform — and the company still allows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22339030/youtube-racist-steven-crowder-video-does-not-violate-hate-speech-policies"&gt;some obviously troubling videos&lt;/a&gt; to stay up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zXuiE"&gt;The stat is a new addition to &lt;a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/youtube-policy/removals?hl=en"&gt;YouTube’s community guidelines enforcement report&lt;/a&gt;, a transparency report updated quarterly with details on the types of videos being removed from the platform. This new figure is called Violative View Rate, or VVR, and tracks how many views on YouTube happen on videos that violate its guidelines and should be taken down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUoi3C"&gt;This figure is essentially a way for YouTube to measure how good it’s doing at moderating its own site, based on its own rules. The higher the VVR, the more problematic videos are spreading before YouTube can catch them; the lower the VVR, the better YouTube is doing at stamping out prohibited content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPxJWc"&gt;YouTube made a chart showing how the figure has fallen since it started measuring the number for internal use:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The chart shows VVR starting at 0.63% - 0.72% in Q4 2017 and falling steeply over the next year to 0.23% - 0.27% before leveling out around 0.16% - 0.18% in the following years." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fXUNkg7fbA6LzmbdtNF5a6---W0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422381/VVR_Graph_1440x1080.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A chart from YouTube showing VVR since measurements started.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UcA1yL"&gt;The steep drop from 2017 to 2018 came after YouTube started relying on machine learning to spot problematic videos, rather than relying on users to report problems, Jennifer O’Connor, YouTube’s product director for trust and safety, said during a briefing with reporters. The goal is “getting this number as close to zero as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuaGap"&gt;Videos that violate YouTube’s advertising guidelines, but not its overall community guidelines, aren’t included in the VVR figure since they don’t warrant removal. And so-called “borderline content” that bumps up against but doesn’t quite violate any rules isn’t factored in either for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQMoJv"&gt;O’Connor said YouTube’s team uses the figure internally to understand how well they’re doing at keeping users safe from troubling content. If it’s going up, YouTube can try to figure out what types of videos are slipping through and prioritize developing its machine learning to catch them. “The North Star for our team is to keep users safe,” O’Connor said.&lt;/p&gt;
