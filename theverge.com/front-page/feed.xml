  &lt;p id="b9pekq"&gt;Whether you’d like to admit it or not, school is quickly approaching. And if you’re in need of a reliable laptop that won’t force you to completely deplete your savings, Chromebooks aren’t a bad way to go. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; deliver great value for the money, and many offer terrific performance for far less than you would pay for a more premium machine. Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is one such device, even if the high-end convertible is one of the more expensive Chromebooks on the market right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEUc0Y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746320001237385626#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Currently discounted at Best Buy to $619&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 model packs in 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i5, which is more than enough processing power for most people. Moreover, it boasts a great keyboard and a brilliant 3:2 screen, along with two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports and enough battery life for a full day in the classroom — virtual or otherwise. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="CDZr8x"&gt;Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now-discontinued HomePod,&lt;/a&gt; the HomePod Mini is somewhat easy to forget. Apple’s pint-sized answer to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Mini&lt;/a&gt; still produces good sound for its size, though, and Siri remains a viable alternative to Alexa and Google Assistant, despite lagging behind when it comes to features and functionality. The compact smart speaker also plays nice with HomeKit-compatible devices and Apple Music, rendering it a device really built for those who are already entrenched in the Apple ecosystem. Normally $100, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1598683-REG%2Fapple_aphomepmsg_homepod_mini_space_gray.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F16%2F22577815%2Facer-chromebook-spin-713-apple-homepod-mini-microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is offering a rare $10 discount&lt;/a&gt; on Home Pod Mini, bringing the price down to $90 for a limited time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="xpKyaN"&gt;With COVID-19 restrictions easing and in-person gatherings become more commonplace again, now might not be a bad time to pick up an extra controller for your Xbox One, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, or Windows 10 machine. Thankfully, the black incarnation of Microsoft’s latest Xbox Wireless Controller is compatible with all three and remains available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Shock-Blue-one/dp/B08DF248LD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fxbox-wireless-controller%2F8xn59crbsqgz%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26ranSiteID%3DVZfI20jEa0c-HbHu3oCkeQ1z2svgZK2uRQ%26epi%3DVZfI20jEa0c-HbHu3oCkeQ1z2svgZK2uRQ%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2200057_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__iglaeqnhj9kfq1cckk0sohzif22xudv630gxj2fe00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%2528VZfI20jEa0c-HbHu3oCkeQ1z2svgZK2uRQ%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_iglaeqnhj9kfq1cckk0sohzif22xudv630gxj2fe00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store for $49&lt;/a&gt;, matching its second-lowest price. Unlike the previous model, the new-ish controller features a textured grip, USB-C support, and a dedicated Share button, letting you quickly capture and share your content with the press of a button. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21452750/microsoft-xbox-series-x-controller-1tb-expansion-cards-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our hands-on review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The stakes for fighting misinformation are life and death</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d06Dira6zg7uruBcr2H57tZYZv8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69590117/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DSZ6HM"&gt;The United States surgeon general &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578431/white-house-surgeon-general-facebook-youtube-twitter-covid-19-misinformation-vaccines"&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt; this week calling for a whole-of-society response to health misinformation, calling it a “serious threat to public health.” It took a sweeping look at a wide range of misinformation, on everything from masks to unproven drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qpfBV"&gt;But the focus of Surgeon General Vivek Murthy’s remarks &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/15/politics/surgeon-general-vaccine-misinformation-advisory/index.html"&gt;circled back&lt;/a&gt; to vaccines. Daily vaccination rates have stalled out at around 500,000 shots per day, and in many pockets of the country, a majority of people aren’t getting immunized. The US is struggling to bump those numbers up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIRkXH"&gt;Misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines spreads fast, and so do the accompanying consequences. The rapid spread of the more transmissible Delta coronavirus variant makes them even easier to see. Case counts are going up around the country, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/7/13/22576416/nyc-covid-cases-rise-in-areas-with-low-vaccination-rates"&gt;in areas&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/12/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html"&gt;low vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/unvaccinated-covid19-los-angeles-county-hospitalizations/10887037/"&gt;Every person hospitalized&lt;/a&gt; with COVID-19 in Los Angeles County is unvaccinated. &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/6242"&gt;In Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, 94 percent of COVID-19 cases since May were among the unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="FN2rL7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e1XuIz"&gt;In Missouri, the new center of the Delta-driven US surge, health care workers are exhausted by the avoidable COVID-19 cases and deaths they see every day. They’re frustrated that people in their communities aren’t getting vaccinated. In addition to fighting the virus, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/15/springfield-missouri-delta-outbreak/"&gt;health officials are battling&lt;/a&gt; theories that the vaccine is causing the spike in cases, apathy from young people who think they don’t need to get vaccinated, and the false idea that the vaccine contains a microchip. With &lt;a href="https://data.news-leader.com/covid-19-vaccine-tracker/missouri/29/"&gt;much of the population&lt;/a&gt; in the state avoiding shots, the virus is inevitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oP9KfY"&gt;“We are going to see more people get really sick. We are going to see a lot of people die,” Katie Towns, the acting health director at the Springfield-Greene County Health Department in Missouri, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/15/springfield-missouri-delta-outbreak/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UV4CNX"&gt;Misinformation is also winning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578519/vaccine-politicization-tennessee-covid-hpv-flu"&gt;in Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, where the health department stopped all vaccine outreach to young people after pressure and backlash from conservative lawmakers. Anti-vaxxers and others opposed to public health measures have the ear of people in power, and it’s frightening, psychologist and anti-vaccine researcher Seth Kalichman &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578519/vaccine-politicization-tennessee-covid-hpv-flu"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oorVGY"&gt;Vaccines are some of the most powerful public health tools at our disposal. Because they’re so good, and particularly because the COVID-19 vaccines are so good, the fallout from any drops in vaccination rates is predictable. When people don’t get vaccinated, people get sick, and people die. That means the stakes for &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-misinformation-advisory.pdf"&gt;proposals and efforts&lt;/a&gt; to curb vaccine misinformation — crack down on social media platforms, distribute correct information, develop health literacy programs — couldn’t be higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sx6qGZ"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gHfsse"&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lFW43s"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/12/flu-jab-may-reduce-severe-effects-of-covid-suggests-study"&gt;Flu jab may reduce severe effects of Covid, suggests study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;COVID-19 patients who had a flu shot were less likely to have a stroke or admitted to emergency departments than patients who didn’t, a new study found. It’s not a substitute for COVID-19 vaccine. (Ian Sample/&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F4CJZO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/opinion/covid-unusual-cases-study.html"&gt;Why the most unusual Covid cases matter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unique, outlier cases can help researchers and doctors understand the disease. Studying people who don’t respond to the COVID-19 vaccine, for example, can help us understand the immune system. (Roxanne Khamsi/&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MAVbj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bat-scientists-warn-that-the-world-may-never-know-covid-19-origins-11626026153?st=xzj3j18omaz5awx&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;Bat Scientists Warn That the World May Never Know Covid-19 Origins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Research that tries to track down a smoking gun is challenging and often fails. Scientists also often disagree on what various data means. (Amy Dockser Marcus/&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="odMcn4"&gt;Development &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="km92xC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01893-0"&gt;Quarter-dose of Moderna COVID vaccine still rouses a big immune response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;A smaller dose of the vaccine could still help protect people from COVID-19. That could make limited supplies of the shot stretch further. (Elie Dolgin/&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WB6tnb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/07/12/when-and-how-will-we-know-covid-19-booster-shots/"&gt;When and how will we know if we need Covid-19 booster shots?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pfizer and BioNTech are pushing for a third shot in the COVID-19 vaccine regimen. Federal agencies in the United States are pushing back, saying that the data doesn’t show a need yet. The booster debate also raises issues of vaccine equity. (&lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0efwX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574180/fda-johnson-warning-covid-vaccine-guillain-barre"&gt;FDA adds warning about a nerve condition to the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;People who got the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot have slightly higher rates of a condition called Guillain–Barré syndrome, which can cause weakness and coordination problems, than would be expected in the general population. (Nicole Wetsman/&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="grbPRu"&gt;Perspectives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pcWjDM"&gt;And I went back and forth about it for a while. It’s almost like I was paralyzed from trying to do the right thing, if that makes sense……… it was torture. But it just seemed like the advice about vaccinations and pregnant women, at that time, it was still up in the air. It was still a situation where no one was telling me, you know, It’s undisputed, Cheyenne, these are the facts, this is what you should do. So I just tried to make the right choice, the best I could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="XfR5U2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/cheyenne-parker-wnba-basketball-atlanta"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Player’s Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Atlanta Dream star Cheyenne Parker wrote about grappling with whether to get a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IOqaIp"&gt;More than numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4tzoD2"&gt;To the people who have received the 3.5 billion vaccine doses distributed so far — thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdsoGE"&gt;To the more than 188,726,053 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbHqHe"&gt;To the families and friends of the more than 4,062,486 people who have died worldwide — 608,336 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYEI4E"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80ZwyN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aB5sN7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alexa’s latest celebrity voices are Shaq and Melissa McCarthy</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kFQPfL"&gt;Shaquille O’Neal and Melissa McCarthy are the latest celebrities to lend their voices to Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant, the &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/alexa-introduce-me-to-melissa-and-shaq"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The two voices can provide weather reports, jokes, and personal stories when asked using the wake words “Hey Melissa” or “Hey Shaq.” Both voices cost $4.99 individually, and are rolling out in the US now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2ahqG"&gt;Amazon kicked off its celebrity Alexa voices initiative &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21013145/amazon-echo-alexa-samuel-l-jackson-celebrity-voice-now-available-price"&gt;with Samuel L. Jackson in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and says this Alexa voice skill was the top selling digital purchase on Amazon.com the day it was launched. In 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436292/amazon-alexa-amitabh-bachchan-celebrity-voice-india-bollywood-star-pricing-release-date"&gt;followed up with Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan&lt;/a&gt;. None of these celebrities replace Alexa’s default voice, but instead offer responses to specific requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4dkC45"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5o_vmcCbrkE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="2O3MXP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnb451SHPMI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MXbTVc"&gt;If you’re after a new Alexa voice for all of your requests, then Amazon says it’s also releasing a new voice option, which you can enable with the command “Alexa, change your voice.” Separately, there’s also a new wake word, “Ziggy,” if you’re tired of the existing selection (which currently includes Alexa, Computer, Echo, and Amazon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lf7qIj"&gt;To enable either celebrity voices, you can ask Alexa for an introduction. The commands “Alexa, introduce me to Shaq,” or “Alexa, introduce me to Melissa” should do the trick. Alternatively, you can manually enable &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XW88QZB/ref=sxts_spks_0_0_fe93319a-8afe-47d4-a26b-1cf04483ed5e?pd_rd_w=O2qZB&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=fe93319a-8afe-47d4-a26b-1cf04483ed5e&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=V1632KG3BYWC589939XH&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=eb63b2db-1485-4d9e-9bda-67920148236d&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=tvO3c&amp;amp;qid=1626434273&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;each&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Melissa-McCarthy-celebrity-personality-Alexa/dp/B08XVTH3ZP/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=melissa+mccarthy&amp;amp;qid=1626434258&amp;amp;s=digital-skills&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; via Amazon’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epomaker’s NT68 is a mechanical alternative to your MacBook’s keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HUxPZgYzqkoT1Ka7IjdDlKL6tXg=/1x0:1113x741/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69589947/nt68_photo_3_min_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The NT68 is designed to sit on top of your laptop’s existing keyboard.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epomaker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JVmp5b"&gt;If you can’t stand to type on a Macbook’s scissor switch keyboard, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;let alone a butterfly model&lt;/a&gt;, and you don’t fancy lugging around one of the small number of laptops with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7495073/msi-mechanical-keyboard-gt80-titan-laptop-ces"&gt;full-on mechanical keyboard built in&lt;/a&gt;, then Epomaker’s new wireless keyboard might be one for you. The NT68 is designed to sit on top of a MacBook or other laptop’s existing keyboard so your fingers don’t have to put up with their rubbery key switches for a single second longer than they need to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmFEpo"&gt;It’s not an entirely new idea (&lt;a href="https://nuphy.com/products/nutype-f1"&gt;Nuphy’s NuType F1 keyboard&lt;/a&gt; is another recent example) but the quality and specs of Epomaker’s previous keyboards make the NT68 worthy of attention. It can be hardwired over USB-C, connected via Bluetooth to up to three devices, and its switches are hot-swappable so you can modify the keyboard’s typing feel without having to get a soldering iron out. It uses what’s known as a 65 percent layout, which means you only get five rows of keys and no dedicated function row. It’s compact, but at the cost of some extra keys. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dKTDkD0nwXyIUXqmKrjFjcNCwGc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721291/nt68_bg3_min.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Epomaker&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ah yes. Ergonomics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tnrX0w"&gt;Oh, and there’s also RGB backlighting if you care about that sort of thing. The NT68 features what Epomaker is calling an “invisible stand,” and its magnetic case can prop up any phones or tablets you want to pair it to. Its 1,900 mAh battery is rated for between two and five weeks of wireless use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sa4tKx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If &lt;/em&gt;I was ever going to go to the effort of carrying around a little mechanical keyboard to use on top of a laptop, then I’d be giving the NT68 serious consideration. But that’s a big “if.” For starters, even as someone who owns around half a dozen different keyboards, it still seems straight up inconvenient to carry around an extra keyboard to replace the perfectly functional one built into my laptop. Even then, I couldn’t see myself bothering to put the keyboard &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;on top of&lt;/em&gt; a laptop’s keyboard when it’s much more ergonomic and comfortable to sit it on the desk in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VszF3O"&gt;But hey, I’m not going to tell you how to live your life. Epomaker is yet to announce a release date or pricing for the NT68, but it’s inviting people to sign up for updates &lt;a href="https://nt68comingsoon.epomaker.com/"&gt;over on its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi overtakes Apple as number two smartphone vendor for first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RoEJx-ejU8P8R7snEItUUlFIHFo=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69589716/DSCF5698.jpg_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A phone repair store at a technology market in Shenzhen, China. | Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F52BFY"&gt;Xiaomi is now the second largest smartphone vendor based on worldwide shipments in the second quarter of 2021, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-market-q2-2021?ctid=2143-0b9f92413ead631983febced55e12cd8"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from Canalys. The Chinese company captured 17 percent of global market share, according to the research firm, just behind Samsung’s 19 percent but ahead of Apple’s 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gn7Ak"&gt;BBK’s Oppo and Vivo rounded out the list of top five vendors at 10 percent apiece. All five companies grew their shipments year on year, but what’s notable is just how much Xiaomi has managed to increase its volume — it shipped 83 percent more phones than in Q2 2020, whereas Samsung grew shipments 15 percent and Apple by just one percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vxj4as"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We've moved up one more spot! Just in from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Canalys?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Canalys&lt;/a&gt;, we are now the 2nd largest smartphone brand worldwide in terms of shipments. This amazing milestone couldn't have been achieved without our beloved Mi Fans! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoMiWithoutYou?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NoMiWithoutYou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RT with ✌️from your Xiaomi smartphone :) &lt;a href="https://t.co/kKfuTK8K7J"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kKfuTK8K7J&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xiaomi (@Xiaomi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xiaomi/status/1415731357368471553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXhzMt"&gt;“Xiaomi is growing its overseas business rapidly,” Canalys Research Manager Ben Stanton says, citing sales boosts in regions including Western Europe, Africa, and Latin America. “It is still largely skewed toward the mass market, however, and compared with Samsung and Apple, its average selling price is around 40% and 75% cheaper respectively. So a major priority for Xiaomi this year is to grow sales of its high-end devices, such as the Mi 11 Ultra.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McMFbf"&gt;Canalys says global smartphone shipments grew by 12 percent last quarter. Much of the growth seen by smartphone makers is at the expense of Huawei, however, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21114885/huawei-overtakes-apple-2019-analysts-strategy-analytics-counterpoint-research-canalys"&gt;itself overtook Apple in 2019&lt;/a&gt; but has since been essentially shut out of the worldwide market due to US-imposed sanctions and trading bans. So far, Xiaomi appears to be the biggest beneficiary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter adds captions to voice tweets more than a year after they first launched</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/foo8fxaVSe1QVmIBW-o5TtzioFg=/0x200:1200x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69589056/E6XiiGlWQAYISTV.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captions on a voice tweet.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7UAdrN"&gt;Twitter is now rolling out captions for voice tweets, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1415806764113670145"&gt;the company announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter first launched voice tweets &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294481/twitter-audio-tweets-now-available-iphone-ios"&gt;in June 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296032/twitter-audio-tweets-accessibility-volunteers"&gt;quickly criticized at the time&lt;/a&gt; by accessibility advocates for not having captions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8W0cfd"&gt;Now, when you make a voice tweet (something you can only do on the iOS app right now), captions will be automatically generated in supported languages, which are English, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish, Arabic, Hindi, French, Indonesian, Korean, and Italian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npgjyG"&gt;To see the captions on a tweet, you can click or tap the CC icon in the top-right corner of the voice tweet window. Captions only appear on new voice tweets, Twitter tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;so you won’t see them on older ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLFdhH"&gt;Below is a screenshot of what the captions and the CC icon look like on the web, taken from a voice tweet that I made while writing this article:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_YD_udtL0AuyfYaYiESAUCkVZaY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22720808/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_4.26.51_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6X7WpS"&gt;You can also try to listen to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jaypeters/status/1415814919669260288"&gt;my voice tweet here&lt;/a&gt; and follow along with the captions, though I will warn you that my tweets eventually auto delete. If you’re reading this article a little while after it was published, the voice tweet might be gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bOVXE"&gt;When voice tweets launched, it also came to light that there wasn’t a dedicated team at Twitter for accessibility at the time — instead, employees had to volunteer their own time for accessibility work. The company has since fixed that, announcing that it had formed teams &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/making-twitter-more-accessible"&gt;to focus on accessibility&lt;/a&gt; in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8r3sWB"&gt;“As part of our ongoing work to make Twitter accessible for everyone, we’re rolling out automated captions for Voice Tweets to iOS,” Twitter’s head of global accessibility Gurpreet Kaur said in a statement. “Though it’s still early and we know it won’t be perfect at first, it’s one of many steps we’re taking to expand and strengthen accessibility across our service, and we look forward to continuing our journey to create a truly inclusive service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FamdOk"&gt;Twitter also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;offers captions in Twitter Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, its Clubhouse-like social audio rooms. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel is reportedly in talks to buy the $30 billion foundry company AMD spun off a decade ago</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QnbEjP14IxQo_G8xnQoaIGIf9UQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69588670/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CQfD9C"&gt;In 2008, chipmakers Intel and AMD took two distinct paths: Intel kept manufacturing its own chips to maintain full control, while AMD decided to spin off its semiconductor business as GlobalFoundries, relying on it and other manufacturers to provide the actual silicon. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-is-in-talks-to-buy-globalfoundries-for-about-30-billion-11626387704"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Intel is looking to snap up AMD’s former fabs as well, in a deal that could value them at $30 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6mSOK"&gt;It’s clear from the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; story that the deal isn’t a sure thing, and GlobalFoundries outright denied that it was in talks with Intel. But it’s possible Intel’s negotiating with the investment firm that owns GlobalFoundries instead, as the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;points out. It’s also intriguing that the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have a “no comment” from Intel itself — that’s sometimes a canary to indicate a company &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; comment, just off the record or on deep background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kha7ys"&gt;(“We will decline to comment on rumor and speculation,” an Intel spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="481eGh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel’s pushing fabs on multiple fronts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vcJsmf"&gt;There’s an obvious reason why Intel might want GlobalFoundries — Intel is actually ramping up its foundry business now. In an attempt to turn around the struggling company, new Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;announced in March that Intel would no longer go it alone&lt;/a&gt;, outsourcing more of its chip production to third-party foundries, agreeing to produce more chips for other companies using its own foundries, and also investing in new fabs itself. That included a $20 billion investment in new facilities in Arizona, but it could take many years for new buildings to get constructed and ramp up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RSQWX"&gt;In the meanwhile, it could snap up GlobalFoundries, the #4 foundry in the world (&lt;a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20210224-10675.html"&gt;according to TrendForce&lt;/a&gt;), one that accounts for 7 percent of all foundry business by revenue. That won’t put Intel on the same footing as a giant TSMC or Samsung (which together account for an estimated 74 percent), but it’d be a start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Txhn4J"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; took &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/07/making-semiconductors-is-hard/"&gt;a tour of GlobalFoundries’ facility in Malta, NY&lt;/a&gt; just last week, if you’d like to hear what it’s like.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Dorsey says Square has a new Bitcoin business named TBD</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yGA1yN"&gt;Jack Dorsey, CEO of both Twitter and Square, is enough of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17147574/twitter-ceo-bitcoin-jack-dorsey-square-interview-currency-10-years"&gt;fan of cryptocurrency &lt;/a&gt;that Square’s push into the area won’t stop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22569309/square-hardware-wallet-bitcoin-jack-dorsey"&gt;at releasing a hardware wallet&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the company is creating a new business, to go with existing units like Tidal and Cash App, which is “focused on building an open developer platform with the sole goal of making it easy to create non-custodial, permissionless, and decentralized financial services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yC2Lf3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Like our new &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; hardware wallet, we’re going to do this completely in the open. Open roadmap, open development, and open source. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brockm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@brockm&lt;/a&gt; is leading and building this team, and we have some ideas around the initial platform primitives we want to build.&lt;/p&gt;— jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1415765943385563139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dHSWHW"&gt;What does that mean exactly? Is the new business called TBD, or is the name “to be determined” at a later date? In the words of at least one editor of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “I absolutely do not know what he is talking about.” When contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a spokesperson for Square declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hc25hx"&gt;What we do know comes mostly from the unit’s new leader Mike Brock, who confidently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brockm/status/1415795489954361347"&gt;tweeted out several names of TBD’s founding team&lt;/a&gt;, and says he’s “super excited to return to the world of open source.” Further updates on exactly what TBD is doing should come via Twitter and GitHub accounts. But exactly when those updates might arrive is, well, TBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sea4Dn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@jack&lt;/a&gt; said, we're going to be biasing towards being open and transparent. So we'll be sharing a lot more about our plans in the coming days and weeks. We're also going to be thinking of ways to include the community in our planning. So stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Brock (@brockm) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brockm/status/1415795491879624705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>England footballer calls out weak response from social platforms after online abuse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New Digital Mural Of The Three Black Footballers Racially Abused After England Lost The Euro’s Final Is Unveiled" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JvcslaJxs1CDh0KmJAxTrWZ7NbI=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69588368/1328717139.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A mural in support of England footballers Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka was unveiled in Manchester. The three were targeted with racist abuse online after the Euro 2020 final. | Photo by Charlotte Tattersall/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rS8mPr"&gt;Bukayo Saka, a player on England’s national football team said in an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRWkU6mLLlJ/"&gt;Instagram post Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that social media platforms did not do enough to prevent the racist abuse he and his teammates were subjected to after the team’s loss to Italy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4814z4"&gt;“To the social media platforms &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/instagram/"&gt;@instagram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/twitter/"&gt;@twitter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/facebook/"&gt;@facebook&lt;/a&gt; I don’t want any child or adult to have to receive the hateful and hurtful messages that me Marcus and Jadon have received this week,” Saka wrote. “I knew instantly the kind of hate that I was about to receive and that is a sad reality that your powerful platforms are not doing enough to stop these messages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vfqd8X"&gt;Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, and Saka, who are Black, were among England’s players to participate in a penalty shootout to decide the winner of the UEFA Euro 2020 championship match on July 11th. England ultimately lost, and the players ‘social media accounts, including Twitter and Facebook-owned Instagram, were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22574082/black-players-england-italy-football-soccer-racist-instagram-twitter-telegram"&gt;flooded with racist comments and messages&lt;/a&gt; not long after the game ended&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIrMbW"&gt;Instagram head Adam Mosseri told a BBC reporter on Wednesday that Instagram had mistakenly marked some of the comments aimed at the players that used monkey emojis as benign “which they are absolutely not.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vxUMk2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have technology to try and prioritize reports, and we were mistakenly marking some of these as benign comments, which they are absolutely not. The issue has since been addressed, and the publication has all of this context.&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Mosseri   (@mosseri) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1415335234300690433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzdNQJ"&gt;Twitter said Monday it had removed more than 1,000 tweets and suspended some users for violating its policies against harassment and hateful content; Facebook said it had suggested using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394611/instagram-tool-filter-abusive-direct-messages-harassment"&gt;Instagram’s hidden words tool&lt;/a&gt; to remove the objectionable comments from being visible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5mLbl"&gt;But as Saka wrote in his post, he knew the hateful posts were coming, yet Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and other social platforms typically seem to be in reaction mode when incidents like this occur, rather than taking steps to prevent abuse from happening in the first place. It was unfortunately not hard to predict that there would be racist reactions after the end of the match: Throughout the UEFA tournament, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/13/england-players-take-knee-wembley-euro-2020-boos-applause"&gt;fans at Wembley Stadium had booed&lt;/a&gt; their home team when players kneeled before games as an anti-racism protest. England &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/03/gareth-southgate-england-fans-boos-taking-knee"&gt;manager Gareth Southgate said last month&lt;/a&gt; that fans booing England players kneeling before a friendly match against Austria felt like it was critical of the team’s Black players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Xdbxv"&gt;It shouldn’t be up to the targets of abuse to push for better responses from social platforms, especially when everyone except the platforms themselves seem to know what’s coming. &lt;/p&gt;
