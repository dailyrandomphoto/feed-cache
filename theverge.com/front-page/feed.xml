    <title>TikTok adds another way to remix videos with green screen duets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The TikTok music note logo against a dark background. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tReyOaGc_FX4s7mFGDX4x-uQpKo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69276104/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N1QYua"&gt;TikTok launched a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/green-screen-duet"&gt;new feature today&lt;/a&gt; that combines the existing duet and green screen formats, letting people use other TikToks as the background for their own. “Green Screen Duet” now appears as an option in the duet layout menu. Like all duets, the creator of the original video is tagged in the caption of the new one. This could be great news or a portent of even more sensory overload in the app, depending on your sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A layout menu in TikTok that shows duet options labelled left and right, green screen, react, and top and bottom." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L_uZQkH5pwIb_ku15nne_qtJ_vU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22509596/tiktok_green_screen_duet.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The green screen option among duet layouts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fj6f0K"&gt;The new feature will likely be a useful tool for people who already use TikTok’s “green screen” to put images in the background of their videos, or edit videos to create a similar effect. It also might make TikToks that are reactions to other TikToks more visually cohesive than Duets (where videos are tiled next to each other) and Stitches (where a clip of the original video plays for a few seconds before the new one starts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1fsDJ"&gt;TikTok continues to roll out new formats as other companies add TikTok-like features to their own apps. Instagram’s Reels can now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360544/instagram-reels-remix-tiktok-duet-feature-launch"&gt;be “remixed”&lt;/a&gt; like TikTok duets. Snap says its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;TikTok competitor Spotlight&lt;/a&gt; reached &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266970/snap-spotlight-100-million-mau-q4-2020-earnings"&gt;100 million users&lt;/a&gt; two months after it launched, and YouTube is planning to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429350/youtube-shorts-fund-video-payments-tiktok-competitor"&gt;pay creators&lt;/a&gt; who use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334540/youtube-shorts-us-beta-tiktok-competition-launch"&gt;YouTube Shorts&lt;/a&gt; to encourage them to keep posting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xy9YCN"&gt;For a better idea of how the feature works, here’s someone adding sign language interpretation to a TikTok that’s already a running bit between several users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uQB39y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@signstorm/video/6959683573557382405" data-video-id="6959683573557382405" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@signstorm" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@signstorm"&gt;@signstorm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="duet" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/duet"&gt;#duet&lt;/a&gt; with @themikeandmoshow I just had to add to this!! &lt;a title="greenscreen" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/greenscreen"&gt;#greenscreen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="funnyduet" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/funnyduet"&gt;#funnyduet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Marcus DiPaola" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6958374958800079621"&gt;♬ original sound - Marcus DiPaola&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Chevy Bolt EUV gets lower than expected EPA range of 247 miles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DKmPeU5CpKlcZdBiC_9LvdJ34hk=/0x0:1280x853/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69276001/2022_Chevrolet_BoltEUV_007.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eZMtaU"&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says the new “EUV” version of the 2022 Chevy Bolt will travel an average of 247 miles on a full battery pack — three miles shy of the estimate General Motors provided when the vehicle was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/14/22280449/chevy-bolt-ev-euv-super-cruise-range-price-specs"&gt;announced in February&lt;/a&gt;. The updated version of the existing Bolt, meanwhile, will top out at 259 miles, which is exactly what GM had predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ciYRd1"&gt;The EUV (which stands for “electric utility vehicle”) is basically a Bolt with a more traditional compact SUV shape. It’s about six inches longer and &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; roomier than the standard Bolt, and as such it weighs nearly 100 pounds more. That it can make fewer miles on the same 65kWh battery pack is not surprising, but it’s helpful to finally have an EPA rating in order to benchmark it against the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDOkOm"&gt;Those ratings are for city and highway driving combined. The EPA says owners should expect to get a little more out of each new vehicle when confined to city driving (roughly 267 miles for the EUV and 280 miles for the regular Bolt), while more demanding highway driving will drain the battery faster (about 223 miles for the EUV and 233 miles for the regular Bolt). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vq50l4"&gt;The Bolt was one of the first real long-range options to hit the EV market that wasn’t made by Tesla. And while it’s disappointing that GM wasn’t able to leverage some of the technology it’s developing for its upcoming Ultium series of battery packs (which will power far more capable EVs like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370058/gm-chevy-electric-silverado-pickup-truck"&gt;electric Silverado pickup&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22362072/hummer-suv-electric-price-specs-release-date"&gt;pair of electric Hummers&lt;/a&gt;), the new Bolts offer more than enough range for most people’s daily driving needs at a more palatable price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxrDFP"&gt;The bigger question with these new Bolts will be the reliability of their battery packs. GM recently had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;issue a recall&lt;/a&gt; in response to a handful of reports of fires in the battery packs, and so did Hyundai, which used the same LG Chem batteries in its Kona EVs. The Detroit automaker’s fix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417634/chevy-bolt-recall-fire-fix-software-update"&gt;involves installing additional software&lt;/a&gt; to monitor for abnormalities in the battery packs, and it told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this software would be installed on all new Bolts moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Save up to $100 on some of the best 4K TVs at eBay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3EASgUhpSKCDEn_DNU0VTlRS8Q=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69275793/LG_CX_Angled_Press_Shot.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;LG’s CX series of OLED TVs offer stunning black levels and plenty of smart features. | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZnYJZm"&gt;There’s a great site-wide deal happening for a limited time at eBay on, well, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fb%2FeBay-Coupons%2Fbn_7109765183%3F_trkparms%3D%2526clkid%253D1590810078023031888%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F12%2F22432408%2Febay-4k-tv-lg-oled-samsung-qled-neo-tcl-mini-led-sale-deal-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x-hdmi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a lot of things&lt;/a&gt;. The&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;offer code &lt;strong&gt;PICKSUMMER15 &lt;/strong&gt;is active through May 16th (ending 11:59PM PT) and knocks 15 percent off your purchase total when applied (via &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/05/12/save-15-on-the-new-nest-hub-google-wifi-and-tons-more-smart-tech-in-latest-ebay-sale/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The code will automatically show up at checkout when you have eligible products in your cart, but you’ll need to check the box to activate it. The terms state that you can use it two times, which is impressive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aoz5PS"&gt;To receive the maximum $100 discount, you’ll need to spend more than $666. With that in mind, purchasing a 4K TV with this deal seems like a smart idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNYuF7"&gt;We scoured eBay’s various pages to find which products are eligible for discounts, and the TVs on offer were better than expected. In fact, we found a few models included in news editor Chris Welch’s guide for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;the best gaming TV to pair with a PS5 or an Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s not clear how much stock is available for each model. Also, the final price might not be the lowest we’ve seen on these models, but they’re better than what other retailers are currently offering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oKr-UsNoVCuargkwbXUYeriybgw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22400097/tcl.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sG4WNk"&gt;First up is TCL’s 65-inch 6-series Mini LED QLED 4K TV (model 65R635). It’s listed for $1,100 on eBay, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F184448058243%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F12%2F22432408%2Febay-4k-tv-lg-oled-samsung-qled-neo-tcl-mini-led-sale-deal-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x-hdmi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but this offer code brings it down by $100 before taxes take effect&lt;/a&gt;. The QLED TV features 120Hz support in 1440p resolution — which the Xbox Series X supports — but it tops out at 60Hz for 4K gameplay. It also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low-latency mode (ALLM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xiu4mp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462612"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="juRk7J"&gt;If you want to upgrade to an OLED, LG’s 55-inch CX model is $1,296 once the offer code goes into effect. The LG CX features a brilliant OLED display and HDMI 2.1 support, which opens the door to 4K resolution displaying up to 120Hz. Like the above TCL model, it also supports VRR and ALLM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dfNjsP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462552"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tq-7QVKOY7dmwRW9Xa_IUK_-nVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217046/DSCF2777.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk9NtO"&gt;The most high-end option we found — it retails for $1,698, post discount — was Samsung’s 55-inch Neo QLED QN90A 4K TV. It’s the company’s first series of LCD TVs to use Mini LED backlighting tech, which results in better contrast and higher brightness. It also has an HDMI 2.1 port, allowing for a powerful PC or gaming console and 4K support at up to 120Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BoLhqf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462562"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="1dOxiX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>The original Xbox background is here to haunt the Xbox Series X / S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q9YIob7rKeW0qeZoWIWwmEmTQsw=/187x0:1414x818/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69275727/Screen_Shot_2021_05_12_at_9.12.40_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TOepfI"&gt;The Xbox has gone through several visual periods during its life span, from an edgy and yet somehow dorky green alien thing, to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517293/xbox-series-x-s-dashboard-ui-october-update-release"&gt;a modern look&lt;/a&gt; that could be described as “I know how to use Excel but I can still have fun.” But like stumbling on a Facebook album from high school, you can still hold on to a bit of the past. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1392240418016878592?s=20"&gt;As spotted by senior editor Tom Warren&lt;/a&gt;, the original Xbox background is now an option for the Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKSvJ3"&gt;The new (old) styling was added as a new dynamic background as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430549/xbox-update-may-quick-resume-saved-audio-passthrough"&gt;Tuesday’s system update&lt;/a&gt;, which notably also brought improvements to quick resume. Titled “The Original,” it looks like a higher-resolution version of the glowing green orb that was at the center of the first Xbox’s user interface. Please note: it’s not the interface itself (Microsoft wouldn’t abandon tiles like that), but it is a recognizable part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gUYIAC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Xbox insiders can now access the original Xbox dashboard animation as a dynamic background called "The Original" &lt;a href="https://t.co/Nvh6D8iw2X"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Nvh6D8iw2X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1392240418016878592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Z5eV8"&gt;My experience with the original Xbox is admittedly secondhand. To me, it was the loud box that lived at my friend’s house and let us play &lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved&lt;/em&gt;. But I do think you can get a pretty solid hit of nostalgia just by looking at this background and remembering what used to be. A simpler, more green time, when consoles were consoles and not Metro-inspired (or I guess &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/11/15615812/microsoft-fluent-design-system-project-neon-features"&gt;Fluent Design-inspired&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/21/4352654/xbox-one-powered-by-windows-app-development"&gt;pseudo-Windows&lt;/a&gt; machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3axnYK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X7hRb2BXL1A?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VEVcwe"&gt;Microsoft and the Xbox team have been through a lot since the 2001 launch of the Xbox — the Xbox One was briefly positioned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/8/5075216/xbox-one-tv-microsofts-plan-to-take-over-the-living-room"&gt;as a sort of cable box&lt;/a&gt; — but there’s some charm missing in the current dashboard and user experience. That charm was exchanged for a mostly better, if more complicated experience overall, but the heart still remembers what the brain forgot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Il13IW"&gt;For a longer trip down memory lane, check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21152674/xbox-design-history-360-one-series-x-console-dashboard"&gt;our visual history of the Xbox Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; and ponder with me how the Xbox 360’s “Blades” could be crammed on the Series X and S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7Do7CA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZYhri2tsM4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p id="sFxUPK"&gt;Spotify’s adding another big name to its list of exclusive podcasts: Dax Shepard and his show &lt;em&gt;Armchair Expert&lt;/em&gt;, which is one of the most popular podcasts running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roquwJ"&gt;All past and future episodes will be available exclusively on Spotify starting July 1st. Along with the exclusive distribution rights to &lt;em&gt;Armchair Expert&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Spotify is also signing a first look deal with Armchair Umbrella Network, meaning it gets first dibs on any other shows the network creates. The show will be exclusively licensed to the company for an undisclosed number of years. The terms of the deal were not shared, but the program will move over to Megaphone, a Spotify company, for hosting, and Spotify will handle ad sales in-house&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fa5Qfd"&gt;The deal harkens back to Spotify’s Joe Rogan partnership. Similarly, Rogan’s show, &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21263927/joe-rogan-spotify-experience-exclusive-content-episodes-youtube"&gt;went exclusive to Spotify&lt;/a&gt; in September last year, although clips continue to live on YouTube. &lt;em&gt;Armchair Expert&lt;/em&gt; is widely considered one of the world’s most popular shows, and &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/stories/more/the-highest-earning-podcasters/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; estimated&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 that it had a monthly audience of 20 million people, putting Shepard near the top of its list of highest-earning podcasts. Also on that list are Rogan and Bill Simmons, who sold &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21124201/bill-simmons-the-ringer-spotify-acquistion-podcast-purchase"&gt;his company The Ringer&lt;/a&gt; to Spotify in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtIflJ"&gt;Clearly, Spotify has centered its podcasting strategy on bringing the biggest names to its platform exclusively. That seems to be working, given that the company said last month that it grew its premium subscribers by 21 percent year over year and that people were listening to podcasts for longer periods of time. It also added that &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt; performed “above expectations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ME9Elq"&gt;A key component of Spotify’s podcasting moves is that it makes shows available to both free and paying users, and also includes ads for both of them. This means that Spotify makes ad money on every podcast listen. With &lt;em&gt;Armchair Expert&lt;/em&gt;, the company can bring more people to Spotify, offer another popular show exclusively, and sell more ads, all in a quest to become the dominant place people consume audio.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6313uZ"&gt;Humble Bundle is launching a new bundle to raise money for COVID-19 relief in India and Brazil, which have recently seen a surge in COVID-19 cases. The new &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/humble-heal-covid-19-bundle"&gt;Humble Heal: COVID-19 Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is jam-packed with a lot of great games, including the cult hit RPG &lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;, mind-bending puzzler &lt;em&gt;Baba Is You&lt;/em&gt;, turn-based strategy games &lt;em&gt;Into the Breach &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Wargroove&lt;/em&gt;, as well as ebooks and software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQUhDZ"&gt;Humble Bundle says that all of the content in the bundle is worth more than $640, if everything was purchased on its own, but you can get everything in it for as little as $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMeoDd"&gt;All of the proceeds from the bundle will go to charities including &lt;a href="https://www.directrelief.org/"&gt;Direct Relief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/"&gt;Doctors Without Borders (MSF)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/"&gt;International Medical Corps&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.giveindia.org/"&gt;GiveIndia&lt;/a&gt;, according to Humble Bundle. The bundle will be available from now through May 19th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus introduces the ZenFone 8 Flip and mini flagship ZenFone 8</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TbbKSZKNqtENZYByAL5R9R-AaEA=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69275349/ZenFone8_group_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The larger, pricier ZenFone 8 Flip includes a camera module that rotates forward for selfies.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SoD7xy"&gt;Asus is taking a slightly different turn with this year’s ZenFone series. While the ZenFone 8 Flip looks a lot like previous years’ phones, with its large screen and flip-out camera mechanism, the company went back to the drawing board for the flagship ZenFone 8 and redesigned it as a smaller one-hand-friendly device: kind of an Android iPhone mini. The two phones make their global debut today, priced at €599 for the ZenFone 8 and €799 for the ZenFone 8 Flip. Asus says that only the ZenFone 8 will come to North America; it is expected this summer. The US price is still being finalized, but the company says it will cost somewhere between $599 and $799.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDCtMW"&gt;The ZenFone 8 and 8 Flip both use a Snapdragon 888 chipset, but that’s about as far as the similarities go. The ZenFone 8 features a 5.9-inch 1080p OLED display with a fast 120Hz refresh rate. It will be sold in configurations of up to 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage and includes an IP68 waterproof rating. Both the 8 and 8 Flip support 5G — but when the ZenFone 8 arrives in the US, it will only work on AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile’s LTE and sub-6GHz 5G networks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1W36z258N7p_w5BcEdYsC-QArSE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22508007/Zenfone_8_group_shot_all_color_04.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 offers just two fixed rear-facing cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OfKeES"&gt;The ZenFone 8’s two rear cameras are borrowed from the ZenFone 7 series: a 64-megapixel standard wide with OIS that kicks out 16-megapixel images and a 12-megapixel ultrawide. Since the camera array doesn’t flip forward to play the role of a selfie camera, there’s now a 12-megapixel camera under an off-center hole punch on the front panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1E3Ie"&gt;The phone’s compact size is reflected in its 4,000mAh battery, which is much smaller than previous years’ 5,000mAh cells. It supports 30W wired charging with the included charger, but it doesn’t offer wireless charging. There are dedicated dual stereo speakers and even a 3.5mm headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OcVQQp2WUNOW0A_Cn66QVFFTrko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22508015/Zenfone_8_Flip_all__color_03.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 Flip’s rotating camera housing features a stronger, more durable motor this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VKeWzM"&gt;The ZenFone 8 Flip is, by necessity, a much larger device with a 6.67-inch screen — a 1080p OLED panel with a 90Hz refresh rate. It offers a bigger 5,000mAh battery with 30W wired charging, includes up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, but it lacks an IP rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7VZbZ"&gt;The main attraction, of course, is its flip-out camera array. The triple-camera hardware is borrowed from the ZenFone 7, including a 64-megapixel main camera, a 12-megapixel ultrawide, and an 8-megapixel telephoto with 3x optical zoom. Asus says the module itself has a stronger motor with better endurance; users can expect to get up to 300,000 “flips” out of it. A custom RhinoShield case will be sold separately in some markets with a sliding cover to protect the housing and a sensor that automatically activates the camera when the cover is opened.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ZenFone 8 review: an Android iPhone mini</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The ZenFone 8 delivers flagship-level build quality and performance in a small package&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4C38dH"&gt;After a couple of generations making phones with flip-out cameras and increasingly large displays, Asus has taken the ZenFone 8 in a totally different direction: small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSrT9H"&gt;The flipping camera concept lives on in the also-new ZenFone 8 Flip, but it’s no longer a standard feature across this year’s ZenFone lineup. Instead, priced at €599 (about $730), the ZenFone 8 lands in the upper-midrange class with a conventional rear camera bump and a much smaller 5.9-inch display. As a side note, final US pricing is TBD — Asus says somewhere between $599 and $799 — but it will be coming to North America, unlike last year’s model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwwRdC"&gt;Rather than an attention-grabbing camera feature, the focus of this design has been to create a smaller phone that’s comfortable to use in one hand, which Asus has done without skimping on processing power or higher-end features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1hmwn"&gt;It’s an Android iPhone mini, and it’s fantastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u3cT9V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10494874"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Go0J86tAcMmzjPPXSpyPncCJlc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499353/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus designed the ZenFone 8 with one-handed operation in mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FW7hIJ"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 screen and design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IhH9SM"&gt;The ZenFone 8 may be small, but that hasn’t kept it from offering the latest flagship processor: a Snapdragon 888 chipset, coupled with 6, 8, or 16GB of RAM (my review unit has 16GB). I can’t find fault with this phone’s performance. It feels responsive, animations and interactions are smooth, and it keeps up with demanding use and rapid app switching. This is performance fitting of a flagship device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cElERS"&gt;The display is a 5.9-inch 1080p OLED panel with a fast 120Hz refresh rate that makes routine interactions with the phone — swiping, scrolling, animations — look much more smooth and polished than a standard 60Hz screen or even a 90Hz panel. By default, the phone will automatically switch between 120 / 90 / 60Hz depending on the application to save battery life, but you can manually select any of those three refresh rates if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EFkcZ"&gt;The display’s 20:9 aspect ratio was carefully considered by Asus. The company says it settled on this slightly narrower format so the phone would fit more easily into a pocket, and it does. I can’t get it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way into a back jeans pocket, but it mostly fits. More importantly, it fits well inside a jacket pocket and doesn’t feel like it’s going to flop out if I sit down on the floor to tie my shoes. The ZenFone 8 is rated IP68 for dust protection and some water submersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2grdcK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I can’t get it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way into a back jeans pocket, but it mostly fits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o69ULu"&gt;The front panel is protected by Gorilla Glass Victus and houses an in-display fingerprint sensor, while the back uses Gorilla Glass 3 with a frosted finish that’s on the matte side of the matte / glossy spectrum. The front panel is flat, but the rear features a slight curve on the long edges for an easier fit in the hand. At 169 grams (5.9 ounces), it’s heavy for its size, and it feels surprisingly dense when you first pick it up. The phone’s frame is aluminum, giving the whole package a high-end look and feel. There’s even a headphone jack on the top edge as a treat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8XM4b"&gt;The power button (an exciting shade of blue!) is well-positioned so my right thumb falls on it naturally with the phone in my hand. Same for the in-screen fingerprint sensor: the target appears to be positioned higher on the screen than usual, but that actually puts it within a comfortable reach of my thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3w8VC5"&gt;I’ll admit up front that I have a personal bias toward smaller phones, but the ZenFone 8 just feels great in my hand. I’ve spent a lot of time using big devices over the last six months, and I’ve gotten used to it. But the ZenFone 8 is the first device that feels like it was adapted to &lt;em&gt;me,&lt;/em&gt; not something I’ve had to adapt to using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0UuUZnwxRe3j921AYa4ifsE1k5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499355/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A smaller phone means a smaller battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kpaymP"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 battery and software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8mbHH8"&gt;The phone’s small size makes a smaller battery a necessity — 4,000mAh in this case, much smaller than the ZenFone 6 and 7’s 5,000mAh. I felt the difference in using this phone versus a battery-for-days budget or midrange phone, but I had no problem getting through a full day of moderate use. I even left Strava running for 20 hours by accident, and the battery still had some life in it the next morning. The ZenFone 8 supports 30W wired charging with the included power adapter, which takes an empty battery to 100 percent in a bit more than an hour. Wireless charging isn’t supported, which makes the ZenFone 8 a bit of an outlier in the flagship class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPNxId"&gt;Asus offers a ton of options to help stretch day-to-day battery life as well as the overall lifespan of your battery. There are no fewer than five battery modes to optimize phone performance or battery longevity on a daily basis, and different charging modes let you set a custom charging limit or stagger charging overnight so it reaches 100 percent around the time of your alarm for better battery health. You won’t find class-leading battery capacity here, but rest assured if you need to stretch the ZenFone 8’s battery, there are plenty of options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kj8abO"&gt;The ZenFone 8 ships with Android 11, and Asus says it will provide “at least” two major OS with security updates for the same timeframe. That’s on the low side of what we’d expect for a flagship phone, especially compared to Apple’s typical four- or five-year support schedule. An important note for US shoppers is that the ZenFone 8 will only work with AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile’s LTE and Sub-6GHz 5G networks; you can’t use this phone on Verizon, and there’s no support for the fast, but extremely limited, millimeter-wave 5G networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ctgUaWF69tS9vSVEdPG5w8MwvQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22507533/DSC00661_rear.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 offers standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8l2mPu"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MbIlch"&gt;There are just two cameras on the ZenFone 8’s rear camera bump, and they are both worth your time. Rather than cram in a depth sensor, macro, or some monochrome nonsense, Asus just went with a 64-megapixel main camera with OIS and a 12-megapixel ultrawide. They’re borrowed from last year’s model, minus a telephoto camera and the flipping mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5utE4G"&gt;As in the ZenFone 7 Pro, the 8’s main camera produces 16-megapixel images with vibrant color and plenty of detail in good light. Images can lean a little too far into unnatural-looking territory, and some high-contrast scenes look a little too HDR-y for my liking. But overall, this camera does fine: it handles moderately low-light conditions like a dim store interior well, and Night Mode does an okay job in very low light, provided you can hold the phone still for a few seconds and your subject isn’t moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bFBXWG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10494947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xx4klZ"&gt;A skin-smoothing beauty mode is on by default when you use portrait mode, and it is not good. Skin looks over-smoothed, unnaturally flat, and brightened, like your subject is wearing a couple of layers of stage makeup. Turning this off improves things significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBkFNw"&gt;The ultrawide camera also turns in good performance. Asus calls it a “flagship” grade sensor, and while that might have been true in 2018, it’s at least a step up from the smaller, cheaper sensors often found in ultrawide cameras. Likewise, the front-facing 12-megapixel camera does fine. Beauty mode is turned off by default when you switch to the selfie camera, and thank goodness for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maIBzp"&gt;There’s no telephoto camera here, just digital zoom. On the camera shooting screen, there’s an icon to jump to a 2x 16-megapixel “lossless” digital zoom to crop in quickly, which works okay, but it isn’t much reach, and it just makes the limitations of the small sensor and lens more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wAwwx"&gt;On the whole, the camera system is good but not great. The lack of true optical zoom or a telephoto camera is a disappointment, but you can’t have everything on such a small device, and I’d personally take an ultrawide before a telephoto any day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2yyJwz2m9mIkB8t4cUpzDgDLbuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499354/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 doesn’t sacrifice a flagship experience to achieve its small form factor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZDiMQY"&gt;The ZenFone 8 fills a void in the Android market for a full-specced, small-sized device. The Google Pixel 4A is around the same size, but it’s decidedly a budget device with a step-down processor, plastic chassis, and fewer niceties like an IP rating or a fast-refresh screen. Aside from battery life, which is manageable, you give up very little in the way of flagship features to get the ZenFone 8’s small form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzbIbh"&gt;You have to look to iOS for this phone’s most direct competition: the iPhone 12 mini, which it matches almost spec-for-spec from the IP rating down to the camera configuration. The 12 mini is actually a little smaller than the ZenFone 8, and when you factor in storage capacity, it’s likely to be the more expensive choice at $829 for 256GB. However, when you consider that the 12 mini will probably get a couple more years of OS and security support, it may be the better buy in the long run, if you’re flexible in your choice of operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jc0CEI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Flagship-level build quality and performance quite literally in the palm of your hand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rEL2JQ"&gt;I like the ZenFone 8 a lot, but I’m not sure it’ll find a big audience, at least in the US. Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;having trouble selling the iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;, and if there’s one thing Apple is good at, it’s selling phones to US customers. As much as I hate to entertain the idea, maybe we’ve gotten used to giant phones. I love how the ZenFone 8 feels in my hand and in my pocket, but I do notice how much smaller the screen and everything on it seems compared to the bigger phones I’ve used recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Etfrj"&gt;There are also a few important considerations, like the lack of compatibility with Verizon and the comparatively short support lifespan of the phone. If you need the absolute best in battery life the ZenFone 8 can’t offer that, and if you want a class-leading camera, you’ll need to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="OIO7v3"&gt;All that said, the ZenFone 8 will be the right fit for a specific type of person, and I can heartily recommend it to my fellow small phone fans. You’ll get flagship-level build quality and performance quite literally in the palm of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slate is selling audiobooks that you can listen to through your podcast app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3GjKd-wbWIAtta5od4lFJUiXqG0=/72x0:1187x743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69275135/image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Slate is now selling audiobooks that can be listened to in the podcasting app of listeners’ choice.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PXC7CM"&gt;Slate is getting into the audiobooks business. The online magazine and podcast subscription seller is &lt;a href="https://books.supportingcast.fm/"&gt;launching its own audiobook store&lt;/a&gt; today in partnership with multiple publishing companies. The store will list and sell popular titles but with the added benefit of making the audio accessible through listeners’ preferred podcast app instead of a separate audiobook-only platform. This is likely its biggest sell for listeners, although Slate will compete on price, too. Listeners also will buy these books a la carte, meaning they don’t have to subscribe to an ongoing membership as they may through Audible, the biggest name in audiobooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFrjh6"&gt;The store and its functionality are powered through Slate’s &lt;a href="https://www.supportingcast.fm/"&gt;Supporting Cast&lt;/a&gt;, its technology that powers recurring revenue audio services, like subscription podcasts. This means that on the back end, Slate is hosting publishers’ audiobooks on its servers and creating private RSS feeds for them, which can then be inserted into any podcasting app that supports them, like Apple Podcasts, Pocket Casts, and Overcast. The process basically looks like this: Listeners navigate to Slate’s store, buy a book, and can then either listen online or they can tap on the app of their choice to have the feed automatically inputted. They can also manually copy and paste the feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVfwBo"&gt;David Stern, CEO of Supporting Cast, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its software automatically looks for suspicious activity and will revoke access if it suspects someone is sharing their private RSS link outside of a “very small flexible range.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xkhJD"&gt;Initial partners include Penguin-Random House, Simon &amp;amp; Schuster, HarperCollins, and Hachette. Slate wouldn’t disclose its royalty agreements with these companies. The initial catalog is small, especially compared to Audible’s thousands of titles, but Slate seems to be interested in books that its team has reviewed for the website. As evidence for why Slate thought it should pursue an audiobook business, the company says it’s generated more than $1 million through its book affiliate business, and that it tested selling Danny Lavery’s &lt;em&gt;Something That May Shock and Discredit You &lt;/em&gt;audiobook and sold 500 copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xvO0L"&gt;Slate’s move into audiobooks continues the trend of podcast-oriented companies looking to audiobooks and audiobook companies looking to podcasts. Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248393/spotify-audiobook-exclusive-recordings-david-dobrick-hilary-swank"&gt;launched audiobooks&lt;/a&gt; in its app, hosted by celebrity talent, earlier this year and has reportedly put the founder of Parcast in charge of its audiobook efforts, per &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-26/spotify-plans-hiring-spree-in-bid-to-challenge-clubhouse?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;. Audible also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536963/amazon-free-podcast-update-catalog"&gt;brought podcasts&lt;/a&gt; to its app for the first time last year. (Apple, for its part, sells audiobooks through its Books app, not Podcasts app.) The broader bet seems to be that people who enjoy listening to things will want to do so from one app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z6vajW"&gt;“It’s sort of a no-brainer,” Stern says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o81euQ"&gt;Slate is positioning itself to let people choose what app they want to listen within, although neither Spotify nor Audible support private RSS feeds.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The grid needs to smarten up to reach clean energy goals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NbovbFQTxn1qY_O64p_fh6zXMCk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69273956/acastro_210510_4555_smartGrid_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Smart grids were supposed to come to the rescue a long time ago&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jyKEUO"&gt;In the future, our vehicles and homes will be in constant conversation with the power grid. Smart thermostats will send information about how much energy the home is using or potentially wasting to heat or cool itself. Solar panels will say how much energy they have on hand, while electric vehicles will share information about when and where they’re charging and how much juice they need for their travels. Solar and EV batteries might even offer up the energy they’re storing in case it’s needed elsewhere.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcseeR"&gt;“You just plug it in, and somehow it automatically talks to its nearest neighbors,” explains Ben Kroposki, a director at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. “[It] says, ‘Hey, I just want to let you know I’m out here. I can provide these kinds of services back.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6P4n1"&gt;That conversation is the backbone of what’s called a “smart grid.” While America’s aging grid system was built to send electricity in one direction — from power plants to homes and businesses — smart grids are a two-way street. Homes and buildings send information and electricity back to the grid or to other homes and buildings. An electric vehicle battery, for example, might be able to provide power to an area in the middle of a blackout. A smart grid also listens for directions from the utility, so that it charges whenever solar or other renewable energy is most abundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4i0kPH"&gt;It’s a simple enough idea that for more than a decade has been sold as a way to improve the efficiency, environmental impact, and resiliency of the power sector. But electricity grids still have a long way to go to get “smart.” They’ve managed to fail spectacularly under the stressors of climate change and more extreme weather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZhxBQ"&gt;After years of underinvestment, there’s renewed hope that long-awaited smart grids might actually come to fruition. President Joe Biden can’t reach his goal of getting the power sector to run on 100 percent clean energy by 2035 without a smarter grid. And grids can’t get smarter without the kind of urgency that Biden has injected into overhauling America’s infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQi33I"&gt;“This probably is the most exciting time in the power system history in the last 50 years,” Kroposki says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZAyprD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A smarter grid can better manage power demand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VNn9QR"&gt;While Biden’s clean energy goals are vital for staving off a deeper climate crisis, the plan has exposed some weaknesses in our current grid system that a smart grid could help solve. For starters, old grids were built to accommodate a constant flow of electricity; power plants can ramp generation up and down at will to deliver as much energy as people demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LStV9M"&gt;Wind and solar power aren’t so consistent. When it’s sunny and gusty, too much energy might overwhelm the grid, leading to some of it going to waste. There also isn’t enough energy storage — aka batteries — to hold onto that excess renewable energy so that it can be used when sunshine and wind die down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TENvs"&gt;A smarter grid can better manage power demand, making use of renewable energy when it’s most abundant and preventing energy shortages. Embattled California utility PG&amp;amp;E, which has come under scrutiny for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20908434/california-blackouts-utilities-fires-lawsuits-san-francisco-bay-area-pge-pacific-gas-electric"&gt;pervasive rolling blackouts&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352090/bmw-pge-ev-california-vehicle-grid-charging"&gt;has partnered with BMW&lt;/a&gt; to implement “smart charging” for its electric vehicles. Their pilot “smart charging” program incentivizes EV drivers to charge their cars whenever there’s excess renewable energy, typically in the middle of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lSolmF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That revolution is gaining momentum&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aY7tq3"&gt;That kind of coordination can also prevent blackouts by taking pressure off the grid when there’s peak demand, typically when people come home from work in the evening or crank up their air conditioners in the summertime. Managing that demand will become even more important in the race to electrify homes, buildings, and transportation so that they can run on renewable energy. Some cities have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22360189/gas-stove-methane-leaks-electric-climate-change"&gt;banned new gas hookups&lt;/a&gt; in favor of electricity, and California &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;banned&lt;/a&gt; the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles starting in 2035. Electricity grids will have to brace themselves for all those changes. “We’re going to need to speed up the pace of the grid investments in order to keep up with everything that’s happening outside the grid,” says Karen Wayland, CEO of the GridWise Alliance whose members include utilities, tech, and energy companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hVNvG3"&gt;A flood of new electric vehicles could overwhelm old, creaky grids. But EV batteries could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451642/tesla-ev-electric-vehicle-energy-grid-battery-day-elon-musk"&gt;become an asset&lt;/a&gt; in an updated, smarter grid. The same is true for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403271/virtual-power-plants-california-apartment-buildings-solar-energy"&gt;residential solar power&lt;/a&gt; systems with batteries. They might &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21523976/virtual-power-plants-solar-energy-grid-resilience-climate-change"&gt;provide backup power&lt;/a&gt; when extreme weather causes problems, like when a storm forces a power plant offline or when a heatwave drives up power demand for air conditioning. But to be able to do that, utilities need to build out a way to communicate with those batteries so that they know when they’re available and how much capacity they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtBzSU"&gt;In the middle of an outage, a smart grid can also sense excess power being wasted. It might have been able to divert power from empty downtown Houston skyscrapers to people facing freezing temperatures inside their homes during the Texas freeze earlier this year. “In laser, scalpel-like precision, you can turn the building lights off or down … and avoid having to do the rolling blackouts by being able to connect in real time to those assets,” Michael Bates, global general manager of energy at Intel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288292/texas-grid-upgrade-disaster-planning-power-outage-energy-crisis"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SIDvru"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Powering a real city with a virtual power plant|95786" data-volume-uuid="e9cbe1c6a" data-volume-id="95786" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-672" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V28461"&gt;Seeing the potential of smarter grids, the Obama administration funneled $11 billion toward developing smart grids and the reduction of power outages. But the money wasn’t enough. Outages have been &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/03/01/power-outages-like-the-one-in-texas-are-becoming-more-common-in-america"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt; since 2009, when Biden announced the investment as part of an economic stimulus package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmSDlW"&gt;Obama’s initial investments spurred the adoption of smart meters in the US, which can tell utilities how much energy a household is using at regular intervals. (Before that, utility workers had to come and read the meters). The future will be more granular; utilities may be able to read how much energy each appliance in your home is using. That initial funding was only a drop in the bucket in terms of what’s needed to unlock the full potential of smart grids. A &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-utilities-smartgrid-epri/u-s-smart-grid-to-cost-billions-save-trillions-idUSTRE74N7O420110524"&gt;2011 report&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="https://www.epri.com/research/products/1022519"&gt;Electric Power Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; estimated that it would cost up to $476 billion over 20 years to fully modernize the grid. To make things harder, the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/465001-trump-officials-eliminate-board-that-advised-on-smart-grid"&gt;dismantled&lt;/a&gt; a smart grid advisory board that Obama had started and took other actions to &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/08/how-trump-appointees-short-circuited-grid-modernization/615433/"&gt;kneecap grid modernization research&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZza4D"&gt;Similarly, Obama set the US on course to slash greenhouse gas emissions — but not with the same urgency we’re now seeing under the Biden administration. That’s in part because so much time has been wasted, and the climate crisis has only grown more destructive and exacerbated by disasters that batter energy grids. “The utilities and the markets still felt like it was more of an evolution,” Bates tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I think everyone’s now starting to see this more as a revolution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MZ4A2U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Increasing cyber threats” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ETPOaz"&gt;That revolution is gaining momentum. A new &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/27/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-expansion-modernization-of-the-electric-grid/"&gt;advisory council&lt;/a&gt; formed last week to push for funding to modernize the power sector. Representatives from labor and environmental groups, utilities, and tech companies are all part of the council calling for a $50 billion investment. That would go toward making sure every household has a smart meter, plus installing sensors, controls, and other equipment across the grid to analyze and respond to energy supply and demand. There’s also a need for a better communications infrastructure for utilities — either through fiber optic or wireless networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ueiXx"&gt;The council is also backing Biden’s sweeping $2 trillion infrastructure plan, which proposes laying down new high-voltage transmission lines to make more resilient grids.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02K39f"&gt;Beyond garnering the money and political will necessary to really get the ball rolling on modernizing the grid, there are more technical details to hammer out. Keeping an increasingly digital power system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429433/colonial-pipeline-cyber-security-ransomware-attack"&gt;safe from hackers&lt;/a&gt; is one of them. So Wayland’s group is calling for $1 billion in funding for the Department of Energy to deploy cybersecurity technologies, and another billion to split between monitoring cyber threats and developing a cybersecurity workforce for the energy sector. In April, the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-administration-takes-bold-action-protect-electricity-operations-increasing-cyber-0"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; a 100-day action plan to safeguard utilities’ control systems from “increasing cyber threats.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fU82c3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Things will probably continue to get more complex in the race to “get smart”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9WtstT"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277300/florida-water-treatment-chemical-tamper-teamviewer-shared-password"&gt;security breach at a water treatment plant&lt;/a&gt; in Florida in February is one example of how vulnerable utilities can become. In that case, hackers tried to increase the concentration of a chemical in the water to poisonous levels. The attempt failed because a person working at the plant figured out what was going on and adjusted chemical levels back to safe levels. Safeguards in a smarter grid could prevent a similar attack on the power sector, Wayland says, by blocking any commands that fall outside a predetermined range of operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hhJEKj"&gt;Another crucial detail to troubleshoot will be to figure out how electricity rates and energy bills will differ under a smart grid system. To better manage power demand, experts say that smart grids should respond in real time to changing electricity rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtKydt"&gt;Smart grids could one day make suggestions for, or even automate, when people charge their cars or heat their homes. But it has to offer an incentive to get people to agree to do that. The personal payoff is taking advantage of lower electricity rates based on the time of day that you purchase electricity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Fw0ks"&gt;Right now, most residences pay fixed rates for electricity, which insulates their bills from sudden price changes related to supply and demand. On the other hand, with so-called time-of-use rates (which is more common for heavy industry than for residences), electricity rates can vary by the hour. During the Texas freeze, a similar kind of rate system shocked many homeowners. While people who signed up for that rate system might have saved money by paying wholesale prices throughout the year, some saw their electricity bills &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291426/texas-blackouts-utility-bills-electricity-cost-energy-insecurity"&gt;skyrocket&lt;/a&gt; by thousands of dollars because of fuel shortages. Electricity rates under a smart grid would be similarly variable, so there will need to be protections put in place to ensure that doesn’t happen under a new rate system with smart grids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="vwNB8Y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10493160"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gCyIfo"&gt;“Now that may only occur once every nine years, but when that occurs you get really upset,” says Henry Lee, director of the Environment and Natural Resources Program at Harvard Kennedy School. “And you run to your elected officials and you run to the regulators to say that they’re ripping me off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i41sln"&gt;That complication illustrates the need for policy changes on top of advances in infrastructure and tech. “You have to build in some safeguards, you know, from that happening,” NREL’s Kroposki says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPVu15"&gt;Things will probably continue to get more complex in the race to “get smart.” After all, what a fully fledged smart grid really looks like is sort of a moving target. The realm of what’s possible will only grow with more technological breakthroughs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="1Y2QiE"&gt;“For me, it’s a portfolio of continually evolving solutions,” says Luis Munuera, an energy technology analyst at the International Energy Agency. “I don’t see so much an endpoint as a process.” &lt;/p&gt;
