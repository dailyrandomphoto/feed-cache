    <title>Coinbase is down amid massive cryptocurrency plunge</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X3QXNg"&gt;Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is &lt;a href="https://status.coinbase.com/"&gt;experiencing a “partial” outage&lt;/a&gt; this morning for its entire site and application. Additionally, both Coinbase and Binance are reporting issues specifically focused around withdrawals of Etherium and ERC-20 tokens this morning due to “network congestion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NYtOH"&gt;“We’re seeing some issues on Coinbase and Coinbase Pro and we’re aware some features may not be functioning completely normal. We’re currently investigating these issues and will provide updates as soon as possible,” Coinbase commented in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDY5cufK9QxKy-7OhjiDYx7f1sQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525368/Screen_Shot_2021_05_19_at_9.28.17_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fTrnqQ"&gt;The outage comes in the midst of a massive cryptocurrency plunge over the past week — and particularly the past 24 hours — that has seen the price of some of the most popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Etherium, and Dogecoin drop precipitously. As of publication time, Bitcoin has dropped almost 30 percent down to $31,000; Ethereum, down 40 percent to $2,424, and meme coin Dogecoin dropped almost 45 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lloK4l"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&amp;amp;src=ctag&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;$ETH&lt;/a&gt; and ERC20 withdrawals are temporarily disabled due to network congestion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you for your patience and apologies for any inconvenience caused. &lt;a href="https://t.co/BbECDgDUay"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BbECDgDUay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Binance (@binance) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1395002603558391812?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XOODLl"&gt;In its S-1 filing, Coinbase specifically noted that “abrupt changes in volatility or market movement can lead to extreme pressures on our platform and infrastructure that can lead to inadvertent suspension of services across parts of the platform or the entire platform.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is reinventing Docs to fight a two-front war</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wz3Q6E8sbRr5X4mDtWeaAv60dko=/100x0:1641x1027/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310391/352_2021_05_18_352_chromescreen.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L54kiz"&gt;Let’s talk about some big changes announced to the platform where many of us get a lot of work done: Google Workspace, home to the suite of cloud-based tools that includes Docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KA59FZ"&gt;The relative stagnation of Docs in a rapidly evolving world of productivity tools has been an ongoing fascination for me. When I’m writing for myself, I use slick, modern tools like Notion, Bear, and (more recently) Substack. But when I write for others, it’s most often in Docs, which launched 15 years ago and looks more or less the same as it has since the late 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UyCgV6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For casual users of Docs, the entire conversation can end here&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aXf2ny"&gt;Create a new document in any other digital writing tool and you see an infinite canvas; in Docs you see a picture of an 8.5 x 11-inch sheet of paper, since Google assumes that any document you create is going to be printed eventually. On &lt;em&gt;paper&lt;/em&gt;. To me, the skeuomorphism of Docs has long been a sign that Google has fallen behind the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MujCHE"&gt;And so I was happy to learn, at long last, that’s changing. Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440226/google-workspace-smart-canvas-features-docs-updates"&gt;Dieter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="sJWxpU"&gt;Ultimately, Google is working to make every single part of its Workspace suite of apps interconnected. You’ll be able to start a Meet video chat directly within Docs or share your Doc directly into a Meet call with a button in the doc. All of that integration will be useful, but it also has the benefit (for Google) of perhaps enticing users away from using competing products like Zoom or Slack and instead using Google’s cohesive suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VfgCQ"&gt;There is a smattering of other small updates: emoji reactions in Google Docs in addition to traditional comments, a new timeline view in Google Sheets for improved project management, and best of all: a new “pageless” view in Google Docs that does away with the assumption that your document is meant for an 8.5” x 11” piece of paper. It dynamically resizes the doc to the size of your web browser the way a web app ought to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GONaLK"&gt;The changes are part of a suite of updates to Workspace that, I would argue, represent the biggest set of changes to Docs in more than ten years. While the shift away from printed pages is perhaps the most symbolic move here, the larger idea is to create more dynamic, interactive documents that are integrated with other Google products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRAAKH"&gt;As Dieter notes, this will offer a lot of practical convenience for average users: starting quick video chats from inside a document; creating polls to help colleagues make quick decisions; and quickly assigning tasks to colleagues via the @-mentions that are already standard across most enterprise software. Together, they create what Google is calling a “smart canvas” in Workspace, built on individual objects called “smart chips.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8Ebl9k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The learning curve is real&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hJk3E8"&gt;Notably, smart chips can include file formats other than Google’s own — you’ll be able to embed document previews from Microsoft Office docs, for example. Modern enterprise software is built on these kinds of useful integrations — Slack raced out to an early lead mostly because it let you monitor events across an entire suite of third-party products, including Google’s — but they have been next to nowhere inside Docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dsscwi"&gt;For casual users of Docs, the entire conversation can end here: Google is making a series of minor helpful changes to Docs, making the overall experience 10 or 15 percent better for you. Great! I wish every product I used got 10 to 15 percent better every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91d0g7"&gt;At the same time, Google’s incremental approach to improving Docs also reveals a dilemma that the company often faces when trying to improve its most-used products. Introducing lots of changes is appealing to designers, developers, and the tech enthusiasts like me that they serve, but often causes average users to revolt. And Google is so big that even well-funded startups with great ideas can fail to gain traction. The result is that the safest path at Google and other big companies is almost always to change things very little. The more users the product has — and Workspace has hundreds of millions of users — the more true this generally is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqvlvq"&gt;Just look at Gmail, which has changed relatively little over the past decade. The company’s noble attempt to build a new email experience from scratch, a standalone product called Inbox, won praise from reviewers for its more innovative features. But it failed to get much traction and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17848500/google-inbox-shut-down-sunset-snooze-email-march-2019"&gt;was eventually ended&lt;/a&gt;. Gmail is still thriving in large part due to indifference from the startup world, which sees a daunting challenge in trying to build a new email service from scratch. But it’s telling that when Basecamp tried last year with its email service Hey, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch"&gt;it was overflowing with novel ideas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OzvHhj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;using Docs has come to feel like going back in time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GsvgiJ"&gt;Google’s dilemma with Workplace is even more acute, since the company is fighting a two-front war. On one side you have Microsoft, the original target that the products once called G Suite were designed to antagonize. (That project was a tremendous success, and ultimately dropkicked Microsoft into cloud-based subscriptions for Office five years later.) A huge part of Google’s attention remains occupied by the picayune needs of current and former Office users and can enforce a kind of slow, linear progression in the product roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sinhog"&gt;On the other hand, though, you have the upstarts: beautiful, feature-rich, fast-iterating products like &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/"&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://coda.io/"&gt;Coda&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://airtable.com/"&gt;Airtable&lt;/a&gt;. What these products lack in the lowest-common-denominator simplicity of Google Workspace is more than made up for in power and flexibility. The learning curve is real — I think I tinkered with Notion for six months before I figured out how it really fit in my life, which isn’t much of an endorsement — but before the Google I/O announcements, using Docs has come to feel like going back in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RuNYjF"&gt;But unlike new email apps, productivity tools are getting real traction. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/08/11/coda-startup-backed-by-kleiner-perkins-and-greylock-raises-80-million/?sh=3a91b0787825"&gt;Coda raised money&lt;/a&gt; at a valuation of $600 million last year. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/04/01/buzzy-work-app-notion-hits-2-billion-valuation/?sh=2ba2432878ec"&gt;Notion raised $50 million&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the pandemic, and by April 2020 was valued at $2 billion. As of March, the spreadsheet-based Airtable was &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/airtable-is-now-valued-at-5-77b-with-a-fresh-270-million-in-series-e-funding/"&gt;valued at $5.77 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mm8Y2"&gt;It’s clear that these startups’ ability to move fast is drawing in new users at a rapid clip. And because they aren’t serving legacy user bases in the millions, they can afford to have a learning curve. Coda CEO Shishir Mehrotra — himself a former Googler, having run product at YouTube — told me Docs could only afford to evolve so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YMph5J"&gt;“I think they’re gonna get stuck at what I call the &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/paper"&gt;Dropbox Paper&lt;/a&gt; point,” Mehrotra said, referring to the file-storage company’s tepid attempt to improve digital documents. “Which is like, there’s like a set of things you can do without fundamentally changing the paradigm. And it’ll be good — I think a lot of people will love @-mentions and so on. They’re clearly trying to cherry-pick attractive features — they highlighted voting and reactions, which are two of our most popular features. They’re clearly trying to pull individual things in. But if you don’t want to fundamentally change the product, there’s only so far you can go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MpWzma"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the arrival of a world where Docs would start to iterate faster&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="17dlk5"&gt;Toward the end of the day, I hopped on a Meet with Javier Soltero, who has run Google Workspace since October 2019. Soltero has seen both sides of the tech giant / startup divide — he founded the great mobile email app Acompli, sold it to Microsoft, and then successfully transformed it into the mobile Outlook app during a productive stint in the Office organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EGJDs"&gt;Soltero took exception to my suggestion that the Workplace team hasn’t been shipping lately — he pointed to the roll-out of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20973917/google-docs-smart-compose-feature-g-suite-update"&gt;AI-assisted “smart compose” features&lt;/a&gt; over the past couple years, for example. But he acknowledged that the company had a lot of infrastructure work to do — free customers and paid customers have been using different versions of the apps, for example, and Google is spending a lot of time migrating them to a more similar set of features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQMOAW"&gt;Ultimately, though, Soltero told me what I wanted to hear: that the changes would herald the arrival of a world where Docs would start to iterate faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KjWGpR"&gt;“I’m excited because today actually represents a big step toward continued acceleration,” he told me. “It’s not to say that we’re going to get everything right, or that everything’s going to be an earth-shattering, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9wmWZbr_wQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marvin the Martian&lt;/em&gt;-style kaboom&lt;/a&gt;, but we are guided, I think, by the right set of things as a team. And I’m seeing the organization get really excited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLruQT"&gt;Of course, Coda and its peers are also accelerating. And despite the welcome moves, Google still has a lot of catching up to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="4j7AGp"&gt;
&lt;p id="t7wjef"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvUt7b"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom Events will try to re-create the in-person conference experience</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kgDR40eci4KKusH-diGrK6g1DV8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310224/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1MAjS9"&gt;Zoom is announcing an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fdocs%2Fen-us%2Fzoom-events.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F19%2F22442919%2Fzoom-live-events-paid-tickets-conferences-chat" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;expanded live events product&lt;/a&gt; today that’s launching this summer. Zoom Events builds on Zoom’s previous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515902/zoom-marketplace-paid-events-onzoom-third-party-app-integrations-zapps"&gt;paid event marketplace, OnZoom&lt;/a&gt;, by layering in features that can support larger multiday events and non-video activities like chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zwj7ld"&gt;Zoom says it’s still building out Zoom Events in the lead up to its launch, but as it stands, it’s both a rebranding of the more small-business focused OnZoom, with new features that serve Zoom’s original pre-pandemic customers —  enterprise companies. Like OnZoom, with a paid Zoom Meetings or Zoom Webinar license you’ll be able to host live events, organize them in a hub, sell tickets, and track stats like ticket sales or attendance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XSyJunVz0slEYDitOtSbR_5I5_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22524315/updated___Multi_Session_Event___Tall.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zoom&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An early example of a multi-session event in Zoom Events.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WHmd2u"&gt;The main way Zoom is focused on improving the experience for larger organizations is by making Zoom Events more friendly to conferences or large group meetings that could be split over multiple sessions. For instance if you were hosting a developers conference like Google I/O, you could have a main event page for your entire conference with a schedule of separate sessions happening over the coming day and week. Event pages will also be able to feature video event previews, a Zoom spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2lTY5"&gt;Zoom is also adding access to text chat in places outside of a typical video call. If you show up to an event before the live video actually starts or stick around afterwards, you’ll be able to see who’s in the event lobby, participate in a group chat channel, and exchange contact information. It’s not a replacement for getting cocktails at a big convention, and it’s probably not as immersive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286520/skittish-virtual-event-space-online-andy-baio"&gt;as something like Skittish&lt;/a&gt; — which places meeting attendees in a 3D space with proximity-based audio —  but it’s at least a small evolution of what Zoom is known for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5C1Y8J"&gt;Zoom was not able to share details on if it will take a commission on paid events or what payment methods users will be able to accept, but OnZoom does accept ticket purchases with PayPal and credit cards, so it seems possible Zoom Events will at least do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXmoII"&gt;You can sign up on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fdocs%2Fen-us%2Fzoom-events.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F19%2F22442919%2Fzoom-live-events-paid-tickets-conferences-chat" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom’s website&lt;/a&gt; to be notified when Zoom Events launches this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPad Pro (2021) review: dream screen </title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Mini LED, major improvement&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="TZBslC"&gt;How much do you care about having a great screen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPrMnJ"&gt;That, really, is the only question that matters with the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro. It has a new kind of display so good I think it is the best thing for watching movies that isn’t a high-end television. It starts at $1,099 for a 128GB version, but increased storage and accessories like a keyboard or the Apple Pencil can shoot the price up fairly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsmZOW"&gt;Both the 12.9 and the smaller 11-inch iPad Pro (which starts at $799) feature Apple’s M1 processor and some other updated specs, all of which are excellent. But even that fancy processor — the same as you’ll find in the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;iMac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac mini&lt;/a&gt; — doesn’t fundamentally change the story of what the iPad Pro is and what it can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOJ3Hc"&gt;It is an iPad, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVndsY"&gt;But the 12.9-inch version of the iPad Pro is an iPad with a very beautiful display. And so again, the question is what that screen means to the experience of using an iPad, especially since the price has jumped $100 compared to the last model. How much do you care about having a great screen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="RUGlvz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10507195"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="GlN0SG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10507198"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bxLxtR"&gt;Here is a very brief, wildly incomplete, and necessarily oversimplified education on flat panel screen technology. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;Chris Welch has a longer one&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glK9JS"&gt;There are two basic types you usually see, LCD and OLED. Both have pixels that combine red, green, and blue subpixels to create colors, but in order for you to actually see those colors the display pixels need to be lit up. OLED pixels are self-lit; LCD panels light up the display pixels by putting one, several, or many LED backlights behind them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOzHr1"&gt;The benefit of LCD panels with LED backlighting is that they’re relatively inexpensive, long-lasting, bright, and unlikely to burn in. The benefit of OLED is that the black pixels are not lit at all, meaning you get superb contrast, but they are relatively expensive and don’t get as bright. Each technology’s strength is the other’s weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTEgYk"&gt;Mini LED, the technology powering the 12.9-inch iPad Pro display, is designed to bring the LCD panel as close as possible to OLED’s contrast and black levels. Its display pixels are not self-lit, but instead lit from behind. The trick is that they’re lit by 10,000 tiny LED lights split up by software into 2,500 local dimming zones. It’s almost like the backlight itself is a lower-resolution screen behind the screen, tracking the image and making sure the black parts of the picture aren’t lit up.  &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The iPad Pro models have the same shape, and though the 12.9 model is slightly thicker, it still worked with an old Magic Keyboard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Both new iPad Pros. The 11-inch lacks Mini LED, but it still has a great screen with ProMotion." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TD9l8Cm0L-hGMBoQJVkkJbTLogY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22524104/vpavic_210516_4592_0267.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Both new iPad Pros. The 11-inch lacks Mini LED, but it still has a great screen with ProMotion.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OpKAFs"&gt;I would never call the display on the 11-inch iPad Pro bad, because it’s a stellar display. But because it uses a more traditional LCD backlight system with fewer dimming zones, you can see that the blacks are actually just a little gray. On the 12.9-inch version, Mini LED lets blacks be truly black, offers a high contrast ratio, and can also get very bright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3NWvg"&gt;Apple is calling this screen the “Liquid Retina XDR display.” And it has all the benefits of Apple’s previous iPad Pro displays: it’s very high resolution, color-accurate, and it has fairly good viewing angles. It supports ProMotion, Apple’s term for a variable refresh rate to increase smoothness and match the frame rate of videos. (“Liquid Retina,” as far as Apple has ever told us, refers to the Apple-specific method of making round corners on an LCD.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvyitW"&gt;The funny thing about the 12.9-inch iPad is that it is very easy to miss the benefits of Mini LED in normal day-to-day use. At first you don’t see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTXo1z"&gt;Sure, there’s great contrast when you’re browsing the web, texting, playing games, and so on, but really it’s not very different from any other iPad. Apple still limits the max brightness in most scenarios to 600 nits, which is bright enough but not eye-popping (the iPad and iPad Air max out at 500 nits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1OD89Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new iMac brings M1 goodness to the desktop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hdr4QH"&gt;The magic kicks in when you are viewing videos or photos in full-screen. When you do that, the iPad Pro kicks into a different HDR mode (or in Apple’s parlance, XDR, for “Extreme Dynamic Range”) that really is stunning. The overall max brightness of the screen jumps up to a powerful 1,000 nits and peak brightness for certain lighting can hit 1,600 nits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWAArh"&gt;You don’t see it until you see it — but then you &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPad Pro with the Liquid Retina XDR display" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aINEKEA-wjFWlfVGt_q0WKQVV-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22524099/vpavic_210512_4592_0192.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The iPad Pro with the Liquid Retina XDR display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JdPAM8"&gt;The joke I’ve been telling people is that the display is so good that &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; actually makes sense when you watch it on this iPad Pro. HDR content is incredible on this screen. I am not a display quality enthusiast, but this screen is functionally equivalent to a high-end OLED TV to my eyes, especially in a dark room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgFjb7"&gt;If you are also not a display quality enthusiast, you might be left unimpressed with descriptions of nits and contrast ratios. I get it, but there are intangibles to the screen that I struggle to describe and have struggled even harder to capture in photos and video. For example, some colors just look better and more accurate to me, especially textured yellows. It just does a better job showing fine detail in situations where dark and light elements get mixed together, like with hair or a building reflecting sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Both Kindle and Apple Books in dark mode, in a very dark room, have a weird gray halo around text not due to normal blooming (Click to enlarge.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Both Kindle and Apple Books in dark mode, in a very dark room, have a weird gray halo around text not due to normal blooming (Photo edited to best replicate what I saw with my eyes)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="svXalO"&gt;The display isn’t perfect, of course. If you run a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYtvehF9-Z8"&gt;local dimming test&lt;/a&gt; you will see blooming on brightly lit pixels against a black background. I only noticed this when running tests that are specifically designed to surface blooming, though. In regular use, everything looked great, sharp, and evenly lit across the entire screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yeeXCq"&gt;There was one odd bug I experienced. Putting either the Kindle app or Apple Books into dark mode and viewing them in a near-pitch black room, I noticed a strange gray haze around all of the text blocks. It’s too big to be blooming; it’s more like the local dimming algorithms got a little confused. It’s a minor thing that I hope gets fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLJ1Re"&gt;For me, the quality of the display when watching video on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is impressive, but it’s also not at the top of my list of priorities when picking a computer. I care a little more about portability, weight, and — yes — functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDsPVW"&gt;So let’s talk about that M1 chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPad Pro is great for video editing" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lF20kEwDsHsYdlIqMirweSX1rmY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22524091/vpavic_210512_4592_0110.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The iPad Pro is great for video editing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9s9wDu"&gt;What does it really mean that the iPad Pro now has the same chip that powers Apple’s latest Mac computers? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPHtDd"&gt;It does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean that iPads will be able to run Mac apps now. While Apple is happy to let the Mac run iPad apps and generally let you do whatever you want on it (except touch the screen), the iPad Pro continues to be a more, shall we say, curated experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzhiBg"&gt;One interesting consequence of the M1 is that for the first time in the history of iOS devices, Apple is publicly disclosing how much RAM these devices have. It’s 8GB on models with 512GB or fewer of storage and 16GB on models with 1TB or more. Whether or not that’s actionable information is another matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znAEml"&gt;The M1 is obviously fast, and in benchmarks it’s faster than the last A12Z Bionic that Apple put in the previous iPad Pro models. But in my usage, I didn’t actually perceive any speed improvements in any of the apps that I use — because everything was already very fast on the iPad Pro. I got the exact same export speeds in Premiere Rush on the brand new 12.9-inch iPad Pro with the M1 as on my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features"&gt;2018 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The 2021 11-inch iPad Pro. This review has focused a lot on the 12.9, but other than the screen and size the 11-inch is the same. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4eZjQC"&gt;Both the RAM and the M1 processor are specs that won’t make an appreciable difference to the vast majority of iPad users. They’re specs that will matter to certain “pro” users who have found specific apps and workflows that push the limit of what an iPad can do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uzcos1"&gt;Apple touts soon-to-be released capabilities in apps like &lt;a href="https://luma-touch.com/lumafusion-for-ios-2/"&gt;LumaFusion&lt;/a&gt; and AR effects, and I have no doubt that there are benefits for power users of those apps. For the rest of us, the reasons to get an iPad Pro are less about speeds and feeds and more about the overall experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vqGSWd"&gt;Another consequence of the M1 is that the USB-C port now supports Thunderbolt accessories. In theory, that’s great. I plugged my iPad into my very fancy CalDigit TS3 Plus Thunderbolt dock and was gratified to see my monitor light up right away. From there, though, I ran into the same old iPad problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3C3LZ7"&gt;I have a USB microphone interface hooked into the dock, and for whatever reason I was unable to get any audio out of it on the iPad, just silence. I also tested out some admittedly old LaCie Thunderbolt 2 drives with an adapter and couldn’t get them to show up in the Files app. Oh and just to remind you: the monitor still can only mirror the iPad Pro — it can’t serve as a second display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgXxNV"&gt;Similarly, the dock has an audio-out so it shows up as a speaker. On the Mac, I can easily change settings to let my computer know to play audio out of its own speakers since I don’t have anything hooked up to the dock for sound. Nothing doing on the iPad Pro — if there’s a setting that would let me move the audio back to the iPad’s own excellent speakers, I couldn’t find it. (Long pressing on the AirPlay icon in Control Center only listed the dock as an option.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIqTMo"&gt;Seemingly every new iPad Pro inspires an admittedly exhausting but also necessary discussion about whether or not iPadOS is actually capable enough to justify the price of the hardware that runs it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmRBkP"&gt;The M1 processor sharpens that discussion. To me, the biggest difference between the Mac and the iPad at this point isn’t the touchscreen, it’s Apple’s approach to the operating system. On the iPad, Apple would rather not offer a feature than have it work in a non-iPad way. That’s noble, but it means the company has committed itself to reinventing a lot of wheels in computing: files, peripheral support, multi-window interfaces, and all the rest have to be re-thought and re-done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIP8dU"&gt;Sometimes that reinvention results in some genuinely great features. The iPad’s “windowing” system takes some getting used to and has its limitations, but it can be a joy to use and makes organizing your digital stuff a bit easier. The problem is that all that reinvention is taking a very long time — it’s been six years since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9288241/apple-ipad-pro-announced-specs-price-release-date"&gt;original iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Center Stage works very well to keep you in frame. And as a bonus, the camera doesn’t blank out when you multitask in Zoom calls anymore.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AQ163j"&gt;One new invention I love is the Center Stage feature. It zooms and follows human faces to keep them centered in the frame of the iPad’s wide-angle front facing camera. It works in any video conferencing app without the need for setup and it performs very well, better than similar features on smart displays like the Echo Show or Facebook Portal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRhVtw"&gt;I’d love it even more if the front-facing cameras on the iPad Pro weren’t &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; in the wrong spot when attached to a keyboard — off to the side instead of centered on top. It’s great that the camera can keep my face centered in frame, it’s not so great that I am literally giving my coworkers the side-eye because I’m looking off to the right of where the cameras are to see their faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Xz45W"&gt;One more note: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399095/apple-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-2020-models-magic-keyboard-incompatible"&gt;Apple has said&lt;/a&gt; that the original 12.9-inch Magic Keyboard “may not precisely fit when closed” as the new iPad Pro is slightly thicker. But when I tested it, I couldn’t discern any difference between the fit on the original and the new, white Magic Keyboard. Both worked — and closed — fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssOGZn"&gt;In any case, set aside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186312/ipad-pro-vs-macbook-air-future-computers"&gt;“What’s a computer” argument&lt;/a&gt; and let’s be more pragmatic. A 256GB 12.9-inch iPad Pro with a Magic Keyboard costs $1,548. A 256GB MacBook Air with the same processor costs $999. And just to be realistic: most people can get more done on the Mac than on the iPad. Taken strictly as a work machine, the Mac wins out on both price and functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgIJTi"&gt;That includes battery life, by the way. Both iPad Pros have good battery life, but it’s not significantly improved over previous iPads. And as many people have discovered during the pandemic, if you actually use the iPad for work all day (especially if you do a lot of Zoom calls), the iPad Pro can conk out in eight hours or less. The MacBook Air edges it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoOX4n"&gt;Last and certainly not least, Apple’s refusal to offer multi-user support on the iPad has gone from being mystifying to obstinate. The company clearly intends this to be a single-user device, despite the fact that it would theoretically make for an even more compelling family computer than the pastel-colored iMacs that share the same processor.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Typing on the iPad Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FtjgSriAmSzteExIfaXQK5M0gLU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22524090/vpavic_210512_4592_0019.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="l4a7Tt"&gt;But to give Apple the benefit of the doubt here, if you’re looking strictly at the iPad Pro as a work machine, you’re probably missing the point. The iPad Pro is simply a more beautiful, more premium object than even Apple’s own laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hESvSF"&gt;It’s easy to take for granted, but the hardware in this tablet really is amazing: Face ID, dual rear cameras that are quite good and paired with LiDAR, quad speakers with superb sound and decent volume, excellent microphones, support for the Apple Pencil, the best screen you can get on a portable device, and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="A1C1Ni"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The justification for getting an iPad Pro isn’t its feature set, it’s the experience of using a well-made, high-end object&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bECkFJ"&gt;The reason to get the iPad Pro 12.9 (or even the 11) is simply to get the best, nicest iPad. Unless you can specifically answer right now which app in your workflow is slowed down by the specs on a lesser iPad, the $599 iPad Air or even the $329 base iPad offer the same core features that most people really use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3C51wb"&gt;Except for a slim minority of people, the justification for getting an iPad Pro isn’t its feature set, it’s the experience of using a well-made, high-end object. Until I hit the limits of iPadOS (which I hit regularly), I enjoy using an iPad Pro more than I do any other computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaAv9f"&gt;The wonderful Mini LED display on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro doesn’t change any of those equations, it just makes the nicest iPad Pro even nicer. And so my yearly refrain about the iPad Pro remains. If you want the very best iPad, this is the very best iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SrTvAP"&gt;Just remember, it’s an iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to download your Google Photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6zXz68O7WMq0T-9vL0m6Rw4ezxc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310116/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KwzXBY"&gt;As of June 1st, 2021, all of the new images and videos that you save to Google Photos will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;count toward your free 15GB of storage&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t take a lot of photos, that may not be much of a problem. And if you own a Pixel phone, your photos still won’t count against your total storage. (However, be aware that those photos will be Google’s “high-quality” compressed images, not the originals.) But if you like to take a good number of photos, be prepared to have to pay for Google One storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LQ11Ko"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to choose a photo storage service","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21561171/photo-storage-service-google-amazon-flickr"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RfdTlM"&gt;You could decide to just shrug and go for a subscription: &lt;a href="https://one.google.com/about/plans"&gt;Google One is not all that expensive&lt;/a&gt;, and it compares reasonably well to other photo services. But if you decide that you’d like to move your photos to a different service — or that you simply want to save them to your computer drive or other local storage — then you’re going to have to export them from Google Photos first. Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xlkm4n"&gt;Google Takeout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bMgDL2"&gt;The first thing to be aware of is that you can’t simply go into Google Photos and download your stuff. You have to use Google’s export tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="NLVFZl"&gt;Go to &lt;a href="https://takeout.google.com/"&gt;Google Takeout&lt;/a&gt;. (You can get to the same page while you’re in Google Photos by selecting Settings, scrolling down to “Export your data,” and clicking on “Backup.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FCwGKK"&gt;You will find a long list of your Google apps; all of them will be pre-checked. If you want to take this opportunity to simply download all of your Google data, just leave them checked; otherwise, look for the “Deselect all” link at the head of the checkboxes and click it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once you’re in Google Takeout, scroll down the Google Photos and select it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GyQYAkkvsjPQI2qPcFuYRf5AkM8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520566/Screen_Shot_2021_05_17_at_10.09.51_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once you’re in Google Takeout, scroll down to Google Photos and select it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BHmeAt"&gt;Scroll down to “Google Photos”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9D8nnl"&gt;If you want to know what formats your data will be exported in, click on the button that reads “Multiple formats.” Basically, your still photos will be exported in the format (PNG, JPG, WEBP) they were imported in, videos will be exported in MP4 format, and your metadata will be exported in the JSON text format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tlu1Fm"&gt;You can also choose not to export all of your albums. The second button under “Google Photos” will probably read “All photo albums included.” If you want to only export some of your albums, click on that and then uncheck any albums you don’t want to export&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4QI11G"&gt;Scroll down and click on “Next step”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can choose how often and in how large a file you can export your photos." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xm-P4--uLlq97odmZw6P2FRG79k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520568/Screen_Shot_2021_05_17_at_10.14.34_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can choose how often and in how large a file you can export your photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="P42JMP"&gt;Now you get to choose from a variety of different options: Whether you want your data to be emailed to you as an attachment or sent to Drive, OneNote, Dropbox, or Box; how often you want your data to be exported (either this once or every two months for a year); the type of file that will be downloaded (a ZIP or TGZ compressed file); and how large you want the exported files to be. For example, if your exported file will be larger than 2GB, you can have it split up into more than one file. I have about 39GB of photos, so that resulted in 19 zipped files. You can request files up to 50GB, but Google states that compressed files over 2GB will be delivered in &lt;a href="https://www.artpol-software.com/ZipArchive/KB/0610051629.aspx"&gt;Zip64&lt;/a&gt; format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HCF4dd"&gt;Click on “Create export”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google will warn you that it may take a while to get a link to your exported file(s)." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qpTTIwmjQcJcrbB3E9nC1QZh1M0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520569/Screen_Shot_2021_05_17_at_10.28.27_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google will warn you that it may take a while to get a link to your exported file(s).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8pBaZA"&gt;And that’s it. Google will warn you that it could take hours or even days for your data to be available; I have several thousand photos, and it took only a little more than half an hour for the link to my export to appear in my email. Of course, depending on your internet connection, it can take much longer than that to actually download them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gnvzg8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDqxkO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cro0X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deezer beats Spotify to Apple Watch offline listening</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JrGhTedDc1eTCvGaW5IQAYsh4jg=/0x7:1240x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69309895/1240x840_logo_3_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Deezer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BrWWhV"&gt;Music streaming service Deezer has revamped its Apple Watch app to let you listen to music without an internet connection, the &lt;a href="https://www.deezer-blog.com/press/apple-watch-app/"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Previously Deezer’s Apple Watch app has only been able to &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:OiX6symDxJMJ:https://support.deezer.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207989465-Apple-Watch+&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=uk"&gt;control music playback on a paired iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, but now paid subscribers can download songs for offline listening when they’re away from their phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZWBUf"&gt;Offline listening has previously been &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204691"&gt;available with Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/4/18169040/pandora-app-apple-watch-offline-playback-now-available"&gt;Pandora&lt;/a&gt;, but similar functionality is yet to appear in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18063838/spotify-apple-watch-download-features"&gt;Spotify’s Apple Watch app&lt;/a&gt;. Spotify recently added the ability to stream music from Apple Watch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549483/spotify-apple-watch-streaming-music-rolling-out"&gt;without needing a paired iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, but the feature still requires a cellular or Wi-Fi connection. Meanwhile, Google just teased that Spotify users will soon be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442880/spotify-youtube-music-download-offline-playlists-podcasts-updates"&gt;download tracks to Wear OS smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it even more strange that it doesn’t offer a similar feature on Apple’s wearables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iTSn1i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’ll be able to download Deezer playlists for offline listening&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ig8How"&gt;Subscribers can download both Deezer playlists as well as their own personalized playlists for offline listening. Naturally, you’ll need enough storage on your Apple Watch to hold the files for offline listening, and Deezer says the feature is only available on the latest Apple Watch Series 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9Lnab"&gt;The new Apple Watch feature follows Deezer’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422637/apple-homepod-mini-deezer-third-party-music-integration"&gt;upgraded integration with Apple’s HomePod smart speakers&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this month. The new functionality lets users control playback with Siri voice controls, and even make Deezer their default music service. Spotify is yet to offer the same option. Then again, with a &lt;a href="https://musically.com/2020/06/23/report-there-were-400m-music-subscribers-globally-at-end-of-q1-2020/"&gt;fraction of Spotify’s market share&lt;/a&gt;, Deezer has to work a lot harder to try and catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oPQqk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 19th, 8:51AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with Deezer’s confirmation that you’ll need an Apple Watch Series 6 to use the feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Big IFA tech show is canceled again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="IFA" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L5WVFm1-VlPHjBwJw596hz9y69I=/0x166:3987x2824/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69309871/ifa_vladsavov.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OMQTLH"&gt;IFA 2021’s physical event &lt;a href="https://b2b.ifa-berlin.com/en/press/press-releases/news_4033.html"&gt;has been canceled&lt;/a&gt; just weeks after &lt;a href="https://b2b.ifa-berlin.com/en/press/press-releases/news_3328.html?referrer=/press/press-releases/#news-en-3328"&gt;promising it would return as an in-person show&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin in September. The event’s organizers cited “global health uncertainties” relating to the Covid-19 pandemic for the cancellation, including the emergence of new variants of the virus and concerns about the speed of vaccine rollouts around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3ZXBW"&gt;This will be the second year IFA has not taken place as normal in Berlin. Last year the show took place in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21230177/ifa-2020-coronavirus-berlin-germany-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;mostly-virtual format&lt;/a&gt;, with companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333840/samsung-life-unstoppable-september-virtual-event"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2020/09/ifa-2020-lg-virtual-exhibition/"&gt;LG&lt;/a&gt; making announcements online coinciding with the dates the show would have normally taken place. IFA is the largest consumer tech show of its kind held in Europe each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FTPdnH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There simply are now too many uncertainties”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3zD5CA"&gt;“Unfortunately, the latest public health developments introduced too much risk into everybody’s planning for the event,” said Kai Hillebrandt, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of gfu Consumer &amp;amp; Home Electronics GmbH. “There simply are now too many uncertainties. Therefore, right now it has become near impossible for anyone to responsibly plan their participation in any trade show.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMFfog"&gt;These uncertainties are yet to force the cancellation of Europe’s other major tech show, MWC, which is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;due to take place next month&lt;/a&gt;. Multiple companies including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430649/samsung-mobile-world-congress-mwc-barcelona-remote-covid"&gt;Samsung, Lenovo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/nokia-joins-ericsson-in-bailing-on-mwc-with-oracle-sony-also-reportedly-out-/d/d-id/767983"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/ericsson-bails-mwc-barcelona-2021"&gt;Ericsson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/mwc-june-2021-barcelona-in-person-sony-nokia-ericsson-oracle-220004011.html"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.telecomtv.com/content/sustainability/what-s-up-with-oracle-mwc-orange-ofcom-5g-spectrum-apple-41023/"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; have said they won’t be attending the conference in-person.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google wants to build a useful quantum computer by 2029</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cxi-5MRIWC2nUOJ0OBQbKcW6gOs=/1x0:640x426/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69309618/ezgif.com_gif_maker__11_.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of Google’s cryostats, which keeps a quantum computer cold enough to reduce errors.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ky7RLo"&gt;Google is aiming to build a “useful, error-corrected quantum computer” by the end of the decade, the company &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/unveiling-our-new-quantum-ai-campus/"&gt;explained in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. The search giant hopes the technology will help solve a range of big problems like feeding the world and climate change to developing better medicines. To develop the technology, Google has unveiled a new Quantum AI campus in Santa Barbara containing a quantum data center, hardware research labs, and quantum processor chip fabrication facilities. It will spend billions developing the technology over the next decade, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-aims-for-commercial-grade-quantum-computer-by-2029-11621359156?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2Eje2"&gt;The target announced at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22435419/google-io-2021-event-recap-biggest-announcements-pixel-android-12-wear-os-workspace"&gt;Google I/O on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; comes a year and a half after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20928294/google-quantum-supremacy-sycamore-computer-qubit-milestone"&gt;Google said it had achieved quantum supremacy&lt;/a&gt;, a milestone where a quantum computer has performed a calculation that would be impossible on a traditional classical computer. Google says its quantum computer was able to perform a calculation in 200 seconds that would have taken 10,000 years or more on a traditional supercomputer. But competitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18171732/ibm-quantum-computer-20-qubit-q-system-one-ces-2019"&gt;racing to build quantum computers of their own&lt;/a&gt; cast doubt on Google’s claimed progress. Rather than taking 10,000 years, &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/10/on-quantum-supremacy/"&gt;IBM argued at the time&lt;/a&gt; that a traditional supercomputer could actually perform the task in 2.5 days or less.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xtNfmMYgXwI0yWyilhvwDuU4Jlw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525094/1_294_R01_1.max_1000x1000.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s new Quantum AI campus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="VJYZj7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:2235291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LnjMk8"&gt;This extra processing power could be useful to simulate molecules, and hence nature, accurately, Google says. This might help us design better batteries, creating more carbon-efficient fertilizer, or develop more targeted medicines, because a quantum computer could run simulations before a company invests in building real-world prototypes. Google also expects quantum computing to have big benefits for AI development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqSEdq"&gt;Despite claiming to have hit the quantum supremacy milestone, Google says it has a long way to go before such computers are useful. While current quantum computers are made up of less than 100 qubits, Google is targeting machine built with 1,000,000. Getting there is a multistage process. Google says it first needs to cut down on the errors qubits make, before it can think about building 1,000 physical qubits together into a single logical qubit. This will lay the groundwork for the “quantum transistor,” a building block of future quantum computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FmySW"&gt;Despite the challenges ahead, Google is optimistic about its chances. “We are at this inflection point,” the scientist in charge of Google’s Quantum AI program, Hartmut Neven, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-aims-for-commercial-grade-quantum-computer-by-2029-11621359156?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “We now have the important components in hand that make us confident. We know how to execute the road map.” Google’s eventually plans to offer quantum computing services over the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jQAjF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo Switch Online reaches more than 100 retro games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/neNRmFFMIIa618oiODEKs1HcvTM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69309252/acastro_210113_1777_gamingstock_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="678304"&gt;Nintendo has hit a milestone with the ever-growing library of retro games included in its Nintendo Switch Online service. The next batch will take the number of available games past 100, with five new titles resulting in a total of 104.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQPLfx"&gt;In keeping with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275714/nintendo-switch-online-games-february-2021"&gt;recent form&lt;/a&gt;, the latest additions are, well, not necessarily blockbuster releases. Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="SASp2K"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Caveman Ninja: Joe &amp;amp; Mac&lt;/em&gt;, a prehistoric action game released in arcades and ported to the SNES by Data East in 1991&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HuXhNf"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Magical Drop 2&lt;/em&gt;, a 1996 Data East puzzle game for the SNES that was originally on the Neo Geo but never previously got a Western release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7Cyo07"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Super Baseball Simulator 1.000&lt;/em&gt;, a SNES baseball game released by Culture Brain in 1991&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RKzYry"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Spanky’s Quest&lt;/em&gt;, a 1991 SNES action game by Natsume about a monkey with a magic bubble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZCyMhT"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ninja JaJaMaru-kun, &lt;/em&gt;a popular Jaleco NES action game released in 1985; it was only ever released in Japan but did come to the Wii Virtual Console around the world in 2007&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Iu7L5W"&gt;So no, still no &lt;em&gt;Earthbound&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVnb2J"&gt;Nintendo is, of course, constrained in what it can release on the service for various reasons including licensing issues, and it is cool to see some more obscure titles get spotlighted. But it’s clear that there isn’t much left in the NES and SNES pipeline, and it’d be a good time for the company to start thinking about perhaps moving on to the N64 — especially now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438499/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which includes &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;) has been removed from sale forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jf3AkK"&gt;Until that hypothetical possibility transpires, you’ll be able to play the five new games when they’re added to the service on May 26th. Nintendo Switch Online costs $3.99 a month or $19.99 a year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>At the Epic trial, Phil Schiller got away clean</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="phil schiller wwdc 2013" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d436xwVq7YrsJxFcEoXtdek2efQ=/0x0:1014x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69308782/2013-06-10phil_schiller.1419980091.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;phil schiller wwdc 2013&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ohf59d"&gt;Phil Schiller is one of the biggest names at Apple, and at the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, his job was to make Apple feel small. Over two days of testimony including several hours of cross-examination, he didn’t always succeed — but he left the stand without facing some of Epic’s harshest lines of attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0iCoi"&gt;Schiller, whose title is simply “Apple Fellow,” has spent more than 30 years with the company. In his testimony, he recounted joining Apple in the ‘90s and watching Steve Jobs reorganize the then-failing computer maker. He reminisced about the iPod and name-dropped largely forgotten competitors like Handango and BlackBerry Messenger. In court, Epic Games has portrayed Apple as a scolding, disingenuous bully that locks users into a walled garden and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429267/epic-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-trial-peely-day-6"&gt;gets mad at cartoon bananas&lt;/a&gt;. Schiller countered with an iOS product showcase and Apple history lesson, and Epic didn’t do much to stop him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zsPov4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Schiller countered Epic with an Apple history lesson&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L4INfY"&gt;The iPod bit was a great encapsulation of Schiller’s time on the stand. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441304/apple-phil-schiller-epic-iphone-testimony-app-store"&gt;As my colleague Liz Lopatto notes&lt;/a&gt;, Schiller famously served as Apple’s longtime marketing head. But at the prompting of an Apple lawyer, Schiller mentioned on Tuesday that he’d also helped invent the iPod clickwheel — one of Apple’s most distinctive hardware designs. And why, Apple’s counsel asked, was a marketing executive working on hardware design? “Product marketing works hand-in-hand with engineering on all of our projects,” Schiller explained. Different parts of Apple simply aren’t siloed into neat divisions; it’s one tight-knit company that makes a many-featured product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="or3Ysc"&gt;That anecdote buttressed a more legally pertinent claim: because of this management system, Apple allegedly has no idea how much the App Store makes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbpYiD"&gt;One Epic-paid expert witness has pegged Apple’s operating margins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414402/epic-expert-apple-app-store-fortnite-court-profit"&gt;between 70 and 80 percent&lt;/a&gt;, something Epic calls evidence of monopoly power. Epic used one of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2017%2F06%2Fdeveloper-earnings-from-the-app-store-top-70-billion%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F18%2F22442395%2Fat-the-epic-trial-phil-schiller-got-away-clean" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s PR statistics&lt;/a&gt; to estimate the App Store made $20 billion or more in commissions by 2017. Schiller didn’t dispute the number. But he said Apple never calculated its overall profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iSlQkC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Product marketing works hand-in-hand with engineering on all of our projects”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vcyx62"&gt;“We don’t deny that it likely is. It’s just that we haven’t managed the business that way,” Schiller said of the App Store. He rattled off iPhone features that require lots of work and benefit App Store developers, but don’t involve spending money on the store itself. Epic attorney Katherine Forrest was incredulous: “Apple can do accelerometers, and machine learning, and have some of the most sophisticated technology around, and it can’t figure out if the App Store is profitable — is that what you’re saying?” Schiller, however, never changed his story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QtsNu"&gt;Apple used Schiller to put a new spin on Epic’s other evidence against it. Epic has cited a 2008 message where he said opening up iOS would mean “throwing out the whole plan” for the operating system. But where Epic described that plan as a single monopolistic gambit, Schiller says he was just describing the straightforward goal of a central App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bkt8Dr"&gt;“You keep going back to that sentence referring to ‘the plan,’ as if there was one special plan that we referred to,” he complained at one point. Where Epic has pointed out phrases like “lock-in” and seeking “stickiness” on iOS, Schiller emphasized that the “stickiness” involved trying to add features that would discourage phishing. “If there’s any plan here, it’s simply to come up with new features to help protect users from security and privacy scams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n72rMO"&gt;Some choices are tougher to spin as fair-minded altruism. One court filing suggests Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;kept iMessage off Android&lt;/a&gt; to discourage switching ecosystems, and another recounts a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;list of sweetener deals&lt;/a&gt; that Apple discussed offering Netflix, despite claims to not favor individual developers. iMessage and the App Store play a huge role in consumer technology, and Epic’s counsel had a chance to push Schiller on them, helping the rest of us better understand how Apple makes these calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjggQl"&gt;But mostly, Epic... just didn’t. Cross-examination touched on topics like iMessage, but Epic’s counsel favored exhaustive readings of policies and lists that could show Apple in an unfavorable light, including every time it mentions relying on open source software and the search results for “BDSM” on the App Store. Little of this related to Schiller himself, although we did glean details like his favorite &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skins (&lt;a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Rogue_Agent"&gt;Rogue Agent&lt;/a&gt; and the New England Patriots), his use of Reddit (“I tried it once”), and whether knows what Pornhub is (allegedly, no.) And while Schiller occasionally sounded frustrated, he stuck to his central claims: the App Store can’t be carved out or measured, and even if it’s made Apple rich, it’s helped everyone else as well.&lt;/p&gt;
