    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 for consoles is just $10 today at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kuR3izi10-yZJc5ti-7lG3EK2o0=/87x0:1707x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69735884/Cyberpunk2077_Im_your_fixer_RGB_en.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I always think this guy looks like Ed Helms.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bBaj4J"&gt;If you’ve ever said to yourself “I think I’ll wait to buy &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;until it’s like $10 or so,” then today is your day to act on that. Best Buy has knocked the price down for the much-anticipated RPG that promptly landed a little flat on its face when it released late last year due to myriad performance issues. Many of those issues have been resolved and developer CD Projekt Red has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627096/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-3-reset-perks-mini-map"&gt;steadily updating the game&lt;/a&gt;, though the game still might not be what some were hoping for. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wsAUy"&gt;The game is available on disc at Best Buy for the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749345477012021267" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749343755863373752#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;, though both can be played on newer consoles like the Xbox Series X or PS5, if you have one. The developer hasn’t yet officially released a proper next-gen patch, but you’ll certainly get better performance out of the gate on the latest hardware than you will on older consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BRQeul"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10197689"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M8SpYY"&gt;Amazon’s Kindle Paperwhite commonly sees some sort of a discount, but today’s $80 price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PQ96B6B?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749344907908952977" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1129183/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-paperwhite---waterproof--ad-supported--10th-generation-%2F-%2FA-75574430" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; is the lowest (usually $129.99). That cost will get you the 8GB base model with ads on the lock screen. In case you’ve been trying to decide whether to get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Now-with-Built-in-Front-Light/dp/B07978J597/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cheaper Kindle that’s currently $65&lt;/a&gt; or this, definitely opt for the Paperwhite. It’s waterproof and the Paperwhite’s display is more pixel dense to make text easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cx9VGR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10695294"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o7WJ8f"&gt;The tube-shaped Nvidia Shield TV streaming device is slightly discounted at several retailers (via &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15224119-nvidia-shield-android-tv-4k-hdr-streaming-media-player-129-99" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Usually $150, you can pick up the version that has 8GB of internal storage, 4K HDR with 60 frames per second support, and microSD storage for $130. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Welch’s late 2019 review&lt;/a&gt;, he praised this gadget’s fast performance, its impressive 4K upscaling of 1080p content, and a more ergonomic remote than previous iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe is bringing the Magic Wand tool to Photoshop for iPad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PxV7g3Bu9qGon1lMHgKxN-E8Ajc=/0x22:1732x1177/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69735798/Magic_Wand.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Selecting objects from a flat background is easier with the Magic Wand.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6TYePA"&gt;Adobe &lt;a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.adobe.com%2Fen%2Fpublish%2F2021%2F08%2F17%2Fphotoshop-releases-major-update-sky-replacement-healing-brush-magic-wand-on-ipad-much-more.html&amp;amp;data=04%7C01%7CClaire.Petras%40edelman.com%7C520c8c50266b4d2c65b108d95c54c84c%7Cb824bfb3918e43c2bb1cdcc1ba40a82b%7C0%7C0%7C637642341490258971%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;amp;sdata=DYYzDpKycoCiC4gpknFJ5BiuscrYAKdXfRqSTpcHNsw%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0"&gt;has announced it’s updating Photoshop on iPad&lt;/a&gt; today with a classic desktop tool missing from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20937111/adobe-photoshop-ipad-now-available-download-cloud-psd-workflow"&gt;the original launch of the app&lt;/a&gt; — the Magic Wand. Some of the intelligent selection features from Magic Wand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/20806997/adobe-photoshop-for-ipad-update-select-subject-tool"&gt;have been introduced to the iPad app in the past&lt;/a&gt;, but now Adobe is adding the tool itself, making it easier to select, adjust, or remove specific elements of a larger project with a tap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHIm65"&gt;The Magic Wand tool on iPad should be familiar to anyone who’s used it on desktop. The tool makes it easy to extract objects from a flat background, select oddly shaped areas, or select a specific colored section of a project to then transform in the usual Photoshop ways.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5T8kIx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Magic Wand makes selecting things easier&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XkMCik"&gt;Adobe is also introducing a new way to share and project what you’re working on to larger screens with Canvas Projection. The plan is that by enabling Canvas Projection and connecting an iPad to an external display with USB-C or HDMI, you can display your project in full-screen, without Photoshop’s UI in the way. iPads can already connect to external displays (its even simpler on an iPad Pro with a USB-C port), but Photoshop’s feature should make it easier to share just what you're actually working on, without distracting menus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/br5mjGLuyVVteELm3ltpMQchiyM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786673/Transform_Warp.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Adobe&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Transform Warp tool in desktop Photoshop is getting independent Bezier handles to adjust curves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gszN7e"&gt;The desktop version of Photoshop is also getting a couple new additions: even more skies to use with the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYq7XOIKWWM&amp;amp;list=PLXw7EK7EUaUEJJvW6cN4roebMHv0mWDaA&amp;amp;index=9"&gt;Sky Replacement tool&lt;/a&gt; under a new “Get More Skies” option, and an improved Transform Warp tool with “independent Bezier handles.” Adobe says the new handles should make it even easier to adjust images wrapped around unusual shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODMJiN"&gt;While the improved Transform Warp and Sky Replacement tools are exciting, it’s the iPad improvements that may leave users the most thrilled. Adobe has been promising something like a full version of Photoshop for iPad &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17969754/adobe-photoshop-apple-ipad-creative-cloud"&gt;since at least 2018&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s always been some kind of caveat. With the recent addition of &lt;a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/whats-new/mobile-2021-6.html"&gt;a fully powered Healing Brush&lt;/a&gt;, plus this launch of the Magic Wand tool, the iPad version of Photoshop is finally starting to look more like the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku now streams over 200 free live TV channels, and here are the newest 17</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aQRPDf348nwh5O3g_2jR2yR_Ek8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69735801/DSCF3628_Edited.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h8Ogez"&gt;Roku is adding more than a dozen new channels to the Live TV Channel Guide on the Roku Channel, its free streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0H8B92"&gt;Roku’s live and linear live TV hub includes more than 200 free channels to surf. The newest slate of channels arriving on its live guide includes CBC, AccuWeather Now, FilmRise True Crime, Haunt TV, and IGN. On Wednesday, the platform will also add a dedicated channel for &lt;em&gt;The Wiggles&lt;/em&gt; to mark the second anniversary of its Kids &amp;amp; Family experience, which launched in 2019. The full list of channels coming to the service is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="R204HU"&gt;AccuWeather Now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VfsUHe"&gt;Baywatch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="djoLdH"&gt;CBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tyHXxT"&gt;El Rey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TQWhxu"&gt;Estrella Games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tej4sO"&gt;FimRise Kids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PbsxUo"&gt;FilmRise True Crime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GYfnf3"&gt;Haunt TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sJBrtX"&gt;IGN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Fx2k0c"&gt;Mega Noticias&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2pxPiJ"&gt;RCN Más&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JEdVge"&gt;Real Madrid TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qXMP33"&gt;So...Real&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4ueEOl"&gt;The Only Way Is Essex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="baA6o2"&gt;Tribeca Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8Ohp0P"&gt;The Wiggles powered by Loop Media, Inc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="W7PJ8g"&gt;Vivaldi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="nyWZai"&gt;As of July of last year, Roku’s live TV guide housed &lt;a href="https://blog.roku.com/live-tv-channel-guide"&gt;100-plus live and linear&lt;/a&gt; channels. That number has roughly doubled in a year, and the company has seen “linear streaming explode over the last year,” Ashley Hovey, director of AVOD growth at Roku, said in a statement. The expansion of the platform’s live TV programming adds to Roku’s recent foray into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22617516/roku-originals-debuting-august-2021"&gt;original programming&lt;/a&gt;, which it’s also been expanding since its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220426/quibi-roku-channel-acquisition-content"&gt;acquisition of Quibi’s library&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utz9D1"&gt;Hovey added that “demand for free, quality programming continues to be of importance to our streamers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scooter sharing has finally come to NYC — is the city ready?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4BySc6SIMQvndqdlgMxkXlhgWYU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69735736/ahawkins_210809_4710_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A lack of protected bike lanes and a sharp increase in cyclist injuries could hamper the Big Apple’s rollout of e-scooters&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZorTxs"&gt;New York City is a scooter-free metropolis no longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JG7pZD"&gt;On Tuesday, August 17th, three companies — Bird, Lime, and VeoRide — deposited 1,000 scooters each in the East Bronx, officially kicking off a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383976/nyc-scooter-permit-selection-lime-bird-veoride"&gt;pilot project to see how battery-powered two-wheelers fare on the mean streets of New York&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQbqeC"&gt;To be sure, New Yorkers have been riding personally owned electric scooters, as well as electric bikes and skateboards, in the city for years, in defiance of local rules prohibiting them. But this will be the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21204232/new-york-legalizes-electric-bikes-scooters"&gt;first time&lt;/a&gt; that venture capital-backed scooter companies will be permitted to operate within the five boroughs. New York has been behind the curve while the rest of the world has already experienced the highs (they’re fun!) and lows (they block the sidewalk!) of scooter sharing. And now the city is about to finally catch up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nb1JrU"&gt;Unsurprisingly, the scooter companies are thrilled to finally have access to New York City’s 8.8 million residents — although the pilot means they’ll only initially be able to reach the 570,000 or so who live in the East Bronx. The city may authorize another 3,000 scooters next year and expand the service area. But that’s only if things go well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BVXmsw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I am, frankly, just so excited to be in New York City”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wavxYr"&gt;“I am, frankly, just so excited to be in New York City,” Lime CEO Wayne Ting told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Even if New York’s not the first city, over time, New York will be the biggest city for micromobility because it has all the ingredients to make micromobility work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46Htob"&gt;In the months since their selection by DOT, the scooter companies have been scrambling to get prepared for launch, hiring on-the-ground operations staff (under the provisions of the pilot, the companies are required to use salaried employees, and not independent contractors, to rebalance and charge their scooters), leasing warehouse space, working with community groups, and unboxing and assembling their vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmWqBc"&gt;“New York is a very different beast,” Ting said. “And so we’re going to learn as we go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/afmyaNiAItTxGN8EDnoJlB6j4Q0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785559/ahawkins_210809_4710_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LR1rCi"&gt;But as to whether the city — and especially the East Bronx — is ready for the sudden influx of 3,000 motorized scooters is another question altogether. There is virtually no on-street protected bike infrastructure in the East Bronx, and the protected bike lanes that do exist (such as the Bronx River Parkway) specifically prohibit battery-powered vehicles like scooters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAwzz6"&gt;I recently rode Lime’s Gen-4 electric scooter along the Bronx River Parkway (even though I was technically breaking the rule against e-scooters) and came away impressed by the company’s upgraded hardware but concerned about the safety of the hundreds of people who will soon also be riding scooters in the neighborhood’s many car-dominated streets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3KRpt"&gt;Vehicle drivers injured 761 cyclists and killed seven in the Bronx in 2020, according to &lt;a href="https://crashmapper.org/#/?cfat=true&amp;amp;cinj=true&amp;amp;endDate=2020-12&amp;amp;geo=borough&amp;amp;identifier=Bronx&amp;amp;lat=40.851734958237735&amp;amp;lng=-73.8174819946289&amp;amp;lngLats=%255B%255D&amp;amp;mfat=false&amp;amp;minj=false&amp;amp;noInjFat=false&amp;amp;pfat=false&amp;amp;pinj=false&amp;amp;startDate=2020-01&amp;amp;vbicycle=true&amp;amp;vbusvan=true&amp;amp;vcar=true&amp;amp;vmotorcycle=true&amp;amp;vother=true&amp;amp;vscooter=true&amp;amp;vsuv=true&amp;amp;vtruck=true&amp;amp;zoom=12"&gt;NYC Crash Mapper&lt;/a&gt;, which relies on statistics provided by the New York Police Department. That’s a 53 percent increase compared to 2019, in which 495 cyclists were injured and none were killed. There was a sharp increase in traffic crashes in New York City in 2020, in part because there were fewer cars on the road because of lockdown orders and more reckless drivers. There was also a spike in the number of people biking as many sought alternatives to public transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFLHC2"&gt;Advocates and elected officials have been sounding a warning about the Bronx’s lack of protected infrastructure for years. “The Bronx is really lagging behind in protected bike lanes, the infrastructure is not there to safely ride a bike,” Bronx Council Member Andrew Cohen &lt;a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/12/01/bronx-cyclist-injuries-will-keep-rising-without-protected-bike-infrastructure-advocates-say/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Streetsblog &lt;/em&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="c7yybu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Advocates and elected officials have been sounding a warning about the Bronx’s lack of protected infrastructure for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rZ49S3"&gt;Marco Conner DiAquoi, deputy director of Transportation Alternatives, the city’s leading bike advocacy organization, said New York City as a whole has lagged behind other major urban centers in terms of building out protected lanes for cyclists and scooter riders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dR9fle"&gt;“It is absolutely a concern that the city has been lacking so much in building out protected infrastructure,” DiAquoi said in an interview. “It’s so far behind the pace that we needed to see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Var74C"&gt;During the last eight years under Mayor Bill de Blasio, city transportation officials have built more than 330 miles of bike lanes, 130 miles of which offer some separation from car traffic. That’s less than the total number — nearly 500 miles — installed during Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s administration. Most of those bikes lanes are unprotected, though, which increases the risk of cyclists and scooter riders being injured or killed by drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZ3v8W"&gt;In the absence of protective infrastructure, DiAquoi said the hope is that scooter riders will find safety in their increased numbers. “The more micromobility usage you have, the safer it is for micromobility,” DiAquoi said. But there is a chicken-and-egg problem, in which many riders, especially women, will avoid scooters altogether if they don’t feel it’s safe enough to ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="P4CiVx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The more micromobility usage you have, the safer it is for micromobility”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="098KvH"&gt;National surveys reveal that the majority of people who ride shared electric scooters are white men in higher income brackets. People of color, including Black and Latino people, are underrepresented — &lt;a href="https://nabsa.net/2021/08/05/2020industryreport/"&gt;though that number is growing&lt;/a&gt;. Concerns about access and equity are what drove the city to locate its first scooter pilot in the East Bronx. The zone is an 18-square-mile area home to a “diverse population” of 570,000 residents, including 25,000 public housing residents, the city said in its press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oh7F76"&gt;In the lead-up to the launch of the pilot program, Lime held several outreach events in the Bronx to educate residents on proper scooter use and safety. Just five residents showed up to one event in July, according to &lt;em&gt;Streetsblog&lt;/em&gt;. And DOT did nothing to help promote the events. But the city is requiring the scooter companies to include safety tutorials in their apps. Riders will have to complete an in-app safety training for the first three times they attempt to unlock a scooter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsSgZs"&gt;“New York City is not going to be the first city where we don’t have sufficient protected bike lanes,” Lime’s Wayne Ting said. “And I think our riders over time will learn to find safe ways to move around the city.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Svf7RQ"&gt;Vandalism is another concern for the scooter companies. Encouraged by social media, anti-scooter types have knocked them into the streets, thrown them off parking garages, or even doused them with lighter fluid and set them on fire. A few years ago, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/16/18141418/scooter-vandalism-rugged-bird-lime-spin-acton"&gt;Oakland had to fish 60 electric scooters out of Lake Merritt&lt;/a&gt;, with environmentalists calling it a “crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgOLG6"&gt;The scooter companies are bracing themselves for similar treatment in New York City — although Ting says the intervening years have made them better prepared for what’s to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T7A_k_DhSzuIzTsqst84111Askg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787278/scooter_nyc.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="35mE0H"&gt;“You’re going to get some form of vandalism,” he said. But Lime’s scooters can’t be used if they’re not connected to the company’s cloud software. It can lock scooters remotely to prevent them from being stolen, and even if they are stolen, the scooters have “no resale value,” because they’re made in-house and can’t be broken into parts. “I feel confident that New York City over time is going to look like what we see elsewhere, which is relatively low levels of vandalism,” Ting added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLs3s2"&gt;Lastly, the business of scooter sharing is notoriously unprofitable. Lime and Bird originally used consumer-grade hardware that wasn’t designed for the wear and tear of being left outside during inclement weather and ridden by a half-dozen different people on some days. In some cases the scooters lasted only for a few weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ngSpT"&gt;Also, the initial investor hype that fueled Bird’s and Lime’s multibillion-dollar valuations has faded. Investment has slowed while costs have ballooned. Bird’s recent decision to go public via a reverse merger has &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/"&gt;shone a light on some of the complicated economics&lt;/a&gt; of scooter sharing. Things could improve — the scooters have evolved into more rugged, street-ready vehicles that could improve their unit economics — but it won’t be an easy road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ie8NxC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’re going to get some form of vandalism”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5TNy4D"&gt;The scooter companies aren’t likely to see a huge boost in revenue from New York City, at least not initially, due to its limitations. Under the pilot, the companies are barred from offering scooter rides in any neighborhood where CitiBike, the city’s popular bike-share system that’s owned by Lyft, is available. And CitiBike is growing its footprint, which means it could eventually come into conflict with the scooter program. At that point, things could get messy for micromobility in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="0rlxXO"&gt;“Longer term I can certainly see some potential conflict,” Transportation Alternative’s Marco Conner DiAquoi said. “But at the same time we don’t care whether one company is in conflict with another. That’s not really our main concern, which is what are the mobility options available for New Yorkers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnlyFans pushes SFW app on iOS and Android as it tries to shake adult image</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_1617zJKBacKAzPouZ3m3YO2gEk=/112x0:1260x765/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69735542/Screen_Shot_2021_08_17_at_11.50.06_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OFTV includes original content including the “Unlocked” interview series. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CmoHbH"&gt;OnlyFans is a juggernaut of NSFW content, but its abundance of nudity has stopped the platform launching as an app on &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zype.oftvandroid&amp;amp;hl=en_GB&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Google’s Play Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oftv/id1521600438"&gt;Apple’s App Store&lt;/a&gt;. Now, though, the company is pushing a new app available on iOS and Android called &lt;a href="https://of.tv/"&gt;OFTV&lt;/a&gt;. It features many regular OnlyFans creators but the content is strictly safe-for-work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nne377"&gt;The app has been in development for a while and launched back in January, but OnlyFans is only now promoting it, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-15/onlyfans-creates-its-first-app-with-a-twist-no-nudity-no-cost?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s part of the company’s attempt to move beyond adult content and position itself as a neutral platform like Patreon, allowing entertainers, musicians, and creators to monetize their relationships with fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JybUTH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s no adult content on OFTV”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fTKtVd"&gt;“OFTV provides a super convenient way for fans to watch content from favorite creators,” OnlyFans CEO Tim Stokely &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-15/onlyfans-creates-its-first-app-with-a-twist-no-nudity-no-cost?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “There’s no adult content on OFTV. Because it’s not being monetized and there’s no direct impact on creators’ earnings, we are able to be in the app store.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="duzlJi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that the app has more than 800 videos, with a flagship series — “Unlocked” — featuring interviews with figures like media personality and former pornographic actress Mia Khalifa, and actress and director Bella Thorne. Other content on the app includes lessons in dancing, cookery, meditation and surfing, as well as various vlogs and video recordings of podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvI5nK"&gt;Although the OnlyFans brand is currently inseparable from its reputation for adult content, it is undoubtedly a huge presence in the online space. It boasts more than 1 million creators and, as of last December, some 85 million users generating $2 billion in annual sales (of which OnlyFans takes a 20 percent cut, netting it around $400 million).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XnMXJ"&gt;Stokely tells &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that the company does not currently plan to charge for access to OFTV or place advertising on its content. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gigabyte to replace ‘exploding’ PSUs that Newegg bundled with RTX 30-series cards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8GGHsDS1uFMJQAx7fPbNawuwyMc=/47x0:554x338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69735258/gigabyteexplodingpsus.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8uh0Te"&gt;Gigabyte is offering a return and exchange service for two of its power supply units (PSUs), following complaints that the products were “exploding” or failing. PSU reviewer &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS0Mjw3BW94"&gt;Aristeidis Bitziopoulos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aACtT_rzToI"&gt;Gamers Nexus&lt;/a&gt; both found that Gigabyte’s GP-P850GM and GP-P750GM models could fail catastrophically, with some sparking and others arriving dead out of the box. These models had been the subject of many negative reviews on Newegg, and were previously part of a forced bundle with RTX 30-series cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sexzEm"&gt;After spending months testing the two PSUs, Gamers Nexus found a surprisingly high rate of failures. Out of the PSUs that Gamers Nexus sourced from YouTube viewers or purchased, 50 percent of the GP-P750GM failed. Gamers Nexus even managed to fry a Gigabyte RTX 3080 card during its testing, although it’s not clear if this was directly related to the PSU failing or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YCevoa"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aACtT_rzToI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BhISxL"&gt;Gigabyte has &lt;a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Press/News/1930"&gt;responded to the findings&lt;/a&gt; (spotted by &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/gigabyte-will-replace-exploding-psus-takes-shot-at-med-1847491215"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), while also casting doubt on them. “We were made aware by third parties of concerns regarding potential issues of the GP-P850GM and GP-P750GM tripping at high wattages when tested via DC Electronic Load equipment for extended lengths of time repeatedly close to the 120 percent to 150 percent OPP trigger point,” says a Gigabyte spokesperson. “This level of extended testing could severely reduce the lifespan of the product and components of the GP-P850GM and GP-P750GM.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhLW2r"&gt;The over-power protection (OPP) trigger point is a power supply protection that will activate when you’re pulling more power from a power supply than its rated capacity. Gigabyte claims that reviewers were “repeatedly” pushing the load for “extended lengths of time, but &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Xts3pvbcFos"&gt;Gamers Nexus has responded&lt;/a&gt; in a video entitled “Gigabyte twists truth about exploding power supplies in dangerous way.” Gamers Nexus claims it only triggered the OPP once during its testing on each power supply, and that this shouldn’t be enough for a PSU to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvaff6"&gt;Gigabyte is now adjusting the OPP trigger point on both the GP-P850GM and GP-P750GM, with the 850W model now operating at a maximum of 1050W instead of the 1300W limit before. The 750W model has also been reduced to an OPP trigger limit at a maximum of 925 watts, much less than the 1125W limit before. Gigabyte is also offering a return and exchange service for the GP-P850GM and GP-P750GM, with &lt;a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Press/News/1930"&gt;details available on Gigabyte’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJ4ZBu"&gt;It has taken Gigabyte more than six months to respond to multiple reports of failures and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fgigabyte-gp-p750gm-750w%2Fp%2FN82E16817233029%3FDescription%3DGP-P750GM%26cm_re%3DGP-P750GM-_-17-233-029-_-Product%26quicklink%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;poor reviews on Newegg&lt;/a&gt;. The response isn’t a good look for Gigabyte, which could have issued a recall and worked closely with expert reviewers instead of doubting their findings. The issues came to light as the power supplies were used in Newegg bundle deals on the RTX 30-series cards, with people desperate to buy a new GPU and being forced into also buying a power supply that’s been branded by some reviewers as “unsellable.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mastercard is phasing out magnetic stripes on its cards starting in 2024</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2G-vJy7Ee5yFC43UPOvXkpbL6mc=/51x0:2237x1457/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69735225/stripeless_white.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A card with an EMV chip and contactless, but not magnetic stripe.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Mastercard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sRwOh1"&gt;Mastercard is phasing out the use of magnetic stripes on its credit and debit cards over the next decade, as the industry moves towards more secure or convenient alternatives like chips and contactless payments, the &lt;a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2021/magnetic-stripe/"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. It says it will be the first payments network to phase out the technology, which dates back to the 1960s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEBNvM"&gt;Mastercard says the transition will start in 2024, when the stripe will no longer be required on new cards in regions like Europe where chip cards are already widely used. In the US, where the adoption of chip payments has been slower, the transition will start in 2027. From 2029, no new Mastercard debit or credit cards will come with a magnetic stripe, and they’ll be gone completely by 2033. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YExX78"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The magnetic stripe was invented in the 1960s&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HOR8XJ"&gt;Magnetic stripes were a huge improvement over the flatbed imprinting machines (aka “knuckle-busters”) that cashiers used to have to use to record card details. But in the 1990s the global EMV chip standard was introduced, which paved the way for cardholder details to be held more securely on small integrated circuit chips embedded into cards. Nowadays, &lt;a href="https://www.emvco.com/about/deployment-statistics/"&gt;86 percent of in-person card transactions&lt;/a&gt; globally use EMV chips. These are typically authenticated using a PIN, but &lt;a href="https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/business/overview/safety-and-security/authentication-services/biometrics/biometrics-card.html"&gt;biometric fingerprint authentication&lt;/a&gt; is also emerging as a more secure alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxUoiY"&gt;Interestingly, the US hasn’t adopted EMV chips to the same extent as the rest of the world. Last year, the percentage of in-person card transactions using the technology in the country was lower at around 73 percent, despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9432115/us-stores-chip-and-pin-credit-cards-deadline-today-not-ready"&gt;efforts to encourage adoption&lt;/a&gt;. The US has historically been an outlier for a number of reasons, including &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/27/target-credit-card-breach-chip-pin-technology-europe"&gt;its size and low fraud rates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hq7ObR"&gt;Although chip cards are being positioned as the successor to magnetic stripes, Mastercard notes that contactless payments, which can be made by either a card or digitally using most modern smartphones, have exploded in popularity during the pandemic. The amount of contactless transactions have increased by 1 billion in the first quarter of this year compared to last year, it says. Globally 45 percent of in-person checkout transactions in the second quarter of the year were contactless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4cyTe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Astro teams up with Timbuk2 to make bags for all of your gaming gear</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Astro BP35 backpack and CS03 sling bag" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Te26G5Zo6YS6a55WutTOh962ZE=/0x0:6710x4473/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69735179/astrobags.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Astro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wAPJfD"&gt;Astro’s latest set of products are a bit outside of its usual lane. Instead of releasing a new gaming headset or controller, it has worked with reputable bag and accessory brand Timbuk2 during the pandemic to make a backpack and a sling bag with Astro’s name printed on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeByjM"&gt;Astro’s focus on gaming means that, unsurprisingly, each bag has been made to carry your gaming essentials. As such, they’re built with sections dedicated to storing — and, crucially, protecting — things like headphones, controllers, and laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wf0ils"&gt;The smaller sling bag, called the CS03, costs $79.99 and seems tailor-made for Switch owners looking for protection and utility from a bag. Lifting the bag’s magnetically sealed front flap reveals a pocket to store keys or other small objects like a phone. The main zipper reveals a larger section with small sleeves that can carry up to 14 Switch game cartridges. There’s enough room here in the stretchy mesh sleeves for things like cables and earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MjvJAM"&gt;The Nintendo Switch fits inside the bag’s main pocket perfectly and aims to provide enough padding to protect your console from bending or suffering a fatal blow. The console section will fit the Switch or Switch Lite (it will also be able to fit the slightly larger Switch OLED that will release later this year, Astro told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;). It’s also water-resistant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Astro Timbuk2 CS03" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OkOGuUEzcPIhjk4bhlHk3tG8254=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785773/cs03bag.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Astro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The CS03 offers ample support to protect your Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E6U5ho"&gt;For gamers with a lot more gear to lug around, the BP35 backpack costs $199.99 and has 35 liters of total storage volume. Like the CS03, it is water-resistant, and it’s packed with zippers and pockets. Unzipping its outermost layers reveals one of its highlights: a headphone holder. Headphones that have swiveling ear cups can be secured with a durable-feeling fabric hook that clasps onto a button. Within the same pocket, there are spaces big enough to fit (and protect) a phone or a portable battery pack, a controller, some cables, and other small objects like pens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CjMBg0"&gt;The BP35 is a sizable backpack, but it’s still not quite big enough to easily fit modern consoles (you practically need a small suitcase to pack a PS5 or Xbox Series X). But there’s more than enough storage capacity in its main compartment to fit something like an Xbox Series S and a few additional controllers. If you aren’t a console gamer, it can carry up to two 16-inch laptops. So, if you’re into PC gaming more than console gaming, this might be all the space that you need to pack the necessities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Astro Timbuk2 BP35" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2QNhY_izjawG2NHkoWIKyAfo-KQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785777/bp35bag.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Astro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The outer-most zipper reveals a handy headphone hook, as well as some pouches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AVRUOQ"&gt;Having seen and handled both bags over the past few days, I think these could be good options for gamers who don’t want to fuss with figuring out how to pack gaming accessories. The CS03 and BP35 are doing that for you, with enough padding to feel like your investments are being protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWAwQX"&gt;Both bags are available now through Astro’s site, as well as online through Timbuk2. If you want to see them in person, Timbuk2 is stocking them at its flagship stores around the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qq1TTr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gr464g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California regulators think T-Mobile lied to get Sprint merger approved</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dTVLvz"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M398/K955/398955746.PDF"&gt;a ruling published on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile made false and misleading statements in testimony to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) about its plans for Sprint’s legacy CDMA network. The company will have the opportunity to explain why it shouldn’t face sanctions for violating the commission’s rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwDGYx"&gt;The decision comes after a long back-and-forth that started with a petition from Dish Network in April asking the Commission to modify its decision on the Sprint acquisition. Dish claimed that T-Mobile made statements under oath that indicated the company would shut down Sprint’s 3G CDMA network in a three-year timeframe. When T-Mobile announced it would decommission the network on January 1st, 2022, Dish cried foul and appealed to the commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qSyo3w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A recent letter from the DOJ acknowledged ‘grave concerns’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QGJGQb"&gt;It would seem that CPUC agrees with Dish. It cited testimony given by T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray, who it says neglected to mention that the PCS spectrum the CDMA network occupies would be needed for its 5G build-out. Ray also stated that maintaining the legacy network would not impact its plans for 5G expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLKqTQ"&gt;When Dish called out the 2022 CDMA shutdown date as premature, T-Mobile then claimed that the short timeframe was necessary because that PCS spectrum &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be needed to support 5G services after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QdHh6L"&gt;The Commission relied on the specific false statements, omissions, and/or misleading assurances T-Mobile gave regarding its use of the PCS spectrum and its repeated references to a three-year customer migration period without a degraded experience in framing D.20-04-008. Further, it appears that these false statements, omissions and/or misleading assurances and the related time references were intended to induce the Commission to approve the merger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eUXYLb"&gt;As a refresher, T-Mobile agreed to sell Sprint’s prepaid brand Boost Mobile to Dish as a condition of the merger deal. The idea was to set Dish up to fill the void in the wireless market that Sprint would leave as the fourth national carrier. The newly acquired Boost customer base — many of who still rely on the older CDMA network — would help Dish get a running start as it built out its own wireless network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84Fpf0"&gt;That’s... &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587790/t-mobile-sprint-acquisition-dish-promises"&gt;not really working out how regulators envisioned&lt;/a&gt;, to the surprise of nobody who was paying attention at the time. But while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618472/doj-letter-dish-t-mobile-3g-cdma-network-shutdown"&gt;a recent letter from the Department of Justice to T-Mobile and Dish&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged “grave concerns” regarding the CDMA shutdown, this ruling from CPUC goes a step further to potentially impose sanctions on T-Mobile. If the company can’t provide an adequate reason for violating the Commission’s rules, it may be ordered to pay up to $100,000 in fines for each of its offenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UchDu5"&gt;That, unfortunately, doesn’t sound like a whole lot of money, especially considering what T-Mobile stands to earn from Boost customers as it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598163/t-mobile-metro-5g-prepaid-boost-cricket-switch-promotion"&gt;attempts to convert them with waived fees and discounted plans&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, T-Mobile will have the chance to defend itself at its virtual hearing scheduled for September 20th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Drought-choked Colorado River faces an unprecedented water shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-ENVIRONMENT-DROUGHT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BYmAJ-PHjIVs9RCuMfFIhkFKyF4=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733865/1234075312.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="byaCmP"&gt;For the first time ever, there’s an official water shortage at the largest water reservoir in the US. Today, the US Bureau of Reclamation &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/newsroom/#/news-release/3950"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; a water shortage at Hoover Dam’s Lake Mead, which 25 million people across the Western US and Mexico rely on for water. It’s the first time this kind of declaration had been made&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;on the Colorado River, the main source of water for Lake Mead, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/16/us/lake-mead-colorado-river-water-shortage/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/megadrought-spurs-first-ever-federal-colorado-river-cutbacks/"&gt;E&amp;amp;E News&lt;/a&gt; report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zD6ls"&gt;The declaration will trigger mandatory cuts to water use starting January 1, 2023. California, Arizona, and Nevada all tap water from Lake Mead. Based on federal guidelines for shortages brokered in 2019, Arizona will lose 18 percent of its annual apportionment of water from Lake Mead, and Nevada will lose seven percent of their annual allotment. Mexico, which also gets water from the watershed, will lose five percent of its share. California won’t face cuts just yet, because it has stronger water rights under complex water sharing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tKNqb7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One of the worst droughts in decades continues to plague the Western US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7vL8E2"&gt;The water level at Lake Mead reached a historic low in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527600/hoover-dam-reservoir-lake-mead-record-low-drought"&gt;June&lt;/a&gt;, dropping to &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/hourly/levels.html"&gt;1,071.57&lt;/a&gt; feet above sea level. By January, when mandatory cuts come into effect, water in the reservoir is expected to reach just 1,065.85 feet above sea level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCZKG6"&gt;One of the worst droughts in decades continues to plague the Western US. Back in June, it was already “the most exceptional drought that we’ve ever shown on the map in the Western US,” according to Brian Fuchs, a climatologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who creates maps for the &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap.aspx"&gt;US Drought Monitor&lt;/a&gt;. The drought has grown worse since then, and now affects a whopping &lt;a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/512cef7647fe42698dc05dd4e75d4343/page/page_3/"&gt;95 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the West. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcyQEe"&gt;The news comes on the heels of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;major United Nations climate report&lt;/a&gt; that found that climate change is supercharging the water cycle, which is fueling more intense droughts and extreme weather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTlEno"&gt;“It’s not like drought is a new phenomenon. There are parts of the world that are dealing with these conditions every day of the year. What we’re seeing, however, is that the overall set of expected conditions is moving into uncharted territory,”  Alex Ruane, one of the authors of the new report and a research physical scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;
