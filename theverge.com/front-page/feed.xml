    <title>Instacart shoppers say their accounts were wrongly deactivated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2FgVPbtBg1L7Qd68RFzCHgkZhm0=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69213953/instacart_shopper_produce.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Instacart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YURJhx"&gt;Some Instacart shoppers claim that the company has wrongfully terminated their accounts in response to fraudulent activity, locking them out of future earnings until they get reactivated, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/30/tech/instacart-deactivations/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN Business&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xq8mB5"&gt;The shoppers &lt;em&gt;CNN Business&lt;/em&gt; spoke to were identified as having “linked accounts,” which, in Instacart’s terminology, means an account believed to have indicators of fraud, though not necessarily with compromised data connected to a shopper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z4Hh8v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The shoppers may be the victims of phishing scams&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N6dclF"&gt;The company offers a process for appealing deactivations, but at least one of the shoppers &lt;em&gt;CNN Business&lt;/em&gt; spoke to, Rachael Freedman, still hasn’t had her account reactivated because her appeal was denied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwtcL3"&gt;Instacart didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on Friday. The company did tell &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt; that “We take the safety and security of the Instacart platform very seriously,” but that “there has not been a breach or hack of the Instacart platform.” The company says it has measures in place for workers who’ve been the victim of a phishing scam to get back into their accounts “in a timely manner.” It’s not clear why that hasn’t applied to Freedman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4N3RE"&gt;The scam that Instacart workers described sounds similar to an issue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409937/scammers-hack-target-gig-workers-drain-bank-accounts"&gt;Target’s Shipt gig workers&lt;/a&gt; encountered. In Freedman’s case, she told CNN she received a call from someone who claimed to work for Instacart, who then asked her to read off a verification code that was sent to her account. Not long after she shared her information, she was locked out. It appears the scammer changed the password to her account — again, very similar to what Shipt shoppers described, except in her case, Instacart responded by deactivating Freedman’s account completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zuW3uv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The human cost of Instacart’s grocery delivery","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21267669/instacart-shoppers-sick-extended-pay-quarantine-leave-coronavirus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="qWraZO"&gt;Instacart cautions shoppers against sharing their information with anyone who identifies themselves as an Instacart employee outside of its official channels, like the app or its 24/7 shopper chat. The pandemic has made grocery delivery a crucial service, but the ease with which workers can have their income affected through no fault of their own illustrates how vulnerable gig workers like Instacart shoppers are. In addition to working on the front lines during a pandemic, last year, Instacart shoppers reportedly had to deal with some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216317/instacart-tip-baiting-grocery-employees-delivery-pandemic"&gt;customers baiting larger orders with even larger tips&lt;/a&gt;, only to have those tips shrink upon delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpFjwT"&gt;Gig workers like Instacart shoppers typically lack the job stability and workplace protections that full-time employees enjoy.  At least one Biden administration official has said it’s time to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/4/29/22409952/labor-secretary-gig-workers-uber-lyft-employees-contractors"&gt;reclassify gig workers as employees&lt;/a&gt;, which would alleviate some of the uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If your paycheck is missing, QuickBooks may be to blame</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="(Flickr) American money" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/in0aLzCo3GUo-oekdyrUkRJWom0=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69213746/4603130687_d0a0862bc4_b.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Flickr&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ckgTym"&gt;Due to an issue with QuickBooks processing direct deposits, some people had a very unpleasant morning, waking up to see either that their paycheck hadn’t arrived, or that they had a ton of employees asking why they hadn’t been paid. If you’re one of those people, it may not be time to panic just yet — &lt;a href="http://status.quickbooks.intuit.com/incidents/jnhwslhtskgd"&gt;QuickBooks says&lt;/a&gt; that the issue has been resolved and that the money &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/QuickBooks/status/1388174723079495685?s=20"&gt;should be arriving in accounts&lt;/a&gt; by the end of today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3h1TZ"&gt;QuickBooks claims the missed payments were caused by an issue with a third party. Some users, though, are upset with how Intuit, which owns QuickBooks, handled the situation, claiming that they couldn’t get a hold of the company on their phone or chat lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y4WL4T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;What the heck &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/QuickBooks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@QuickBooks&lt;/a&gt;. My employees need to get paid. Fix your stuff ASAP. Nobody is answering the phones or helping in the chat. Been on hold for 2 hours now.&lt;/p&gt;— Ashwin Chary (@CharyAshwin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CharyAshwin/status/1388135526155292677?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ikVt2T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/QuickBooks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@QuickBooks&lt;/a&gt; I almost got fired by my boss because he thinks I forgot to run payroll. Fun way to wake up. At least update your phone lines and websites to let us know it’s a known issue. I waited 30 minutes before I thought “let me see what’s trending on Twitter”.&lt;/p&gt;— Michael (@CardinalMike08) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CardinalMike08/status/1388129602917306368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="d6LBLS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/QuickBooks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@QuickBooks&lt;/a&gt; been on hold for almost three hours. My employees didn’t get their direct deposit. You can at least give your clients an update! &lt;a href="https://t.co/tVYvEYpahK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tVYvEYpahK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fabby Escamilla (@MrsJCEseo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MrsJCEseo/status/1388163523105132548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u2tODA"&gt;QuickBooks told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s working on communicating with “impacted customers,” but it’s definitely not the type of situation you want to deal with on a Friday morning, especially one on the 30th — if you’re an employee, you probably have a bunch of bills coming due, and if you’re an employer, you probably don’t want all your workers mad at you because of a computer glitch that’s not your fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlRqdj"&gt;If you’ve been impacted and still haven’t seen payment by the end of the day, you can let &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; know by emailing tips@theverge.com.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: iOS 14.5 features, Apple sales skyrocket, and podcasting </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/49IftTcv4YejD0OvTXvVkauQc2U=/0x0:1224x816/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69213471/fbpodcasts.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sFXTBx"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where host Nilay Patel discusses the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2IYZK"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, Nilay brings in &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; deputy editor Dan Seifert and news editor Chaim Gartenberg to discuss the features added in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;Apple’s iOS update to 14.5&lt;/a&gt;, Apple and other tech companies’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407894/apple-q2-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;skyrocketing&lt;/a&gt; earnings despite the ongoing pandemic, and how the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;global semiconductor shortage&lt;/a&gt; is affecting the tech industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UFFObc"&gt;Later in the show, senior reporter Ashley Carman runs through the recent developments in podcasting platforms. At an event last week, Apple announced a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;subscription feature within Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt; for creators to offer to their listeners. Ashley discusses the audio product developments announced this week from competitor companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404273/spotify-podcast-subscriptions-monetize-subscriber-shows"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403617/facebook-podcast-player-release-in-app-pages"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403852/siriusxm-roman-mars-99-percent-invisible-acquire-stitcher"&gt;SiriusXM&lt;/a&gt;, and what this may mean for podcast creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zmxql9"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP5942362223&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EbKZDJ"&gt;There’s a whole lot more in between all of that — like Samsung’s newly announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405540/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-features-price-photos-video-release-date"&gt;Galaxy Book Pros&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22405894/epic-apple-store-fortnite-trial-kickoff-witnesses-list"&gt;upcoming trial between Epic Games and Apple&lt;/a&gt; — so listen here or in your preferred podcast player to hear the full discussion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu’s live TV service is finally getting Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV, and other ViacomCBS channels today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jH6yVvT3vKKZ6-fN5I-J-W8ZWhU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69213191/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EUvGXu"&gt;Hulu’s live TV service is finally getting nine new ViacomCBS channels — Comedy Central, BET, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., VH1, CMT, MTV, TV Land, and Paramount Network — as part of its regular $64.99 per month cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPAMMd"&gt;If that sounds familiar, it’s because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212874/hulu-live-tv-channels-nickelodeon-mtv-bet-comedy-central-viacomcbs"&gt;Hulu first announced&lt;/a&gt; that these channels would be coming to its service on January 4th, almost four months ago. But despite the long gap, the new channels are finally debuting for subscribers today. Customers who pay for Hulu’s live TV service will also get on-demand access to additional ViacomCBS library titles, including  &lt;em&gt;Freaks and Geeks&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Moesha, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Sister, Sister&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ocAJnL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A long wait, but Hulu customers can finally watch MTV&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PykPym"&gt;Other ViacomCBS channels — BETher, MTV2, NickToons, TeenNick, and MTV Classic – will also be available for Hulu’s live TV customers starting today, but only through &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/entertainment-add-on?language=en_US&amp;amp;u1=VergeHulusLiveTVService043021"&gt;Hulu’s $7.99 per month Entertainment package&lt;/a&gt;, which also includes channels like CNBC World, the Cooking Channel, and Discovery Family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6G08g3"&gt;Hulu isn’t announcing any price hikes to go with the new channels at this time: the basic live TV service will still cost $64.99 per month (which the company has charged for the service since its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570259/hulu-live-tv-price-increase-cable-sports-news-virtual-bundle-disney"&gt;$10 price increase last November&lt;/a&gt;.) That price also puts Hulu’s live TV service at exactly the same starting point as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;Google’s YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7tazG"&gt;That said, there’s a strong possibility that Hulu could raise prices in the future to help cover the new ViacomCBS channels, similar to YouTube TV (which increased its price from $50 per month to $65 per month last summer after it added ViacomCBS’ lineup.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>English soccer teams have started a four-day social media boycott to protest online abuse</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="axFjtB"&gt;English soccer teams and organizations &lt;a href="https://www.thefa.com/news/2021/apr/24/english-football-social-media-boycott-20210424"&gt;are all shutting down their Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts&lt;/a&gt; for the weekend as part of a massive social media blackout to advocate for better policies regarding discrimination and abuse that players and members of clubs receive on those platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tdRnyf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;English football will unite for a social media boycott from 3pm on Friday 30 April to 11:59pm on Monday 3 May, in response to the ongoing and sustained discriminatory abuse received online by players and many others connected to the game.&lt;a href="https://t.co/GYTAuWAEgN"&gt;https://t.co/GYTAuWAEgN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/dNLuv62nw5"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dNLuv62nw5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FA Spokesperson (@FAspokesperson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FAspokesperson/status/1386062441654759424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FogyQu"&gt;Groups participating in the blackout include &lt;a href="https://www.premierleague.com/NoRoomForRacism"&gt;the Premier League&lt;/a&gt;, the English Football League, the Professional Footballers’ Association, the Football Association, the League Managers Association, the Football Supporters’ Association, and more. Clubs that are part of the Premier League, EFL, Barclays FA Women’s Super League, and Women’s Championship will all be shutting down their social channels over the weekend as part of the protest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbO81y"&gt;The blackout comes after the various English soccer organizations banded together in February to request changes from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey &lt;a href="https://www.thefa.com/news/2021/feb/11/letter-to-facebook-and-twitter-20210211"&gt;in an open letter&lt;/a&gt; requesting that the companies take stronger action against discriminatory and racist comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SLvVHG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are switching off our social media channels from 3pm on Friday 30 April, until 23:59pm on Monday 3 May, in response to sustained and ongoing online abuse.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Enough?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Enough&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StopOnlineAbuse?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StopOnlineAbuse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/toiIg3FfWW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/toiIg3FfWW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Raheem Sterling (@sterling7) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sterling7/status/1388131029718798338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IGObZp"&gt;Specifically, the soccer groups advocated for four improvements: that posts be blocked or filtered if they contain racist or discriminatory material; that abusive posts be removed through “robust, transparent, and swift measures”; the addition of improved verification processes to allow for law enforcement to identify users and to stop abusive posters from making new accounts; and that the platforms work closer with law enforcement groups to identify people posting discriminatory content in cases where it breaks the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrPR09"&gt;The leagues hope this weekend’s boycott will build on that movement, noting that while progress has been made, players, teams, and other members of the English football world still feel that there’s a lot more that Facebook and Twitter could do to help stop internet abuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNiPMp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the tall vampire lady gulp down a bucket of blood in this Resident Evil Village puppet show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yY7K_1Pw4ZtFUhNUuA-PLKyIDso=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69212861/Screen_Shot_2021_04_30_at_9.08.42_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Capcom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LdBIFK"&gt;We’re just a week out from the release of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;, and as part of the game’s promotional campaign, Capcom has uploaded an absolute treat to the YouTube channel for &lt;em&gt;Biohazard&lt;/em&gt; (which is the name of the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; series in Japan): &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/7-Bq9nV-uHg"&gt;an official puppet show starring characters from the game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Yes, everyone’s favorite tall vampire lady, Lady Dimitrescu, is one of the puppets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOhY13"&gt;The three-minute video is simultaneously adorable and terrifying. The show is entirely in Japanese, so I don’t have any idea what the actual story is — I think all of the puppets are meeting up to paint together, using blood as the ink? But it’s worth watching for some seriously silly puppet antics, like puppet-Lady Dimitrescu gleefully gulping down a bucket of blood. And the video’s title suggests this is just the first episode, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-makes-for-a-delightfully-demented-1846795680"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so it appears there’s more to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0C3xQZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; will launch on May 7th for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, PC, and Stadia. The game’s final demo will unlock in North America tomorrow, May 1st, at 8PM ET, and Capcom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404242/resident-evil-village-final-demo-week-vampire-werewolf"&gt;recently extended its availability&lt;/a&gt; so you can play it through May 9th at 8PM ET. Once you start the demo, though, you only have 60 minutes to play it.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>10 percent of you will be Goblinized today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shadowrun Trilogy" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sFdY6gUxXl3ALJa0IhES7AuvJ64=/1x0:928x618/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69212829/shadowrunork.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Harebrained Schemes&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CfTkeT"&gt;I woke up feeling a little strange this morning, but I didn’t think much of it. It’s just another day living in the pandemic. But after I got some strange looks at the cafe, I started to get a little worried. On my way home, I took a sip of my coffee and somehow pierced through the paper cup with bottom fangs that I didn’t have yesterday. I ran to the bathroom mirror when I got inside, only to discover that I’d turned into an ork. Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCgnNq"&gt;As decreed by the &lt;em&gt;Shadowrun &lt;/em&gt;lore (via Twitter user &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Gen_Ironicus/status/1388110456057999360"&gt;@Gen_Ironicus&lt;/a&gt;), April 30th, 2021 is the day of Goblinization. The &lt;a href="https://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/Goblinization"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadowrun &lt;/em&gt;wiki over at &lt;em&gt;Fandom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;says that, today, 10 percent of the world’s population will be transformed into orks and trolls for no apparent reason. Guess I just got lucky!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKvJpk"&gt;I thought maybe Goblinization would primarily target people who had played the &lt;em&gt;Shadowrun &lt;/em&gt;tabletop RPG or the video games. I’ve only played the first-person shooter released in 2007 for the PC and Xbox 360, so I’m not the world’s biggest fan. But now that I’m an ork, perhaps I’ll give &lt;em&gt;Shadowrun: Dragonfall&lt;/em&gt; a try now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFe316"&gt;If you aren’t currently feeling or noticing the transformation taking effect, don’t worry. It could happen later in the day. The lore says that most humans will change before “the very eyes of horrified spectators, causing much panic and alarm.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iH5iMr"&gt;And as if the COVID-19 pandemic weren’t enough, apparently Goblinization is the start of major strife between humans and the “&lt;a href="https://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/Metahumanity"&gt;metahumanity&lt;/a&gt;” created during today’s events. Perhaps worse, it’s said to eventually lead to the Coffee Famine of 2022. I don’t know if I’ll survive that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="liSdRE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telecom groups sue New York over low-income broadband law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TLuXQ8xj4fygvXeS0SyBMQTvaRY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69212795/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yCLjSM"&gt;Trade groups representing some of the largest telecom companies, including AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon, are suing New York over a new state law forcing them to provide cheaper broadband plans for low-income families in the state, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/att-verizon-new-york-broadband-law-41448df8-370c-403a-8826-60159daf1877.html"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELBJq4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388184/new-york-affordable-internet-cost-low-income-price-cap-bill"&gt;Earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill that would require internet service providers to offer a $15 a month broadband internet option for low-income consumers and families in the state. It’s one of the first laws in the country enforcing such a rule. But groups like USTelecom, CTIA, and the New York State Telecommunications Association argue that the state has no authority to set broadband prices and that the law could impair the companies’ abilities to upgrade their networks in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y4mRWD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“While well-intended, this bill is preempted by federal law”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NrsFPx"&gt;“While well-intended, this bill is preempted by federal law and ignores the $50 monthly broadband discount recently enacted by Congress, as well as the many unprecedented commitments, donations and accommodations that broadband providers have made for low-income consumers since the pandemic began,” the coalition said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acKujh"&gt;As of right now, some internet providers offer their own low-income options for consumers, but none of these programs are mandated by law. There are other subsidy programs like Lifeline offered by the Federal Communications Commission that help decrease the cost of connectivity for families. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTrkRJ"&gt;In December, Congress approved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22193133/us-coronavirus-covid-relief-stimulus-package-broadband-huawei-zte"&gt;over $3 billion&lt;/a&gt; to help consumers pay for internet service during the pandemic. The trade groups cite this law as a reason the New York broadband mandate goes too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgzCme"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njwnEb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Deepfake’ that supposedly fooled European politicians was just a look-alike, say pranksters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wOaodCoWr8kkdZSdKPnCEyhco94=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69212765/VRG_ILLO_2727_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deepfakes use AI techniques to generate or manipulate videos and pictures. &lt;/em&gt; | &lt;span data-author="-1"&gt;Artist: William Joel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="70SBoC"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/22/european-mps-targeted-by-deepfake-video-calls-imitating-russian-opposition"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2021/04/22/hello-this-is-leonid-volkov"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://nltimes.nl/2021/04/24/dutch-mps-video-conference-deep-fake-imitation-navalnys-chief-staff"&gt;outlets&lt;/a&gt; reported that a string of European politicians had been tricked by a sophisticated Russian plot. Parliamentarians from the UK, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia had all arranged video calls with a hoaxer claiming to be Leonid Volkov, chief of staff to imprisoned Russian anti-Putin politician Alexei Navalny. As the politicians tell it, they fell victim to a digital fake: a doppelgänger using “deepfake” technology created specially to trick them — the latest example of Russia’s misinformation campaigns in the West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uqtk2U"&gt;But the Russian men who orchestrated the calls say the “deepfake” claim is itself misinformation. Speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the hoaxers say their imitation Volkov was created using effects no more sophisticated than makeup and artfully obscure camera angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nOq39B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The case of the fake deepfake&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w4Ve9v"&gt;“Meet Leonid Volkov, Russian opposition leader,” says Vladimir Kuznetsov in a recent video call with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, introducing his colleague and partner-in-crime Alexei Stolyarov, a man who does indeed bear a passing resemblance to Leonid Volkov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9yO7p"&gt;The pair say they tricked their way into various meetings with European politicians and even a live interview on Latvian TV. They did so by cold-calling and emailing their targets from fake addresses, using a real picture of Volkov as their digital avatar. As proof, the pair shared some of this correspondence with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. They’ve also uploaded a meeting between “Volkov” and Ukrainian politicians to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/MykU8zozL7g"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and say more videos are coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0BynE"&gt;“I didn’t need to prepare much to look like the real Volkov,” says Stolyarov. “I just had some brushes and some colors and that was enough.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CMlrnv51IWHACfYiZ9OZ_oH5up8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22481245/lexus_volkov_fake.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image showing Alexei Stolyarov, aka Lexus, in costume as Russian opposition leader Leonid Volkov. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uQtBue"&gt;Kuznetsov and Stolyarov are better known as Vovan and Lexus: a pair of self-described “pranksters” who &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/13/kremlin-calling-russian-pranksters-elton-john-owes-us"&gt;have a history&lt;/a&gt; of fooling Western politicians and celebrities. Over the years, the pair have tricked their way into phone calls with the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/25/leave-nato-justin-trudeau-pranked-by-russian-duo-posing-as-greta-thunberg"&gt;Justin Trudeau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2015/sep/17/listen-to-hoax-elton-john-putin-call-by-pranksters-lexus-and-vovan-audio"&gt;Elton John&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://globalvoices.org/2020/02/16/russian-pranksters-target-bernie-sanders/"&gt;Bernie Sanders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/lindsey-graham-fooled-by-notorious-russian-pranksters"&gt;Lindsey Graham&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russia-hoax-boris-johnson-he-fell-right-into-our-trap-say-lexus-and-vovan-0s9hlqscp"&gt;Boris Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, each time aiming to catch these figures off-guard and tease potentially embarrassing statements out of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="BdtgvW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We wouldn’t prank Putin. We don’t want to harm our country”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YSf4sT"&gt;Although the pair have &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/lindsey-graham-fooled-by-notorious-russian-pranksters"&gt;denied&lt;/a&gt; any official connections to the Kremlin, there’s no doubt their work is &lt;a href="https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/product/c1dofhaw"&gt;useful to and supported by&lt;/a&gt; the Russian government. In the past, they’ve had their own show on Russian state TV and their antics approvingly covered by state news. They plainly know which side their bread is buttered. As &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/13/kremlin-calling-russian-pranksters-elton-john-owes-us"&gt;Stolyarov told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a few years back: “We wouldn’t prank Putin. We don’t want to harm our country. We don’t want unrest here; we don’t want to do anything that would help the enemies of Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3YubOB"&gt;Creating unrest elsewhere, though, is par for the course. “Our work is to prank high officials and celebrities and to make a lot of fun and publish it to social media,” says Stolyarov. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UlnqyK6u2e2YLB-ygj0IJ-Nqdek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22481256/Screen_Shot_2021_04_30_at_4.04.35_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A screenshot showing Stolyarov posing as Volkov (top left), speaking with Ukrainian officials, including the country’s youngest MP, Sviatoslav Yurash (top right)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="csqOVU"&gt;The pair say they chose to impersonate Volkov for a number of reasons. Firstly, because of the newsworthiness of Navalny. After leading the most substantial opposition to Russian president Vladimir Putin in years, Navalny has been &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56919934"&gt;imprisoned&lt;/a&gt;. He recently ended a 24-day hunger strike and continues to criticize the Russian government despite the expectation that his nationwide political movement will be &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/30/russian-state-watchdog-adds-navalny-network-to-terrorism-database"&gt;outlawed soon&lt;/a&gt;. Secondly, because of Stolyarov’s resemblance. And thirdly, because the real Volkov hasn’t sought many meetings with Western politicians, meaning few had any familiarity with how he looks and sounds. An unspoken fourth motivation is to ridicule anti-Putin forces, in line with the duo’s politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeTxyB"&gt;Kuznetsov and Stolyarov have carried out numerous pranks over the years (you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Vovan222prank/videos"&gt;browse their YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; for a selection) though not all have gained media attention. What made this particular campaign stand out is its connection with deepfakes — AI-generated or manipulated media that many fear will be used as a tool of political misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="m7b6PL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Despite fears, deepfakes have yet to make a major political impact&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CjYj8l"&gt;Over the years, experts have warned about a so-called “infopocalypse,” where the quality and availability of deepfakes make it impossible for the public to distinguish truth and fiction. So far, this dire prediction &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251736/deepfake-propaganda-misinformation-troll-video-hoax"&gt;has not come to pass&lt;/a&gt;. The most damaging effects of deepfakes have been in the generation of nonconsensual pornography. And although politics has, indeed, been dogged in recent years by hoaxes and misinformation, such incidents almost always revolve around video and images &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/24/18637771/nancy-pelosi-congress-deepfake-video-facebook-twitter-youtube"&gt;edited the old-fashioned way&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, the specter of deepfakes still haunts politics — as this recent incident shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdT3AR"&gt;It’s not clear when the fake Volkov calls were first blamed on AI technology, but it seems Volkov himself might be the source. Latvian politician Rihards Kols &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/KolsRihards/photos/a.1376884405665151/4129529840400580/?type=3"&gt;posted on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; on April 22nd that he had been tricked into taking a call in March with an unknown prankster, and shared two pictures supposedly showing the real and fake Volkovs. Volkov then &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/leonid.m.volkov/posts/4004434886245781"&gt;reposted the images&lt;/a&gt; that same day, ascribing the prank to Vovan and Lexus, but also suggesting that AI was used. “Looks like my real face — but how did they manage to put it on the Zoom call?” he wrote, according to a Facebook translation. “Welcome to the deep-fake era.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZBAP_jhgQuymA-uAafLnD6BP2vs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22481264/Screen_Shot_2021_04_30_at_4.07.10_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/leonid.m.volkov/posts/4004434886245781" target="_blank"&gt;Leonid Volkov via Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot showing a Facebook post from Leonid Volkov, shared on April 22nd, in which he suggests a real picture of himself is a deepfake.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I9YG58"&gt;From here it seems the line spread. The next day, Kols, who is chair of Latvia’s Foreign Affairs Committee, posted a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RihardsKols/status/1385576305056534533/photo/1"&gt;statement on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; co-signed by his counterparts from Lithuania and Estonia. The trio warned about the threat posed by “deepfake technologies,” and say the pranks were “targeted attacks on the Kremlin’s critics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="NdO4zI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We encourage all to remain vigilant yet open”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SrNhV6"&gt;“During the past few months, disinformation operations with the use of manipulated and artificial intelligence (AI) generated media were carried out against Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian and the United Kingdom’s politicians, non-governmental organisations, and media representatives,” says the statement. “We encourage all to remain vigilant yet open to communication, as representatives of true democracies always should be!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTq845"&gt;Kuznetsov and Stolyarov say that they’re surprised the prank was described as a deepfake, not least because the image they used in their accounts, and that was identified by Volkov himself as fake, is &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Bp4_yz741kc"&gt;taken from a real video&lt;/a&gt;. “It was his real picture but he denied it was him,” says Stolyarov, before Kuznetsov adds that perhaps Volkov didn’t like the picture because he looked “too fat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4heOK8"&gt;Whether politicians blamed the trick on deepfakes out of genuine confusion or more self-serving reasons isn’t clear. Certainly it’s less embarrassing to be fooled by a sophisticated AI fake than a couple of pranksters with a convincing email manner. But the incident does illustrate that the fear of deepfakes is having as much an effect on misinformation as the technology itself. For those tricked by Kuznetsov and Stolyarov — aka Vovan and Lexus — blaming new technology may simply have been a matter of saving face.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How a university got itself banned from the Linux kernel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZeCW2I447Omi8F36hkCWQ4ws-sA=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69212102/VRG_ILLO_4566_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The University of Minnesota’s path to banishment was long, turbulent, and full of emotion&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XULSBW"&gt;On the evening of April 6th, a student &lt;a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/20210407001658.2208535-1-pakki001@umn.edu/"&gt;emailed&lt;/a&gt; a patch to a list of developers. Fifteen days later, the University of Minnesota was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22398156/university-minnesota-linux-kernal-ban-research"&gt;banned&lt;/a&gt; from contributing to the Linux kernel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdTpZS"&gt;“I suggest you find a different community to do experiments on,” wrote Linux Foundation fellow Greg Kroah-Hartman in a livid email. “You are not welcome here.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPhubA"&gt;How did one email lead to a university-wide ban? I’ve spent the past week digging into this world — the players, the jargon, the university’s turbulent history with open-source software, the devoted and principled Linux kernel community. None of the University of Minnesota researchers would talk to me for this story. But among the other major characters — the Linux developers — there was no such hesitancy. This was a community eager to speak; it was a community betrayed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="NjM21b"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="pqo6z9"&gt;The story begins in 2017, when a systems-security researcher named Kangjie Lu became an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZwEna"&gt;Lu’s research, per his &lt;a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, concerns “the intersection of security, operating systems, program analysis, and compilers.” But Lu had his eye on Linux — most of his papers involve the Linux kernel in some way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42jzGk"&gt;The Linux kernel is, at a basic level, the core of any Linux operating system. It’s the liaison between the OS and the device on which it’s running. A Linux user doesn’t interact with the kernel, but it’s essential to getting things done — it manages memory usage, writes things to the hard drive, and decides what tasks can use the CPU when. The kernel is open-source, meaning its millions of lines of code are publicly available for anyone to view and contribute to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="A8yiDu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Getting a patch on people’s computers is no easy task&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="edPPVd"&gt;Well, “anyone.” Getting a patch onto people’s computers is no easy task. A submission needs to pass through a large web of developers and “maintainers” (&lt;a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/maintainers.html"&gt;thousands&lt;/a&gt; of volunteers, who are each responsible for the upkeep of different parts of the kernel) before it ultimately ends up in the mainline repository. Once there, it goes through a long testing period before eventually being incorporated into the “stable release,” which will go out to mainstream operating systems. It’s a rigorous system designed to weed out both malicious and incompetent actors. But — &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-teen-threw-scots-wiki-into-chaos-and-it-highlights-a-1844851959"&gt;as is always the case with crowdsourced operations&lt;/a&gt; — there’s room for human error. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FH2Yi5"&gt;Some of Lu’s recent work has revolved around studying that potential for human error and reducing its influence. He’s &lt;a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/papers/lrsan.pdf"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/papers/deadline.pdf"&gt;systems&lt;/a&gt; to automatically detect various types of bugs in open source, using the Linux kernel as a test case. These experiments tend to involve reporting bugs, submitting patches to Linux kernel maintainers, and reporting their acceptance rates. In &lt;a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/papers/crix.pdf"&gt;a 2019 paper&lt;/a&gt;, for example, Lu and two of his PhD students, Aditya Pakki and Qiushi Wu, presented a system (“Crix”) for detecting a certain class of bugs in OS kernels. The trio found 278 of these bugs with Crix and submitted patches for all of them — the fact that maintainers accepted 151 meant the tool was promising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgdJH0"&gt;On the whole, it was a useful body of work. Then, late last year, Lu took aim not at the kernel itself, but at its community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CnYKoW"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="hnIyA7"&gt;In “On the Feasibility of Stealthily Introducing Vulnerabilities in Open-Source Software via Hypocrite Commits,” Lu and Wu &lt;a href="https://linuxreviews.org/images/d/d9/OpenSourceInsecurity.pdf"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; that they’d been able to introduce vulnerabilities into the Linux kernel by submitting patches that appeared to fix real bugs but also introduced serious problems. The group called these submissions “hypocrite commits.” (Wu didn’t respond to a request for comment for this story; Lu referred me to Mats Heimdahl, the head of the university’s department of computer science and engineering, who referred me to the &lt;a href="https://cse.umn.edu/cs/linux-incident"&gt;department’s website&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAfw07"&gt;The explicit goal of this experiment, as the researchers have since emphasized, was to improve the security of the Linux kernel by demonstrating to developers how a malicious actor might slip through their net. One could argue that their process was similar, in principle, to that of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382243/counter-strike-global-offensive-game-engine-bug-take-over-pc"&gt;white-hat hacking&lt;/a&gt;: play around with software, find bugs, let the developers know.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddsgcu"&gt;But the loudest reaction the paper received, on Twitter and across the Linux community, wasn’t gratitude — it was outcry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Jnht7"&gt;“That paper, it’s just a lot of crap,” says &lt;a href="https://www.dgregscott.com/"&gt;Greg Scott&lt;/a&gt;, an IT professional who has worked with open-source software for over 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0uipp"&gt;“In my personal view, it was completely unethical,” says security researcher Kenneth White, who is co-director of the Open Crypto Audit Project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9I0YgA"&gt;The frustration had little to do with the hypocrite commits themselves. In their paper, Lu and Wu claimed that none of their bugs had actually made it to the Linux kernel — in all of their test cases, they’d eventually pulled their bad patches and provided real ones. Kroah-Hartman, of the Linux Foundation, contests this — he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that one patch from the study did make it into repositories, though he notes it didn’t end up causing any harm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nFkMS3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In my personal view, it was completely unethical.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n9pQxJ"&gt;Still, the paper hit a number of nerves among a very passionate (and very online) community when Lu first shared its abstract on Twitter. Some developers were angry that the university had intentionally wasted the maintainers’ time — which is a key difference between Minnesota’s work and a white-hat hacker poking around the Starbucks app for a bug bounty. “The researchers crossed a line they shouldn’t have crossed,” Scott says. “Nobody hired this group. They just chose to do it. And a whole lot of people spent a whole lot of time evaluating their patches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4Phq6"&gt;“If I were a volunteer putting my personal time into commits and testing, and then I found out someone’s experimenting, I would be unhappy,” Scott adds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfFr6T"&gt;Then, there’s the dicier issue of whether an experiment like this amounts to human experimentation. It doesn’t, according to the University of Minnesota’s Institutional Review Board. Lu and Wu applied for approval in response to the outcry, and they were granted a formal letter of exemption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lx7v1K"&gt;The community members I spoke to didn’t buy it. “The researchers attempted to get retroactive Institutional Review Board approval on their actions that were, at best, wildly ignorant of the tenants of basic human subjects’ protections, which are typically taught by senior year of undergraduate institutions,” says White. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iI6jly"&gt;“It is generally not considered a nice thing to try to do ‘research’ on people who do not know you are doing research,” says Kroah-Hartman. “No one asked us if it was acceptable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="zcqpgh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That paper, it’s just a lot of crap.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oy5r3K"&gt;That thread ran through many of the responses I got from developers — that regardless of the harms or benefits that resulted from its research, the university was messing around not just with community members but with the community’s underlying philosophy. Anyone who uses an operating system places some degree of trust in the people who contribute to and maintain that system. That’s especially true for people who use open-source software, and it’s a principle that some Linux users take very seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CmaAX"&gt;“By definition, open source depends on a lively community,” Scott says. “There have to be people in that community to submit stuff, people in the community to document stuff, and people to use it and to set up this whole feedback loop to constantly make it stronger. That loop depends on lots of people, and you have to have a level of trust in that system ... If somebody violates that trust, that messes things up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2aWfe"&gt;After the paper’s release, it was clear to many Linux kernel developers that something needed to be done about the University of Minnesota — previous submissions from the university needed to be reviewed. “Many of us put an item on our to-do list that said, ‘Go and audit all umn.edu submissions,’” said Kroah-Hartman, who was, above all else, annoyed that the experiment had put another task on his plate. But many kernel maintainers are volunteers with day jobs, and a large-scale review process didn’t materialize. At least, not in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oA0qq4"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="FLKEe2"&gt;On April 6th, 2021, Aditya Pakki, using his own email address, submitted a patch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i4Casu"&gt;There was some brief discussion from other developers on the email chain, which fizzled out within a few days. Then Kroah-Hartman took a look. He was already on high alert for bad code from the University of Minnesota, and Pakki’s email address set off alarm bells. What’s more, the patch Pakki submitted didn’t appear helpful. “It takes a lot of effort to create a change that looks correct, yet does something wrong,” Kroah-Hartman told me. “These submissions all fit that pattern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pAAw9"&gt;So on April 20th, Kroah-Hartman put his foot down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcinS0"&gt;“Please stop submitting known-invalid patches,” he wrote to Pakki. “Your professor is playing around with the review process in order to achieve a paper in some strange and bizarre way.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHXBg3"&gt;Maintainer Leon Romanovsky then chimed in: he’d taken a look at four previously accepted patches from Pakki and found that three of them added “various severity” security vulnerabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="a8qlGl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s the dicier issue of whether an experiment like this amounts to human experimentation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GI1dpe"&gt;Kroah-Hartman hoped that his request would be the end of the affair. But then Pakki lashed back. “I respectfully ask you to cease and desist from making wild accusations that are bordering on slander,” he wrote to Kroah-Hartman in what appears to be a private message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhdhKS"&gt;Kroah-Hartman responded. “You and your group have publicly admitted to sending known-buggy patches to see how the kernel community would react to them, and published a paper based on that work. Now you submit a series of obviously-incorrect patches again, so what am I supposed to think of such a thing?” he wrote back on the morning of April 21st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCJc02"&gt;Later that day, Kroah-Hartman made it official. “Future submissions from anyone with a umn.edu address should be default-rejected unless otherwise determined to actually be a valid fix,” he wrote in an &lt;a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210421130105.1226686-1-gregkh@linuxfoundation.org/"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; to a number of maintainers, as well as Lu, Pakki, and Wu. Kroah-Hartman reverted 190 submissions from Minnesota affiliates — 68 couldn’t be reverted but still needed manual review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cq6KHD"&gt;It’s not clear what experiment the new patch was part of, and Pakki declined to comment for this story. &lt;a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/"&gt;Lu’s website&lt;/a&gt; includes a brief reference to “superfluous patches from Aditya Pakki for a new bug-finding project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5djNb"&gt;What is clear is that Pakki’s antics have finally set the delayed review process in motion; Linux developers began digging through all patches that university affiliates had submitted in the past. Jonathan Corbet, the founder and editor in chief of &lt;a href="http://LWN.net"&gt;&lt;em&gt;LWN.net&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;recently provided an update on that review process. Per his assessment, “Most of the suspect patches have turned out to be acceptable, if not great.” Of over 200 patches that were flagged, 42 are still set to be removed from the kernel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Oc8Kad"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="auc05d"&gt;Regardless of whether their reaction was justified, the Linux community gets to decide if the University of Minnesota affiliates can contribute to the kernel again. And that community has made its demands clear: the school needs to convince them its future patches won’t be a waste of anyone’s time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMmDNL"&gt;What will it take to do that? In a statement released the same day as the ban, the university’s computer science department suspended its research into Linux-kernel security and &lt;a href="https://cse.umn.edu/cs/statement-cse-linux-kernel-research-april-21-2021"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would investigate Lu’s and Wu’s research method. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmnl4i"&gt;But that wasn’t enough for the Linux Foundation. Mike Dolan, Linux Foundation SVP and GM of projects, wrote a letter to the university on April 23rd, which &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has viewed. Dolan made four demands. He asked that the school release “all information necessary to identify all proposals of known-vulnerable code from any U of MN experiment” to help with the audit process. He asked that the paper on hypocrite commits be withdrawn from publication. He asked that the school ensure future experiments undergo IRB review before they begin, and that future IRB reviews ensure the subjects of experiments provide consent, “per usual research norms and laws.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="AMJbpW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The school needs to convince them its future patches won’t be a waste of anyone’s time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ELMevG"&gt;Two of those demands have since been met. Wu and Lu have &lt;a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/papers/withdrawal-letter.pdf"&gt;retracted&lt;/a&gt; the paper and have &lt;a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/papers/full-disclosure.pdf"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; all the details of their study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9h2N7"&gt;The university’s status on the third and fourth counts is unclear. In a &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z3Nm2bfR4tH1nOGBpuOmLyoJVEiO9cUq/view"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; sent to the Linux Foundation on April 27th, Heimdahl and Loren Terveen (the computer science and engineering department's associate department head) maintain that the university’s IRB “acted properly,” and argues that human-subjects research “has a precise technical definition according to US federal regulations ... and this technical definition may not accord with intuitive understanding of concepts like ‘experiments’ or even ‘experiments on people.’” They do, however, commit to providing more ethics training for department faculty. Reached for comment, university spokesperson Dan Gilchrist referred me to the computer science and engineering department’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lku4VP"&gt;Meanwhile, Lu, Wu, and Pakki apologized to the Linux community this past Saturday in an &lt;a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAK8KejpUVLxmqp026JY7x5GzHU2YJLPU8SzTZUNXU2OXC70ZQQ@mail.gmail.com/"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to the kernel mailing list, which contained some apology and some defense. “We made a mistake by not finding a way to consult with the community and obtain permission before running this study; we did that because we knew we could not ask the maintainers of Linux for permission, or they would be on the lookout for hypocrite patches,” the researchers wrote, before going on to reiterate that they hadn’t put any vulnerabilities into the Linux kernel, and that their other patches weren’t related to the hypocrite commits research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HqHUW"&gt;Kroah-Hartman wasn’t having it. “The Linux Foundation and the Linux Foundation’s Technical Advisory Board submitted a letter on Friday to your university,” he responded. “Until those actions are taken, we do not have anything further to discuss.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Gkbvgw"&gt;From the University of Minnesota researchers’ perspective, they didn’t set out to troll anyone — they were trying to point out a problem with the kernel maintainers’ review process. Now the Linux community has to reckon with the fallout of their experiment and what it means about the security of open-source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzmFWO"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1385075395884556293?s=20"&gt;developers&lt;/a&gt; rejected University of Minnesota researchers’ perspective outright, claiming the fact that it’s possible to fool maintainers should be obvious to anyone familiar with open-source software. “If a sufficiently motivated, unscrupulous person can put themselves into a trusted position of updating critical software, there’s honestly little that can be done to stop them,” says White, the security researcher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Th1dgm"&gt;On the other hand, it’s clearly important to be vigilant about potential vulnerabilities in any operating system. And for others in the Linux community, as much ire as the experiment drew, its point about hypocrite commits appears to have been somewhat well taken. The incident has ignited conversations about patch-acceptance policies and how maintainers should handle submissions from new contributors, across Twitter, &lt;a href="https://lore.kernel.org/ksummit/a72a13e56ee5f19b0dee9ae8c1928b020e8809c2.camel@HansenPartnership.com/"&gt;email lists&lt;/a&gt;, and forums. “Demonstrating this kind of ‘attack’ has been long overdue, and kicked off a very important discussion,” wrote maintainer Christoph Hellwig in an email thread with other maintainers. “I think they deserve a medal of honor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vk2OZA"&gt;“This research was clearly unethical, but it did make it plain that the OSS development model is vulnerable to bad-faith commits,” one user wrote in a &lt;a href="https://lobste.rs/s/9miojb/hypocrite_commits_apology_letter"&gt;discussion post&lt;/a&gt;. “It now seems likely that Linux has some devastating back doors.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UowDM6"&gt;Corbet also called for more scrutiny around new changes in his &lt;a href="https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/854645/e7eff3462424263e/"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about the incident. “If we cannot institutionalize a more careful process, we will continue to see a lot of bugs, and it will not really matter whether they were inserted intentionally or not,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="0dl7V7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This method works.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i3gudX"&gt;And even for some of the paper’s most ardent critics, the process did prove a point — albeit, perhaps, the opposite of the one Wu, Lu, and Pakki were trying to make. It demonstrated that the system worked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VN6gnK"&gt;Eric Mintz, who manages 25 Linux servers, says this ban has made him much more confident in the operating system’s security. “I have more trust in the process because this was caught,” he says. “There may be compromises we don’t know about. But because we caught this one, it’s less likely we don’t know about the other ones. Because we have something in place to catch it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2M3ud"&gt;To Scott, the fact that the researchers were caught and banned is an example of Linux’s system functioning exactly the way it’s supposed to. “This method worked,” he insists. “The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22248631/solarwinds-hack-cybersecurity-us-menn-decoder-podcast"&gt;SolarWinds&lt;/a&gt; method, where there’s a big corporation behind it, that system didn’t work. This system did work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5FrnAf"&gt;“Kernel developers are happy to see new tools created and — if the tools give good results — use them. They will also help with the testing of these tools, but they are less pleased to be recipients of tool-inspired patches that lack proper review,” Corbet writes. The community seems to be open to the University of Minnesota’s feedback — but as the Foundation has made clear, it’s on the school to make amends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="0dvAPo"&gt;“The university could repair that trust by sincerely apologizing, and not fake apologizing, and by maybe sending a lot of beer to the right people,” Scott says. “It’s gonna take some work to restore their trust. So hopefully they’re up to it.” &lt;/p&gt;
