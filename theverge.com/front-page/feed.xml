    <title>Almost a fifth of Facebook employees are now working on VR and AR: report</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0HJRLR"&gt;Facebook has nearly 10,000 employees in its division working on augmented reality and virtual reality devices, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-people-with-power-at-facebook-as-its-hardware-commerce-ambitions-expand"&gt;report in &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; based on internal organizational data. The number means the Reality Labs division accounts for almost a fifth of the people working at Facebook worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7oIaw"&gt;This suggests that Facebook has been significantly accelerating its VR and AR efforts. As &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/5-percent-facebooks-employees-working-vrar/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; noted in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, the Oculus VR division accounted for over a thousand employees at a time when Facebook’s headcount was 18,770 overall, indicating a percentage somewhere north of five percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AQgLFX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 12 best new and updated games for the Oculus Quest 2","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21535909/oculus-quest-2-best-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QXXlRR"&gt;Since then, Facebook has shifted its VR focus away from Oculus Rift-style tethered headsets by releasing the Oculus Quest and Quest 2, which are standalone wireless devices that don’t require a PC. The $299 Quest 2 was preordered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541535/oculus-quest-2-preorders-sales-developers-zuckerberg"&gt;five times as much as its predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, with developers seeing a boost in sales of their existing titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04wIzA"&gt;“Today, most of what Facebook does is…we’re building on top of other people’s platforms,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; in an &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mark-zuckerberg-on-mind-reading-apple-and-the-race-to-mainstream-vr"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; this week on Facebook’s VR and AR ambitions. “I think it really makes sense for us to invest deeply to help shape what I think is going to be the next major computing platform, this combination of augmented and virtual reality, to make sure that it develops in this way that is fundamentally about people being present with each other and coming together.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Los Angeles movie-goers will soon be able to visit a theater for the first time in a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="AMC movie theater logo (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pnTzIzt6s_l3rW0m-52bhwY0pJ0=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68952793/amc-movie-theater-logo_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m7ej3k"&gt;Los Angeles theaters will be &lt;a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=3014"&gt;allowed to reopen at 25 percent capacity&lt;/a&gt; next week, according to the LA Department of Public Health (&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/la-movie-theaters-reopening-25-percent-capacity-1234928619/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The restrictions are being lifted, almost &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/coronavirus-movie-theaters-new-york-close-1203532292/"&gt;exactly a year after&lt;/a&gt; they were put in place, because Los Angeles County believes it will reach the number of vaccinations required by California to move into the next phase of reopening. The movie capitol’s theater re-opening comes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295880/new-york-city-movie-theaters-open-cuomo"&gt;a few weeks after New York’s&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that two of the biggest movie markets will once again be uncapping their projectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4UaPK2"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;notes, this doesn’t mean that the theaters will be able to open as soon as the ban lifts — they’ve been closed for so long that they’ll have to re-hire and train staff, which could take a week or two. The theaters will also have to ensure that they can meet the safety and cleaning requirements required by California, and will have to set up a reservation system if they don’t already have one — any theater reopening will be required to have moviegoers book their seats in advance. Attendees will also be required to wear masks, and groups will have to be at least six feet apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tila7y"&gt;Theaters will also have to figure out which movies to show (a somewhat important part of the moviegoing experience), as most major releases &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243496/bond-uncharted-ghostbusters-movie-delays"&gt;have been pushed back to the second half of the year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmFbaN"&gt;The future was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504536/movie-theaters-close-regal-cineworld-amc-cinemark"&gt;looking grim for movie theaters back in October&lt;/a&gt;, with many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/3/21500538/regal-cineworld-theaters-shut-down-james-bond-us-uk"&gt;theater chains shutting down all their locations&lt;/a&gt; in the US and UK, some permanently. The picture has been looking brighter since then, with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22279023/covid-19-vaccine-appointment-how-to"&gt;arrival of the vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324053/amc-theaters-earnings-fourth-quarter-stock-movies-vaccine-streaming"&gt;AMC said yesterday that it believes it’ll be able to weather the storm&lt;/a&gt; until most Americans are able to see movies again. Whether the public will rush back to movie theaters remains to be seen, as some of the year’s most anticipated films &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;will be released side-by-side on streaming&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden: ‘all American adults will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1st’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Address To Nation On Covid-19 Pandemic" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aqhh3o_h12KCo8lv8vfpuWEqzSg=/0x0:3936x2624/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68952717/1231655585.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yXHuzy"&gt;President Joe Biden just announced that he will direct states to make all adults eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations by May 1st. He also said that the federal government will launch a website on May 1st that will let people check where they can get a vaccine near them. He made both announcements during his first prime-time televised address as President on Thursday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxvMFb"&gt;“All American adults will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1st,” says Biden. “That doesn’t mean everyone’s going to have that shot immediately. But it means you’ll be able to get in line beginning on May 1.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="6asIdq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jM5Q0n"&gt;The administration also plans to increase the number of places administering vaccinations and expand the group of medical professionals who can give the shots. All these steps should help states get shots in arms, increasing the likelihood that the country will hit its vaccination targets, and return to something resembling normalcy. The US will have enough doses available to vaccinate every adult in the country &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22316094/covid-19-vaccine-supplies-us-antivirus-newsletter"&gt;by the end of May.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxpThf"&gt;Biden says the goal is for families to be able to celebrate together again by the Fourth of July, but made no promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IUgN3Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“you’ll be able to get in line beginning on May 1.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="picIxx"&gt;This isn’t the first time a US president has promised a large-scale website as part of its efforts to fight COVID-19. In March 2020, as the nation was coming to terms with the fast-spreading virus, former president Donald Trump announced that Google had 1,700 engineers working on a nationwide website that people could use to determine if they should get tested and where they could do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ifUO0"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197026/trump-coronavirus-testing-website-plan-google-covid-19"&gt;wasn’t true&lt;/a&gt;, however — Verily, another company owned by Google parent Alphabet, was in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179118/google-coronavirus-testing-screening-website-drive-thru-covid-19"&gt;the early stages&lt;/a&gt; on a testing website that was intended to serve parts of California. And that 1,700 number reportedly came from a list of Google employees &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/politics/trump-google-coronavirus.html"&gt;who said they would volunteer&lt;/a&gt; for the project. Trump’s promised website never launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FzzQs1"&gt;Biden also said that his administration will deploy teams to help states in need of support for their own vaccine-scheduling websites. The government will also establish a call center to help &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/11/us/joe-biden-news#in-his-prime-time-speech-biden-will-direct-states-to-make-all-adult-americans-eligible-for-vaccine-by-may-1"&gt;people without internet access&lt;/a&gt; make a vaccine appointment. The announcements follow Biden’s signing of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/10/22320350/stimulus-bill-covid-19-passes-house"&gt;earlier on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, which includes $1,400 stimulus checks for many Americans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7AIOU"&gt;Vaccines are slowly becoming more available in the US, but it is still a challenge for many to get them or even book an appointment. That has led to the homegrown development of services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320344/dr-b-covid-vaccine-standby-list-coronavirus-immunization-overflow"&gt;Dr. B&lt;/a&gt;, which notifies people about thawed vaccines that would otherwise go to waste, and &lt;a href="https://nycvaccinelist.com/"&gt;NYC Vaccine List&lt;/a&gt;, which can help people book vaccine appointments in the NYC area. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also offers a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/reporting/vaccinefinder/about.html"&gt;vaccine finder website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neaCKi"&gt;If you’re looking to score a vaccine appointment ahead of May 1st, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22279023/covid-19-vaccine-appointment-how-to"&gt;check out our guide&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s ‘culture fit’ is the focus of a discrimination complaint, report says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZO9S4xs2UARQy9XgLuVb-1ibRyw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68952281/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X5Kywb"&gt;A Black woman who interviewed at Facebook last year says she was told the company was “looking for a culture fit” before being rejected, &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/11/facebook-hiring-racism-eeoc/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; She’s now one of four people who’ve recently complained to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) about allegedly racist hiring and promotion practices at the tech giant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="002qf0"&gt;The woman says she was well-suited to the managerial position on Facebook’s Global Impact Partnerships team due to her work experience and relevant doctoral degree, &lt;em&gt;The Intercept &lt;/em&gt;reports. Yet she alleged that during in-person meetings, she “sensed that the interviewers were not prioritizing her interviews because all of the interviews seemed rushed after making her wait for several hours.” &lt;em&gt;The Intercept &lt;/em&gt;agreed not to use the woman’s real name as a condition of receiving the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWIcI7"&gt;All the interviewers were white,&lt;em&gt; The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; reports. Only 3.9 percent of Facebook’s US workforce is Black, &lt;a href="https://diversity.fb.com/read-report/"&gt;according to a recent diversity report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzlsJy"&gt;The news comes on the heels of an EEOC investigation into allegations of racial bias in Facebook’s hiring and promotion processes. The probe has been categorized as “systemic,” meaning the agency “suspects” these policies “may be contributing to widespread discrimination,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-workers-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-agency-probes-facebook-for-systemic-racial-bias-in-hiring-promotions-idUSKBN2AY006"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNzk6d"&gt;The woman also alleged that one Facebook staffer told her “There’s no doubt you can do the job, but we’re really looking for a culture fit.” The term is widely used in the tech industry to refer to job applicants who staffers would want to have a beer with. But experts say it’s a “misguided hiring strategy” that can contribute to a lack of diversity, “since very often the people we enjoy hanging out with have backgrounds much like our own,” &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/how-to-hire"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcrBmB"&gt;The complaint alleges that the company’s discrimination against Black applicants is partly predicated on its “strong consideration of ‘culture fit’ in hiring, without providing sufficient objective guidance to managers and other employees on how to determine which applicants and employees will be a good ‘culture fit’ at Facebook,” &lt;em&gt;The Intercept &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfCb7B"&gt;Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4SObh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft says the latest Xbox Series X update fixes controller disconnect issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MfJ7O76VTZRgrZIjR96rgiRN8VI=/9x0:2631x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68952172/twarren_xboxseriesxcontroller_VLS_3616_2_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x4lfJQ"&gt;Microsoft released a &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/09/march-xbox-update-details/"&gt;new Xbox update&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that brings toggles for Auto HDR and FPS Boost and improvements to better support the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285247/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-release-date-price-features"&gt;Xbox Wireless Headset&lt;/a&gt;. But there was another big feature that wasn’t mentioned in the official release notes: the update also fixes “many” of the Xbox Series X controller disconnect issues that have cropped up, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jronald/status/1369696666278711298"&gt;according to the Xbox team’s Jason Ronald&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eKXYNw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Lots of Xbox news this week, but in case you missed it we released our March Xbox System Update yesterday. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to the new features, this release also fixes many of the controller disconnects players have reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep the feedback coming.&lt;a href="https://t.co/bltTsL6Lty"&gt;https://t.co/bltTsL6Lty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Ronald (@jronald) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jronald/status/1369696666278711298?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Iwj24H"&gt;Players began reporting disconnect issues with the controllers just days after the console’s launch, and you can see some of those reports in this &lt;a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/xba_console/xbox-series-x-controller-keeps-disconnecting/16d9f462-57c0-4b6c-93fd-b03711e632ee?page=1"&gt;89-page thread on Microsoft’s support forums&lt;/a&gt;. In January, however, Microsoft acknowledged that it was aware of the issues and said that fixes were coming “in a future update” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215289/microsoft-xbox-series-x-controller-disconnect-update"&gt;in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CE9M9E"&gt;We haven’t tested the new update ourselves to see if it fixes issues that people have seen. But if you have been experiencing controller disconnects, it sounds like the new update could address them for you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mh23p0"&gt;The latest Windows update has been causing problems for some printer owners, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2021/03/10/windows-10-kb5000802-march-update-is-crashing-pcs-with-bsod/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Latest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(via &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/latest-windows-10-update-is-causing-some-printers-to-cr-1846456254"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Users are reporting that they’re getting a blue screen when they try to open the print dialogue from Notepad, Office, or other programs. (You know that annoyingly ambiguous error message that’s like “Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart”? It’s that one.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZVBOV"&gt;Microsoft is aware that attempting to print in certain circumstances can blue screen your PC, and has listed the bug on the Windows 10 &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/march-9-2021-kb5000802-os-builds-19041-867-and-19042-867-63552d64-fe44-4132-8813-ef56d3626e14"&gt;Support page&lt;/a&gt;. The company doesn’t appear to have issued a fix at this time. “We are presently investigating and will provide an update when more information is available,” that website currently reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UThk2e"&gt;It’s not clear how widespread the issue is, but &lt;em&gt;Windows Latest&lt;/em&gt; says it has “seen numerous reports of error popping up here and there.” The bug appears to impact multiple printer brands including Kyocera, Ricoh, and Zebra. “Have had at least 20 confirmed cases from 4 different clients already and it’s only been an hour into the day,” one reader told the publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pN63MF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’ve seen numerous reports of error popping up here and there”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kp6OBC"&gt;Windows users are complaining across Reddit as well. “This issue was confirmed across four computers,” said &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/m1jkuz/kyocera_drivers_patch_tuesday_bsod/"&gt;one Reddit user&lt;/a&gt;. “We just got 3 calls from clients all experiencing this same issue,” another commenter &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/m1jkuz/kyocera_drivers_patch_tuesday_bsod/gqgi31f?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Kyocera Corp. Founder Kazuo Inamori Interview" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g9XgY_cO-S2kVrbw5rppfGf8nDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363896/495767146.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LqvQNT"&gt;If you’re encountering this problem, the easiest fix is to roll back the latest Windows update. To do this, open Settings &amp;gt; Update &amp;amp; Security &amp;gt; Windows Update &amp;gt; View Update History &amp;gt; Uninstall Updates &amp;gt; Uninstall, or remove the patch manually in Command Prompt. Some Reddit users confirmed that this fixed their problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQEGOd"&gt;A user claiming to be a Microsoft employee has also &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/m1jkuz/kyocera_drivers_patch_tuesday_bsod/gqj91b3/"&gt;posted two temporary workarounds&lt;/a&gt; on Reddit, which commenters have confirmed to work. You can enable direct printing in the Command Prompt, or you can use the Compatibility Administrator tool to apply a fix, depending on the application you’re running. Both processes are complicated, so your best bet is to go read that Reddit comment closely if you want to try them. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile’s long-promised 5G home broadband will launch later this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xSH8vXRo5Bmuw4wCC_DHyAtOB6U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951865/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile hopes to expand the service to 7 to 8 million customers in the next five years | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d8ZTO1"&gt;At an analyst event on Thursday, T-Mobile revealed that its long-awaited 5G home broadband service will launch later this month, which it confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; A 4G version of the service is currently in pilot testing with 100,000 households. By the end of the year, T-Mobile says it hopes to extend the service to 7–8 million customers within five years. There’s no confirmed launch date for the service yet, but we’ll know more later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCrFgl"&gt;The company has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254853/tmobile-sprint-merger-5g-home-internet-service-promises"&gt;promising 5G-based wireless broadband&lt;/a&gt; since before its acquisition of Sprint, saying that the merger would make it possible to offer service that would challenge the dominant cable companies. Before the deal was approved, T-Mobile went ahead and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275640/tmobile-lte-wireless-home-internet-service-pilot-launch"&gt;started testing out the service&lt;/a&gt; with a limited group of customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0z9D8s"&gt;The self-styled Uncarrier isn’t the only one testing the waters of fixed wireless internet. Verizon &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2Fc-band-verizon-expands-5g-home-internet&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325833%2Ft-mobile-5g-home-broadband-internet-launch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just expanded&lt;/a&gt; its 5G home internet service to ten more cities, though in testing last year &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/for-now-verizons-5g-home-internet-service-offers-very-little-coverage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; found&lt;/a&gt; that actual availability in the cities Verizon serves is scarce. If nothing else, both companies seem plenty motivated to get 5G home internet up and running. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go listen to Spotify’s podcast about itself that ignores the existence of iTunes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GIvgSm29-LauAgtAIsyOvUcNsoQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951861/mdoying_180308_1437_0082still.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L1vT9P"&gt;Spotify is &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-11/introducing-the-new-miniseries-spotify-a-product-story/"&gt;making a podcast about its own history&lt;/a&gt;, and the first two episodes are well worth a listen for the details on the jump from piracy to streaming, how the company decided to build its business, and the technical details of how it did so. There are also some fun interviews included, with the podcast featuring stories from Sean Parker, inventor of Napster, and Lars Ulrich of Metallica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjakdV"&gt;In the podcast, the Spotify founders discuss the history of piracy in Spotify’s home country, Sweden, to give context about its development environment. It goes into the existence of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party_(Sweden)"&gt;Sweden’s Pirate Party&lt;/a&gt;, an actual political party that once held several seats in the country’s parliament. The founders also discuss how they wanted to take the ease of pirating music but make it legitimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hto6JX"&gt;If talk about being easier than piracy sounds familiar, it’s probably because that was part of the pitch for the &lt;a href="https://www.theledger.com/news/20130424/happy-anniversary-itunes-celebrates-a-decade-faces-new-challenges"&gt;iTunes Music Store, too&lt;/a&gt;. It seems, for the most part, that iTunes and the iPod are pretty much completely ignored. The podcast presents music distribution as going from CD stores to Napster to Spotify. Apple and Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/17/18268861/spotify-apple-antitrust-fight-latest-updates-news"&gt;aren’t the best of friends&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s honestly somewhat hilarious to hear how the story completely ignores the fact that people could, in fact, buy digital music (an option that was around even before Spotify launched).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHyG4f"&gt;Despite the lack of objectivity about the history of digital music, the technical depth alone makes it well worth a listen. The second episode (labeled 01) gets into how Spotify used the same peer-to-peer tech used by the pirates to build its legitimate music streaming service and how its approach blew people's minds at the time. Even though the story leaves some pretty important parts out, &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3L9tzrt0CthF6hNkxYIeSB"&gt;it’s still worth a listen&lt;/a&gt; to hear the origins of the popular music (and, obviously, podcasting) service. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pakistan is again banning TikTok, this time for ‘peddling vulgarity’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ufLIkvf3ZyakkULTvro5-1pWqgU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951763/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hGrOzk"&gt;Pakistan has banned TikTok yet again, citing objectionable content on the shortform video app. This is the second time the ByteDance platform has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21509817/tiktok-pakistan-ban-immoral-indecent-content"&gt;banned in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, following a brief 10-day shutdown in October of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ONMcK"&gt;Last fall, TikTok was banned for hosting “immoral” and “indecent” videos, but the company was able to assure the Pakistani government that videos would be moderated “in accordance with societal norms and the laws of Pakistan,” and the app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21523094/pakistan-tiktok-ban-lifted-after-10-days"&gt;resumed operations&lt;/a&gt; a week and a half later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kgMTQd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In respectful compliance to the orders of the Peshawar High Court, PTA has issued directions to the service providers to immediately block access to the TikTok App. During the hearing of a case today, the PHC has ordered for the blocking of App.&lt;/p&gt;— PTA (@PTAofficialpk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PTAofficialpk/status/1370044117678444544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s4pyxu"&gt;The company has tens of millions of users in Pakistan, and yet a high court in the city of Peshawar ordered the government’s telecom regulatory body, the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority, to ban the app in order to comply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOV0rz"&gt;“In respectful compliance to the orders of the Peshawar High Court, PTA has issued directions to the service providers to immediately block access to the TikTok App,” reads the announcement. “During the hearing of a case today, the PHC has ordered for the blocking of App.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnTr1J"&gt;It’s not entirely clear why TikTok’s legality in Pakistan is again in question and whether any one video or trend on the app is the culprit. Yet, &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/11/pakistani-court-orders-tik-tok-banned-over-obscene"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that complaints were made from Peshawar High Court Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan, who accused TikTok of hosting content “unacceptable for Pakistani society.” &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/90df50e4-7fd9-4def-86e3-db256882140d"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Khan said the platform engaged in “peddling vulgarity” and ordered the ban take effect immediately during a hearing on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="n1gtY3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the second ban for TikTok in Pakistani in the last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9vyZs6"&gt;“TikTok is built upon the foundation of creative expression, with strong safeguards in place to keep inappropriate content off the platform,” TikTok said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “In Pakistan we have grown our local-language moderation team, and have mechanisms to report and remove content in violation of our community guidelines. We look forward to continuing to serve the millions of TikTok users and creators in Pakistan who have found a home for creativity and fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wCZ8I"&gt;TikTok has endured a number of contentious government bans and other restrictions around the world — most notably, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262940/tiktok-leaves-india-ban-app-china-government-security-privacy"&gt;countrywide ban in India since last summer&lt;/a&gt; and the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160239/tiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department"&gt;hamfisted attempt&lt;/a&gt; to force the company to partner with a US tech firm to assuage fears of Chinese government influence over the platform. (That deal, with cloud giant Oracle, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276090/tiktok-oracle-deal-biden-trump-ban-china-bytedance-white-house"&gt;apparently on life support&lt;/a&gt; under President Joe Biden.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OJcgI"&gt;The app has faced its most serious opposition in and around Southeast Asia, where governments have extended existing control over the media to the video-centric social network using laws and regulations around what constitutes obscene or immoral content. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gogo’s 5G network launch has stalled due to the chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gogo in-flight internet STOCK" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lHETWhF_mED3GtwchqDhx2yO6nE=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951586/gogo-internet-logo-stock1_1020.1419980305.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Gogo in-flight internet STOCK&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t5p29N"&gt;Gogo will be delaying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/29/18644707/gogo-5g-network-planes-developing-in-flight"&gt;the rollout of its 5G network&lt;/a&gt;, pushing it back from 2021 to 2022. &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/gogo-delays-5g-launch-due-to-chipset-shortages/d/d-id/768025"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;LightReading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the global chip shortage is to blame for the delay, though Gogo didn’t provide any direct details about how the shortage was setting it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZONve"&gt;Gogo isn’t the only one feeling the sting of the global chip shortage: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;, CPUs, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;game consoles&lt;/a&gt; have become infamous for being in short supply, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;car manufacturers are having to slow down production lines&lt;/a&gt; because of the supply constraint. The situation has gotten to the point where President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298376/biden-sign-semiconductor-shortage-executive-order-apple-amd-playstation"&gt;has signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; calling for a review of the chip supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBl0iq"&gt;The company, known for providing in-flight Wi-Fi, had a difficult 2020: it did &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21350251/gogo-layoffs-furloughs-airlines-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;several rounds of layoffs&lt;/a&gt;, pay cuts, and furloughs, as people stopped taking flights. The company also ended up selling its commercial in-flight Wi-Fi business &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21410368/gogo-sells-inflight-internet-business-intelsat-bankrupt"&gt;to a bankrupt satellite provider&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it slightly unclear as to what the company plans to do with its 5G network when it eventually gets it rolled out. The company &lt;a href="https://business.gogoair.com/solutions/midsize-heavy-jet/"&gt;still provides internet and in-flight entertainment&lt;/a&gt; for smaller, more business-oriented planes, so it’s possible it’ll use the network to improve that service. Gogo wasn’t immediately available to comment on its future plans for the network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CZ3w42"&gt;The 5G network, when Gogo gets it rolled out, will be &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/mobile/5g/gogo-goes-all-american-for-5g-network/d/d-id/755064"&gt;an upgrade to the company’s existing 3G cellular towers&lt;/a&gt;. Gogo gave up on its plans of upgrading the network to 4G with equipment from ZTE after the US government basically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/18/17477170/zte-ban-senate-vote-reinstate"&gt;shut down the network equipment provider with a ban&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
