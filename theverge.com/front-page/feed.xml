    <title>Amazon extends ban on police use of its facial recognition software ‘until further notice’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2sz0ifqs-3Qj8Eel3feJqezTrzI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69307460/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GNVmPJ"&gt;Amazon has extended its moratorium on law enforcement use of its facial recognition software “until further notice,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com./technology/exclusive-amazon-extends-moratorium-police-use-facial-recognition-software-2021-05-18/?utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The ban was set to expire in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEU0CY"&gt;As early as 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/22/17492106/amazon-ice-facial-recognition-internal-letter-protest"&gt;Amazon employees&lt;/a&gt; had pushed Amazon to scale back the project, arguing that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/3/18291995/amazon-facial-recognition-technology-rekognition-police-ai-researchers-ban-flawed"&gt;documented racial bias in facial recognition&lt;/a&gt; could exacerbate police violence against minorities. Amazon defended the project until June 2020, when increased pressure from widespread protests led to the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287101/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police-ban-one-year-ai-racial-bias"&gt;announcing a yearlong moratorium&lt;/a&gt; on police clients for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYv8TW"&gt;Rekognition is offered as an AWS service, and many of Amazon’s cloud computing competitors have similar technology. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288053/microsoft-facial-recognition-police-law-enforcement-pledge-regulation"&gt;Microsoft announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would also not be selling its facial recognition services to police the day after Amazon’s pledge, and IBM said that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21284683/ibm-no-longer-general-purpose-facial-recognition-analysis-software"&gt;would stop developing or researching&lt;/a&gt; facial recognition tech altogether the same week. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075001/facial-recognition-ban-google-microsoft-eu-sundar-pichai-brad-smith"&gt;doesn’t commercially offer its facial recognition technology&lt;/a&gt; to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCvvsi"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately respond to request for comment about why the ban was being extended. In a statement provided when the ban on law enforcement use was first issued, Amazon said it hoped Congress would use the year provided by the moratorium to implement rules surrounding the ethical use of facial recognition technology. Part of its statement read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ofTctf"&gt;We’ve advocated that governments should put in place stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology, and in recent days, Congress appears ready to take on this challenge. We hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules, and we stand ready to help if requested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xRb4bl"&gt;So far, no federal legislation has addressed police use of facial recognition, but a number of state and local measures have passed paring back use of the technology. San Francisco was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18623013/san-francisco-facial-recognition-ban-vote-city-agencies"&gt;the first US city to ban government use of facial recognition&lt;/a&gt; in May 2019, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697821/oakland-facial-recogntiion-ban-vote-governement-california"&gt;Oakland following soon after&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429960/portland-passes-strongest-facial-recognition-ban-us-public-private-technology"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21536892/portland-maine-facial-recognition-ban-passed-surveillance"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; cities of Portland also passed legislation around the tech in late 2020. The state of Massachusetts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179245/facial-recognition-bill-ban-rejected-massachusetts-governor-charlie-baker-police-accountability"&gt;failed to pass a proposed ban&lt;/a&gt; in December 2020 but &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/07/982709480/massachusetts-pioneers-rules-for-police-use-of-facial-recognition-tech"&gt;has recently passed a modified bill&lt;/a&gt; that adds some restrictions on police use of facial recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 public beta is now available: here’s how to install it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rhzGfRd8tVHG9KHkxSRLx4kT19U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69307041/vpavic_210517_4586_0027.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo composite by Amelia Holowaty Krales and Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SGc5DS"&gt;Google unveiled Android 12 at its opening &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432922/google-io-2021-rumors-news-announcements"&gt;I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt;  keynote, and now you can try the new update yourself as part of the first public beta. The Android 12 public beta is currently available for Google’s Pixel phones (Pixel 3 and up) and will also come to devices from OnePlus, Lenovo, Asus, Oppo, Realme, Sharp, Tecno, TCL, Vivo, Xiaomi, and ZTE. You can enroll your Pixel phone on &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta"&gt;Google’s Android beta site&lt;/a&gt; or find specific instructions for other supported phones on &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/devices"&gt;the Android Developers page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blkQBw"&gt;Android 12 brings a cornucopia of new features, but the most exciting are the new visuals. Along with new animations, widgets, and a modified lock screen, Android 12 also offers theming, with the ability to change the colors used across the OS just by changing your wallpaper. Not all of the dramatic visual changes will be available in this first beta, but they should roll out over time as we get closer to release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3nlq1"&gt;Google is tweaking other aspects of the Android experience as well, like notifications and quick settings. It’s also making some improvements to privacy and security, with indicators for when your phone’s camera or microphones are in use, and easier access to all of your apps’ various permissions in one dashboard. For a more in-depth look at Android 12, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22203818"&gt;check out our full preview&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to get started with the beta right now, head below for instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="shYkqe"&gt;Pixel 3, 3 XL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0y9mMh"&gt;Pixel 3A, 3A XL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OCnwI5"&gt;Pixel 4, 4 XL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uz1NKb"&gt;Pixel 4A, 4A 5G&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f7OJNO"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="60pdaS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2FContent%2FAndroid-12-Beta%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F18%2F22442051%2Fandroid-12-beta-download-google-io-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus Zenfone 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="Wofbdn"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://developers.oppomobile.com/wiki/doc/index#id=91"&gt;Oppo Find X3 Pro&lt;/a&gt; (model CPH2173)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4WKaBi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tcl.com/global/en/android-12-beta.html"&gt;TCL 20 Pro 5G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Rf6h0u"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.vivo.com/doc/detail?id=103"&gt;Vivo iQOO 7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vKmMME"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mi.com/global/service/support/androidsbeta.html"&gt;Xiaomi Mi 11, Mi 11 Ultra, Mi 11I, Mi 11X Pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="m4HRC0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ztedevices.com/en-gl/developer/android-12/"&gt;ZTE Axon 30 Ultra 5G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8q22Yu"&gt;as well as models from &lt;a href="https://k-tai.sharp.co.jp/support/developers/android12_betaprogram/"&gt;Sharp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://spot.tecno.com/global/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;amp;tid=98054&amp;amp;id=98054"&gt;Tecno&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.realmebbs.com/post-details/1393156430865309696"&gt;Realme&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pqo2S3"&gt;How to install the Android 12 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DcweJw"&gt;The process of how you get Android 12 beta on your phone ranges from requiring just a few clicks to something more involved. For this beta download, it’s considerably easier to get the it on one of the supported Google Pixel phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nukaT"&gt;For a Pixel, begin by &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta"&gt;visiting the Android 12 beta site to enroll your phone in the beta&lt;/a&gt;. You should be able to find your phone listed when you click “View your eligible devices.” After you enroll your device, you might be nudged via a notification on your phone that the software is ready to install. If you want to check manually, open the settings menu on your phone, then head to System &amp;gt; System Update. Tap “Check for update” to see if you can download the new software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5turHD"&gt;If nothing happens right away, your only option is to keep waiting. In the past, I’ve gotten the beta update on my phone within minutes of enrolling, though sometimes it takes hours. It may take over 24 hours for the software to be ready to install on your phone, so hang tight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feWDkB"&gt;As for supported phones from other brands like OnePlus, Realme, Sharp, and others, &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/devices"&gt;follow the instructions on each page&lt;/a&gt; from Google’s list of eligible phones, as the process for installation seems to differ depending on the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google I/O 2021: the biggest announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kkeRgl_86di19oO3JMVfXRca3Jk=/2x0:1060x705/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69307106/Sundar_Pichai_03.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EkVd2G"&gt;Google just finished its live &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432922/google-io-2021-rumors-news-announcements"&gt;Google I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt; keynote, where the company unveiled a huge number of announcements, including a new look coming to Android, a bunch of features coming to its Google Workspace productivity suite, and even a new AI that talked as if it were Pluto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mS9wd0"&gt;Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn followed the whole thing in real time right here &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22200447"&gt;on our live blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But if you just want to get caught up on the biggest news from the show, read on for our recap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DkHZX1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22203818"&gt;Android 12 has a radical and bubbly new look&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P90YgdXDdWW1P3VSYbBXQhVEW_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520874/1._Android_12_Keyword_Header.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1c73tP"&gt;Google revealed that Android 12 will have a brand-new “Material You” design with a whole lot of new changes. It offers a lot of color and customization, and the new mobile OS will even be able to change system colors to be able to better match your wallpaper. It also offers some new privacy features, including a new privacy dashboard. A beta will be available today, and it works with phones from 11 device makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CBb7TW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22204267"&gt;Google is making Workspace more interconnected&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RTeFfIl9I0B8MWwLTNF2wjtrphE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523240/352_2021_05_18_352_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cowa7t"&gt;Google announced “smart canvas,” a new initiative for its Workspace office software that will make it easier to work between products. Features include “smart chips” that let you link to other Workspace apps and the ability to start a Meet video call right from Google Doc, Sheet, or Slide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="80KR8v"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442328/google-io-2021-ai-language-model-lamda-pluto"&gt;Google showed off its new LaMDA AI language model and demoed conversations with Pluto and a paper airplane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dhDtRdII62zzec9EqYWyL1kiXb0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523253/374_2021_05_18_374_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6HGlLD"&gt;Google CEO Sundar Pichai showed off some impressive (but pre-recorded) demos of someone having a conversation with an AI powered by its new LaMDA conversation technology. In the demos, the AI “talked” as Pluto and a paper airplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bKzWnN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;Google and Samsung are merging Wear OS and Tizen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hpSHh2ndDTF6MB1d23EjQd-iqO8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523443/image__2_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h45GDO"&gt;Google announced Wear OS (now called just Wear) and Samsung’s Tizen will be combined into a unified platform. That should lead to apps launching faster and longer battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cXcHU0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442336/google-project-starline-3d-video-chat-platform"&gt;Project Starline creates a 3D model of a person sitting across from you&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DmpbYBSZ0g5j7u-cN9S9zKuI9wA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523498/511_2021_05_18_511_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rTZeBL"&gt;Google demonstrated Project Starline, which uses high-resolution cameras and depth sensors to create a real-time 3D model of a person who is “sitting” across you to re-create the feeling of having a face-to-face meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="91C4pv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442515/google-camera-app-inclusive-image-equity-skintones"&gt;Google is building a camera that’s more inclusive of skin tone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/joJ43KdXHMbjL8ix5F7SKm5VYgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523549/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_12.13.28_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nA7uJh"&gt;Google is working on updates to its camera and imaging products to make them better at capturing and reproducing skin tones accurately in images. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vY7MSx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442466/google-photos-cinematic-moments-animated-android-ios-machine-learning"&gt;Google Photos will be able to make animated photos from still shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WKUyCO6Y4QApjUKXvL5Hb5QV6Y0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523418/E855_Photos_IO_Social_Assets_CinematicPhotos_Part01_v01_cl_6zNG70C.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4EgBOh"&gt;Google Photos is getting impressive new “cinematic moments” that use two photos to create a moving image. You can see what they look like in the GIF above. Google is also adding new types of Memories, including ones based on visual patterns in your photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BRvgzn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442416/google-photos-locked-folder-private-hidden-pictures"&gt;Google Photos will let you store photos in a locked folder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GAtAoN8Qab_ufv6jIjh-UDJu5Z4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523384/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_11.05.05_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lGUYZz"&gt;Google is adding a feature in Google Photos to let you store photos in a password-protected space on your phone. These photos won’t appear when you’re scrolling in the app. It’s launching first on Google Pixel and coming to more Android devices “throughout the year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iq3h87"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442247/google-chrome-password-manager-android-compromised-duplex"&gt;Google will let you change a site’s password right from inside its password manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Kh8kGQ6nFRc9_zWctCeJnITzMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523364/Automated_Password_Change.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;

&lt;p id="MrIpOw"&gt;Google announced that it’s adding a way to change a stored password for a website right from inside Google’s password manager. It’s rolling out gradually to Chrome on Android in the US and will be widely available in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is trying to make its image processing more inclusive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A9Ksvm0sHS2BV49oSkg36S1_KjM=/133x0:1588x970/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69307084/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_12.13.28_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google says its tweaked image processing will avoid over-brightening black and brown faces.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9UcfQR"&gt;It’s a long-standing problem that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d16LNHIEJzs"&gt;dates back to the days of film&lt;/a&gt;: image processing tends to be tuned for lighter skin tones and not that of black and brown subjects. Google announced an effort to address that today in its own camera and imaging products, with a focus on making images of people of color “more beautiful and more accurate.” These changes will come to Google’s own Pixel cameras this fall, and the company says it will share what it learns across the broader Android ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWA364"&gt;Specifically, Google is making changes to its auto-white balance and exposure algorithms to improve accuracy for dark skin tones based on a broader data set of images featuring black and brown faces. With these tweaks, Google aims to avoid over-brightening and de-saturating people of color in photos for more accurate representation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GHfks7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2DXY9cR7vN4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NgaflI"&gt;Google has also made improvements for portrait mode selfies, creating a more accurate depth map for curly and wavy hair types — rather than simply cutting around the subject’s hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7v270"&gt;The company says it still has much to do — and it has certainly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai"&gt;stumbled in the past&lt;/a&gt; on the image recognition and inclusion front — but it’s a welcome step in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google previews Project Starline, a next-gen 3D video chat booth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TMp0GHzssKJj6RUdGhIz_ytf8OY=/65x0:928x575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69306950/Booth_Blog.max_1000x1000.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Project Starline | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dxbVYh"&gt;Google is working on a next-gen video chat booth that makes the person you’re chatting with appear in front of you in 3D. You can see them from different angles by moving around and even make eye contact, Google said during a preview of the project at its I/O conference today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2vuID"&gt;The system is called “&lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/research/project-starline/"&gt;Project Starline&lt;/a&gt;,” and it’s basically a really, really fancy video chat setup. The platform uses multiple cameras and sensors to capture a person’s appearance and shape from different perspectives. It then stitches those together into a 3D model that’s broadcast in real time to whomever they’re chatting with. In Google’s preview, Starline was used for person-to-person calls (not group chats), and both sides seemed to be using specialized tech so it could all work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDuL6H"&gt;In a demo video, people using the tech describe seeing people like they were in the same room together. It’s “as if she was right in front of me,” one person says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3e6TG"&gt;Right now the system is big. It appears to be an entire booth, complete with lights, cameras, and a bench to sit on. Google says it relies on “custom-built hardware and highly specialized equipment.” &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-project-starline/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the booth contains more than a dozen different depth sensors and a 65-inch “light field display” to make people appear in 3D. Light field tech has popped up in some promising applications over the past decade (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/2/29/2821763/lytro-review"&gt;Lytro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/1/16070188/avegant-light-field-display-ar-headset-next-level-video"&gt;Avegant&lt;/a&gt; both used it), but it’s yet to catch on as a way to present people clearly in 3D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7G9Sz"&gt;The video chat booth is currently only available in “a few” of Google’s offices, and it plans on testing the tech with business partners later in the year. Google mentioned health care and media as two industries from which it was seeking feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWeFrH"&gt;After a year of constant reliance on video chatting — and as companies plan futures where they rely on video chats more than ever — the promise of more realistic remote calls is exciting. Google makes it sound like Project Starline is a ways away from being something found in every office, let alone in your home. But it means the company is at least working toward something that’s significantly better than the blurry calls we’re used to. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google announces health tool to identify skin conditions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cartoon image of a person using a smartphone to photograph a rash on their hand." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Z4Vkr4CXtSJXjODsaYEL1sDYH8=/162x0:1935x1182/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69306833/Copy_of_derm___hero_image_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google developed a tool to help people identify skin conditions.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="maDmL0"&gt;Google’s latest foray into health care is a web tool that uses artificial intelligence to help people identify skin, hair, or nail conditions. The company previewed the tool at I/O today, and it says it hopes to launch a pilot later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3c2bq7"&gt;People can use their phone’s camera to take three pictures of the problem area — for example, a rash on their arm. They’ll then answer a series of questions about their skin type and other symptoms. The tool then gives a list of possible conditions from a set of 288 that it’s trained to recognize. It’s not intended to diagnose the problem, the company said in a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/ai-dermatology-preview-io-2021/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/530ZzjZDimv-GMJ7SdULjDFNRJU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521171/Copy_of_01_derm_summary.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google tool asks people to take three photos of a skin problem, and then it offers possible conditions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZiMGjX"&gt;Google decided to tackle skin conditions using artificial intelligence because of their prevalence, says Karen DeSalvo, the chief health officer at Google Health. “People are coming to Google to ask questions about skin conditions. We get about 10 billion annual skin condition queries,” she said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, experts can help people determine if it’s something simple or indicative of a more serious illness, but there’s a shortage of dermatologists all over the world. DeSalvo hopes this tool can help get people accurate information about potential conditions, quickly, without having to spend hours doing their own online research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z34oxw"&gt;The team trained the model on millions of images of skin problems, thousands of images of healthy skin, and 65,000 images from clinical settings. The model takes factors like age, skin type, sex, and race into account when suggesting possible conditions. When it was tested on around 1,000 images of skin problems from a diverse range of patients, Google says it identified the correct condition in the top three suggestions 84 percent of the time. It included the correct condition as one of the possible issues 97 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="horSJJ"&gt;The new system builds on Google’s past work using artificial intelligence tools to identify skin conditions. The company published the first iteration of its deep learning system in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0842-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last spring. That paper showed that the system could identify 26 common skin conditions just as accurately as dermatologists and more accurately than primary care doctors. In April, the company published &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2779250"&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; showing that the system could help non-dermatologist physicians diagnose skin conditions more accurately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvaVHD"&gt;Google is also working with a Stanford University research team to test how well the tool works in a health care setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JeP573"&gt;The company obtained a Class I medical device mark for the tool in the European Union, designating it as a low-risk medical device. It has not been evaluated by the United States Food and Drug Administration. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively.

&lt;p id="xQeiGK"&gt;Walmart, however, offers an even steeper discount; the 64GB iPad mini is currently available for $369 in either &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB%2F207104625%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeiPadDeals032921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB-Silver%2F816033343%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeiPadDeals032921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;

The fourth-gen iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch, fourth-gen model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Photos will soon make animated photos from your still shots</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mp16hmVQgmcDQDpItu3ksgkeWPI=/10x0:741x487/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69306801/cinematic.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UNgPGB"&gt;Google Photos will soon have a cool new trick: if you take two similar images with your phone’s camera, the app will be able to create an animated, moving shot that combines them. It does this by using machine learning to synthesize movement between the two shots. Google creates new frames between them, resulting in a “vivid moving picture.”  Google’s Shimrit Ben-Yair made this sound like something that parents will love since now your multiple attempts at the same shot will allow for this added benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLujub"&gt;The new feature is called “cinematic moments,” and it will work on both Android and iOS, Ben-Yair said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sm2iCe"&gt;Google also announced a new locked folder feature that will let you hide your most sensitive images behind a folder protected by a password or thumbprint. The app will also soon let you hide specific people or periods of your life from its “memories” to avoid unwanted reminders of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxBqek"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Maps’ Live View feature now offers more useful information about restaurants and businesses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i4Tkp51qIlGC-cKPEyQCRdYMIHY=/0x28:898x627/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69306773/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_7.29.07_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iPntOY"&gt;Google announced a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/five-maps-updates-io-2021"&gt;bunch of new features for Google Maps&lt;/a&gt; at its 2021 I/O developer conference today, including upgrades to its handy Live View tool, which helps you navigate the world through augmented reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vm3cN1"&gt;Live View launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20776247/google-maps-live-view-ar-walking-directions-ios-android-feature"&gt;in beta in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, projecting walking directions through your camera’s viewfinder, and was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357528/google-maps-directions-indoor-ar-live-view-fuel-efficient-weather-air-quality-layer"&gt;rolled out&lt;/a&gt; to airports, transit stations, and malls earlier this year. Now, Live View will be accessible directly from Google Maps and will collate a lot of handy information, including how busy shops and restaurants are, recent reviews, and any uploaded photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfeyyD"&gt;It sounds particularly handy for exploring new destinations remotely. You can remotely browse that street full of interesting restaurants while on holiday, checking out which places are heaving, and even looking at some of the pictures of dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EV7KB6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re making it easier to explore with Live View.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon you’ll be able to access it right from the map to see helpful details about places nearby — like their busyness, reviews, photos, and more. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoogleIO?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GoogleIO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/V2g5Q8s7rR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/V2g5Q8s7rR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google Maps (@googlemaps) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/googlemaps/status/1394714911524130827?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ue62Yw"&gt;Live View also now has better labeling for streets on complex intersections, says Google, and it will automatically orient you in relation to known locations (like your home or work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yh8sy"&gt;That’s not all for Maps, though, and as Google’s Liz Reid said onstage, the company is on track to launch “more than 100 AI-driven improvements” for the app this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oyktpU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Android 12 preview: first look at Google’s radical new design","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1ajm1K"&gt;Other upgrades include a wider launch for the &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/more-detailed-colorful-map"&gt;detailed street map view&lt;/a&gt;, which will be available in 50 new cities by the end of the year, including Berlin, São Paulo, Seattle, and Singapore; new “busyness” indicators for whole areas as opposed to specific shops and businesses; and selective highlighting of nearby businesses based on the time of day that you’re looking at Google Maps. So if you open up the app first thing in the morning, it’ll show you more places to grab a coffee than a candle-lit dinner for two. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ilDKYfJ3h1RvQc64R6-kO4oYHKo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523422/google_detailed_street_map.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A comparison of Google Maps’ before and after its more detailed street map view. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jSaGxH"&gt;A more ambitious upgrade for Maps is using AI to identify and forecast “hard-braking events” when you’re in your car. Think of it like traffic warnings that navigation apps issue based on data collated from multiple users. But instead of just traffic jams, Google Maps will try to identify harder-to-define “situations that cause you to slam on the brakes, such as confusing lane changes or freeway exits.” The company says its tech has the ability to “eliminate over 100 million hard-braking events in routes driven with Google Maps each year” by giving users a head’s up when it knows such an event is on the horizon.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and Samsung are merging Wear OS and Tizen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k2VWokG1sm_YF2ke2sC8EVH4ZT4=/127x0:1450x882/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69306763/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_2.31.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BvSfFa"&gt;In yet another sign of the growing alliance between Google and Samsung, today both companies announced that they are essentially combining Wear OS — Google’s operating system — and the Tizen-based software platform that has been foundational to Samsung’s wearables for many years. The resulting platform is currently being referred to simply as “Wear,” though that might not be the final name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8jmkE"&gt;Benefits of the joint effort include significant improvements to battery life, 30 percent faster loading times for apps, and smoother animations. It also simplifies life for developers and will create one central smartwatch OS for the Android platform. Google is also promising a greater selection of apps and watch faces than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RFkSoy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re combining the best of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WearOSbyGoogle?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@wearosbygoogle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SamsungMobile?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SamsungMobile&lt;/a&gt; Tizen into a unified wearable platform. ⌚ Apps will start faster, battery life will be longer and you'll have more choice than ever before, from devices to apps and watch faces. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoogleIO?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GoogleIO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/vj2aYZD81x"&gt;pic.twitter.com/vj2aYZD81x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google (@Google) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1394722430212616192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DDhsFY"&gt;“All device makers will be able to add a customized user experience on top of the platform, and developers will be able to use the Android tools they already know and love to build for one platform and ecosystem,” Google’s Bjorn Kilburn &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/wear-os/wear-io21/"&gt;wrote in a blog post.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVrHgv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-wear-os-io-samsung-fitbit-partnership/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; has more details&lt;/a&gt; on what’s to come, including the tidbit that Samsung will stick with its popular rotating bezel on future devices — but it’s finished making Tizen-only smartwatches. There will also be a version of Google Maps that works standalone (meaning without your phone nearby) and a YouTube Music app that supports offline downloads. Oh, and Spotify will support offline downloads on Wear smartwatches, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wear will make it easier to multitask across smartwatch widgets and apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ndQZOs"&gt;Samsung confirmed that its next Galaxy Watch will run on this unified platform. And future “premium” Fitbit devices will also run the software. Aside from merging the technologies of both platforms, the new Wear OS will include improvements that make it easier to multitask between wrist apps. And some of Fitbit’s “most popular” fitness tracking features will also be included to help the platform evolve as a health tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4MPSWC"&gt;What about my current Samsung Galaxy smartwatch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eAt8Vu"&gt;Samsung will make good on its promise of three years of software updates for existing products, according to &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, and it will also allow customers to export their health data so it can be used on future devices. More details will be shared in the months to come. &lt;/p&gt;
