    <title>Maybe don’t sell your friend’s art as an NFT</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J0C7eYWDTFab9qv9ZKnGPSs6TiM=/86x0:616x353/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68970397/capsule_616x353.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wJmThr"&gt;I get it — despite all the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;warnings about climate change&lt;/a&gt;, you or someone you know has &lt;em&gt;big &lt;/em&gt;Scrooge McDuck-sized dollar signs in their eyes after realizing a pinch of blockchain is all you need to turn a JPG image into cold hard cash, and now you’re casting about for something — anything — to turn into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;an NFT&lt;/a&gt; while the initial gold rush lasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdMwew"&gt;Then, you spot it: something that doesn’t exactly belong to you. You’re not going to sell &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, right? And yet that’s kinda what indie game developer Jason Rohrer is attempting to do, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/game-artists-not-happy-that-developer-is-selling-their-1846465316"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: sell NFT copies of 155 digital paintings that he originally commissioned for his game &lt;em&gt;The Castle Doctrine&lt;/em&gt; as individual artworks online. Which... I mean &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; he’s legally got the rights, even though NFTs didn’t exist back then? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="6SAuty"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MDAWfT"&gt;Except Rohrer isn’t even trying to pretend they’re his — he credits each artist on &lt;a href="http://thecastledoctrine.net/crypto.php"&gt;his new crypto gallery page&lt;/a&gt;, calling them his “personal friends,” and says he’s willing to “share” with them if they “bring in loads of auction money and back-end royalties.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6athpf"&gt;Some of his “friends” were not particularly happy about this level of generosity, according to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;, and you should go read &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/game-artists-not-happy-that-developer-is-selling-their-1846465316"&gt;their biting responses in full&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s one to start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="7CjAo0"&gt;Canabalt and Overland developer Adam Saltsman described the NFT auction as a “a lose-lose proposition for me in the short term.” ”Either Jason does more gross public shit using my art, or else I have to like...talk to Jason, and spend some of my life doing that, which also sucks,” Saltsman told Kotaku in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oZtBfF"&gt;At press time, it’s unclear if Rohrer realizes the irony in continuing to use the phrase “PROTECT WHAT’S YOURS” as his website header image. (He has removed some pieces from the site at the artist’s request, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uwwQBFDsOZNTvMY56VuQ-TJNsKk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22372734/headerFinal__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zO9kMd"&gt;I have to admit, I’m curious: would you ever buy an NFT from someone who &lt;em&gt;didn’t &lt;/em&gt;produce the art? Since an NFT is effectively a digital autograph, I’d much rather own one from the original artist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5x5hb"&gt;Perhaps that’s why no one has yet purchased &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/87283591157440911579395974666033012279231858385679051518079761392621806682113"&gt;this famous photo&lt;/a&gt; of a famous anonymous 4Chan post about how “literally anything can be art.” Then again, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/8/2/11629454/this-post-is-art-framed-4chan-post-sells-for-90900-on-ebay"&gt;a framed copy of that post once sold&lt;/a&gt; for nearly $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams is down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZBc4WPjJ_4WifjwI8VfD_LBl-hk=/0x0:2640x1760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68970393/microsoftteams.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qDRwsd"&gt;Microsoft Teams is currently down worldwide. Microsoft says it’s attempting to bring the service back online after “a recent change to an authentication system” took some Microsoft 365 services down. “We’re rolling back the update to mitigate impact,” says &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1371554704518352896"&gt;Microsoft’s 365 status account&lt;/a&gt;, but the roll back is “taking longer than expected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAD6y0"&gt;The issues started around 3:30PM ET, and Microsoft quickly confirmed they are affecting users worldwide. This is the first major Microsoft Teams outage since the service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21492688/microsoft-outlook-office-teams-azure-outage-down"&gt;went down back in September&lt;/a&gt;, alongside other Microsoft 365 services like Office 365 and Outlook. Microsoft also blamed its previous outage on a configuration change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBL6uQ"&gt;Azure Active Directory also appears to be &lt;a href="https://status.azure.com/en-us/status"&gt;experiencing issues&lt;/a&gt; as part of this outage, and Microsoft’s Xbox prepaid codes &lt;a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-live-status"&gt;aren’t working&lt;/a&gt; right now, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0XyVE6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The process to roll back the change is taking longer than expected. We'll provide an ETA as soon as one becomes available. Additional information can be found at &lt;a href="https://t.co/AEUj8uAGXl"&gt;https://t.co/AEUj8uAGXl&lt;/a&gt; or under MO244568 if available.&lt;/p&gt;— Microsoft 365 Status (@MSFT365Status) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1371562998561579009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XEwYwC"&gt;Microsoft now has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;115 million people using its Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt; communications app every day. The service has grown rapidly during the pandemic, as students and businesses moved online for remote working and learning. As a result, a worldwide outage like this will now affect millions of people trying to use Microsoft Teams to communicate with co-workers, teachers, or fellow students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3n3Ua"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, March 15th 4:50PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with latest information from Microsoft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSI Summit B15 review: average business</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Functional but could be better&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Z93JmH"&gt;This year, multiple companies primarily known for gaming laptops have been branching out into the portable business and productivity sector. It’s a crowded field already, but Razer made quite a splash with its excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287698/razer-book-13-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer Book 13&lt;/a&gt;, which has an elegant chassis, a 16:10 screen, and just a touch of its company’s signature RGB lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OC0P0f"&gt;In this review I’m looking at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21418451/msi-summit-series-prestige-modern-announced-specs"&gt;Summit Series&lt;/a&gt;, which is MSI’s attempt to enter the same space. The series includes the Summit E line — which includes discrete GPU options and is priced to compete with top dogs like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell’s XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; — and the Summit B line, which starts at $999 and sits squarely in the midrange market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fwht5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10388520"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60wLLz"&gt;I’m discussing the Summit B15 here — I looked at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451322/msi-summit-series-e15-chassis-build-keyboard-speakers-security"&gt;Summit E15&lt;/a&gt; last fall. The base B15 includes a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. I tested the more expensive configuration, which costs $1,249 and has a Core i7-1165G7 (one of Intel’s top 11th Gen processors), 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. The system puts solid specs in a nice chassis, but there are a few misses that make it a bit expensive for what it offers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The webcam of MSI’s Summit B15 with the LED indicator on." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lcyVpFp3_M-FXJeQLEzBzKGvac8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361112/mchin_190604_4465_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 720p IR webcam does not support Windows Hello.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The touchpad of the MSI Summit B15 from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VnGqU293H97TJqyVqJA_0P5fUng=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361116/mchin_190604_4465_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s the fingerprint sensor in the top left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wj8JKW"&gt;The most appealing facets of the Summit-Series laptops are their look and build. They have a smooth black finish, an aluminum build, a classy backlit keyboard, and a lustrous new MSI logo on the lid and bottom bezel (no dragon to be found, a first for MSI). MSI claims the B15 has “military-grade durability,” and while that’s a difficult claim to test, there’s very little flex in the B15’s lid and keyboard. And at 3.53 pounds and 0.67 inches thick, it’s light for its size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeMIXg"&gt;All in all, though, the B15 has a bit of a utilitarian look, especially compared to the E15. The latter has some small flourishes that add up to a classier vibe — there are gold accents around the touchpad and edges of the hinge, for example, where the B15 is straight black. One other thing about the B15’s chassis — it’s one of the worst fingerprint magnets I’ve ever seen. Touch the lid one time, and a visible smudge will remain. I used the sides of my fists to reposition the laptop while taking photos and still had to wipe it down between shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqSPVs"&gt;Don’t get me wrong, it’s a nice-looking and nice-feeling chassis. But there’s nothing exciting about it, and you’ll be wiping it down a lot if you want to maintain a clean look.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI Summit B15 from the right side, half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IJV_7SgZ1mzxrqBthkB7gIgMims=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361114/mchin_190604_4465_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two USB-A and a microSD on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;aside id="Xtyl99"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"MSI’s Summit Series looks like it was made for the boardroom","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451322/msi-summit-series-e15-chassis-build-keyboard-speakers-security"},{"title":"MSI’s Summit Series are slim business laptops for remote workers ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21418451/msi-summit-series-prestige-modern-announced-specs"},{"title":"MSI GS66 Stealth proves the RTX 3080 can handle QHD just fine","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pkezmy"&gt;The useful port selection is a highlight, given the thin chassis. It includes a USB-C (supporting Thunderbolt 4, power delivery, DP 1.4a, and USB 4.0), two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, one USB 3.2 Gen 1, one combination audio jack, one microSD reader, and one HDMI jack, in addition to the barrel-plug power port. You also get an RJ45 Ethernet dongle in the box, which is handy. I also appreciate having USB-A ports on both sides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrLrJW"&gt;I also like the keyboard backlighting, which looks quite classy and wouldn’t be out of place in an office setting. The keys have a nice texture and 1.5mm of travel. Three nitpicks to note: First, the Fn key is half-sized, and I found it a pain to hit. Second, there was occasionally some internal rattle inside the deck, which was annoying. Third, the keys are more mushy than they are clicky, and they’re a bit shallower than the best keyboard keys around. Subjectively, I made more errors on this keyboard than I normally do. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI Summit B15 from the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bdLDmTXjEX7et2zQFEYXP4aObF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361115/mchin_190604_4465_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audio jack, HDMI, USB-C, USB-A, and power port on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="jv12Kr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10388485"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I05xAM"&gt;The display, similarly, is functional with caveats. It covers 98 percent of the sRGB gamut and 76 percent of AdobeRGB, and it maxes out at 258 nits. That’s an acceptable range of color coverage and is functional enough for office use, but it’s too dim to use easily in bright settings. I would expect more from a $1,249 laptop. Additionally, it uses a 16:9 aspect ratio, which is falling out of fashion among premium business laptops for a reason — it’s cramped for multitasking purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HgrIZN"&gt;The one component I really don’t like is the touchpad. It’s a bit small for a 15-inch laptop, and I sometimes hit the fingerprint sensor (built into the top-left corner) and the top plastic as I was scrolling. It also isn’t the smoothest I’ve ever used, and my fingers would skid across it a fair amount. Both the material and the click feel a bit plasticky compared to what you might find in a nicer model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bvUOq"&gt;The Summit’s performance is good. I didn’t encounter any problems while running it through my usual office work. The integrated Iris Xe graphics aren’t suitable for serious gaming but can run lighter fare if that’s your thing. I could occasionally feel the system chugging under the keyboard while doing more intense tasks, but it never got too loud or too hot. You can swap to the “Silent” cooling profile in MSI’s control panel if fan noise is bothering you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="dwmGAB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10388525"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9CvQMX"&gt;With that said, two disappointments came out of my testing period. First, the audio from the B15’s two speakers isn’t terrible and works just fine for video calls, but it delivers tinny percussion and practically no bass. I also heard occasional distortion at maximum volume, though I could eliminate it by bumping the sound down a notch. My test unit’s microphone also wasn’t working on Zoom calls initially. It turned out Zoom had the wrong device set as the default input. If you run into this problem, clicking “Test Speaker and Microphone” before joining your meeting should resolve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5pVB51"&gt;Second disappointment: the battery life. Running the B15 as my daily driver at 200 nits of brightness, I only averaged five hours and 13 minutes. This isn’t entirely unexpected, as it only has a three-cell 52Wh battery — similar to what some 13-inch laptops come with at this point. On this 15-inch laptop, it’s not enough to power you through a full day if your workload is similar to mine (around a dozen Chrome tabs, Slack, occasional Zoom call, that sort of thing). One thing to note is that the B15 comes loaded with Norton, which I’ve seen be a serious battery drain in the past. I ran a battery trial before uninstalling that software and only got four and a half hours. After I nuked the bloatware, the B15 got closer to six. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSXyYY"&gt;All told, the Summit Series is a fine first step for MSI. In a market where business-focused laptops commonly cost multiple thousands of dollars, there’s absolutely an audience for something like the B15, which is light, attractive, and functional for just over the $1,000 mark. It looks and feels like a laptop you’d bring to a business meeting, and it has a top Intel processor with cooling that can handle it. Professionals on a budget could certainly do worse. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI Summit B15 keyboard deck seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uhuBLe16IJLc02314HxAs_gZk2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361113/mchin_190604_4465_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Determined to succeed” is the Summit Series motto.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="63sCEo"&gt;But given the unremarkable audio, battery life, and the other areas of the chassis, I still think that people who are willing to spend a bit more will benefit from doing so, especially folks who can live with less RAM and storage. A better screen, better speakers, and better battery life can make a big difference in the daily experience, and while the B15’s nice chassis, plentiful storage, and business-specific features are worth a premium for some folks, they won’t be everyone’s top priority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gq7f0h"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 15th, 4:29PM: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was updated to include a resolution to an issue that I initially faced with Zoom audio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW’s new curved iDrive display is a ‘major step’ toward autonomous driving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MbYB-LEuEzXB16PSQdV7IhBo62s=/0x0:8065x5377/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68970330/P90415786_highRes.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bPBQIN"&gt;BMW is pulling the curtain back on its next iteration of iDrive, the software and infotainment platform that has served as the centerpiece of the automaker’s in-car experience for the last 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5iZawX"&gt;The eighth version of iDrive will mostly live on a new “curved” display that starts behind the steering wheel and extends halfway across the dashboard. This involves merging the 12.3-inch instrument cluster and the central 14.9-inch infotainment screen into a single unit angled toward the driver. The size of the screen will vary, depending on the vehicle, but the screen will have the appearance of “floating,” the automaker said. The new iDrive will make its debut later this year in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21558833/bmw-ix-inext-electric-suv-range-price-specs"&gt;BMW’s new iX electric SUV&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21162530/bmw-i4-electric-sedan-concept-geneva-motor-show-2020"&gt;BMW i4 electric sedan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="53lgip"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The brain of this car will also be a significant improvement over past models&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p5Ykzp"&gt;The brain of this car will also be a significant improvement over past models, BMW says. The onboard computer will be able to process 20 to 30 times the data volume of previous models, or around double the amount of data that was previously possible. This will enable a greater fusion of the vehicle’s sensors, which will help enable higher levels of autonomous driving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lP4pmp"&gt;According to BMW chief technology officer Frank Weber, iDrive is a “major step” toward fully autonomous vehicles. He explained that iDrive is designed to support both Level 2 and Level 3 autonomous driving systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvro0b"&gt;“It is not an evolutionary step from what we had in the [previous] generation,” Weber said. “It’s an all new, all new system when it comes to sensors, computing, [and] the way it was developed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlgNQR"&gt;Advanced driver assistance systems, defined as Level 2 by the Society of Automotive Engineers, include lane keeping, blind-spot detection, automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control. Most major automakers include some version of advanced driver assistance in their vehicles today. Level 3 refers to highly automated driving, also called conditional automation, where the driver still needs to be able to take over the vehicle upon request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xkctBl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s an all new, all new system”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JGKZWe"&gt;Other automakers have been tripped up by the promise of Level 3 driving. Audi, for example, said its A8 sedan would come with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/11/15952510/audi-a8-level-3-autonomous-driving-self-parking"&gt;a feature called Traffic Jam Pilot&lt;/a&gt; that, when active, would relieve human drivers of the need to pay attention during stop-and-go traffic. &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/shift/why-level-3-automated-technology-has-failed-take-hold"&gt;But the feature was contingent on approval from local authorities&lt;/a&gt;, and Traffic Jam Pilot remains dormant in most markets around the world. Audi has no plans to activate the feature, and Level 3 automation remains a morass of legal, regulatory, and business-related challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNWPCY"&gt;Weber wouldn’t say when BMW would introduce Level 3 automation and hinted it was conditional on racking up more test miles in vehicles equipped with the new version of iDrive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S34xM6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10393766"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q7D9IS"&gt;“Nobody currently can offer at start of production Level 3 capabilities, because you need so many test miles,” he said. “And so you need a production vehicle, and then you run all your validation tests for Level 3.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5EyAQ"&gt;iDrive can be controlled with touch, voice activation, or gesture control. There are three main layouts: Drive, in which drivers can use a “dynamically changing area in the center of the information display to show individually selectable information”; Focus, “designed for extremely dynamic driving situations”; and Gallery, which minimizes the driving content “to clear as much space as possible for widget content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="4ZOAM0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10318020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HygksK"&gt;There is a theme of personalization that runs through the automaker’s new software update. BMW’s Personal Intelligent Assistant, built on top of Microsoft’s Azure cloud system, will “adjust to the driver’s individual needs and routines,” the company says, making it “a central operating channel of human-machine interaction.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHbWSW"&gt;The virtual assistant, which has been available in BMW’s cars for a number of years, will play the role of a “digital character which can engage in natural dialogue with the driver and front passenger – similarly to a relationship between humans.” Expect some similarities to Mercedes-Benz’s MBUX system or Volvo’s Android-powered Google Assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aw1URc"&gt;Using ultra-wideband (UWB) technology, iDrive will be able to load a driver’s personal settings as soon as they start approaching the vehicle by sensing their key fob or smartphone. BMW describes this as a “great entrance moment,” which includes geometric projections, lighted door handles, and other lighting effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkfVE6"&gt;There will be three driving modes: sport, personal, and efficient. These control driving functions like engine throttle, steering characteristics, regenerative braking, and chassis settings, as well as internal and external sounds. New modes may be added via over-the-air software updates in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GZNB8u"&gt;Information about navigation, parking, and EV charging will be fully integrated into iDrive. BMW extends its theme of personalization to its mapping capabilities with a new feature called “learning navigation,” in which the vehicle will learn and anticipate the destination the driver is likely to head for next, based on the driver’s personal ID. This is meant to be a time saver, as well as a way to identify possible road hazards that may delay the journey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwhKl3"&gt;iDrive will support both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto wirelessly, the company said. For several years, BMW had the dubious distinction of being one of the few automakers to charge its customers an annual fee to mirror their smartphone’s display on their car’s infotainment screen. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20995630/bmw-apple-carplay-reverse-decision-annual-fee-vehicle"&gt;BMW reversed that decision in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and since then offers both CarPlay and Android Auto to its customers for free. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk produced a techno track about NFTs he’s selling as an NFT</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/axKfWQkvxZYNOZ9kVBSt7_HJpkM=/0x0:1114x743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68970280/Screen_Shot_2021_03_15_at_3.56.20_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Elon Musk&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ko8hvU"&gt;Elon Musk is getting in on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFT gold rush&lt;/a&gt; by selling a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1371549960030842893"&gt;new electronic music track&lt;/a&gt; he’s apparently produced as an NFT. Yes, you’ve heard that right — it’s a song about non-fungible tokens, which Musk appears to have minted (or plans to mint) on the blockchain. Musk did not include a link to the NFT, so it’s not clear if it’s already live or if Musk plans to initiate the sale at a later date. It’s also not clear on which platform Musk intends to sell the NFT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfuM9D"&gt;We also don’t know if the song has a name, but we have some clues. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1371549960030842893"&gt;looping video&lt;/a&gt; attached to the song Musk posted to Twitter on Monday displays the words “Vanity Trophy” orbiting around a golden orb affixed to the top of a literal trophy reading “HODL,” short for the phase “hold on for dear life.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HyBl9u"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m selling this song about NFTs as an NFT &lt;a href="https://t.co/B4EZLlesPx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/B4EZLlesPx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1371549960030842893?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CQaUzw"&gt;The HODL acronym, though it’s believed to have potentially originated as a drunken misspelling of the word “hold,” is both online slang and a kind of rallying cry for the bitcoin community, because it ostensibly encourages crypto enthusiasts not to sell their tokens. It’s worth noting here that Musk is a huge proponent of bitcoin. Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272103/tesla-bitcoin-investment-1-5-billion-cryptocurrency-payments"&gt;invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; last month and plans to accept it as form of payment for its electric vehicles in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x8kGe8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8WhCUe"&gt;At various points in the short video, the words along the trophy shift from “computers” to “never sell” while a female vocalist sings lyrics over top like “NFT for your vanity” and “computers never sleep.” Did I mention that the trophy also has little gold dogs, or “doges” if you will, rotating around it, too? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Omobeh"&gt;As for the song itself, well... there’s not a lot to say. It’s loosely a techno song if you want to dig into the genre (with some electro house vibes thrown in), and that’s appropriate considering Musk named himself the “technoking” of Tesla in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331315/elon-musk-tesla-technoking-title-ceo"&gt;real filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission this morning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMwTPG"&gt;It’s not very good, though by the standards of Musk’s previous work in the electronic music scene — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21116427/elon-musk-song-edm-soundcloud"&gt;certifiable not-quite-a-banger “Don’t Doubt ur Vibe”&lt;/a&gt; — I’d say it’s an improvement. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A fan-made fix for GTA Online’s slow load times is actually being added to the game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GTA Online" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ma7ZqbJ4JCcco124CL33sBGllk=/50x0:590x360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68970167/unnamed.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Eu1eS"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online &lt;/em&gt;fan that goes by the moniker t0st &lt;a href="https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/"&gt;posted an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the game’s infamously slow load times on PC, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/hacker-reduces-gta-online-load-times-by-over-70-percent/"&gt;with a solution that improved things&lt;/a&gt; by up to 70 percent. And it seems that Rockstar was playing attention: the company has &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-thanks-gta-online-player-who-fixed-poor-load-times-official-update-coming/"&gt;confirmed to&lt;em&gt; PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that t0st’s fix is legitimate, and it will be implementing their suggestions in a future update to the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCYCC3"&gt;“After a thorough investigation, we can confirm that player t0st did, in fact, reveal an aspect of the game code related to load times for the PC version of &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; that could be improved,” the company commented to &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;. “As a result of these investigations, we have made some changes that will be implemented in a forthcoming title update.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKckin"&gt;According to t0st’s detailed post &lt;a href="https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/"&gt;explaining the issue and their solution&lt;/a&gt;, they were first motivated to explore the problem after noticing that it took nearly six times as long to launch into the online mode for&lt;em&gt; Grand Theft Auto &lt;/em&gt;than it did the story mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpxNv5"&gt;After examining the code of &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; as it launched, t0st determined that a main bottleneck was due to single-threaded CPU processing of a 10MB file that appears to contain a list of every item that can be bought with in-game currency. The fix is twofold: it reduces both the time it takes &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; to check that list and provides a far more efficient method for checking for duplicates by using a hash table. Together, t0st’s fixes managed to cut down load times from roughly six minutes down to just under two minutes on their test machine, an improvement of about 70 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caUgo2"&gt;Rockstar hasn’t said when it’ll be implementing t0st’s updates to the game, but &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; fans frustrated by lengthy load times should hopefully see some relief soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter will soon let you use a security key as your only 2FA method</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bfXYWmJAZML_gypRtluWOgh9y4M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68970117/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c8wiVA"&gt;Twitter is planning a future update that will allow accounts enabled with two-factor authentication to use security keys as the only authentication method, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1371510300973875201?s=20"&gt;the company said on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. At present, you can use a security key to sign in to your Twitter account, but you need to have another 2FA method — like an authenticator app or SMS codes — enabled as backup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJMioX"&gt;While authentication apps like Google Authenticator or Authy are more secure than using SMS codes for 2FA, security keys — physical keys that connect to your computer using USB or Bluetooth — are the most secure way to protect an account online. Users don’t have to type in a code that could be intercepted by a malicious third party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8KgI3"&gt;You connect the key, your browser issues a challenge, then the key cryptographically signs the challenge and verifies your identity. Another benefit of using a security key: users don’t have to give Twitter any additional personal information, such as a telephone number, to be able to log in to their accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TaymK2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Secure your account (and that alt) with multiple security keys. Now you can enroll and log in with more than one physical key on both mobile and web.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And coming soon: the option to add and use security keys as your only authentication method, without any other methods turned on.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1371510300973875201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EmEKbK"&gt;Twitter also said Monday it will allow multiple security keys on a single account; until today, it only allowed one key per account, in addition to the other 2FA methods. In December, Twitter announced it was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334229117978497024"&gt;adding support&lt;/a&gt; for security keys for 2FA-enabled accounts when users log in to its mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpAI2k"&gt;A Twitter spokesperson said Monday there wasn’t a timeline for when security key-only 2FA would take effect. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite Fleet Force bundle includes Peely-themed Joy-Cons for your Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oggc6y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;fans can snag two new Joy-Con controllers when the Fleet Force Bundle arrives June 4th. The set, a blue and yellow Peely-themed Joy-Con also comes with 500 V-Bucks and codes for a glider and pickaxe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J41qCl"&gt;Nintendo hasn’t announced a price for the bundle yet, though most Joy-Con sets go for $79.99. Nintendo released a&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430290/fortnite-special-edition-nintendo-switch-announced-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite-&lt;/em&gt;themed Switch&lt;/a&gt; last year with inverted Joy-Con colors, with the blue controller featuring a Battle Bus image. This new set is the only one yet to include &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s iconic, haunting banana — and now you can have matching banana-themed right and left Joy-Cons, if you so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6S0XZe"&gt;

&lt;p id="6Q6CuP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Chapter 2 of Season 6 begins March 16th. The season is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321323/fortnite-chapter-2-season-6-event-date-cinematic"&gt;kicking off&lt;/a&gt; with an “explosive” event for solo play, in which the “aftermath of this event is sure to shape reality as we know it,” Epic said in a blog post. In the past, Epic has held &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;Marvel-themed&lt;/a&gt; seasons, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233946/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-record-breaking-player-count"&gt;Travis Scott concerts&lt;/a&gt;, and tie-ins to licensed franchises like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291805/chun-li-ryu-fortnite-street-fighter-mortal-kombat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Street Fighter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22276283/fortnite-tron-crossover-skins-light-cycles"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22256564/fortnite-gi-joe-snake-eyes"&gt;G.I.

  &lt;p id="GZFANk"&gt;Over the weekend, some users of NFT marketplace &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/"&gt;Nifty Gateway&lt;/a&gt; said hackers stole digital artwork worth thousands of dollars from their accounts. Some people who were hacked also said their credit cards on file were used to purchase additional NFTs, also costing thousands of dollars, which were then transferred away to a hacker’s account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skTgm8"&gt;Nifty Gateway confirmed in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that some accounts without two-factor authentication had been hacked and that it has been in touch with those affected, but it said it has not seen evidence that its platform was breached. Nifty Giveaway suggests the hackers may have successfully reused login credentials that leaked from other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVthwt"&gt;“We have seen no indication of compromise of the Nifty Gateway platform,” the statement reads. “The Nifty Gateway team is communicating with a small number of users who appear to have been impacted by an account takeover. Our analysis is ongoing, but our initial assessment indicates that the impact was limited, none of the impacted accounts had 2FA enabled, and access was obtained via valid account credentials.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="J4bEoX"&gt;Over the past few weeks, many NFTs have suddenly become high-value assets; Grimes sold a series of 10 digital artworks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22308075/grimes-nft-6-million-sales-nifty-gateway-warnymph"&gt;for around $6 million&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and digital artist &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;Beeple sold an NFT for $69 million at Christie’s&lt;/a&gt;. So it’s unfortunately not altogether surprising that NFT platforms have become targets for hackers looking to steal the digital artworks or take credit card information to buy more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="1TgDlz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kkNksN"&gt;To help prevent future hacks, Nifty Gateway recommends enabling two-factor authentication. “We encourage our users to enable 2FA that we provide on the platform and never reuse passwords,” the statement continued. “We have seen some reports that NFTs involved in these account takeovers were sold in transactions negotiated over Discord or Twitter. We strongly encourage all Nifty Gateway customers to purchase their NFTs on the official Nifty Gateway marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhvmMj"&gt;Given the blockchain-based nature of NFTs, Nifty Giveaway doesn’t have control of an NFT once it is stolen, so it seems unlikely that the affected users will be able to recover their lost collections.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO’s QAnon documentary is a megaphone for extremists — and it’s unbelievably boring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Q: Into the Storm teaser image" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p-PU0R4UPCvL_AWWu1ULLzlPAtw=/147x0:1716x1046/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68969015/Screen_Shot_2021_03_15_at_12.52.09_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;HBO&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZtkmY3"&gt;QAnon has become a nearly inescapable part of politics. The conspiracy is organized around an anonymous figure called Q, who was supposedly operating inside the Trump administration. Using anonymous online message boards, Q has sent a string of cryptic messages about a plan to mass-arrest Democratic politicians and celebrities, who are supposedly kidnapping and murdering huge numbers of children. (They are not.) Q has now spent three years promising imminent arrests, while the QAnon group has become a kind of super-conspiracy theory attracting people from across the world, built around cheering for mass executions and martial law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBw5hI"&gt;On paper, then, unmasking the person (or people) behind Q sounds like a big deal. And that’s the goal of &lt;em&gt;Q: Into the Storm&lt;/em&gt;, an HBO documentary series from director Cullen Hoback. Hoback tracked down some of the people who have supported and popularized QAnon, seeking what HBO calls the “mastermind” behind the theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrKrNF"&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;Into the Storm&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a deconstruction of QAnon so much as a grimy mirror of it. The six-hour series tediously and obsessively charts an alleged inner circle of the movement, while glossing over the myriad reasons that Q’s messages appeal to people, as well as QAnon’s effect on believers and the people around them. It embodies all the ways that idealistic journalistic values — a devotion to humanizing subjects, a goal of exposing powerful wrongdoers, and a belief that exposing truth will set people free — fail in the face of extremist movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="c7WpSO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Imagine ‘Tiger King’, but about forum trolls checking Twitter&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zqJnNy"&gt;Earlier this month, a teaser trailer for Hoback’s series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/28/22304518/hbo-trailer-upcoming-qanon-movie-disinformation-researchers"&gt;drew criticism from anti-disinformation researchers&lt;/a&gt;, who worried it could become a QAnon recruiting tool. The bad news is that &lt;em&gt;Into the Storm&lt;/em&gt; breaks several best practices for reporting on extremism. The good news (I guess?) is that it’s almost so boring it’s unwatchable. Instead of a big-picture overview of QAnon or a meticulous argument for Q’s identity, the series focuses on a handful of feuding message board operators and YouTube (or “QTube”) influencers, documenting them with a combination of formal interviews and interminable slice-of-life scenes. Imagine &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt;, but about forum trolls checking each other’s Twitter feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mYecRd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Into the Storm&lt;/em&gt; is largely about the operators of 8chan (later relaunched as “8kun”), the anything-goes message board where “Q drops” are posted. Hoback spent years visiting the Philippines to speak with 8chan’s creator Fredrick Brennan; its current owner Jim Watkins; and Watkins’ son Ron, the site’s former administrator. &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/men-qanon/story?id=73046374"&gt;Brennan has publicly&lt;/a&gt; — and &lt;a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/llhe5nm"&gt;fairly believably&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/who-is-q-why-people-think-jim-watkins-qanon-8chan-2020-10"&gt;accused the Watkins family&lt;/a&gt; of being potentially behind Q, and Hoback got what appears to be unprecedented access to all of them. For people who study QAnon, gleaning new details from his interviews will be the show’s main draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGHnoB"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Into the Storm&lt;/em&gt; is too aimless to make that access compelling. After the first episode, it becomes mostly a documentary about 8chan in general, including a bitter feud between Brennan and the Watkins family fueled by 8chan’s role in several far-right mass shootings. While some of its subjects claim they’re apolitical, they’re enmeshed in right-wing politics, prone to supposedly ironic bigotry, and extremely cavalier about racist violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Nvab0M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Into the Storm’ takes an approach anti-extremism researchers have warned against&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m5LXed"&gt;The series halfheartedly gestures at how these events tie into larger right-wing politics, including the Watkins’ interactions with QTubers. But huge chunks are devoted to Hoback just hanging out with the trio — covering their blow-by-blow interpersonal drama, lobbing softball questions about 8chan’s many controversies, and letting them pontificate about free speech and their favorite hobbies. The series could be hours shorter if it cut supposedly entertaining scenes like Jim Watkins making fart noises with his hands or explaining how to fill a fountain pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zF7d2F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Into the Storm&lt;/em&gt; is seemingly trying to make QAnon’s best-known players look absurd. Taking that outcome for granted, Hoback barely bothers to rebut their statements or offer outside context, a tactic researchers have spent years discouraging. What some viewers might see as crassness or a bad argument, others could easily buy as charming foibles or a rhetorical triumph. And compared with extremism documentaries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17113514/alt-right-age-of-rage-antifa-film-review-sxsw-2018"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;Alt-Right: Age of Rage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Into the Storm&lt;/em&gt; barely acknowledges that there are forces taking QAnon seriously and trying to counter it — or at least &lt;a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/reddit-qanon-casualties/"&gt;providing support&lt;/a&gt; for the people it’s hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDE3Zh"&gt;The approach also makes Hoback’s hunt for Q seem bizarrely ineffectual. &lt;em&gt;Into the Storm&lt;/em&gt; implies that if you just talk to a bunch of internet trolls for long enough, they’ll slip up and reveal their secrets. So the series’s visible research basically involves training a camera on people who are known to enjoy tricking and manipulating journalists, then asking if they’re Q.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="dXaszg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;QAnon is, at its core, a grift&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L3Fmbe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Into the Storm&lt;/em&gt; touches on one compelling thesis: QAnon is, at its core, a grift. Jim and Ron Watkins admit QAnon is the only thing keeping 8kun afloat, and they have a huge incentive to keep Q on the platform. QTubers seem to truly believe some Q claims, but they also describe being enticed by how QAnon boosted their traffic. Hoback outlines how the theory spread from an obscure forum post through a right-wing influence machine, including former Trump officials like Michael Flynn and prominent media figures like Alex Jones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMjdsO"&gt;But in addition to being padded by hours of 8chan drama, this is all wrapped in a needlessly conspiratorial framing. The series ominously emphasizes officials’ military ties or their links to “psyop” research, when all that often seems necessary is a good handle on viral marketing. It seems remarkably willing to buy subjects’ self-aggrandizing stories, so when a detail &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; seem weird and alarming, it’s hard to separate that from the hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AIUaI"&gt;Hoback touts a big reveal about Q’s identity, or at least the name of one person who has allegedly operated the account. His claim echoes a fairly well-known theory about QAnon, and it’s based on parsing some cagey and noncommittal statements by an interview subject. For the reasons mentioned above, &lt;em&gt;Into the Storm&lt;/em&gt; makes it incredibly hard to evaluate this big reveal — because there’s little to indicate that, say, the subject hasn’t just been messing with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oZwFDY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Does exposing Q actually matter?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sThwxr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Into the Storm&lt;/em&gt; also elides a major issue: exposing Q probably wouldn’t stop QAnon. The movement appeals to long-standing mistrust of powerful institutions, and it’s notoriously resistant to fact-checking or debunking. Since Q’s original posts, it’s insinuated itself into &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/21/904798097/how-qanon-conspiracy-is-spreading-in-christian-communities-across-the-u-s"&gt;Christian churches&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/technology/save-the-children-qanon.html"&gt;anti-sex trafficking campaigns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-55957298"&gt;wellness communities&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93wq73/conspirituality-explains-why-the-wellness-world-fell-for-qanon"&gt;New Age spirituality&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes in ways that don’t even reference Q as a person. The people &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-55090145"&gt;promoting QAnon ideas&lt;/a&gt; aren’t hidden in the shadows; they’ve been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266731/smartmatic-fox-news-lawsuit-rudy-giuliani-defamation-election-disinformation"&gt;speaking on Fox News&lt;/a&gt; and other right-wing networks, while Q goes months without posting. The series references all this — but only as a quick recap of other reporters’ work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYFmcN"&gt;Grasping for a master manipulator sounds like a compelling idea. But if &lt;em&gt;Into the Storm&lt;/em&gt; is any indication, it’s far less interesting than the mundane structures that made QAnon so popular. (Also, a &lt;em&gt;six-hour series&lt;/em&gt; should have room to delve into both.) As a documentary about pro-Trump online extremism, Hoback’s work is adjacent to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21113587/pepe-frog-feels-good-man-matt-furie-trolling-documentary-review-sundance-2020"&gt;last year’s film &lt;em&gt;Feels Good Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which used the Pepe cartoon frog meme to incisively chronicle modern politics’ chaotic weirdness. By contrast, &lt;em&gt;Into the Storm&lt;/em&gt; simply tries to answer a false conspiracy by finding a true one — subjecting viewers to some of the world’s dullest political crusaders along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zRKYY"&gt;Q: Into the Storm&lt;em&gt; premieres March 21st on HBO and HBO Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
