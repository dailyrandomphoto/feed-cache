    <title>Microsoft’s new Windows prompts try to stop people downloading Chrome</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/liXI00Ari8Bt98RdjV3cZYUtOEM=/0x0:1400x933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70218551/chromedownloadprompt.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new Edge prompt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HSCbBW"&gt;Microsoft has never been a fan of Windows users downloading Chrome instead of using Edge, but the company has now stepped up its campaign to keep people using its built-in browser. Windows 10 and Windows 11 have both started displaying new prompts when people navigate to the Chrome download page, in an effort to discourage people from installing Google’s rival browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g61r9E"&gt;These new prompts, &lt;a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-says-its-own-edge-browser-is-more-trustworthy-than-so-2008-google-chrome/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Neowin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, include messages like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aFauYh"&gt;“Microsoft Edge runs on the same technology as Chrome, with the added trust of Microsoft.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="X9zcq6"&gt;“That browser is so 2008! Do you know what’s new? Microsoft Edge.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RQUSSA"&gt;“‘I hate saving money,’ said no one ever. Microsoft Edge is the best browser for online shopping.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8mV_5-eINze3Wr_UoJ-ldVn23cc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23057686/8qTMWBQ.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V4l0iv"&gt;We’ve been able to confirm at least one prompt on a Windows 11 PC, and it appears these new prompts are also appearing for some Windows 10 users, too. These aren’t pop-ups or prompts you’d typically find inside a website, either. They’re rendered natively by Edge, and other websites aren’t able to display similar prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYRoaw"&gt;That makes these a little different from the messages that Google displays when you’re running Edge and use its online services, which appear within webpages when you visit services like Google Search and Gmail. Google uses these to try to encourage users to switch to Chrome over Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDSVS3"&gt;Microsoft’s new prompts come more than three years after the company first started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17850146/microsoft-windows-10-chrome-firefox-warning"&gt;testing ways to warn Windows 10 users&lt;/a&gt; not to install Chrome or Firefox. Those tests were never rolled out publicly, but these prompts are now starting to appear for Windows users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YiYeso"&gt;Microsoft has also been making it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"&gt;harder to switch default browsers&lt;/a&gt; in Windows 11 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21310611/microsoft-edge-browser-forced-update-chromium-editorial"&gt;forcing people into using Edge&lt;/a&gt; through Windows updates. These latest prompts also follow widespread criticism of Microsoft building a “buy now, pay later” tool directly into Edge that prompts users to use a short-term financing service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how Google’s experimental 3D telepresence booth works</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gLMHd3KV4WgZisScTZGP68uDKko=/0x0:760x507/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70218524/msedge_jMrBs47Heb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1nxz6R"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/424ee26722e5863f1ce17890d9499ba9a964d84f.pdf"&gt;new research paper&lt;/a&gt;, Google has detailed the tech behind its impressive Project Starline demo from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442336/google-project-starline-3d-video-chat-platform"&gt;this year’s I/O conference&lt;/a&gt;. Project Starline is essentially a 3D video chat booth that aims to replace a one-on-one 2D video conference call with an experience that feels like you’re actually sitting in front of a real human being. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lwdvsa"&gt;It sounds simple, but Google’s research paper highlights just how many challenges there are in tricking your brain into thinking there’s a real human being sitting just a few feet away from you. Obviously the image needs to be high resolution and free of distracting artifacts, but it also needs to look correct from your relative position in the booth. Audio is another challenge, as the system needs to make it sound like a person’s words are coming from their actual mouth. And then there’s just the small matter of eye-contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcWiOh"&gt;But, eventually, the hope is that Project Starline could offer a similar feeling of presence as virtual or augmented reality, without users needing to wear bulky headsets or trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gGUrOgIq-mIXal6RJTFbRvAMSgs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23057671/msedge_R8BM20N2BK.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The display unit and its various tracking hardware.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rI0rtV"&gt;The paper details exactly how much hardware is needed to start to solve these problems. The system is built around a large 65-inch 8K panel which runs at 60Hz. Around it, Google’s engineers have arranged three “capture pods’’ which are capable of capturing both color imagery and depth data. The system also includes four additional tracking cameras, four microphones, two loudspeakers, and infrared projectors. In total, color images from four viewpoints are captured, as well as three depth maps, for a total of seven video streams. Audio is captured at 44.1 kHz, and encoded at 256 Kbps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhergU"&gt;Obviously all of this hardware generates a lot of data that needs to be transmitted, and Google says that transmission bandwidth ranges anywhere from 30Mbps up to 100Mbps, depending on “the texture detail in the user’s clothes and the magnitude of their gestures.” So it’s significantly more than a standard Zoom call, but nothing a typical office in a metropolitan area couldn’t handle. Project Starline is equipped with four high-end Nvidia graphics cards (two Quadro RTX 6000 cards and two Titan RTX’s) to encode and decode all this data. End-to-end latency reportedly averages 105.8 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1jLhXg0G401kTZqOH2gU4ebQLsQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23057672/msedge_bryqKVi33l.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The system is made up of a backlight unit and display unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G0kJZp"&gt;The way Google tells it, employees who’ve used Starline across the three sites where it’s been installed think it beats traditional videoconferencing when it comes to creating a feeling of presence, personal connection, as well as helping with attentiveness, and reaction-gauging. The company says that over nine months, 117 participants held a total of 308 meetings in its telepresence booths, with an average meeting time of just over 35 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBliVT"&gt;It all sounds very promising, but as yet there’s no indication of when, or even if, the system might one day be commercialized. There’s also very little information about how much Starline’s extensive array of hardware will cost in reality (although Table 4 in the research paper outlines the tracking and display hardware it uses, if you fancy doing some math). For now, Google says it’s expanding Project Starline’s availability “in more Google offices around the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OznqmL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9PRXl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla announces all-electric $1,900 Cyberquad for kids</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FFQAayH9O-SsS_POmUhHgfT4WeY=/131x0:1486x903/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70218448/WFLnzpB.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jmue8g"&gt;Tesla has quietly launched a $1,900 four-wheel ATV for kids. The Cyberquad for Kids is available to order right now &lt;a href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/cyberquad-for-kids"&gt;from Tesla’s website&lt;/a&gt;, and will begin shipping in two to four weeks. The surprise announcement comes more than two year after Tesla announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20977300/tesla-atv-electric-features-range-price-release-date-announcement-elon-musk-all-terrain"&gt;fullsize Cyberquad ATV&lt;/a&gt; to compliment its futuristic Cybertruck. The Cyberquad has not yet shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqG0Zm"&gt;This new pint-sized Cybersquad is designed for kids 8 years old and up, and ones that have parents that can afford to buy them a $1,900 ATV. It includes a steel frame, cushioned seat, and adjustable suspension with rear disk braking. There’s even LED light bars to complete the cyberpunk aesthetics. This all-electric ATV has a top speed of 10mph, and the battery will power up to 15 miles of range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AWPTOH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Out riding with the kids on the Cyberquads! So much fun for kids and adults! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tesla?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@tesla&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/gq23GWsiDk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gq23GWsiDk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Franz von Holzhausen (@woodhaus2) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/woodhaus2/status/1466273823011917825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1qWkge"&gt;There are three speed settings: 5mph, 10mph, and 5mph in reverse. Tesla says it will take up to 5 hours to completely charge, and the battery range can be affected by a user’s weight, the riding terrain, and the speed setting. The Cyberquad for Kids will only ship in the US right now, and Tesla isn’t guaranteeing that the ATV will arrive prior to the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple may have a problem with iPhone demand as well as supply</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r6Pt_bloSZ8pfkCa6qYK5dcV02U=/0x0:2002x1335/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70218007/vpavic_210916_4760_0240.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4oAmLl"&gt;Apple is indicating to its iPhone 13 component suppliers that it may not order as many units as expected due to a drop in demand, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-02/apple-tells-suppliers-iphone-demand-has-slowed-as-holidays-near"&gt;report in Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCBnNe"&gt;While the company had already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723209/apple-iphone-13-chip-shortage-manufacturing-report"&gt;cut&lt;/a&gt; orders for the year to 80 million — down from a target of 90 million — it was reportedly planning to make up for much of the drop next year. Now, though, Apple is said to have told manufacturing partners that this may not happen and they might not see the expected boost in orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpdk2u"&gt;Like almost every other technology company, Apple has been dealing with supply issues brought on by the global semiconductor shortage. CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751418/apple-q4-2021-earnings-supply-constraints-chip-shortage"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the company’s last quarterly earnings took an estimated $6 billion hit due to the shortage as well as the impact of COVID-19 on manufacturing in Southeast Asia, and Apple was expecting an even bigger impact on this current holiday quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UmohO"&gt;If Bloomberg’s report is accurate, though, it suggests that the iPhone 13 range might not meet Apple’s initial expectations even without the supply crunch. The original plan to assemble 90 million units for 2021 reflected a forecast of increased demand, as Apple usually orders around 75 million iPhones for the year of each launch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Federal court blocks Texas law banning ‘viewpoint discrimination’ on social media</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="U.S. Supreme Court Hears Expedited Challenges Over Texas Abortion Ban" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIMopJlwaVLQaeAFBv7W2DQwZ1Y=/0x0:6670x4447/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70217787/1236278969.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nFGSLE"&gt;A federal judge has blocked a Texas law that aimed to limit large social platforms’ ability to moderate content on the grounds that it is likely to violate the First Amendment. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23057162/order.pdf"&gt;The order&lt;/a&gt;, issued by a federal district court in Austin on Wednesday night, granted an injunction proposed by NetChoice and the CCIA that puts the HB 20 law on hold until the conclusion of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuWUTM"&gt;“HB 20’s prohibitions on ‘censorship’ and constraints on how social media platforms disseminate content violate the First Amendment,” determined Judge Robert Pitman in the decision. “Content moderation and curation will benefit users and the public by reducing harmful content and providing a safe, useful service,” Pitman said, explaining why the injunction was beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="jSfCQZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Private companies that use editorial judgment to choose whether to publish content...cannot be compelled by the government to publish other content”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e71Zf1"&gt;“Social media platforms have a First Amendment right to moderate content disseminated on their platforms,” the order reads, citing three separate Supreme Court decisions affirming the principle. “Private companies that use editorial judgment to choose whether to publish content — and, if they do publish content, use editorial judgment to choose what they want to publish — cannot be compelled by the government to publish other content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kLHlw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22661626/texas-social-media-law-hb-20-signed-greg-abbott"&gt;The Texas social media law&lt;/a&gt; bans web services with more than 50 million monthly active users from removing or otherwise limiting content based on the user’s “viewpoint,” among other regulations that are aimed at simultaneously discouraging moderation of controversial posts and requiring faster takedowns of illegal content. It’s intended to fight what Texas politicians have described as unfairly liberal-leaning moderation on sites like Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="v0Jh1c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Content moderation and curation will benefit users and the public”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qU77dG"&gt;But crucially, the court found that this alleged viewpoint discrimination can be cast as editorial discretion, which is protected by the First Amendment. “Without editorial discretion,” the order reads, “social media platforms could not skew their platforms ideologically, as the state accuses of them of doing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDYqa5"&gt;Judge Pitman also objected to rules that required publishing detailed moderation reports. The law’s disclosure rules are “inordinately burdensome given the unfathomably large numbers of posts on these sites and apps,” the order says. It also suggests that the law was intended specifically and unconstitutionally to target sites that politicians saw as anti-conservative, noting a failed amendment that could have lowered the user threshold to cover conservative-friendly sites like Parler and Gab. “The record in this case confirms that the legislature intended to target large social media platforms perceived as being biased against conservative views.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uu2kyC"&gt;NetChoice and the CCIA previously sued over a similar Florida social media law. That rule &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22558086/florida-social-media-theme-park-law-preliminary-injunction-lawsuit"&gt;received a scathing rebuke&lt;/a&gt; from a judge who blocked its implementation in June.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are a go-to pick that’s often on sale&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HYaZ7v"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday may have come and gone, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t any AirPods deals to be had. In October, Apple finally launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third generation of AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, introducing a new AirPods lineup and dropping the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level AirPods from $159 to $129. Since then, we’ve seen many retailers starting to discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We’ve even seen some of the first discounts on the latest AirPods, despite how recently they launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on each model, including the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UJyTOI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"},{"title":"Which AirPods should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFDHZw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10742787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best entry-level &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; (second-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eg29V6"&gt;Once $159, Apple recently lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — to $129. Moreover, it only sells the model with a wired charging case, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. What’s great, though, is that this version frequently gets discounted, so you can buy it for even less. During Black Friday, we saw this model drop to as low as $89. While the price has since increased, you can still find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods discounted down to $109 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and $115 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0lrWhTzc2xyIWSIWPUxqHXoGUkG0HdVMNz%253A%253AT00%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0lrWhTzc2xyIWSIWPUxqHXoGUkG0HdVMNz%253A%253AT00%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodDeals110221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;AirPods (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d2yjBK"&gt;As previously mentioned, the newest pair of wireless earbuds support Apple’s MagSafe technology. The short stems allow for a more subtle design, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiPrKN"&gt;Deals were once hard to come by on the third-gen model given how recently they launched, but we finally started seeing some significant deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday that are still available. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling the $179 earbuds for $150 at checkout, their lowest price yet. &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-3rd-generation%2F510546422" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; is also discounting the third-gen model, but only by $10 or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q2OXRZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iewbkw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S8o5q4"&gt;We think Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price. They have better sound quality than the models above, offer active noise cancellation, and come with a wireless charging case. The earbuds also support Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content, and comes with swappable silicone tips. In addition, they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713126/airpods-pro-conversation-boost-firmware-update"&gt;recently received a firmware&lt;/a&gt; update that added Conversation Boost, an accessibility feature for those who are hard of hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM8uVd"&gt;Additionally, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi"&gt;recently launched a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case that supports Apple’s MagSafe technology, just like the third-gen AirPods. These start at $249, but you can buy them right now for $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or $200 at &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/x9zDqO"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not quite as low as the $159 price we saw this model drop to during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it’s still roughly a $50 discount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="THtgJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, wrapped in aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max were discounted to $429 at Amazon during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, prices have since increased. Still, the Max are currently available in various colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThsYtSLBr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1610235-REG%2Fapple_mgyn3am_a_airpods_max_green.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; for $479, one of their better prices in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s ‘notebook upgrade program’ could get businesses new M1 Macs for $30 per month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="From $30/ Month" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a0rqB5rVch510AifqGVWwXx3bWw=/0x130:1162x905/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70217415/FFXiWQ5VgAcOtih.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Mac notebook upgrade program marketing to apparent business partners | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/MaxWinebach" target="_blank"&gt;@MaxWinebach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZaNwO"&gt;Apple has apparently introduced a business-only program that enables members to obtain and eventually upgrade computers for a relatively low monthly fee. A tweet from writer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MaxWinebach/status/1465326203049414656"&gt;Max Weinbach&lt;/a&gt; shows an image of Apple’s “New Mac Notebook Upgrade Program” promotional material that popped up for a customer with access to a business portal (via &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/29/apple-macbook-upgrade-program-businesses/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GiahGV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The credit application makes clear this is all about the Apple M1 refresh&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXsroC"&gt;The deal appears to be in partnership with CIT Group&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a bank for business customers where this &lt;a href="https://landing.cit.com/mac-upgrade.html"&gt;landing page&lt;/a&gt; for the program shares the monthly rates for different MacBook models — starting with the 13-inch MacBook Air for $30, 13-inch MacBook Pro for $39, 14-inch MacBook Pro for $60, and 16-inch MacBook Pro for $75. Apple did not respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on the details of the program, while CIT Group declined to comment, directing requests for information to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NuLRKU"&gt;The process as listed on the site begins with a standard business financing &lt;a href="https://m1refresh.directcapital.com"&gt;application&lt;/a&gt; — just sign the documents after approval, and then CIT will issue a PO to Apple on the business’s behalf. The application page is titled “Apple M1 Refresh,” which lays bare the intention to push businesses to upgrade from Intel-based Macs to their more powerful and energy-efficient successors. The information available does not clarify whether there are any minimum order amounts involved per organization based on size or the exact path to ownership of these machines if there is one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XJg6lb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;See this is something I'd absolutely subscribe to &lt;a href="https://t.co/QbhtGKGGua"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QbhtGKGGua&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Max Weinbach (@MaxWinebach) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MaxWinebach/status/1465326203049414656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6No9A5"&gt;Typically, organizations with Apple Business and Education (K-12 or Higher Ed) accounts can create a purchase order for devices and accessories using a special Apple Store site. Apple offers these partners financing, but it usually would be for the complete purchase amounts (save for some small discounts). This new Mac upgrade program now gives these organizations an option to &lt;em&gt;lease&lt;/em&gt; MacBooks, though there is no mention if accessories or other computers will be available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="CIT Group’s offer for a ‘Mac Notebook Upgrade Program’" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3vcuiff_fxBpW3hsBmqFlDZw1bk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23056895/mac_upgrade_program.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CIT Group&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;CIT Group’s offer for a ‘Mac Notebook Upgrade Program’&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u7iM1y"&gt;Assuming a small business with five employees needs five MacBook Airs, they could potentially have them for $150 / month (ignoring taxes) but would have to hold on to them for at least 90 days before being able to upgrade. Still, this means that instead of paying $4,995 upfront for the five notebooks, the small business could hang on to them for about 33 months before reaching the full cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPjfdS"&gt;This aligns nicely with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/14/22781752/apple-business-enterprise-mdm-essentials-cloud-storage-security"&gt;Small Business Essentials support package&lt;/a&gt; that Apple announced in November, enabling small startups to get running — and invested in — Apple hardware without spending a lot of money. It doesn’t look like this will lead to something for consumers like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9296849/apple-iphone-upgrade-program-announced"&gt;iPhone Upgrade Program&lt;/a&gt; Apple has offered since 2015. Still, small business employees who carefully eye the annual refresh cycle might get new computers more often.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ubiquiti hack may have been an inside job, federal charges suggest  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nRMNhx2Mn0wLTyaUcRPLIs163-s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70217406/acastro_170621_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RVnR5s"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-employee-technology-company-charged-stealing-confidential-data-and-extorting"&gt;indictment from the Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22226061/ubiquiti-data-breach-email-third-party-unathorized-access"&gt;Ubiquiti hack reported in January&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360409/ubiquiti-networking-data-breach-response-whistleblower-cybersecurity-incident"&gt;subsequent whistleblower claims of a cover-up&lt;/a&gt;, were the work of someone who was then an employee of the company. The DOJ alleges that Nickolas Sharp, 36, was arrested on Wednesday on accusations that he used his employee credentials to download confidential data and sent anonymous demands to the company he worked for pretending to be a hacker in an attempt to get a ransom of 50 Bitcoin. You can read the full indictment below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTRmG1"&gt;The indictment doesn’t specifically name Ubiquiti, only referring to a “Company-1.” However, all the details line up. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22226061/ubiquiti-data-breach-email-third-party-unathorized-access"&gt;Ubiquiti sent an email to users&lt;/a&gt; saying an unauthorized party had accessed its “information technology systems hosted by a third party cloud provider.” In March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360409/ubiquiti-networking-data-breach-response-whistleblower-cybersecurity-incident"&gt;someone claiming to be a whistleblower represented&lt;/a&gt; the incident as “catastrophic,” alleging that the company couldn’t tell the full extent of the attack because it wasn’t keeping logs and that the attacker had access to Ubiquiti’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9C5BoJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The indictment says the scheme fell apart because of a ‘fleeting’ VPN hiccup&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LkvP8I"&gt;The indictment says the company is based in New York, which &lt;a href="https://www.ui.com/contact/"&gt;Ubiquiti is&lt;/a&gt;, and says that the company’s stock price fell by around 20 percent between March 30th and March 31st after news broke of the incident. According to Yahoo Finance, Ubiquiti’s stock was worth $376.78 on March 29th and fell to $298.30 by March 31st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NFOqN"&gt;Perhaps most notable is the allegation that Sharp posed as a whistleblower to media outlets in late March 2021 — the same time a whistleblower &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360409/ubiquiti-networking-data-breach-response-whistleblower-cybersecurity-incident"&gt;accused Ubiquiti of covering up the &lt;/a&gt;data breach’s severity, despite &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/"&gt;the company’s denial that user data was targeted&lt;/a&gt;. We also viewed a LinkedIn profile that appears to belong to Sharp and shows him working for Ubiquiti during the timespan listed in the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a503I8"&gt;The DOJ alleges that Sharp accessed the company’s Amazon Web Services and Github accounts after applying for a job at another company in December 2020. The indictment says that another employee discovered the breach days after Sharp downloaded “gigabytes” of confidential data and applied AWS policies to limit logging. Sharp was allegedly assigned to the response team meant to assess the incident, and the DOJ says he used this position to try and avoid suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="ufbBZb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sharp allegedly contacted media outlets after the FBI searched his house&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hEUq7s"&gt;According to the indictment, Sharp sent an anonymous ransom email that promised not to publish the data and help the company patch a backdoor if he was paid 50 Bitcoin by January 10th, 2021. The DOJ alleges that Sharp released some of the stolen data when the company didn’t pay the ransom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GhdZ05"&gt;The DOJ says that it was able to track down Sharp because of one tiny technical glitch — Sharp allegedly used SurfShark VPN to mask his identity while taking data and sending emails, but “in one fleeting instance,” his real IP was identified and logged as connecting to the company’s GitHub. According to the DOJ, this happened when Sharp’s home internet went down, and then reconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYpb1B"&gt;According to the indictment, this eventually led to the FBI carrying out a search warrant on Sharp’s house, where he denied using SurfShark and said that someone else used his PayPal account to purchase the subscription. In a final twist, the indictment says that Sharp contacted media outlets posing as a whistleblower &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the FBI searched his home and seized electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HndLO5"&gt;If Sharp is found guilty and the DOJ can prove that the incident unfolded as laid out in the indictment, it’ll certainly cast a new light on the reports of the Ubiquiti hack. The indictment alleges that Sharp started the attack using credentials he had been given to do his job. In March, Ubiquiti &lt;a href="https://community.ui.com/questions/Update-to-January-2021-Account-Notification/3813e6f4-b023-4d62-9e10-1035dc51ad2e"&gt;held fast to its statement&lt;/a&gt; that attackers didn’t access customer data, which doesn’t appear to be contradicted by the information revealed today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eZb5P2"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21123826-nickolas-sharp-indictmentpdf/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="nickolas-sharp-indictment.pdf (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Shopify has a ‘textbook pirate’ problem, publishers allege</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="justice-blind5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9FEyxhw4UTqHQQ3auSgWFz7AmXo=/0x5:1100x738/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70217382/blind-justice3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2bIO5o"&gt;Five major publishers have sued Shopify over pirated learning materials like PDFs of ebooks and test materials, saying the e-commerce platform fails to remove listings and stores that violate the publishers’ trademarks and copyrights. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23056830/Shopify_complaint_12.1.21.pdf"&gt;The lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, filed today in the US District Court for Eastern Virginia, claims statutory damages higher than $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4OQaT"&gt;The publishers — Pearson Education, Inc., Macmillan Learning, Cengage Learning, Inc., Elsevier Inc., and McGraw Hill — say in the lawsuit that Shopify “assists and profits from the online sale of infringing copies” of the textbooks and other products. The publishers also say that Shopify has received “detailed notices virtually every week for years” that identify listings selling pirated content and related store URLs but has failed to block sellers from using the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q6j84C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“known repeat infringers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8v6XEY"&gt;According to the publishers, Shopify continues to offer services like storefront building, web hosting, and payment processing to sellers who are known to list pirated content. “Shopify furthers its business model — and bottom line — by enabling known repeat infringers in their continued infringement,” the lawsuit alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ML75FY"&gt;Shopify president Harley Finkelstein &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22417825/shopify-harley-finkelstein-interview-online-shopping-amazon-apple"&gt;has previously said&lt;/a&gt; that if the company sees storefronts that are infringing on a copyright or trademark, it’s removed. But the publishers say anyone looking at the storefronts, including Shopify, can see that they are dedicated to selling pirated textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpdryg"&gt;The publishers also say that Shopify’s failure to control “textbook pirates” hurts their bottom line. Illegal digital copies of textbooks are sold “at a fraction of the price of the legitimate digital textbooks, thus diminishing their perceived value and resulting in lost sales,” the lawsuit alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="km9Ivn"&gt;Textbook piracy, in part, is driven by the soaring prices of learning materials and what critics say allows publishers to maintain a stranglehold on the industry. Textbook costs rose &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2016/college-tuition-and-fees-increase-63-percent-since-january-2006.htm"&gt;88 percent between 2006 and 2016&lt;/a&gt;, according to a study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And though publishers have claimed that digital textbooks make materials more affordable, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/3/6/18252322/college-textbooks-cost-expensive-pearson-cengage-mcgraw-hill"&gt;critics say&lt;/a&gt; ebooks don’t fix the affordability issue because access sometimes expires after a certain date, or they can’t resell them to recoup costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ix4RhC"&gt;Reached for a comment, a Shopify representative said the company makes significant efforts to remove copyright violations. “We have multiple teams that handle potential Acceptable Use Policy violations, including copyright and trademark infringement, and we don’t hesitate to action stores when found in violation,” said Rebecca Feigelsohn. “To date in 2021, over 90% of copyright and trademark reports were reviewed within 1 business day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ghXsl1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated December 1st, 8:59PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to include a statement from a Shopify spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="agoeMK"&gt;Sony’s $9,000 Airpeak S1 drone is now available to order, the company announced Wednesday. It’s expected to ship starting December 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUTuAE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526921/sony-airpeak-s1-drone-cinema-video-acceleration-flight-time"&gt;The Airpeak S1&lt;/a&gt;, which was first teased &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225758/sony-airpeak-drone-alpha-photography-cameras-ces-2021-announcement"&gt;in January at CES 2021&lt;/a&gt;, is targeted toward video professionals and is designed to be used with Sony’s mirrorless cameras. According to the drone’s &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/more/airpeak/p/arss1"&gt;product page&lt;/a&gt;, it has a flight time of 22 minutes without a payload and up to 12 minutes with a “heavy payload,” such as a Sony A7S Mark III camera. Sony says the Airpeak is stable in winds of up to 44.7mph, which could be useful for capturing footage in windy conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NHJbfy"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jnyUPbM9H7Q?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2mzFhY"&gt;The $9,000 price tag comes with two pairs of propellers, a remote controller, two batteries, and a battery charger. It doesn’t include a camera or gimbal, though, which means you’ll have to bring some of your own equipment if you decide to order one. There is a third-party gimbal from Gremsy that’s made for the Airpeak S1, but it’s also &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/more/airpeak/accessories/p/gblt3"&gt;expensive at $2,199.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnNUXu"&gt;Sony plans to sell an optional $300-per-year “Airpeak Plus” cloud subscription, which &lt;a href="https://alphauniverse.com/stories/sony-electronics--airpeak-s1-professional-drone-now-available-to-order/"&gt;will offer&lt;/a&gt; “additional data storage, advanced geofencing options, and import / export of flight logs.” There will also be an “Airpeak Protect Plan” that covers accidental damage, but Sony hasn’t shared how much that will cost. &lt;/p&gt;
