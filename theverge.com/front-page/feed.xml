    <title>‘Sideloading is a cyber criminal’s best friend,’ according to Apple’s software chief</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wVyvU_-XAFY6dXHoDdqHGFmPB2Q=/64x0:706x428/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70087804/Screen_Shot_2021_11_03_at_9.59.39_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DdARwO"&gt;“Sideloading is a cyber criminal’s best friend and requiring that on iPhone would be a gold rush for the malware industry,” according to Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi, who delivered a dramatic speech at &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwstKnhWs6k"&gt;Web Summit 2021&lt;/a&gt; declaiming the security risks if Apple were required to let users sideload apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M23152"&gt;Federighi, who oversees Apple’s iOS and macOS software divisions, was specifically protesting the &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en"&gt;European Commission’s proposed Digital Markets Act&lt;/a&gt;, which, if passed, would require Apple to let users install apps outside of the iOS App Store. According to Federighi, the lack of sideloading is what separates Apple’s relatively low rate of malware on iOS from the “5 million Android attacks per month,” and that if Apple were forced to let users install their own apps, “the floodgates are open for malware.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFEnxF"&gt;Federighi also argues against a popular proposed solution of letting users decide for themselves whether to take the risk of sideloading apps. The problem is that “criminals are clever, and they’re really good at hiding in plain sight,” and that even informed users might get caught by misleading websites, or even get stuck with fake app stores installed on their phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jUn5TT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple is still very much against sideloading&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="llCjh0"&gt;And even if &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, a tech-savvy smartphone expert, might not be fooled, Federighi plays on the heartstrings and asks the audience to think of the children or parents who might be fooled. “The fact that anyone can be harmed by malware isn’t something that we should stand for,” Federighi concludes, despite the fact that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;Apple still routinely deals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;with multimillion-dollar scams&lt;/a&gt; that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22705405/apple-report-a-problem-button-app-store-scams"&gt;only just added the ability to report&lt;/a&gt; in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7BA5H"&gt;Federighi’s picture of doom doesn’t just stop there, though: he also raises the concern that if Apple were to allow sideloading, “some social networking apps will probably try to avoid the pesky privacy protections of the App Store and only make their apps available via sideloading.” According to Federighi, Apple’s privacy requirements in the App Store go beyond those of the letter of the law, and social media companies looking to escape those could force customers to choose between “losing touch with your friends online, or taking on the risks of sideloading.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmjV5j"&gt;“Sideloading undermines security and puts people’s data at risk,” according to Federighi, and that if customers and regulators want the option to sideload apps, the alternative of Android should be enough to meet that without requiring it for iPhones. But all the concerns on iOS are curious, given the other half of his job description: leading the macOS software team, where apps can be freely installed outside of Apple’s app store (and have been for decades) without suffering from apocalyptic malware attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azTcgJ"&gt;If Apple wanted, it could enable iOS sideloading in a similar manner and require something like the Gatekeeper system on macOS, which allows for Apple to check signed developer IDs to confirm the software is genuine. It’s an argument that Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667256/apple-vs-epic-trail-judge-craig-federighi-macos-security-arguments-iphone-ios-response"&gt;noted as well during the Apple / Epic trial&lt;/a&gt;, commenting that Federighi may be “stretching the truth” on Mac malware concerns and that Apple could likely make a similar system work on iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElfKnD"&gt;And most notably, Federighi’s speech completely ignores the fact that by requiring all apps to be installed through the App Store, it forces all app commerce to flow through the App Store, too — where Apple collects its highly contested 30 percent cut, to the tune of billions of dollars every year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix adds a trio of movies from Squid Game director</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qdTXKdKdkAzIo3m-Ii2ccgt0uAM=/480x0:3360x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70087786/SquidGame_Season1_Episode1_00_44_44_16.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gxxjc9"&gt;Hwang Dong-hyuk is known for more than just the Netflix hit Squid Game, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723452/netflix-squid-game-biggest-ever-show-at-launch"&gt;garnered 111 million viewers&lt;/a&gt; in its first 17 days on the service. He previously directed several critically acclaimed South Korean films, three of which Netflix is adding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MTcTXN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Before bringing the visually astounding and socially relevant Squid Game to life, Hwang Dong-hyuk directed several acclaimed South Korean feature films — and now, three of those movies are available on Netflix in The US! &lt;a href="https://t.co/FV0nUQV91D"&gt;pic.twitter.com/FV0nUQV91D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix (@netflix) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1455929209826656259?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PLBnDf"&gt;Based on real events, Dong-hyuk’s &lt;em&gt;Silenced &lt;/em&gt;centers around a teacher who just started working at a school for the hearing impaired. When he discovers that its faculty members have been abusing the students, he works to bring the truth to light, only to realize the surrounding community is willing to cover it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nzjCmC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k3BUIreDAeY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R39UwF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miss Granny&lt;/em&gt; is a lot more lighthearted when compared to &lt;em&gt;Squid Gam&lt;/em&gt;e&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Silenced&lt;/em&gt;, following a 74-year-old woman who escapes her future of confinement at a retirement home in an unusual way. After wandering into a strange photo studio and getting her picture taken, she walks out as a 20-year-old woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UJtY0R"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gdhX0tM0mOg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wCIBZL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fortress&lt;/em&gt; is the most recent of the three, coming out in 2017. It transports you all the way back to 17th century Korea during the Qing invasion of Joseon, when King Injo and his court are forced to retreat into a fortress known as Namhansanseong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F51Y7H"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EYsv-rSW3n0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UF1ZXS"&gt;All three of these films are available on Netflix for viewers in the US. While they may not reach the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704313/sk-broadband-netflix-suing-for-payment-squid-game"&gt;level of popularity that &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; has&lt;/a&gt;, they may help hold us over while we wait for season two.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s colorful HomePod Minis are a fun addition to your smart home decor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5wy-pGeNtFTeKSbgtMx2DlUJupc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70087598/jtuohy_211102_4860_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s HomePod Mini now comes in three new color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Eaq9PQ"&gt;Three colorful HomePod Minis were announced last month and went on sale this week, adding yellow, orange, and blue options to our smart speaker home decor selections. I got to try out the trio of bright speakers, and have to say I quite like adding a pop of color to my smart home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yq3o9S"&gt;Apple is a bit behind the ball here; both Google and Amazon have had color choices for their smart speakers for a while now. The Nest Minis come in coral and light blue colors, and Amazon’s Echo speakers have blue, tiger orange, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688035/billie-eilish-echo-studio-price-release-date-preorder"&gt;Billie Eilish-beige&lt;/a&gt; options. But as usual, Apple has gone the extra mile with its design here, creating something quite genuinely delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0A7k9z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10844191"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PatSkt"&gt;Each $99 HomePod Mini comes with a matching colored box and a different shimmering, shimmying Mini logo, presumably mimicking the sounds your HomePod will deliver courtesy of that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734185/new-apple-music-voice-plan-price-features-app"&gt;Apple Music Voice subscription&lt;/a&gt; you’re planning to use it with (right?). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDj2ub"&gt;The braided USB-C power cable (which still can’t be removed) is color-coordinated with the speaker and is a pastel version of the main event. The volume up and down buttons on the white control plate perfectly match the Mini’s color. Also — and this is very Apple — when you set up the Mini using your iPhone, the graphic that pops up matches the color of the Mini you’re pairing (actually useful when you are setting up three different colors at once).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u9IiJJ3GuT9P9EWnmpUzMpvklfE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982938/jtuohy_211102_4860_0030.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each pod comes with matching control buttons and a color-coordinated cord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UQlyvd"&gt;Speaking of those colors, they are a lot more impressive in person. When they were first announced at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22723141/apple-homepod-mini-new-colors-price-release-date-features"&gt;Apple’s fall hardware event&lt;/a&gt;, my initial thought was they were a bit underwhelming. Orange and yellow aren’t top of mind when it comes to interior design color choices, although they are great for the odd “pop” of color. And the blue looked so dark as to not be that dissimilar to the existing dark grey option. Also, where were the green and red, Apple?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G0DJJsvzAD8e8HxGqd7Jz5S6H4o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982935/jtuohy_211102_4860_0019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was able to color coordinate my Samsung Frame TV with the new HomePod Minis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XnnwlC"&gt;Once I got my hands on the speakers, though, and tried them out in a few different situations around the house, I found I had plenty of spots where they could fit right in. Although, admittedly, it was primarily in my children’s rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJ7zkr"&gt;The yellow is very bright, definitely lemon on the color wheel, and the orange has a much more blood orange, reddish hue — closer to coral than the fruit Florida is famous for. However, next to a coral-colored Nest Mini, it pops a bit more and there is no hint of pink. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/15q4S8AN58suscRPYdvrOSbmvoE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982926/jtuohy_211102_4860_0008_cropped.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6l95h9MpukTcMRY9-UgFOqiIG74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982930/jtuohy_211102_4860_0010_cropped.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vvkDsR_QJ_Bd_NjyVoX4ORrWdxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982928/jtuohy_211102_4860_0009_cropped.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j09WB9IEkMSbLvpBZWkIAnxX2pQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982933/jtuohy_211102_4860_0014.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Orange, yellow, blue, and the threesome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YlfJU2"&gt;The blue is my favorite (likely because I just redid my kitchen and chose dark blue cabinets, so it is the perfect fit there). It’s a deeply rich, almost royal blue and really pretty. The blue also doesn’t show as much shadow through the mesh, something that gives the brighter colors a bit of a muddy look when you get up close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ni8BjgsqbkTC-EyualirjXAqp7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982941/jtuohy_211102_4860_0038.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The blue HomePod Mini is a perfect match in my kitchen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gKIuIj"&gt;One advantage of these colors, and the dark grey option, over the white Mini, is they are less likely to start greying as they collect dust and dirt, something that’s been noticeable on the white version in my testing. Clearly, we need a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733198/apple-polishing-cloth-clean-devices"&gt;special Apple cleaning cloth&lt;/a&gt; for our HomePods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utt0Bb"&gt;The new HomePod Minis are identical in function to the existing models. They work with Siri, can use your iPhone to make calls and send messages, act as a hub for your HomeKit home, and set alarms and timers. We will be testing them out shortly though, to explore some of the features added since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;our first review&lt;/a&gt;. They ship with software version 15.0, so you will need to upgrade to 15.1.1 out of the box to take advantage of new features such as spatial audio and lossless music with Apple Music. &lt;/p&gt;

Whittaker may be best known for helping to organize a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18057716/google-walkout-20-thousand-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai-meeting"&gt;2018 walkout at Google&lt;/a&gt;, where 20,000 employees protested against how the company handled alleged sexual harassment, and for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20695964/google-protest-leader-meredith-whittaker-leaves-company"&gt;leaving Google afterward&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512413/google-employees-walkout-organizers-retaliation-punishment"&gt;retaliated against her and other organizers&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the FTC seems to be in the process of hiring her to help shape regulations around AI and Big Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqcmYK"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;, Whittaker hasn’t been officially appointed yet, as steps like running a background check aren’t complete. If she is hired, though, she’ll bring a good deal of experience — she worked at Google &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/onward-another-googlewalkout-goodbye-b733fa134a7d"&gt;from 2006 to 2019&lt;/a&gt; and has done work around AI ethics since leaving the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RFaEuu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Whittaker accused Google of only caring about the appearance of ethics debate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xQp8u1"&gt;Besides helping with the walkout, Whittaker also advocated for Google to stop building AI for the military and spoke out against its ethics reviews, saying that it only gave the “appearance of an inclusive debate, rather than seriously contending with the problems in the company.” Upon leaving the company, she said that it was “clear” that it wasn’t a place where she could work toward tech accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wsa4S"&gt;Whittaker has also dealt with difficulties in the public sphere — she worked on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/15/18309437/new-york-city-accountability-task-force-law-algorithm-transparency-automation"&gt;New York City’s algorithm task force&lt;/a&gt;, which was designed to make sure that the city’s automated systems were equitable and had appropriate oversight and transparency. When NYC ended up releasing the report, though, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974379/nyc-algorithm-task-force-report-de-blasio"&gt;she called the effort “a waste,”&lt;/a&gt; echoing concerns raised by other members that dissenting opinions weren’t taken seriously or included. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XoNm1o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FTC has struggled to regulate Big Tech but now appears to be gearing up for a fight&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nKc6uW"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; points out, though, there are signs that the FTC could be a more hospitable place for her ideas if she actually ends up working there. The regulator’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;new chair, Lina Khan&lt;/a&gt;, has said she wants to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690176/ftc-chair-lina-khan-focus-antitrust-consumer-amazon"&gt;focus attention on tech giants and antitrust&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557456/amazon-lina-khan-recusal-petition-federal-trade-commission-antitrust"&gt;Amazon has even requested&lt;/a&gt; that she not be involved in cases involving the company because of her past statements about breaking it up. The current administration seems serious about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671880/biden-alvaro-bedoya-privacy-ftc-commissioner-facial-recognition"&gt;nominating experts to work at the agency&lt;/a&gt;, which has struggled to regulate Big Tech in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8O3CH"&gt;If the FTC is looking to bring on industry veterans like Whittaker, it could be a further sign that the agency is getting serious about regulating Big Tech. It could help give some say to people who have the technical knowledge and firsthand experience working at companies like Google, Amazon, Apple, or Meta, even if efforts to change things from within were largely ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Starlink delays orders by years for unlucky customers who played with the site’s digital map</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qcmr106brLmwJoWqt3fQfr9vhgA=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70087362/npatel_20210512_4552_0048.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nilay Patel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HOVnm4"&gt;It was an exciting moment when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;Starlink&lt;/a&gt; rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274385/musk-spacex-starlink-deposit-price-satellite-internet"&gt;preorders for its satellite internet service&lt;/a&gt; in February since it can potentially provide faster speed and better service to those in rural areas or with spotty internet access. But a single feature on the Starlink site is causing preorders to be delayed by years and there appears to be no fix in sight, an issue first spotted by &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/11/starlink-nightmare-moving-service-location-a-few-feet-delays-orders-until-2023/?utm_brand=arstechnica"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="urIvIG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you don’t already have service and move your address you go straight to the back of the line”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6RreHm"&gt;According to the report, some users on the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/"&gt;r/Starlink&lt;/a&gt; subreddit moved their service area by just a few feet using the digital map tool on the site and wound up having their preorder dates moved from late 2021 to as far as 2023. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/qiiprb/comment/hijupd9/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;One user&lt;/a&gt; wrote, “I moved it from the end of my driveway to my house this morning and just looked back and it had changed to 2022-2023.” In the same conversation, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/qiiprb/comment/hikyhmy/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;another noted&lt;/a&gt;, “I moved the location from my barn to my house which is literally 13 feet in real-time and now I'm mid to late 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5D6JN"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; notes, the map tool was always on the site, but Starlink recently made some changes to the site’s layout and also removed any mention of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/18/22681185/spacex-ceo-elon-musk-starlink-internet-service-leaving-beta-october"&gt;Starlink being in beta&lt;/a&gt;. The update seemed to have pushed the map tool to a more prominent location and also gave users a notification to check their location for “accuracy.” Naturally, anyone excitedly checking the status of their preorder would feel inclined to change their service location if they noticed an error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0So8qk"&gt;Apparently, this type of preorder delay with Starlink isn’t a new issue either — it’s just been become more common due to the new map location. Another &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/qhhcln/comment/hicr9id/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Reddit user&lt;/a&gt; says “people here have been warning others about it for nearly a year now. If you don’t already have service and move your address you go straight to the back of the line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmW7QC"&gt;Elon Musk’s vision for Starlink is a grand one, and yet, it’s small issues like these that undermine the service’s potential. Customer service issues aren’t a new thing among Musk-owned brands — &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/11/teslas-biggest-problem-is-customer-service-new-bernstein-survey.html"&gt;Tesla is notorious for having poor customer service&lt;/a&gt;, and Starlink isn’t following far behind. In September, frustrated &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-starlink-customers-angry-service-contact-order-update-internet-2021-9"&gt;Starlink customers said that they were unable to reach the company&lt;/a&gt; to check the status of their orders months after their purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhCihv"&gt;Customers who’ve fallen victim to the temptation of moving their service area have also been contacting Starlink via email — but to no avail. Musk is rushing to expand space exploration and define an era of electric vehicles, but some of his customers here on Earth would just like a response to their emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1ejDD"&gt;We reached out to SpaceX about the situation but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pegasus spyware group blacklisted by the US government</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p3YQKyL4wZ6dVUIKV5QSVPI99P4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70087272/acastro_170621_1777_0006_v2.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qnK4hM"&gt;The US Department of Commerce has ordered American companies to not sell their tech to NSO, citing reports that the group’s Pegasus spyware is used against journalists, government officials, activists, and more. In &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/11/commerce-adds-nso-group-and-other-foreign-companies-entity-list"&gt;its press release&lt;/a&gt;, the regulator says that the company is being added to the Entity List because its tool threatens “the rules-based international order” when its sold to repressive foreign governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haRssy"&gt;Pegasus is a program designed to infect targets without notice, allowing police and intelligence agencies to get access to a phone’s text messages, photos, and passwords, all without leaving a trace. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported in July that the spyware could infect someone’s phone with a single, invisible text message: a target wouldn’t have to click on a link or take any action for their fully updated phone to be infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLgsUy"&gt;NSO’s Pegasus spyware was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"&gt;recently in the spotlight&lt;/a&gt; because of The Pegasus Project, a collection of journalists who revealed a list of names seemingly connected to the spyware. That list included journalists, activists, heads of state, and others from across the globe, people that NSO says its software shouldn’t be used to target. The Pegasus Project also analyzed a handful of journalists’ phones and found evidence that the spyware had been installed on them — almost certainly by a government agency, as NSO says those are the only clients it’ll sell its software and services to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="06keV7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NSO’s Pegasus spyware: here’s what we know","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NFmL4Z"&gt;Pegasus had made headlines before this year, too. Journalists in Mexico were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/19/15828934/spyware-nso-group-mexico-journalists-activists-citizen-lab"&gt;reportedly targeted with the tool&lt;/a&gt;, WhatsApp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20938676/whatsapp-nso-group-spyware-hack-encrypted-chat-lawsuit"&gt;sued NSO&lt;/a&gt; for using an exploit in the messaging app to hack people’s phones, and the FBI is said to have at least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21117180/fbi-bezos-hack-amazon-saudi-arabia-nso"&gt;looked into the company in relation to Jeff Bezos’ phone being hacked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ztiMbQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NSO says it can’t target US-based phone numbers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O1BEtv"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-24123.pdf"&gt;Department of Commerce says&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) that NSO being added to the entity list, which restricts US companies from exporting products to it because the company “poses a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities that are contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VkvPXU"&gt;This likely relates to US affairs outside its actual borders — NSO has said that its tool can’t be used to target American phone numbers, and the Department of Commerce and Pegasus Project haven’t contested that fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fRMVo"&gt;NSO isn’t the only company being added to the entity list on Thursday. Candiru, another Israeli IT firm that sells spyware (that’s &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/"&gt;reportedly used for similar purposes&lt;/a&gt;), is also being blacklisted. The Department of Commerce cited two more companies — one from Russia and one from Singapore — that it says are involved in selling hacking tools.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram and Twitter finally make link previews work again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jGS4qXJxgqjPAEBjUJsh8MgpQFA=/186x0:2196x1340/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70087067/FDSQYWzVgAA0cEV.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Instagram link preview on Twitter.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nADVI2"&gt;The ice is thawing on a nine-year internet feud. When you share Instagram links on Twitter, you’ll see a preview of the link that includes an image instead of just the URL text starting on Wednesday. The feature is rolling out on Android, iOS, and the web. I didn’t see a preview when I tried sharing an Instagram post on my Twitter feed, so it might not work for you just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmwhoZ"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1455947657067782148"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1455952061665841157"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; are promoting the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JElmOu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They said it would never happen… Twitter Card previews start rolling out TODAY.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, when you share an Instagram link on Twitter a preview of that post will appear.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/XSZRx9dzd1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XSZRx9dzd1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Instagram (@instagram) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1455947657067782148?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="posCzT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you want to share your latest Instagram post on the Twitter timeline too, you’re in luck: now when you share a link to an IG post in a Tweet, it’ll show up as a card with a preview of the photo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rolling out on Android, iOS, and web.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1455952061665841157?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8u6Ikb"&gt;Instagram turned off the ability to see previews of posts on Twitter after it was acquired by Meta (formerly Facebook) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/9/2936375/facebook-buys-instagram"&gt;in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. Kevin Systrom, Instagram’s founder and former CEO, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/05/kevin-systrom-on-pulling-twitter-cards-integration-we-want-images-viewed-on-instagram-com/"&gt;said that the decision was his&lt;/a&gt;, not Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s. Instagram wasn’t the only party that made changes limiting Instagram and Twitter’s integration, though; Twitter removed a feature that let you find people you follow on Instagram, on Twitter, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/26/no-api-for-you-twitter-shuts-off-find-friends-feature-for-instagram/"&gt;a few months after&lt;/a&gt; the acquisition was announced.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook skirts Apple’s App Store fees with custom subscription links for creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QzAtrnUON_Qk07K-Zz7IZQcIz0c=/0x150:900x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70087032/250777847_389387596230472_4377046633797999619_n.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IuaHwK"&gt;Facebook has found a way to skirt Apple’s 30 percent tax on in-app transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjdpM6"&gt;On Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook parent company Meta, announced that creators will &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/earn-money-with-subscriptions"&gt;soon be able to share custom web links&lt;/a&gt; directing their fans to pay them for subscriptions using Facebook’s native payments system. If a fan signs up through the link rather than Apple’s in-app subscription, the creator will keep all of the money minus taxes. Facebook subscription feature, which lets creators charge on a reoccurring basis for access to exclusive content, is available in 27 countries and accessible to creators who meet certain eligibility requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djqG5H"&gt;Facebook is operating in a gray zone under Apple’s rules for the App Store, though a spokesperson said the social network believes its approach has always been allowed on iOS. The App Store currently forbids iOS apps from offering alternative payment options for purchasing digital goods, but in this case, it’s the creator, not Facebook, the app developer, that will be sending people to pay for a subscription on the web. The spokesperson for Facebook confirmed the social network isn’t removing the ability for users to sign up for a creator subscription using Apple’s native payments system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TV8qp4"&gt;“As we build for the metaverse, we’re focused on unlocking opportunities for creators to make money from their work,” Zuckerberg said &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/4/posts/10114044739955341/?d=n"&gt;in a Facebook post&lt;/a&gt;. “The 30 percent fees that Apple takes on transactions make it harder to do that, so we’re updating our Subscriptions product so now creators can earn more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="c62oKO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook will start paying creators a bonus of between $5 and $20 for every new subscriber they add using their custom web link&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oCz6Pb"&gt;In addition to not collecting a cut of subscription transactions until at least 2023, Facebook will start paying creators a bonus of between $5 and $20 for every new subscriber they add, regardless if they pay through the custom web link or through Apple and Google’s systems. An earnings calculator will show creators on Facebook a breakdown of their earnings and fees, including how much they pay to Apple and Google. And starting in December, Facebook creators will be able to download the emails of their subscribers directly from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFJfMk"&gt;Facebook is taking advantage of cracks that are starting to show in Apple’s grip on iOS app payments. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;recently settled a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; with developers by agreeing to let them directly email customers about alternative payment options and is facing even more restrictions after its high-profile lawsuit with Epic Games. At the close of that case, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;judge ordered&lt;/a&gt; Apple to allow developers to link to outside payment methods, giving the company until December 9th to comply. Apple has asked for a stay while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22717271/apple-appeals-epic-games-ruling-anti-steering"&gt;the ruling is appealed&lt;/a&gt;, but the judge has yet to rule on the stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LNhxE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 3rd, 3:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story incorrectly said that Facebook will only pay creators a new subscriber bonus if someone signs up through the web. Facebook will pay a bonus regardless of where someone signs up for a subscription. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create a signature for PDF documents on a PC </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Surface Laptop Go on a table angled slightly to the left." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UZ9mdUxw-DkKVmIqP29-0LLQBPA=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68948215/twarren-surfacelaptopgo-7.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ALZBsW"&gt;These days, more and more official papers are being turned into PDF documents. (PDF stands for Portable Document Format; it is a standard created by Adobe in the early 1990s that allows paper documents to be turned into exact digital copies.) In fact, hard copy paperwork is fast becoming the exception rather than the rule. However, even digital documents have to be signed. You can do it the long way — print those documents out, sign them, and then scan them back into your computer — or you can create a digital signature and place it directly on the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isjki5"&gt;Windows doesn’t offer a built-in PDF signing feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321383/signature-pdf-mac-pdf-how-to-preview"&gt;the way a Mac does&lt;/a&gt;. However, you can use Windows’ built-in browser, Microsoft Edge, to sign a PDF document. There are also third-party apps you can download that will give you the same ability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7Ufzw"&gt;In this article, I’ll first go over how to use Edge to add a signature, and then I’ll do the same using Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, which is Adobe’s free PDF reader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="48UahT"&gt;Use Microsoft Edge to create a signature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="XaiP5q"&gt;Find your PDF file in the file manager. Right-click on the file and open it using Microsoft Edge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SWoqip"&gt;The file will open in Edge’s PDF reader. Click on the Draw icon (it looks like a pencil facing downward).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QRckNJ"&gt;If you’ve got a touch screen, it will automatically enable the Draw with Touch option (the icon looks like a hand)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QSXp8u"&gt;Use your cursor (or, if you’ve got a touch screen, your finger) to sign the PDF, and then save the document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can sign a PDF in Edge, but you can’t save your signature." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CliD63oM5Q0McFJa_BSdzTsDbV0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982850/Screenshot__133_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can sign a PDF in Edge, but you can’t save your signature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TrnRXm"&gt;While this is a good, quick way to sign a PDF document, it means you have to go through the same process every time. It would be a lot simpler if you could simply pop your signature into the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pecqMl"&gt;One way to do this is to write a signature, photograph it, and download it as a PDF or graphic file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HKFLZW"&gt;Use Adobe Acrobat Reader DC to create a signature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="SgeMF3"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fget.adobe.com%2Freader%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22323097%2Fpdf-signature-windows-pc-adobe-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Download Adobe Acrobat Reader DC&lt;/a&gt;. Adobe has the unfortunate tendency to encourage people to download excess apps, so make sure you uncheck all the additional installations that may pop up on the page: in my case, it was two McAfee apps and Acrobat’s Chrome extension. (You can install this last one later if you think it might be useful.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fyH4Ve"&gt;After you click on “Download Adobe Reader,” you can start the install by clicking on the downloaded .EXE file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s a good idea to uncheck Adobe’s promotional offers before downloading Acrobat Reader" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/niGsIsy1D5YvmE7KouzVOkm-ru0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360298/adobe1___Copy.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a good idea to uncheck Adobe’s promotional offers before downloading Acrobat Reader.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="BW88IR"&gt;Once it’s installed, Acrobat Reader will open. Look for “Fill &amp;amp; Sign” in the main window. Click on that and then on “Select a File” to choose a PDF file to work on. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on “Fill &amp;amp;amp; Sign” and then on “Select a File” to choose a PDF file to work on. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/854NWSY_k8elQZvVSYH6tDAZa9Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982492/Screenshot__121_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on “Fill &amp;amp; Sign” and then on “Select a File” to choose a PDF file to work on. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="71mubA"&gt;Alternatively, you can open the file first (by going to “File” &amp;gt; “Open”) and then scroll down to “Fill &amp;amp; Sign” in the app’s right-hand column. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HoZ2ay"&gt;A new window will invite you to “Fill and sign forms or get them signed from others.” Click on the “Select a File” button and choose your document from the file manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A new window will invite you to “Fill and sign forms or get them signed from others.” " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/67nslT3k5p_v7drOHUSh2qc4jI8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982500/Screenshot__122_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new window will invite you to “Fill and sign forms or get them signed from others.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="r5zYEz"&gt;Before your documents come up in Acrobat, you will probably get a pop-up that invites you to “Get documents signed fast with Adobe Sign,” which lets you send out up to two documents for signatures every 30 days for free; if this is something you want to do more often, it will cost you $120 annually for the “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fsign%2Fpricing%2Fplans.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22323097%2Fpdf-signature-windows-pc-adobe-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Acrobat PDF Pack with e-sign&lt;/a&gt;.” For now, you can remove the pop-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="R3cvjj"&gt;Your document will come up in Acrobat. There should be a small “Ab” next to your cursor; if not, check to make sure the “Fill &amp;amp; Sign” icon on the right is highlighted. This will let you sign by typing your name into your form. If you want to sign by actually drawing your signature or save a typed or drawn signature, tap on “Sign yourself” in the icon above the main screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Add Signature.” Once you’ve saved your signature, it will appear on this drop-down menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lImQxdduh6w81mRdMHEHpwnt25I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982506/Screenshot__126_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Add Signature.” Once you’ve saved your signature, it will appear on this drop-down menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JdYWBB"&gt;You will have the option to “Add Signature” or “Add Initials.” For now, click on “Add Signature.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EdgQjv"&gt;A pop-up window will give you three ways to sign your document: type your name (Adobe supplies you with several handwritten-looking fonts), draw your signature (either using your touchpad or directly on a touchscreen), or upload an image of your signature. Make sure “Save signature” is checked if you don’t want to have to write it again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are several ways you can create a signature" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HGmXg75kGQyZue77CYS5TfEVabI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360374/adobe7.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are several ways you can create a signature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ImiYmj"&gt;Once you’ve hit “Apply,” your PDF document will be back. Place your new signature where you want it on the document and left-click. You can then change the size or placement of the signature if you wish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Now place your signature where you want it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lAy1LTw9E94MjePMZFsXxhfX6wI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982513/Screenshot__129_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now place your signature where you want it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ldRjRL"&gt;And you’re done! Now, if you want to add your signature to a PDF, just open your document using Adobe Acrobat Reader and click on the “Sign yourself” icon. You can then select your saved signature and place it where you need it on your PDF document. (The “Add Initials” option works just the same but gives you less space, so you can only add initials.) If you want to change your signature, just click the “minus” sign next to the signature and try again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your signature is now available whenever you need it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F8nuPxlBO8ti2jgE7a3pCbIoOH0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982516/Screenshot__131_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your signature is now available whenever you need it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ojzgTu"&gt;Adobe Acrobat Reader DC is, of course, not the only app that you can use to read and / or edit a PDF document. There are a variety of other apps out there with free versions that will let you do basic PDF work, such as &lt;a href="https://app.hellosign.com/info/pricing?_ga=2.98293343.1191478015.1615406363-173908718.1615236989"&gt;HelloSign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://smallpdf.com/sign-pdf"&gt;eSign&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.signwell.com/"&gt;SignWell&lt;/a&gt;. However, most of those free versions come with limitations — for example, SignWell lets you sign up to three documents a month, while eSign lets you process up to two documents per day. Adobe Reader doesn’t have any limitations on your ability to sign documents, but if you want to create a PDF or export it to another format, you’ll have to get the Pro version.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adidas reveals a new, Xbox 360-inspired sneaker that you can actually buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XzW7FQnCK2uq170LbqOTZGVSRpA=/8x0:6008x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70086840/The_Xbox_360_Forum_Mid_01_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5lSXxn"&gt;Microsoft is continuing to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Xbox in style this year with a second themed Adidas sneaker: &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/11/03/xbox-360-adidas-sneaker/?ocid=Evergreen_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Video_lrn_11.3.1"&gt;the Xbox 360 Forum Mid&lt;/a&gt;, which, as the name suggests, is inspired by the company’s second console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9peG1"&gt;The Xbox 360 design follows the first Xbox / Adidas collaboration, announced in October which took inspiration from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712418/adidas-xbox-sneakers-trainers-microsoft"&gt;original Xbox console&lt;/a&gt;. The Xbox 360 Forum Mid, however, is decked out in the 360’s white, silver, and green color scheme for a 2005-era look, complete with plenty of subtle details that reference the original design. The velcro strap, for instance, is emblazoned with the disc tray from the 360, while the air vents and Xbox button are featured on the outside. Even the heel is designed to look like the memory card and hard drive slots. The shoe will come with red, yellow, green, and blue laces, to represent the A, B, X, and Y buttons on the 360 controller, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UYUaItipYO5ePnjGaqAEl3frSuo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982984/The_Xbox_360_Forum_Mid_03_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dWt7uZ"&gt;Microsoft and Adidas are also teasing that a third model — inspired by the Xbox Series X — will be announced on November 15th at its celebratory stream for the 20th anniversary of Xbox and &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; to close out the sneaker trilogy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqxk2v"&gt;And unlike the original Xbox collaboration (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22735619/xbox-adidas-sneaker-stockx-20th-anniversary"&gt;which was a limited edition for giveaways&lt;/a&gt;), the Xbox 360 Forum Mid will actually be available to purchase. The sneaker is set to be available in the US and Canada on November 4th at 7AM PT / 10AM ET on Adidas’ website, although there’s no word on price yet. That said, if demand is anything like it is for the next-gen Xbox Series X, Series S, and even the Xbox mini-fridge, you’ll probably need a healthy dose of luck to snag a pair. &lt;/p&gt;
