    <title>Elon’s SNL monologue poked fun at his public persona</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VB4_jXkn-O-E__8jFesTkXrfk8g=/127x0:1534x938/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69258685/Screen_Shot_2021_05_08_at_8.59.18_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Elon Musk on Saturday Night Live | NBC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9eLZTc"&gt;Elon Musk opened his hosting gig on &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; by acknowledging his public comments get him in trouble. “Sometimes after I say something I have to say ‘I mean that,’” he said. He pointed to his “69 days after 4/20 again haha” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1277359833721655302?lang=en"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, but didn’t mention the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/27/17911428/sec-lawsuit-elon-musk-tesla-funding-tweet"&gt;2018 tweet&lt;/a&gt; that got him in hot water with the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UTdrz"&gt;Musk said he was the first person with Asperger’s to host &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; — something he hasn’t said publicly before. It did not appear he was joking, but it was a bit difficult to be sure how sincere Musk was being, given his history as both an internet troll and someone who doesn’t always know how to deliver a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXY4lC"&gt;The Tesla and SpaceX CEO joked that people sometimes don’t know what to expect from him. “I reinvented electric cars and I’m sending people to Mars on a rocket ship,” Musk said. “Did you think I was going to be a chill, normal dude?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYP9Mx"&gt;Musk said his famous appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast where he smoked weed wasn’t his usual habit. And he appeared to relish the live audience: “I could say something truly shocking like ‘I drive a Prius.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpnzQB"&gt;He also said the name of his youngest child, spelled X Æ A-12 is “pronounced ‘cat running across keyboard.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnMkmH"&gt;Musk’s mother Faye also made an appearance during the monologue. “I’m excited for my Mother’s Day gift, I just hope it’s not Dogecoin,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wc4PYn"&gt;To which Elon replied “it is.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Every other EV brand showed up to Elon Musk’s SNL</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W56DOwvwpRzccVnxOh5B23UOv3I=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69258657/E0zpPE0XoAECxyP.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sfPNsz"&gt;At least five of Tesla’s competitors bought ad time during &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; hosted by Elon Musk, using the billionaire’s appearance to sell their own. non-Tesla EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmgu7I"&gt;Commercials for the Audi E-tron, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Volkswagen ID 4, and Lucid Air all aired within the first 30 minutes of &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt;. Lucid Motors, a company founded by Peter Rawlinson, the former head engineer of the Tesla Model S who &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/505126/elon-musk-tweet-rawlinson-not-chief-engineer/"&gt;frequently clashes with Musk&lt;/a&gt;, teased its commercial earlier in the week. It was its debut commercial for the Lucid Air, a claimed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21358613/lucid-motor-air-electric-vehicle-ev-range-517-miles"&gt;500-mile EV&lt;/a&gt; due later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PDfG6j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Guess who is making an appearance during &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SNL?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SNL&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LucidAir?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#LucidAir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Firstto500?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Firstto500&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/aXquKSEND6"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aXquKSEND6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lucid Motors (@LucidMotors) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LucidMotors/status/1390742832751779847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8kgEr8"&gt;In his opening monologue, Musk noted he’s the guy who made electric vehicles popular. The commercials were intended to remind the audience that Tesla isn’t the only name in the game anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1qYLP"&gt;It wasn’t just EV companies either. &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/how-sierra-space-a-rival-of-elon-musks-spacex-built-an-ad-strategy-around-his-snl-debut/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Adweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Sierra Space, a rival of Musk’s SpaceX, purchased several spots that will run on YouTube clips of Musk’s appearance on SNL. The company is also targeting non-SNL Musk clips on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uikc0r"&gt;We’ll update this post if more related commercials air. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An out-of-control Chinese rocket has re-entered Earth’s atmosphere</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="China Launches Space Station Core Module Tianhe" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lmCBaPERZBw85zvskoNFqsDuqj8=/0x0:7543x5029/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69258635/1315232701.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yP3EE3"&gt;The 100-foot-tall, 22-metric-ton Chinese Long March 5B rocket that launched the first chunk of Beijing’s new space station has reentered Earth’s atmosphere near the Maldives, China’s Manned Space Engineering Office reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tERdtG"&gt;US Space Command, which helps locate man-made satellites in orbit around the planet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422791/china-long-march-5b-uncontrollable-rocket-stage-crash-low-risk-public"&gt;was tracking&lt;/a&gt; the rocket’s location. The agency said the rocket “re-entered over the Arabian Peninsula at approximately 10:15 p.m. EDT,” adding it was unknown if the debris impacted land or water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpCBjJ"&gt;“Everyone else following the #LongMarch5B re-entry can relax. The rocket is down,” tweeted Space Track, a website that had been using Space Command data to publish the rocket stage’s whereabouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tF7DpP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Everyone else following the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LongMarch5B?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#LongMarch5B&lt;/a&gt; re-entry can relax.  The rocket is down.  You can see all relevant information and updates here on Twitter/Facebook, so there is no need to keep visiting the space-track dot org website.&lt;/p&gt;— Space-Track (@SpaceTrackOrg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceTrackOrg/status/1391230551181316100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yZFptx"&gt;The rocket’s design puts the entire first stage into low-Earth orbit to deliver its payload — a 22.5-metric-ton Tianhe module that will serve as living quarters for China’s new space station in the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lv73f7"&gt;It’s not the first time a Chinese rocket has reentered Earth’s atmosphere uncontrolled. Tiangong-1, China’s first prototype space station, launched in 2011, reentered just seven years later and broke up in the atmosphere over the South Pacific Ocean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLLafE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Technoking Elon Musk on SNL</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rBrm68NDfb6NZ6CddJg_jrKsqZk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69257106/acastro_180625_2689_Elon_Fans_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cHITW8"&gt;Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22401253/elon-musk-hosting-saturday-night-live-miley-cyrus-tesla-spacex"&gt;hosting &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week. He’s coming in fresh from Wednesday’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421845/spacex-starship-sn15-successful-landing"&gt;successful Starship prototype landing&lt;/a&gt; but also on the heels of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22410075/tesla-solar-roof-price-increase-customer-reactions"&gt;recent customer complaints&lt;/a&gt; about Tesla’s Solar Roof costs and last month’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404677/tesla-texas-crash-driver-seat-earnings-musk"&gt;deadly Tesla crash&lt;/a&gt;. If you have the desire to spend part of your Saturday finding out if the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331315/elon-musk-tesla-technoking-title-ceo"&gt;self-proclaimed Technoking&lt;/a&gt; makes a good comedy show host, here are the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQxYIk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: &lt;/strong&gt;NBC announced Saturday afternoon that the show would be live-streamed internationally for the first time. The link for people to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426596/saturday-night-live-elon-musk-live-stream-international-nbc-miley-cyrus"&gt;watch outside of the US is here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qh83aU"&gt;How do I watch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PnUvCH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; airs on NBC, and it’s available to watch on the &lt;a href="https://www.nbc.com/live?brand=nbc-news"&gt;NBC website&lt;/a&gt; if you have a cable login. It will also be available on other live TV streaming services like Sling TV, Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, and Fubo TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9g9azB"&gt;If you don’t catch it live, &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; episodes are available on Hulu and Peacock the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LmmtiR"&gt;When does it start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S38BAQ"&gt;It starts at 11:30PM ET on May 8th, which is — you guessed it — Saturday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="L9sBrE"&gt;What will happen?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tBSnoW"&gt;Miley Cyrus will be performing. Beyond that, who knows! Perhaps Musk will make a bunch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387486/dogecoin-run-valuation-cryptocurrency-spike-elon-musk"&gt;references to Dogecoin&lt;/a&gt;, do a skit where he re-creates the faces he pulled &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/01/tech/elon-musk-joe-rogan"&gt;while smoking weed&lt;/a&gt;, or joke about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262937/spacex-sn9-starship-test-flight-successful-explode-landing"&gt;rockets catching fire&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe his Twitter charisma won’t quite carry over, or maybe he’ll shock us with a surprisingly good delivery of a witty monologue. It remains to be seen, but either way, I’m sure we’ll hear all about it on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Saturday Night Live with Elon Musk will be live-streamed internationally for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Saturday Night Live - Season 46" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/en9WFnt_Hvo6pa75Ut3XZ1ApvZk=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69257757/1232732470.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FjFVaC"&gt;Saturday Night Live will be live from New York— and streaming to 100 countries around the world for the first time ever, NBC announced. Elon Musk is hosting the show for the first time (in case you  have not read anything else on &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;dot com today), and Miley Cyrus will be the musical guest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brkVgQ"&gt;“‘SNL’ is a global phenomenon and this livestream marks the first time audiences around the world will experience the show simultaneously along with the US,” Frances Berwick of NBCU &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/saturday-night-live-international-livestream-elon-musk-1234950225/"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s incredibly exciting to create this worldwide event with host Elon Musk and musical guest Miley Cyrus. We thank our international partners and YouTube for helping us make it happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="470l4q"&gt;Musk tweeted a link to the international feed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="omilgI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Special link to view SNL outside USA&lt;a href="https://t.co/egSDZ8sNFu"&gt;https://t.co/egSDZ8sNFu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1391130755787599881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TuFdAj"&gt;The show gets underway at the usual 11:30PM ET. Musk’s girlfriend, the singer Grimes, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/COns-pcsDJ9/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"&gt;posted to her Instagram&lt;/a&gt; that she would be making an appearance as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxkK6w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be watching. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go watch how Marvel’s FX team created a new ‘visual language’ for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WoDZ3J_dFx93ybYtWUrGeUgJ4ac=/189x0:1044x570/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69257256/falcon_blue_screen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Anthony Mackie as Falcon | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ2ImdWPM-c&amp;amp;ab_channel=MarvelEntertainment" target="_blank"&gt;Marvel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oCuAtu"&gt;Now that &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; has wrapped and we’re still a few weeks away from the debut of &lt;em&gt;Loki, &lt;/em&gt;Marvel has released a behind-the-scenes video on its YouTube channel detailing the CGI effects that made it look like Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) was flying through the air as Falcon [minor spoilers ahead if you haven’t watched the show yet].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1CJpp"&gt;Eric Leven, VFX Supervisor for &lt;em&gt;Falcon&lt;/em&gt;, breaks down a couple of the show’s key scenes. including the mid-air chase scene from the series’ first episode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrZesI"&gt;“What I really wanted to do for the big action sequences was, as much as possible, make things feel like they’re grounded in reality,” Leven explains. “Obviously, we don't have Anthony Mackie flying around in a real jet pack with real wings, but we wanted to make it feel like if he was, how would we film that?” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TzSFs6k5Py-D80SFvncocARXyLg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22500780/falcon_vfx.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ2ImdWPM-c&amp;amp;ab_channel=MarvelEntertainment" target="_blank"&gt;Marvel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xiquhZ"&gt;He says director Kari Skogland wanted the flying scenes to convey the authentic feeling of a real person flying through the air, with wingsuit pilots who jump out of planes serving as inspiration. But they were trying to avoid emulating the flight patterns of other heroes in the MCU who can fly, like Iron Man, Leven added. The result was a new visual language for the show, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNs5LI"&gt;You can watch the full video of VFX secrets from &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jJK4PI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XQ2ImdWPM-c?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jzlij7"&gt;Oh and in case you’re still jonesing for more MCU&lt;em&gt;, Loki&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421140/loki-disney-plus-show-new-date-wednesday"&gt;premieres on Disney Plus June 9th&lt;/a&gt; (and will drop new episodes on Wednesdays instead of Fridays). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coda is a post-apocalyptic fantasy adventure that crosses Fury Road with Lord of the Rings </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sfwpmj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comics have never been bigger: with Marvel TV shows, DC movies, and indie adaptations growing by the day, comic books have never been more prominent in pop culture. This biweekly &lt;/em&gt;Verge&lt;em&gt; column recommends comic series new and old, whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbDpxs"&gt;With most mainstream comics today tending to skew more toward sci-fi superheroes, Boom Studio’s &lt;a href="https://www.boom-studios.com/wordpress/series/coda/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coda&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a perfect gateway for those who prefer swords and sorcery — set in a magical post-apocalypse with some of the best comic art around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oavmg5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coda&lt;/em&gt; is a 12-issue fantasy comic set in a desolate apocalypse after a gigantic, magical war between the forces of good and evil that cost the world most of its magic. Think &lt;em&gt;Mad Max: Fury Road&lt;/em&gt; if it happened after the final battle in &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, with magical power instead of water as the scarce resource that everyone is fighting for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9f2pFy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coda&lt;/em&gt; is as much a story about a husband and wife figuring out their complicated marriage as it is a soaring fantasy epic. The story focuses on a bard, Hum, who’s traveling with his mutant pentacorn (a unicorn with five horns), the Nag, as he tries to save his wife from the threat of the remaining Urken (&lt;em&gt;Coda&lt;/em&gt;’s version of orcs).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1plE0KfcOPYmGa8Mqxi3AAXK1IE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499404/Coda_Header.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Boom Comics / Matias Bergara&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RkolAb"&gt;Despite the initial premise, as in real life, things aren’t as clear-cut as Hum would like them to be: his wife, Serka, is no damsel in distress, and Hum’s perspective on their relationship doesn’t tell close to the whole story. Hum’s journey quickly spirals out of control. Despite his reluctance to get involved in anything (he frequently reminds others that he’s retired), his quest gets interlinked with the fate of whatever’s left of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzSR20"&gt;Adding to everything is the absolutely &lt;em&gt;gorgeous&lt;/em&gt; artwork. &lt;em&gt;Coda&lt;/em&gt; is fond of gigantic, jam-packed spreads crammed full of detail, rendering Hum and Serka’s world with soft colors, harsh lines, and neon-soaked highlights. Story aside, it’s worth a look just for the art alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZbz3D"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is it by? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coda&lt;/em&gt; is written by Simon Spurrier, who’s also worked on &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Doctor Aphra&lt;/em&gt; and a variety of Marvel comics (&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/22396277/marvel-comics-x-men-nightcrawler-way-of-x-review"&gt;most recently &lt;em&gt;Way of X,&lt;/em&gt; a fantastic look at the Krakoan X-Men’s age of immortality&lt;/a&gt; that just came out). Artwork is by Matias Bergara, a frequent Spurrier collaborator, with colors by Michael Doig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BN0sBC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I read it?&lt;/strong&gt; All 12 issues of &lt;em&gt;Coda&lt;/em&gt; are available &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.comixology.com%2FCoda-Vol-1%2Fdigital-comic%2F734806&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22425401%2Fcoda-comic-book-fantasy-adventure-post-apocalyptic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on digital comics platform Comixology&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Elon Musk on Saturday Night Live, explained</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eFBquUyJ6Z97BMwopBrQAWtVmJg=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69256821/VRG_ILLO_4574_SNL_ElonMusk_site.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by&amp;nbsp;Grayson&amp;nbsp;Blackmon&amp;nbsp;/ The Verge | Photo by Getty Images Pool&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uuPbO1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is Elon Musk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C963Nf"&gt;Oh, come on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1kn1Ly"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seriously!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qcb5Dz"&gt;Fine. He’s the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, the founder of The Boring Company and Neuralink, a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-the-paypal-mafia-the-richest-group-of-men-in-silicon-valley-2014-9"&gt;certified member of the PayPal Mafia,&lt;/a&gt; and a well-known internet troll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgECzb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He sounds rich.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pG3GNI"&gt;He is. Depending on where the market closes on Friday, he’s either &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/elon-musk-is-now-the-richest-person-in-the-world-passing-jeff-bezos-.html"&gt;the first or the second richest person in the world&lt;/a&gt;. The other contender is Jeff Bezos. A substantial part of both men’s net worth is tied up in their company stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6eOyS6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. What is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZGCaj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live &lt;/em&gt;is an American television show that has been on the air since 1975. It is in a sketch comedy format. There is usually at least one good sketch in each 90-minute episode, and it is often the digital short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y320XU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; features a guest host, usually an actor with a movie to promote, and a musical guest, usually promoting a recently released album. After the “cold open,” a topical sketch about current events, the host gives a monologue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjoW54"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Elon Musk doing on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SNL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, though?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="guBkFR"&gt;Selling Teslas and getting richer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taLcxK"&gt;Musk’s sales acumen is a running theme in Ashlee Vance’s biography of him and in the lore Musk loves to promote about himself: &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/10/elon-musk-family-maye-musk"&gt;arbitraging Easter eggs with his cousins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/09/elon-musk-ran-a-nightclub-out-of-his-college-house-to-pay-for-rent.html"&gt;running a nightclub out of his frat house,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesdigitalcovers/2020/01/19/how-to-raise-a-billionaire-maye-musk-on-where-elon-gets-his-drive/"&gt;writing a computer program at age 12 and sending it to &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt; for $500&lt;/a&gt;. A major component of sales, of course, is advertising, and the most powerful form of advertising is “earned media,” or mentions you don’t have to pay for. You know, like the kind you get by guest-hosting &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxjA7I"&gt;Tesla famously doesn’t do paid advertisements. It doesn’t need to. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18232335/elon-musk-pewdiepie-meme-review-youtube-tesla-justin-roiland"&gt;Appearing on PewDiePie’s Meme Review&lt;/a&gt; is free. So is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21002684/elon-musk-driving-cybertruck-footage-photos-nobu"&gt;getting papped in a Cybertruck at Nobu&lt;/a&gt;. So is &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BiiAeCdhz8X/?hl=en"&gt;squiring musician Grimes&lt;/a&gt; to the Met Gala. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/28/16055248/tesla-model-3-elon-musk-when-where-handover-30-livestream"&gt;Parties for people who own Teslas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17445838/boring-company-flamethrower-elon-musk-tweets-party"&gt;Boring Company Flamethrowers&lt;/a&gt;, or who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18148061/boring-tunnel-test-drive-hawthorne-tesla-elon-musk"&gt;are just big fans&lt;/a&gt; have been part of his promotional efforts for years. He has a spicy Twitter account — spicy enough to earn &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jack-dorsey-says-elon-musk-is-his-favorite-twitter-user-misses-the-irony-2019-02-12"&gt;Jack Dorsey’s endorsement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/5/17937768/elon-musk-sec-settlement-twitter-tesla-shareholder-lawsuit"&gt;piss off the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; — and his tweets often make headlines. This is to say nothing of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/7/17830810/elon-musk-smokes-weed-electric-plane-design-joe-rogan-podcast"&gt;infamous Joe Rogan blunt-smoking episode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlDzS4"&gt;This isn’t Musk’s first foray into Hollywood, either. He was an executive producer of &lt;em&gt;Thank You for Smoking. &lt;/em&gt;He’s also appeared in &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty, Big Bang Theory, South Park, The Simpsons, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Iron Man 2.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlhbGs"&gt;Most CEOs don’t do this. Tesla gets compared to Apple a lot, and I would like you, for lols, to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/14/17856928/elon-musk-tesla-vs-apple-executive-departures-dave-morton"&gt;just visualize Tim Cook appearing on Joe Rogan’s show&lt;/a&gt; at all. Okay. Can you even see him drinking whiskey? He’s certainly not gonna &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmelzh0VJc"&gt;pass that dutch&lt;/a&gt;. Steve Jobs appeared in only one movie, a 1988 documentary about Bruce Springsteen&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sIFuub"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; promises to be an hour and a half of Elon-friendly writing, with goofs that burnish his reputation and let him laugh at himself. Plus, he gets to remind everyone Tesla exists and basically re-created the electric car market at a time when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408369/ford-mustang-mach-e-new-customers"&gt;a lot&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399212/honda-gas-car-phase-out-2040-electric-vehicle"&gt;his competitors&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394483/cadillac-lyriq-electric-suv-price-specs-2022"&gt;jumped &lt;/a&gt;into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/18/21142642/bill-gates-elon-musk-electric-vehicles-taycan-tesla-tweets"&gt;EVs&lt;/a&gt;. My only real unanswered question about this is:&lt;em&gt; Why isn’t the musical guest Grimes, tho&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2SQaV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think he’ll &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387486/dogecoin-run-valuation-cryptocurrency-spike-elon-musk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pump Dogecoin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJxtVd"&gt;I mean, yes, probably? One hedge fund made very good returns on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;the GameStonk debacle&lt;/a&gt; by selling immediately &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-04/elon-musk-s-gamestop-tweets-are-now-a-hedge-fund-signal?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;after Elon Musk pumped&lt;/a&gt; GameStop, so that’s something to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yD025y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Tesla involved in Dogecoin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hvdi4f"&gt;Not as far as I know, and I love reading their financial documents. Tesla &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; involved, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275243/teslas-bitcoin-purchase-clashes-climate-change-mission"&gt;in bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;. You can even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22347905/tesla-bitcoin-payment-us-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;buy a Tesla with bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68ltT4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why has Elon gotten involved in Dogecoin and GameStonk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPAsdk"&gt;They’re popular online, and he, famously, loves memes — even if he often arrives at them late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKcXKu"&gt;It also seems like he really wants to be liked. Musk has spent a lot of time courting an online fan base — some of his media appearances, like on &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; and Meme Review, seem designed to appeal to that fan base. While those fans may or may not convert into actual Tesla purchases, they help keep Musk relevant and are useful in hassling his critics online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZum23"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, but what matters more to Musk, money or popularity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7eWya"&gt;Ahahahaha you are asking me to read Elon Musk’s mind? Fine, great, hold on, let me concentrate. I see… &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MziwbQv9zQ0"&gt;an army of angry squirrels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1PGCT"&gt;No, seriously, though — Musk has been consistent about his admiration for humorists. He considered buying &lt;em&gt;The Onion’s&lt;/em&gt; parent company in 2014 but ultimately didn’t put in a bid. Later, he funded &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/2/18701197/elon-musk-thud-satire-startup-onion-launch-failure"&gt;a humor effort called &lt;em&gt;Thud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which he briefly suggested would be part of his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/3/14/17121420/elon-musk-thud-boring-company-the-onion-parody-humor-thud"&gt;“intergalactic media empire.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Thud &lt;/em&gt;crashed and burned shortly after it launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UCzlmi"&gt;Judging by his past beef with the SEC and his history with &lt;em&gt;Thud&lt;/em&gt;, which was never meant to make money, I would argue the thing that matters most to Musk is neither money nor popularity. It’s his ability to do whatever he damn pleases. Arguably, that’s part of what makes him popular — popular enough to host &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt;, even. Now the question is, will he send the ratings &lt;em&gt;to the Moon&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla to pay $750k fine and build solar microgrid system to settle California air quality violations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o0KZL4RCnTb9mX3L1GSL81FBVVQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69256806/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BgCaSn"&gt;Tesla has agreed to pay a $750,000 fine and install a solar roof project to settle air quality violations at its Fremont, California plant, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22500632/settle_tesla_210507_2021_007_pdf.pdf"&gt;officials announced&lt;/a&gt; Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JaRHHy"&gt;The Bay Area Air Quality Management District, which regulates air pollution in nine San Francisco Bay Area counties, said the settlement covers 33 notices of violations dating back to 2015, including “installing or modifying equipment without proper permits, failure to conduct required emissions testing, failure to maintain records and failure to report information to the Air District in a timely manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnNUFa"&gt;The violations have since been corrected and Tesla is back in compliance, according to the air district’s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNxWXS"&gt;Both sides had agreed that the fine should be $1 million, but a spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/07/tesla-will-pay-750000-fine-build-microgrid-system-to-settle-air-quality-violations/"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Mercury News&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;that Tesla will pay $750,000 directly to the air district’s general operating fund. Tesla will then receive a $250,000 credit once it completes the installation of a community microgrid system, which will include rooftop solar panels, as part of the air district’s  Community Health Protection Program. That program “focuses on improving air quality and public health in the Bay Area’s most heavily impacted areas,” the statement reads. “The goal of this project is to reduce electricity costs as well as localized air pollution emissions within the community.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRzcYv"&gt;Where the microgrid will be installed has yet to be determined. The settlement with the air quality district also “commits Tesla to implementing a comprehensive environmental management system,” to ensure the company remains in full compliance of environmental requirements moving forward. The air quality agency’s statement did not provide information about a deadline for when Tesla has to complete the microgrid project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GUwG9"&gt;Tesla has battled with public officials in Fremont over the past year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254871/tesla-fremont-shutdown-factory-production-model-3-y-elon-musk"&gt;defying local pandemic shutdown&lt;/a&gt; requirements. CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21253127/elon-musk-lawsuit-alameda-coronavirus-tesla-fremont-lockdown"&gt;threatened to move&lt;/a&gt; Tesla’s headquarters out of California, but earlier this year the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-02-19/it-looks-like-elon-musk-isnt-moving-tesla-out-of-california-after-all"&gt;company filed permits&lt;/a&gt; to expand its Fremont plant, suggesting the move was off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UTAmd"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404198/tesla-q1-results-earnings-profit-model-s-x-y-3-bitcoin-delay"&gt;Tesla reported a record profit&lt;/a&gt; of $438 million for the first quarter of 2021, with sales of $10.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHYsyf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="olwrjz"&gt;Here are this week’s best deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xdximO"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5WHXr7"&gt;Save 15 percent on useful tech accessories from Satechi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="buEbRJ"&gt;Satechi makes several accessories, like USB-C hubs, adapters, Apple Watch chargers, and much more. If you find something you want from its catalog of gadgets, it’s offering &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsatechi.net%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F8%2F22424501%2Fsatechi-accessories-ps-plus-memberships-roku-streambar-ipad-pro-m1-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a sitewide 15 percent discount&lt;/a&gt; when you use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;FORMOM &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. This deal will end on May 9th, which is Mother’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ahNgxj"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tVRasn"&gt;Get two years of PS Plus for your PlayStation for just $54&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2Vr6AE"&gt;One of the best deals this week wasn’t a gadget but a membership. If you have a PS4 or PS5 and want to load up on PS Plus, you can two years’ worth of service for just $54. Sony usually charges $60 per year, so you’re saving a lot here. To get this deal, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals04062021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;go to this page and tap “Buy Now”&lt;/a&gt; near the top. Then at checkout, make sure to double your quantity to two instead of one, then enter the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEMAYPROMO &lt;/strong&gt;to knock the price from around $60 down to $54. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSa01L"&gt;You’ll get two codes, and you can redeem each one into your console as needed when it comes time to replenish your service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iEY30H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OvsA3t"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sYBdYI"&gt;Roku’s all-in-one Streambar soundbar is $30 off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AjwQcL"&gt;The Streambar from Roku is a soundbar that also serves as a content streaming device that connects to your TV via HDMI. It’s only 14 inches long, so it seems like a good fit for small rooms and people who prefer a simpler setup with fewer individual pieces of hardware to plugin. Once this is set up, you’ll get audio and have a device that can access all of the major video streaming apps, like Hulu, Netflix, Apple TV Plus, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5YcjwU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10488551"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="iTpdbz"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6r9WBX"&gt;Save $50 when you preorder Apple’s new iPad Pro with the M1 processor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Mvg9ip"&gt;Walmart is accepting preorders for the latest 11-inch iPad Pro that has the fast and efficient M1 processor, and it’s asking $50 less than many other retailers. Instead of putting down $800, it’s offering the tablet for $750. It’s not a drastic price cut, but it’s notable since this product isn’t even out yet. Walmart says purchases will ship on May 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8rdEMt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="QMthkj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
