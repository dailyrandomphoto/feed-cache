    <title>Why Take-Two wants to pay nearly $13 billion for the maker of FarmVille</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="apVcTs"&gt;Take-Two Interactive just announced its intent to buy &lt;em&gt;FarmVille&lt;/em&gt; developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876184/take-two-interactive-zynga-acquisition-deal"&gt;Zynga for $12.7 billion&lt;/a&gt; in what could be the biggest acquisition in video game history. It’s an absolutely massive deal; to put it in perspective, the acquisition would be $5 billion &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;Microsoft’s $7.5 billion purchase&lt;/a&gt; of the parent company of &lt;em&gt;Skyrim &lt;/em&gt;maker Bethesda Softworks. You could throw in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/30/3577656/disney-buys-lucasfilm-plans-to-release-star-wars-episode-7-in-2015"&gt;the money Disney paid for Lucasfilm&lt;/a&gt; and still have cash left over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvwnMe"&gt;So what is Take-Two getting for its money? Yes, big Zynga games like &lt;em&gt;FarmVille&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Words With Friends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440209/tiktok-baddie-games-high-heels-nail-woman"&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Heels!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will join Take-Two’s own roster of franchises that includes &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt;. But perhaps more importantly, Take-Two will now be able to use Zynga’s expertise building hugely popular free-to-play mobile titles so it can make new hit games based on its own properties. In fact, Zynga will be the new brand for Take Two’s mobile efforts, and current Zynga CEO Frank Gibeau will lead that organization, indicating the potential direction of Take Two’s mobile future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Cxa7vh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Developers across the industry have been bringing big franchises to mobile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OaGLwg"&gt;Developers across the industry have been bringing big franchises to mobile and earning a lot of money doing so. &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; was the top-grossing mobile game worldwide in November 2021, earning “close to” $254 million, &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/top-mobile-games-by-worldwide-revenue-november-2021"&gt;according to Sensor Tower&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;League of Legends: Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;, the mobile-optimized version of the hit PC MOBA, was in the top ten for App Store revenue that same month. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; brought in more than $5 billion in revenue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565654/pokemon-go-5-billion-fifth-anniversary-revenue-analytics"&gt;as of its five-year birthday in July&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pokemon-go-five-billion-revenue"&gt;Sensor Tower reported&lt;/a&gt;. The Tencent-owned studio that makes &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22367089/tencent-timi-studios-call-of-duty-mobile-10-billion-2020"&gt;reportedly earned $10 billion in 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuNetj"&gt;And some of the biggest publishers have been buying their way into the space for years, with Activision Blizzard buying &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; maker King for $5.9 billion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/2/9662214/actvision-blizzard-buys-candy-crush-king-5-9-billion"&gt;in 2015&lt;/a&gt; and EA buying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273187/ea-glu-mobile-acquisition-kim-kardashian-hollywood"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kim Kardashian: Hollywood&lt;/em&gt; developer Glu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547324/ea-golf-clash-playdemic-acquisition-warner-brothers-games-mobile"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt; maker Playdemic&lt;/a&gt; in 2021. Mobile games are big business, and it’s not hard to see Take-Two releasing free-to-play mobile versions of its biggest franchises with the help of Zynga. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHIa8P"&gt;Take-Two was fairly explicit Monday on its intention to take this path. “We see tremendous untapped potential to bring Take-Two’s renowned console and PC properties to mobile, a high-priority initiative that will be energized by the addition of Zynga’s leading development, publishing, and live operations teams,” Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said in an investor call Monday. Take-Two also noted that the acquisition offered a “clear path to bring Take-Two’s console/PC games to mobile” in an investor presentation (&lt;a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/23d9f00c-d7e7-4992-b16d-84e67dc58622"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). (The deal is expected to close in Take-Two’s first fiscal quarter of 2023, which ends on June 30th, 2022.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rW2iy4"&gt;The Zynga acquisition doesn’t mean that Take-Two will be bringing its franchises to mobile for the first time. Right now, you can download and play &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vice City&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;San Andreas&lt;/em&gt; on your phone, for example. But those are &lt;em&gt;paid&lt;/em&gt; titles on the iOS App Store and likely aren’t nearly as lucrative as some of the huge free-to-play hits on the market right now. (Take-Two already has some experience in that space, with its microtransaction-laden version of &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K&lt;/em&gt; for mobile.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="D99u4V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not hard to imagine Take-Two wanting to translate the massive success of ‘GTA Online’ to mobile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0lCCL0"&gt;And speaking of &lt;em&gt;GTA&lt;/em&gt;, it’s not hard to imagine Take-Two wanting to translate the massive success of &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; onto mobile platforms with Zynga’s expertise. Despite being released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/1/4790206/grand-theft-auto-online-early-server-issues"&gt;in 2013&lt;/a&gt; — and requiring that you own &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; to play it (&lt;a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/3938k3oo9883o8/gtav-and-gta-online-coming-to-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-x-s-march"&gt;well, for now&lt;/a&gt;) — &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; has remained hugely popular. In February 2021, Take-Two said the game “had more players in every month and for the entirety of calendar 2020 than in any other year since its launch,” &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-has-sold-more-than-140-million-copies/1100-6487267/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It also offers in-game currency for real-world money that has proven to be lucrative; Take-Two cited the game as one of its largest contributors to its revenue as recently as its November earnings release (&lt;a href="https://ir.take2games.com/node/28206/pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djQnwr"&gt;In addition to the very obvious business opportunity there — it’s hard not to see some sort of free-to-play&lt;em&gt; GTA&lt;/em&gt; being an absolutely massive hit — Zynga also brings expertise in supporting games for years at a time. Zynga still offers multiple free-to-play versions of &lt;em&gt;Words With Friends&lt;/em&gt;, including both a “classic” version and a sequel, &lt;em&gt;Words With Friends 2&lt;/em&gt;, which seems like a better way to generate long-term revenue from a franchise than one-offs like 2K Games’ expensive and &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-24-2k-games-bioshock-ios-bye-bye.html"&gt;short-lived iOS port of &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine Take-Two and Zynga replicating the long-term model for &lt;em&gt;GTA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt;, and the rest of its titles, and you can start to see why Take-Two decided to pay as much as it did for the &lt;em&gt;FarmVille&lt;/em&gt;-maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcrh07"&gt;The deal isn’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; about turning Take-Two games into mobile hits. Take-Two highlighted how its “expertise in console/PC can be applied to Zynga’s cross-play ambitions;” Zynga is set to put its toe into console gaming with &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Hunters, &lt;/em&gt;which is coming to Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22674204/star-wars-hunters-trailer-nintendo-switch-mobile-zynga"&gt;sometime this year&lt;/a&gt;. Take-Two plans to use Zynga’s Chartboost ad platform to “acquire new users more efficiently and optimize mobile ad inventory.” And yes, there may be something with NFTs in the future — Gibeau said during Monday’s investor call that “the idea that players will play-to-earn or play-to-own is a very compelling idea that we think will have legs as the industry develops,” &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/90103/grand-theft-auto-maker-take-two-zynga-web3-nfts"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Decrypt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qx1dai"&gt;But it seems likely that the biggest shift following the acquisition is that Take-Two will start expanding its most important franchises into the lucrative world of free mobile games. While we don’t know exactly when the first games from the Take-Two / Zynga tie-up might be released, the acquisition could mean the next &lt;em&gt;GTA&lt;/em&gt; might not be as far off as fans have worried — it just might be on your phone instead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber is the latest popular app to bail on the Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8tO0RhQCW8p8IiZWXBtxzHJEPm4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371662/DSCF7013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XGd3fO"&gt;Uber has quietly shut down its Apple Watch app, with the software now showing a message that instructs people to “please switch to the Uber mobile app.” The company is “no longer supporting the Apple Watch app,” according to the text, which ends with Uber apologizing for any inconvenience caused by the app’s discontinuation. There’s also a sad face emoji to drive that sentiment home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJRJLv"&gt;As noted by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/10/uber-apple-watch-app-discontinued/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Uber hasn’t yet removed the Apple Watch app from its &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uber-request-a-ride/id368677368"&gt;App Store listing&lt;/a&gt;, where it still gets its own tab and screenshots. Presumably, that will all be history once the company releases its next update to the iOS app. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Uber for more details, and if I had to guess, the company is likely to cite low usage as the main reason for its Apple Watch exit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HdCfqjmn-JlpSN4rJ-ePN6taq4M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159195/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_3.42.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Uber&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uber’s Apple Watch app offered basic ride-hailing functionality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="scOYWz"&gt;On the one hand, this is another example of smartwatches continuing to shed apps — even those that are massively popular and borderline essential on a phone — that aren’t core to their purpose(s) of fitness tracking, notifications, music playback, and so on. I’ve long had Uber installed on my Apple Watch, and I don’t think there was a single occasion where I hailed a ride from my wrist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ys7XYG"&gt;Uber ended support for its WearOS app more than two years ago, so it’s not like Google’s platform fared much better with user engagement. Lyft has been out of this game since 2018. Perhaps it’s a case where the form factor just isn’t the right match for the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48SE9i"&gt;The Apple Watch app provided barebones ride-hailing functionality, with more advanced options like splitting fares and sharing an ETA reserved for the full mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jT3X_bQX7t5a0-1eIimEZhvSoS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159213/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_3.47.20_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has previously highlighted Uber for the Apple Watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gcFfKc"&gt;But it also goes to show that, in some ways, smartwatches are only moving further away from being able to serve as a standalone smartphone fill-in — even temporarily. Maybe barely anyone took advantage of Uber on the Apple Watch, but the fact that it no longer exists on the platform at all feels notable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfDX8y"&gt;Want to leave your phone at home for the day and rely on your cellular Apple Watch? You can’t hail an Uber in that scenario anymore. And it’s a use case that Apple itself once highlighted, as you can see above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIWlc8"&gt;Uber continues to offer its primary app for iPhone and a larger version for the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SEC charges ‘decentralized’ Amazon Web Services competitor with scamming investors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/49S4Um5V-5vgiffkDm-5ZfCT5FE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371608/blockchain.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T3BkhT"&gt;The US Securities and Exchange Commission has &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-3?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery"&gt;charged the would-be creator&lt;/a&gt; of a “decentralized” Amazon Web Services alternative with scamming investors out of millions. The SEC announced a complaint on Friday against Australian citizen Craig Sproule, the CEO of cryptocurrency startup Crowd Machine, which promised a global cloud computing network built on users’ computers. In reality, Sproule allegedly sent $5.8 million to South African gold mines as investors’ cryptocurrency tokens became worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aa7JpR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.390193/gov.uscourts.cand.390193.1.0.pdf"&gt;An SEC complaint&lt;/a&gt; says that Sproule collected at least $33 million through an initial coin offering (or ICO) to build a decentralized “Crowd Computer” platform, which he claimed was “battle-tested” by Fortune 500 companies. He compared the service to AWS and Microsoft’s Azure and said that Crowd Machine Compute Tokens (CMCTs) could be worth between $10 and $600 apiece. But the complaint says he made false and misleading statements, and this platform was never built as advertised. Instead, Crowd Machine hosted its system on centralized servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hs1hDm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The decentralized network allegedly ran on a centralized computer system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lqp99e"&gt;The ICO itself allegedly wasn’t registered with the SEC and Crowd Machine didn’t verify whether investors were accredited as required by law. And as Sproule attempted to raise money, Crowd Machine allegedly sent $5.8 million of the funds to gold mines in South Africa without informing investors. It described the transfers as loans or purchases of equity interest — but the gold mining operations, the complaint reports, “returned no revenue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GP5Fm4"&gt;Crowd Machine ran into trouble several months after it began raising money. In mid-2018, it reported that &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/09/26/the-crowd-machine-crypto-token-theft-what-we-know-so-far/"&gt;hackers had stolen a large number&lt;/a&gt; of CMCTs — halting trading and sending the price of the coins tumbling. Two men were &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-sim-swappers-arrested-for-cmct-hack/"&gt;later arrested&lt;/a&gt; for the hack. Ultimately, “the secondary market for CMCTs all but disappeared, along with any value that CMCTs might once have held for token holders,” the complaint notes. The tokens were sold for between $0.03 and $0.22 per token and never traded for higher than $0.18 on a secondary market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYgXkc"&gt;Following the complaint, Sproule &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.390193/gov.uscourts.cand.390193.5.0.pdf"&gt;agreed to terms&lt;/a&gt; set by the SEC. The agreement doesn’t require him to admit wrongdoing, but it permanently bars him from offering securities, including cryptocurrency assets. He must also pay a civil penalty of $195,000 and agree to permanently disable any CMCTs that he owns.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Europol ordered to delete petabytes of data not clearly linked to crime</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NQHIbaXRhkyYsqV7CCtD78El1ug=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371556/acastro_1800724_1777_EU_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J4wYqS"&gt;Europol, the law enforcement agency of the European Union, has been ordered to delete a huge store of personal data gleaned from police agencies in EU member states over the past six years. The deletion order comes from the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), a watchdog body overseeing EU institutions’ compliance with privacy and data protection legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1W3KZm"&gt;EDPS has given Europol a year to review its databases and then remove any data that cannot be linked to a criminal investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMMB9P"&gt;The total volume of data stored in Europol’s systems amounts to around 4 petabytes according to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/a-data-black-hole-europol-ordered-to-delete-vast-store-of-personal-data"&gt;reporting in &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — equivalent to hundreds of billions of pages of printed text — and includes data on at least a quarter of a million current or former terror and serious crime suspects, along with other people in its contact networks. The data has been drawn from criminal investigations conducted by national police authorities in EU countries, which were then shared with Europol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bK3k5Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Europol has not complied with the EDPS’ requests to define an appropriate data retention period”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xVuIwj"&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://edps.europa.eu/system/files/2022-01/22-01-10-edps-decision-europol_en.pdf"&gt;text of the decision&lt;/a&gt;, the EDPS cites an initial investigation into Europol’s handling of sensitive data in 2019, which concluded that Europol was storing personal data on crime and terrorism suspects without adequate checks on whether monitoring of flagged individuals was justified. A year later EDPS sent a &lt;a href="https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/investigations/edps-decision-own-initiative-inquiry-europols_en"&gt;notice of admonishment&lt;/a&gt; to Europol for failing to comply with data regulations and putting EU residents at risk of being wrongfully linked to criminal activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MxMyBT"&gt;“While some measures have been put in place by Europol since then, Europol has not complied with the EDPS’ requests to define an appropriate data retention period to filter and to extract the personal data permitted for analysis under the Europol Regulation,” the EDPS wrote in a &lt;a href="https://edps.europa.eu/press-publications/press-news/press-releases/2022/edps-orders-europol-erase-data-concerning_en"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; accompanying the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgYL91"&gt;In the absence of a clear course of action, EDPS has now stepped in more forcefully, giving Europol a year to sort through existing data to find out what can be lawfully kept, and ordering it to delete any newly collected data that is not categorized within six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llfN2i"&gt;“It’s unclear the precise types of data Europol want to hold onto so keenly, but we do know they are large datasets consisting at least in part of data about people who Europol do not currently feel they can categorise within ‘suspects’, ‘potential future criminals’, ‘contacts and associates’, ‘victims’, ‘witnesses’ and ‘informants’,” said Michael Veale, associate professor in digital rights and regulation at the University College London Faculty of Laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNJvBY"&gt;That array of categories was already extremely broad, Veale said, so storing data that falls outside of these categories raised concerns that Europol was conducting unjustified surveillance on groups stereotyped as being “suspicious” or “dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vX1kOV"&gt;What seems clear is that the decision from EDPS will provoke fierce debate over where the EU should draw the line between privacy and security. Some senior European officials were quick to respond: one, EU Home Affairs Comissioner Ylva Johansson, expressed her displeasure shortly after the decision was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g09b2E"&gt;“Law enforcement authorities need the tools, resources and the time to analyse data that is lawfully transmitted to them,” Johansson told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. “In Europe, Europol is the platform that supports national police authorities with this herculean task.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O11iRX"&gt;Johansson clarified her concerns &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vmanancourt/status/1480562529206210560"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;PoliticoEU&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that smaller national police departments would be unable to make sense of big data without drawing on Europol’s expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vr95CY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Policing that does not respect fundamental rights cannot ultimately be effective”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pNuVxJ"&gt;But other privacy campaigners have welcomed the ruling, which has been celebrated as an upholding of EU citizens’ digital rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3bB6hR"&gt;“This decision ... shows once again that in the EU the rights to privacy and to data protection are fundamental rights and are protected as such, even when the pressure on these rights comes from policing,” said Gabriela Zanfir-Fortuna, vice president for global privacy at the Future of Privacy Forum think tank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSm17C"&gt;“In a rule of law, policing activities need to follow the legal framework. Policing that does not respect fundamental rights cannot ultimately be effective,” Zanfir-Fortuna said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned about the (no longer available) Shazam Chrome extension</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PqXZuwGh_djnMXZ6GVk4YQewQe8=/20x0:620x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370901/unnamed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shazam is available in yet another place.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Shazam&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kQ9wq6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 10th, 3:44PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt; Shortly after this article was published, the extension was made unavailable from the Chrome Web Store. At the moment, the &lt;a href="https://www.shazam.com/apps"&gt;apps page on Shazam’s website&lt;/a&gt; still advertises the extension, but the link to it leads to a 404 error. We’ve reached out to Apple (which owns Shazam) to ask what happened, and will update this story again if we hear back, or if the extension is re-listed on the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0ywqr"&gt;The original article continues below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="qn0iDa"&gt;
&lt;p id="ymqO6O"&gt;Today I learned about &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shazam/mmioliijnhnoblpgimnlajmefafdfilb/"&gt;Shazam’s Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to have been out for about a month and can help you identify music playing on the webpage you’re viewing. Having the app directly in Chrome could help you figure out what song is playing in an ad, trailer, or livestream without having to mess around with your phone. (Thanks to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/10/shazam-chrome-extension/"&gt;finding and pointing out&lt;/a&gt; this nifty tool.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4avPNB"&gt;The extension does everything I’d expect it to — you go to the tab where music is playing, press the Shazam button, and it’ll try to identify the song. If it succeeds, it’ll give you a link to the song in Apple Music (serving as your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444506/apple-ios-14-2-beta-shazam-identify-music-phone-apps-headphones"&gt;occasional reminder&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17896350/apple-shazam-app-acquisition-complete-free"&gt;Apple owns Shazam&lt;/a&gt;). It’ll also keep track of the songs you’ve identified in a running list and let you link your Apple Music account. Doing so will let you listen to the entire song in the extension instead of just a preview.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E7ApkZRVK2gvI6yNVYB6ZRk3enI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23158838/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_10.51.51.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see the songs you’ve Shazamed, and listen to them if you’ve connected your Apple Music account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZbU8i"&gt;I had decent luck testing it out — it worked on YouTube, Twitch, SoundCloud, and even Wikipedia. Most of the time, it even got the song right, though that more so speaks to Shazam’s engine than the extension itself. I did occasionally notice that the actual audio coming out of my speakers would get a bit staticky or skip slightly while Shazam was doing its thing, but it didn’t happen every time and wasn’t unbearable when it did. It’s also worth noting that your mileage may vary here — &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/10/shazam-chrome-extension/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and several reviews on the &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shazam/mmioliijnhnoblpgimnlajmefafdfilb"&gt;Chrome Web Store&lt;/a&gt; report that they weren’t able to get the app working.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LEUrCCP_ervdCRcSHUHdqHG0cZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23158659/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_09.55.32.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I also learned today that Wikipedia captions songs, to incredible effect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kNBMPU"&gt;I’ll probably keep this extension installed because it’s easy to imagine times when it’d be useful — some tech companies play pretty great music before their livestreams, and I’ve wasted more time than I’d care to admit in the comment sections of movie trailers trying to sus out the song playing in the background. Of course, most of the time, I could just ask Siri what song’s playing (or use Snapchat, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/13/13936586/shazam-now-inside-snapchat-update"&gt;which has Shazam built into it&lt;/a&gt;), but when my phone’s in another room or I’m using headphones, having an extension to do the same thing could come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How not to tweet out Golden Globe Awards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-ENTERTAINMENT-FILM-TELEVISION-GLOBES" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CrbJPEw3a4pwz0m9hiR1kKCT7tk=/0x0:5798x3865/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371278/1237634390.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Golden Globes continued its tradition of cringe, this time on Twitter | Photo by CHRIS DELMAS/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="suKv36"&gt;If the controversy surrounding the Golden Globe Awards didn’t already push the show into irrelevancy, announcing this year’s winners via bizarre, out-of-touch tweets sure did (via &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/netflix-gets-its-first-golden-globe-for-best-motion-picture-drama-in-a-bizarre-live-tweeted-event/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). As a refresher, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/10/media/golden-globes-nbc-diversity/index.html"&gt;the Golden Globes was barred from airing on NBC&lt;/a&gt; following a &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-02-21/hfpa-golden-globes-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; investigation that uncovered possible racism and bribery within the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the organization that doles out the awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vvYH6M"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Nowhere in these deeply chaotic Golden Globe tweets do they even mention the projects people are winning for &lt;a href="https://t.co/4Tt5CHaojE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4Tt5CHaojE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kyle Buchanan (@kylebuchanan) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kylebuchanan/status/1480370936469544964?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="76FjRN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/golden-globes-2022-untelevised-ceremony-strangest-ever-1235149984/"&gt;A physical event&lt;/a&gt;, consisting only of a small number of HFPA members, still took place behind closed doors without all the usual glitz and glamour. But to keep the rest of us in the loop, the Golden Globes sent out a rapid-fire succession of tweets to reveal its winners, and, as &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ Kyle Buchanan noted, that live Twitter show was purely “chaotic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QBE4e9"&gt;For one, it failed to mention the films that awardees got a Globe for in several of its tweets, leaving users to rely on Google search to find that very vital piece of information. The Globes &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/goldenglobes/status/1480365844408549384?s=20"&gt;tweeted out Kenneth Branagh&lt;/a&gt; “has the write stuff” when granting him the award for best screenplay, but didn’t add the film he actually wrote the screenplay for, which was &lt;em&gt;Belfast&lt;/em&gt;. The Globes repeated its mistake when announcing Andrew Garfield’s Golden Globe for best actor in a musical or comedy, leaving out that the award was for his appearance in &lt;em&gt;Tick Tick... Boom!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kKZosm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The internet remembers &lt;a href="https://t.co/XMPvZaklcG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XMPvZaklcG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brendel (@Brendelbored) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Brendelbored/status/1480386441712701441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YLzXjo"&gt;In perhaps its biggest blunder of the night, it tweeted out, “If laughter is the best medicine @WestSideMovie is the cure for what ails you” when giving &lt;em&gt;West Side Story &lt;/em&gt;the award for the best musical. It's a film modeled after &lt;em&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Someone on the Golden Globe’s social media team eventually noticed as the tweet was deleted and replaced with one that reads “music” instead of “laughter.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lq2B1B"&gt;Sure seems like the Golden Globes social media team doesn’t have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/14/22778827/twitter-blue-undo-button-paywall-features-paid-free"&gt;Twitter Blue subscription&lt;/a&gt; — an investment the HFPA should’ve made &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; hosting their entire event on Twitter. The premium plan lets you edit and undo tweets, something that the Golden Globes could’ve really used last night. But hey, if &lt;em&gt;West Side Story&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t give us the laughter that ails us, at least the Golden Globes does.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer no longer claims its Zephyr mask uses ‘N95-grade’ filters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Zephyr Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4WqlEz_78Ahnyto7EfInPQcLAPs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371033/zephyrprofronthero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BafJTT"&gt;Razer’s popular $100 Zephyr mask isn’t a replacement for PPE (because it &lt;em&gt;isn’t &lt;/em&gt;PPE), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22855795/razer-zephyr-pro-mask-voice-amp-feature-price-ces-2022"&gt;its announcement of the Zephyr Pro last week&lt;/a&gt; spurred a surge of claims that the company had overstated the masks’ protection. Razer responded by scrubbing every instance of “N95-grade” from the mask’s product page late last week (via &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/razer-plays-a-dangerous-game-with-its-misleading-mask-marketing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aurXji"&gt;Previously, Razer used N95 in multiple places to describe the filtration and efficacy of its replaceable filters, which were referred to as “N95-grade” because of their 99 percent bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE). Razer now refers to them as “air purification filters.” While Razer claims that testing showed its filters meet a 95 percent particulate filtration efficiency (PFE), the entire mask (not just the filters) would have to block 95 percent of small particles and be cleared by regulators to call itself an N95.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wa1NVT"&gt;Razer declined to provide an on-the-record statement in response to questions from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. But in a tweet thread on Saturday, the company tweeted that “The Razer Zephyr and Zephyr Pro are not medical devices, respirators, surgical masks, or personal protective equipment (PPE) and are not meant to be used in medical or clinical settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7NNSw0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;*The Razer Zephyr and Zephyr Pro are not medical devices, respirators, surgical masks, or personal protective equipment (PPE) and are not meant to be used in medical or clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;— R Λ Z Ξ R (@Razer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Razer/status/1479845819511496704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x9JRKP"&gt;This isn’t the first bit of controversial info that Razer has changed on the Zephyr’s page. On December 10th, 2021 (via &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211210223814/https://www.razer.com/gear-accessories/razer-zephyr"&gt;Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;), it published a new version of the page that removed its claim in the FAQ section that likened the Zephyr to a medical device, respirator, surgical mask, and PPE, which initially said the Zephyr “offers the same functionality and adequate protection due to its 99% BFE rating.” It now says “Razer Zephyr is not a medical device, respirator, surgical mask or personal protective equipment (PPE) and is not meant to be used on medical or clinical settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46fAcX"&gt;On Saturday, January 8th, &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Ftechnology%2Frazer-zephyr-science&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer published a blog&lt;/a&gt; to its site called “The Science Behind Razer Zephyr” that provides the results of every test that the company put the Zephyr through (relevant or not to the topic of filtration) before coming to market. It issued an update (without any mention of what changed) to this post today, January 10th, that incorporated bits from the statement above, including explicitly stating that the Zephyr and Zephyr Pro are “not certified N95 masks,” along with removing every mention of “N95” that was found in the original blog post published Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Zephyr" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVZVCCv2KuHAbJGZEwqOaDxw6kE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942600/zephyrfilter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer refers to these filters as “air purification filters” instead of being “N95-grade.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4LZ4t2"&gt;The takeaway from the test results that the blog discloses is that, while Razer did put the Zephyr through several internal tests, it still needs external review from expert agencies before people can feel confident that it’s gone through a rigorous evaluation. That extends to the Zephyr Pro, a version of the mask that adds voice amplification that’s set to come out sometime in 2022, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNipTp"&gt;When the Zephyr was initially announced at CES 2021 as Project Hazel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;we noted&lt;/a&gt; that it lacked “any of the necessary approvals and certifications from the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or Occupational Safety and Health Administration.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1mlMw"&gt;When Razer launched Zephyr &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22726468/razer-zephyr-face-mask-available-features-design-safety"&gt;in late October 2021&lt;/a&gt;, it still hadn’t gotten sufficient testing to be considered PPE, and we noticed that the company referred to it as an “air purifier” in its marketing (while still touting N95-grade filters). Shortly afterward, my colleague Nicole Wetsman and I interviewed Razer’s Jeff Sandoval at our On The Verge event, and Nicole pressed him on the Zephyr’s lack of clearances from agencies like the FDA and NIOSH (at the 9:04 mark).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says App Store developers have earned more than $260 billion</title>

  &lt;p id="4MqeMB"&gt;App Store developers have earned more than $260 billion since the store launched in 2008, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/01/apple-services-enrich-peoples-lives-throughout-the-year/"&gt;according to a Monday press release from Apple&lt;/a&gt;. Apple said &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/01/apple-services-entertain-inform-and-connect-the-world-in-unprecedented-year/"&gt;last January&lt;/a&gt; that developers had earned more than $200 billion since the launch of the App Store, so the new figure shared Monday indicates developers earned $60 billion in 2021. The iPhone maker also said that spending on the App Store between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve in 2021 grew by a double-digit amount, though it didn’t specify exactly what that number might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yzhint"&gt;While the new numbers suggest that the App Store continues to be a big moneymaker, developer unhappiness with the store is high at the current moment. Many developers have taken issue with what they see as restrictive store policies, particularly the 30 percent cut Apple takes from many transactions. Apple is still embroiled in a legal dispute with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-maker Epic Games over the App Store, and although Apple arguably got off well from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; ruling&lt;/a&gt;, that ruling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22814147/epic-apple-app-store-injunction-paused"&gt;has been put on hold&lt;/a&gt;, meaning Apple won’t have to let developers point customers to alternative payment systems outside the App Store for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="758qDc"&gt;Monday’s press release also revealed that there are more than 745 million paid subscriptions to Apple services. In recent years, Apple has added new premium services like News Plus, Fitness Plus, and Apple TV Plus to its roster of services offerings. The strategy seems to be paying off, given the number of subscriptions reported Monday and the new all-time high for services revenue reported during the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751418/apple-q4-2021-earnings-supply-constraints-chip-shortage"&gt;latest earnings&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple quietly discontinues the Beats Pill Plus, its last battery-powered speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VuIZuyAmqkYZ9OSgp0aZ8TD96Ds=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370987/beats-pill-plus-0797.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zPdmTY"&gt;Apple appears to have quietly discontinued the Beats Pill Plus, with the portable wireless speaker no longer appearing on either Apple or Beats’ websites, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/apple-discontinues-beats-pill-plus/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPABjh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/7/9467123/beats-pill-plus-speaker-apple-dre"&gt;Originally released in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, the Pill Plus was the first speaker released under the Beats brand since the music company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/28/5700530/apple-confirms-beats-acquisition"&gt;purchased by Apple for $3 billion back in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. A more refined version of the original Beats Pill speaker, the Pill Plus was an Apple-ified version of the original product, with sleeker monochromatic color options and the addition of a Lightning port for charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oXUrI7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Beats’ Pill+ is its best speaker ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/7/9467123/beats-pill-plus-speaker-apple-dre"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ccL1KU"&gt;Apple and Beats would continue to go on to build out Beats’ lineup of headphones over the intervening half-decade, with products like recent Beats Fit Pro or Powerbeats earbuds, both of which feature the same H1 chips and software integration as the Apple-branded AirPods lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxY13c"&gt;But the company didn’t show the same love to the Pill line. There was no Pill Plus successor that added support for Apple’s AirPlay standard or one with integrated Siri support. In fact, Apple hasn’t released another portable speaker (under either its Apple &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; its Beats brands), despite its expansion into smart home speakers with the since-discontinued HomePod and the smaller HomePod mini — the sole standalone speaker that Apple currently sells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABTA5K"&gt;In the meantime, plenty of other portable battery-powered speakers around have come out to fill the niche that Apple never really explored with its Beats-branded options. There’s the Sonos Roam, which offers both Bluetooth and works with Apple’s AirPlay 2 standard, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/30/17796756/ue-ultimate-ears-boom-3-megaboom-speakers-wireless-bluetooth-price-ifa-2018"&gt;modernized versions of the Ultimate Ears speakers&lt;/a&gt; that the Beats Pill Plus used to compete with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJMmaL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIUeqx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>23andMe gets FDA clearance for prostate cancer risk test</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="23Andme" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uy8OXvhYgJGjYsaWc4hvahFOxcE=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370969/1089796154.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gvE5eb"&gt;Genetics testing company 23andMe received Food and Drug Administration clearance for its prostate cancer risk test, the company &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/01/10/2363945/0/en/23andMe-Receives-FDA-Clearance-for-Direct-to-Consumer-Genetic-Test-on-a-Hereditary-Prostate-Cancer-Marker.html"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. It’s 23andMe’s third clearance for a cancer risk report — the company also has tests for genes that predict breast and colorectal cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UnzqD8"&gt;The test screens for a specific mutation on the HOXB13 gene linked with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer. Men with the mutation, the G84E variant, have around a three-fold higher chance of developing prostate cancer than men without, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25595936/"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found. Around one in 70 people of European descent have the variant, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/01/10/2363945/0/en/23andMe-Receives-FDA-Clearance-for-Direct-to-Consumer-Genetic-Test-on-a-Hereditary-Prostate-Cancer-Marker.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from 23andMe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06KSBc"&gt;The prostate cancer risk report is not yet available to 23andMe customers, the company said. Customers will be able to choose whether or not they want to see their results. Those that choose to see it will also get access to an “educational module” to give them information about how to interpret the results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z6ug3h"&gt;23andMe received its first FDA sign-off for a cancer risk screening test in 2018, when the agency cleared its tests for three mutations on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The mutations are associated with higher risk for prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. However, those specific mutations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17086494/23andme-genetic-testing-brca-cancer-health"&gt;aren’t the most common mutations&lt;/a&gt; linked to those cancers in the general population — they’re most common among people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. They can offer some information to 23andMe customers but can’t rule out other mutations that are also linked to those cancers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bV8UbS"&gt;The company’s test for genetic variants linked to a hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome was cleared by the FDA &lt;a href="https://blog.23andme.com/health-traits/23andme-receives-fda-clearance-for-genetic-health-risk-report-that-looks-at-a-hereditary-colorectal-cancer-syndrome/"&gt;in early 2019&lt;/a&gt;. That specific type of cancer only accounts for around 5 percent of colorectal cancers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPLPth"&gt;“These reports provide our customers with the knowledge that they might be at risk for certain diseases, including hereditary cancers, empowering them to take appropriate preventative action with their healthcare provider,” Anne Wojcicki, CEO and co-founder of 23andMe, said &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/01/10/2363945/0/en/23andMe-Receives-FDA-Clearance-for-Direct-to-Consumer-Genetic-Test-on-a-Hereditary-Prostate-Cancer-Marker.html"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; about the new prostate cancer test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSxv7r"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/25/5144928/how-23andme-brought-down-fda-wrath-personal-genetics-wojcicki"&gt;initial tussles&lt;/a&gt; with the FDA over its attempts to give people health information based on their genetic code, 23andMe is building a portfolio of medical tools. Along with its three cancer risk tests, the company gives customers information on their risk of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.23andme.com%2Ftest-info%2Fgenetic-health&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F10%2F22876615%2F23andme-fda-prostate-cancer-risk-test" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;developing other health conditions&lt;/a&gt; and how their bodies might &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.23andme.com%2Ftest-info%2Fpharmacogenetics&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F10%2F22876615%2F23andme-fda-prostate-cancer-risk-test" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;process medications&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21060456/23andme-licensed-drug-developed-genetic-database-autoimmune-psoriasis-almirall"&gt;developed drugs&lt;/a&gt; using its database of genetic information on millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxUiCT"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266661/genetic-health-23andme-public-spac-richard-branson"&gt;went public&lt;/a&gt; via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in February 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
