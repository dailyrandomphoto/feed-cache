  &lt;p&gt;Daversa, the firm tasked with getting adults in the room in Silicon Valley, had no adults in the room, according to a recent lawsuit&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div id="Y0wkk5"&gt;&lt;header&gt;

&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="pNTP2g"&gt;Gretchen Howard was sitting outside the Ferry Building in San Francisco when she got a piece of unexpected career advice that would eventually change her whole life. It came from Paul Daversa, CEO of the executive recruiting firm Daversa Partners. “Are you actually good, or are you just lucky?” he asked her&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The question sounded like a neg, but it eventually spurred enough introspection to prompt her to leave her stable job at Google and take a chance on a new career path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7S9URT"&gt;As an executive recruiter, Paul Daversa is masterful at nudging people toward fast-paced startups. Recounting the story on a podcast, he pulled up an email he’d sent Howard in 2010, asking her to take an interview at Zendesk. When she said she couldn’t quite handle the risk, he suggested she take a jumbo mortgage. She didn’t bite, but his words left a lasting impact. In 2019, Howard became the COO of Robinhood — one of many buzzy companies Paul Daversa advises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7gjfm"&gt;Daversa Partners is far from a household name outside the tech industry. But for companies looking to grow from collegial side hustle to venture-backed verb, it’s the go-to firm. In tech, many startups are run by ambitious but inexperienced entrepreneurs. Daversa helps bring in executives with industry experience. In short, it puts adults in the room, adding a layer of professionalism and oversight that’s sorely needed in Silicon Valley. To that end, the firm has recruited the chief financial officer of Uber, the chief accounting officer of Instacart, and seemingly the entire engineering leadership team at WeWork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="L5tOPx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This same partner apparently got so drunk that he accidentally kneed a female consultant in the head&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QgHSXH"&gt;Behind the scenes, however, Daversa has been struggling with its own alleged lack of oversight. The firm is the subject of a recent lawsuit, brought by a former employee named Vaughn Feighan who says he was repeatedly harassed and assaulted by a man who, at the time, was one of the organization’s most powerful partners. Feighan says the partner drew him in by talking about the opportunity — he, too, could make partner if he just took the older man’s advice. It almost felt like he was one of Daversa’s recruiting targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xDiEH"&gt;The complaint alleges that the partner, who was in his fifties, told Feighan about his specific sexual desires: that he liked having fingers in his ass when he was having sex and that he’d always dreamed of “going both ways,” but it hadn’t been acceptable when he was growing up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8e6iON"&gt;On three separate occasions, Feighan alleges the partner physically assaulted him. Once, after giving Feighan a ride home, he restrained the younger man in the car and stuck his hands down his pants. “I always imagined you had a massive dick,” he said, according to Feighan’s recollection. The other two alleged assaults occurred on company trips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vBKkOa"&gt;All the while, the partner was dangling prestigious career opportunities in front of Feighan, telling him he could get a promotion if he just stuck it out a little longer. He said he was mentoring the younger man — teaching him the subtle art of nudging executives to take a chance on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKg2i8"&gt;Feighan’s complaint is not the first time Daversa has faced internal tension. The firm hires many people just out of college, making it difficult for some to gauge whether the behavior they’re witnessing falls within the bounds of normal corporate culture. A former employee says that, despite being more than 60 percent women, Daversa felt like a boys’ club. One partner, who has helped build the executive teams at Google, PayPal, Twitter, and Postmates, allegedly made references to sucking dick and getting fucked in front of colleagues at the offices. During a company offsite in 2019, this same partner apparently got so drunk that he accidentally kneed a female consultant in the head. He currently co-runs Daversa’s San Francisco office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="M5rG5f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The firm tasked with getting adults in the room at some of the most prestigious startups in Silicon Valley had no adults in the room&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aH1LKV"&gt;In response to these allegations, a spokesperson for Daversa said that the firm’s leadership team is majority women, and suggesting that it was a boys’ club “defies logic.” They also said that during a team outing in Napa Valley wine country, “an unfortunate accident occurred” but vehemently denied allegations that this partner made references to “sucking dick” or “getting fucked” in front of colleagues. The spokesperson also sent prepared statements from multiple women who have had overwhelmingly positive experiences at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wn46sH"&gt;Feighan suspected the alleged behavior was abnormal. It might have been his first job out of college, but he felt like the excessive drinking and sexual references had to breach some code of conduct. Still, he felt he had no one to turn to. According to the complaint, Daversa did not have an internal human resources department, despite being a nearly 30-year-old company. (The firm did have an outside consultant whom Feighan was aware of.) He tried to tell the other partners about the late-night texts and phone calls he was receiving, but, according to the lawsuit, the firm did nothing to protect him. (Daversa denies that any of the other partners knew about the allegations of harassment or assault or were ever told about the late-night phone calls.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EieyC"&gt;Over time, Feighan began to see himself as part of a group of people, many of them women, people of color, and members of the LGBTQ community, who’ve been targeted by powerful men in the tech industry while their companies turned a blind eye. “It was so alarming to me that the people I was supposed to turn to through all of this just kept turning their heads, and that’s exactly what Silicon Valley has continued to do,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICBZqO"&gt;When it mattered most to Feighan, the firm tasked with getting adults in the room at some of the most prestigious startups in Silicon Valley had no adults in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="4St50t"&gt;Follow My Lead&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7-p0n8_lAuMod7L36rCy-0oUdO0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773517/VRG_4688_Spot_1_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yetDCv"&gt;From the beginning, the partner in the DC office took a keen interest in Vaughn Feighan. A recent college grad, Feighan originally wanted to interview for the Los Angeles office but says he was told that the partner had heard about him and wanted him to interview for a position in DC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Az0exs"&gt;Feighan’s uncle had worked at Daversa years before, so the comment didn’t stand out to him. The firm was known for the long tenure of many of its senior staff — perhaps legacy meant something to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ga7qLw"&gt;He showed up for the interview wearing a suit. “You look so stuck-up right now,” the partner said, according to Feighan’s recollection. He instructed the younger man to take off his jacket. Then the partner asked him if he was a “crier.” Feighan thought he’d misheard. “Do you mean, do I cry?” he asked. “Yeah,” he says the partner responded. “Because we don’t really have time for people in the Washington, DC office who are sensitive and cry a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jV3Y05"&gt;The partner ran the show in the DC office. He’d been at the company for 20 years and had deep relationships with VC firms like Sequoia Capital. According to Daversa’s website, he’d helped build the “senior most leadership teams” at companies like Spotify and Survey Monkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ON9N0p"&gt;Feighan could see why the partner was so successful. “He could basically get anyone to take a meeting with anyone, regardless of what role it was for,” Feighan says. “His style is very relaxed and very, very effective. He didn’t even talk about roles necessarily. He would just talk.” The partner’s confidence was intimidating — and it worked. His favorite thing to tell candidates was “just follow my lead on this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5D3hVU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You passed the test, perfect.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BDRyB2"&gt;This confidence, in many ways, is what executive recruiting is all about. Tech companies that need to expand their boards or leadership teams will often hire outside firms to woo qualified candidates on their behalf and convince them to take a leap of faith. Jana Rich, an executive recruiter who’s worked with Dropbox, Square, and Peloton, says the work is “touchy-feely,” less about finding people with technical expertise than identifying “public-facing leaders in the C-suite,” &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/11/17/ozy-jana-rich-silicon-valley-recruiter/19167107/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s behind-the-scenes work that helps shape the culture of Silicon Valley and reverberates through offices around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYaSJ9"&gt;Two days after Feighan started, he was sitting in a training session when he got a text from the partner telling him to go to a bar near the office “ASAP.” Feighan responded that he was in a meeting. “Come anyway,” the partner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jn8KNk"&gt;“When I got down there, he was saying, ‘Oh well, you know what? You passed the test, perfect,’” Feighan recalls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzTwxM"&gt;The off-campus meeting became a pattern. The partner would tell Feighan to leave work, at times even instructing him to lie about his whereabouts to colleagues. He called Feighan late at night and on weekends, often to talk about projects, but at times asking Feighan about his personal life or sharing details of his own. The partner was married but talked about cheating on his wife, according to the lawsuit. He mentioned a desire to sleep with men and speculated about Feighan’s sexual preferences — including fantasizing about whether the younger man was a top or a bottom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3N0hM"&gt;A month after he started, the partner asked to meet for lunch to go over an assignment. When they sat down, the partner ordered whiskey and told Feighan that drinking wasn’t optional, according to the lawsuit. “Mr. Feighan felt he had no choice other than comply, or else risk angering [the partner] and jeopardizing his job,” the complaint alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ss3Hf"&gt;After lunch, the partner texted him: “Great hustle this weekend. Overall B+ and the whiskey/lunch/vision board review puts you @ an A-.” To Feighan, the message was clear: push through your discomfort, and you’ll be professionally rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pz8r9r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Dad, I’m staying in the same room as my boss. He’s 55 years old.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EnhB83"&gt;In September, the partner told Feighan that he was taking the young associate on a business trip to California — an unusual perk for an employee of Feighan’s tenure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEWtPo"&gt;“Should I act surprised that I am going to SF/should I tell the others or are you going to?” Feighan asked him over text. “Yes act surprised…” the partner said. “I will make the announcement later...for now keep your head down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUXGnU"&gt;After Feighan arrived in San Francisco, the partner told him to meet him at a hotel. Feighan assumed the partner had gotten him a room, and he had — but it was a room the two men were meant to share. Feighan felt it was inappropriate. He hadn’t been told ahead of time about the arrangement. “I called my dad and I was like, ‘Dad, I’m staying in the same room as my boss. He’s 55 years old.’” His father confirmed this conversation in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ge9hI"&gt;On two subsequent trips, the partner booked a single room with just one king bed for the two of them, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkhW9i"&gt;In response to these allegations, a spokesperson for Daversa said, “It is absolutely not typical for any manager and subordinate to share a hotel room and any suggestion to the contrary would be false.” In the firm’s answer to the complaint, however, it wrote that “employees of the same gender who travel together sometimes share a hotel room as a cost-saving measure for the company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkM0qa"&gt;Later on during the San Francisco trip, a drunk woman began hitting on Feighan at a restaurant in San Jose, even buying him and the partner a bottle of champagne. After the restaurant staff asked her to leave, the partner said that they had just “lived the beginning of a small dream of his” and that he would “love to take that woman in the bathroom, fuck her and pull her hair while she screamed and [Mr. Feighan] watched…if [Mr. Feighan] did not want to join,” according to the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0K8fyP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Come on...you and I have taken it to the next level...there’s no turning back”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KHzJ2a"&gt;After the trip, the texts became even more frequent. The partner would mix work questions with jokes, movie suggestions, and heaps of praise. “I can say this w/o being a flag,” he told Feighan once. (According to the complaint, he’d started using the term “flag” ahead of inappropriate comments after going through a sexual harassment training.) “I actually love you and think you’re the next combo of myself and Bryce!!!” He was referring to another high-powered executive recruiter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpYKvv"&gt;In November, the partner took Feighan to dinner at an upscale Italian restaurant, saying he had feedback to give him directly from Paul Daversa. Feighan, hoping to keep things professional, suggested bringing along another of the firm’s directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YfDBA"&gt;“This is btw you and I,” the partner responded. “Stop being so political...I want to hang with you solo!!! And don’t share.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVzVkr"&gt;According to text messages reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; the partner picked him up from his house. When they got to the restaurant, the older man ordered a drink and started asking Feighan about his sexuality. He inquired about whether the younger man loved him and found him attractive, according to the lawsuit. Feighan tried to fend off the comments but was feeling pressured to drink as well. Eventually, when the partner got up to use the bathroom, Feighan told the bartender to substitute lime juice and seltzer the next time he ordered a cocktail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbvyR1"&gt;After dinner, the two men took an elevator down to the parking garage where the partner’s car was parked. According to the complaint, the partner began tickling him. “I don’t think I’ve ever even tickled a significant other,” Feighan says. Then, the partner grabbed his crotch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgwB8x"&gt;Feighan pulled out his phone. “I’m going to take an Uber home,” he remembers saying. “I still have your backpack,” the partner responded. Feighan had left it in the car earlier that night. The partner allegedly told Feighan he wouldn’t give it back unless he got in the car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZHWTQ"&gt;On the ride home, the partner remarked on the size of Feighan’s dick, according to the complaint. When they got to Feighan’s apartment, the younger man went to unbuckle his seatbelt, only to have the partner throw his arm across his chest to hold him down. “[The partner] unbuckled his seat belt as Mr. Feighan struggled under him, and forced his other hand down Mr. Feighan’s pants, placing several fingers inside Mr. Feighan’s underwear,” the complaint says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfFVc6"&gt;Around 10PM, after a short exchange about Feighan’s growth at Daversa, the partner wrote: “Come on...you and I have taken it to the next level...there’s no turning back...it’s either you, Reece, or Ava” in reference to a director and senior associate at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Mj7mAv"&gt;Why Men Don’t Report&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hc2OSIvV690210XVaDelzGJ9GIY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773518/VRG_4688_Spot_3_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TlNnZx"&gt;Research suggests that more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf"&gt;24 percent of men in the United States have experienced some form of sexual violence in their lifetime&lt;/a&gt;, yet these incidents are vastly under-reported. According to a &lt;a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv19.pdf"&gt;criminal victimization report from the Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, roughly 66 percent of sexual assaults aren’t reported to police — and the numbers are likely far higher when talking about male-on-male violence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4HzE6"&gt;In Silicon Valley, an inclusive ethos collides with a bro-centric culture. While companies say employees will not be retaliated against for reporting sexual harassment or assault, the reality is that many go to great lengths to protect high-powered men at their organizations. The situation can be even more complicated for young gay men who are navigating an environment where they’re expected to be “one of the guys.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVCKjN"&gt;Up until the alleged assault, Feighan wasn’t even sure what he was experiencing. He knew he was overwhelmed by the number of texts and calls he received from the partner, but when Feighan tried to bring it up to another member of the leadership team, he says he was told, “Look, we know he’s very intense, but this is how you become the number one partner in the firm.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEeXDQ"&gt;(In response to this allegation, a spokesperson for Daversa said, “The employee involved in this fictional conversation categorically denies that it ever occurred, and we believe this individual.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDNS1W"&gt;The partner was also masterful at making Feighan feel like he was perpetually on the verge of a bonus or promotion. “I have your back and will do what it takes to ensure that u crush it!!!” he texted him once. “Close [a candidate] I’m personally buying you 2 pairs of Chelsea boots,” he said on another occasion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLy635"&gt;After the alleged assault, any confusion about what the attention meant evaporated. When his best friend from college got to town shortly after the incident, he told her what had happened. “He explicitly said that he was sexually assaulted by [the partner] the night before,” she says in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I remember being in his little bedroom and he was in the bathroom and he started crying as he said it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4h9sXO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I felt broken by the end, completely broken.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="woMply"&gt;Feighan didn’t know what to do. When he talked to his father about some of the behavior — omitting the details of the assault — he was told to keep his distance from the partner. But how could he? Oftentimes, when he started to pull back, he’d get a notification on his phone that the partner had Venmoed him random sums of money — at times, upwards of $250. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGQIYX"&gt;“I felt broken by the end, completely broken,” Feighan says. He started having panic attacks and suffering from crippling anxiety — symptoms he says he’d never experienced before the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qM5qFw"&gt;Over time, Feighan had begun to mirror the partner’s casual and inappropriate language. He joked with the older man about doing drugs, called him a bitch, and talked shit on the other partners. “They really turned me into someone that I was not,” he says. “That’s been one of the biggest struggles. My demeanor, my attitude toward work and people, and the language I used totally changed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTanQ4"&gt;For victims of sexual assault, this behavior is hardly unusual. “Victims sometimes cope by focusing on their perpetrator’s loving side and shutting out the abuse, maintaining contact to elicit such affirmative behavior from the abuser,” &lt;a href="https://timesupfoundation.org/newsroom/weinstein-trial-why-victims-stay-in-touch-with-perpetrators-and-other-facts/"&gt;wrote the Times Up Foundation in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. “Often, victims may blame themselves for the encounter and convince themselves — or be convinced by the abuser — that an assault was not what they thought it was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDjWmv"&gt;Feighan resigned in July 2020, just over a year after he’d started. He knew he’d likely never go back to executive recruiting. When he told the partner he was leaving, the older man at first offered to match the base salary he was getting at his new job. Then he changed his tune and said that Feighan couldn’t stay two weeks — the resignation was going to be effective immediately. “Thank you so much for all your great work, but things have gotten kind of out of control at the firm,” the partner said, according to a recording of the call reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5550pu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m not the first person this has happened to, but hopefully I can be the last.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="myBF6q"&gt;When Feighan started opening up to his queer male friends about what had happened, he was shocked at how many gay men said they’d experienced similar kinds of behavior but hadn’t felt able to report it. Feighan realized that he had an obligation to come forward. He was queer, yes, but also white and well-off. He felt he could handle the fight. He decided to file a lawsuit, naming both the partner and Daversa as defendants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vR2zJR"&gt;When the firm received the complaint, it placed the partner on unpaid leave and began to investigate the allegations. Shortly afterward, the partner resigned. He’s now started his own firm, building off of his success at Daversa. “Leveraging his two decades of successfully recruiting top talent around the world, [the partner] is excited to now offer a boutique search experience — taking a hands-on approach from start to finish,” his website reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wk60NU"&gt;To Feighan, the move is just further proof of why he needed to come forward. “I’m not the first person this has happened to, but hopefully I can be the last,” he says. “Paul Daversa has had 20 years to fix the culture, and nothing’s happened, until now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0jUpE"&gt;Daversa, for its part, categorically denies that there are widespread issues with the company culture. “Daversa Partners has always had strict policies and procedures designed to ensure a harassment free workplace,” a spokesperson said. “In the very small number of instances in which there were complaints about inappropriate behavior, they were immediately investigated, and if warranted by the facts, appropriate action was taken.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1gCJxm"&gt;The company has denied all allegations in the lawsuit as well as any liability with respect to the claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="p5WkYl"&gt;The spokesperson also said, “Our firm is committed to providing a workplace that is free of all forms of harassment and has strict policies in place to that effect – we expect everyone at the firm to operate with the same high ethical standards and integrity that we demand of ourselves and that we look for in the c-suite executives, board members and others the firm has recruited for some of the most high-profile and successful businesses in the country.” They called the lawsuit an attempted shakedown with no basis in reality. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google One VPN expands internationally to Canada, Mexico, UK, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ILtOaQ"&gt;Google is expanding the VPN service that it provides as part of its Google One subscription to seven new countries: Mexico, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/09/google-one-vpn-countries/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHblK0"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21541032/google-one-vpn-cloud-storage-subscription"&gt;started offering VPN access&lt;/a&gt; to 2TB Google One cloud storage subscribers in the US late last year, as a free addition to the existing $9.99 / month plan. But today’s announcement sees a marked expansion of the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JskKOC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google is bringing its own VPN to desktops and phones with $9.99 Google One subscription","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21541032/google-one-vpn-cloud-storage-subscription"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="upohwC"&gt;There are a few limitations that separate Google One from more comprehensive VPN solutions. First off, you’ll only be able to use the service in one of the supported countries — the company’s support page notes that “you won’t be able to connect to VPN by Google One if you are traveling to an unsupported country.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAhkDJ"&gt;And, much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;Apple’s upcoming iCloud Plus VPN service&lt;/a&gt;, the Google One VPN won’t enable one of the most popular uses of a VPN: accessing content from a different country or region by assigning an IP address from that area. Rather, Google’s system will “assign you an IP address based on your current country so that websites can show you the right content for your region,” although Google notes that it still will prevent tracking to your specific city or area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXp3LM"&gt;The newly expanded Google One VPN is still only available on Android devices, however. Last year, Google said that it would be expanding availability to platforms like iOS, Windows, and Mac “in the coming months,” but there’s no news on that front yet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A NASA scientist explains why the weather is becoming more extreme</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-WEATHER-STORM" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wYt38mNnbOW3nhiPY4_LPl4iHdU=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69704253/840653818.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of the Houston skyline after heavy rains broke during the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey August 29, 2017.&amp;nbsp;Harvey, swirling for days off Texas and Louisiana, dumped more than 49 inches (124.5 centimeters) of rain on the region.  | Photo credit should read BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;We’re headed into ‘uncharted territory’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PDobDZ"&gt;Across China and Western Europe in July, the amount of rain that might typically fall over several months to a year came down within a matter of days, triggering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22607996/flood-risk-satellite-data-nature-study"&gt;floods&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/23/germany-floods-street-night/?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;wpisrc=nl_most&amp;amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F3437bdb%2F60fae7c39d2fda945a13beb7%2F596a4fb9ae7e8a0ef33cf3d7%2F11%2F70%2F60fae7c39d2fda945a13beb7"&gt;swept entire homes&lt;/a&gt; off their foundations. In June, the usually mild regions of Southwest Canada and the US’s Pacific Northwest saw temperatures that &lt;a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2021/06/the-cool-lush-pacific-northwest-roasts-in-death-valley-like-temperatures/"&gt;rivaled highs in California’s Death Valley&lt;/a&gt; desert. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602208/june-heatwave-most-extreme-summer-record-north-america"&gt;severe heat&lt;/a&gt; was enough to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22559961/heat-roads-washington-oregon-climate-infrastructure"&gt;buckle roads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/dangerous-heat-wave-is-literally-melting-critical-infra-1847186624"&gt;melt power cables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7xyNxF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Humans are fueling more dangerous weather&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eeGg7A"&gt;Yesterday, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;landmark United Nations report&lt;/a&gt; helped put those kinds of extreme events into context. By burning fossil fuels and releasing planet-heating greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, humans are fueling more dangerous weather. Researchers have been able to connect the dots between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change for decades. But the new report showcases a big leap forward in climate science: being able to tie the climate crisis directly to extreme weather events like the June heatwave, which would have been “virtually impossible” without climate change &lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/"&gt;according to recent studies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1kgIe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;spoke with Alex Ruane, one of the authors of the new report and a research physical scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. He walks us through the phenomena that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;supercharging extreme weather events&lt;/a&gt;. And he explains why scientists have gotten so much better at seeing the “human footprint” in each weather disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Et03sx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZCCv5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new United Nations report ties many changes in extreme weather to a more intense water cycle. What is the water cycle and how does it affect the weather?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slIubg"&gt;The water cycle is basically the way that we track moisture moving through the climate system. So it includes everything from the oceans to the atmosphere, the clouds, ice, rivers, lakes, the groundwater, and the way that those things move and transfer moisture and water from place to place. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="China Henan Massive Evacuation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RiwQ9a5ScPy1c_CzmwsYqtEq1BE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22772269/1234214409.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Feature China / Barcroft Media via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rescuers transfer citizens out of the flooded zone in a massive evacuation effort in Weihui city in central China’s Henan province on July 26th, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zOESaB"&gt;So when we’re talking about the intensification of the water cycle, we’re basically saying things are moving faster. Air is pulling the moisture out of the oceans and out of the land faster. It’s moving more moisture from place to place on the planet. And when it rains, it can come down hard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oFUGUy"&gt;The fundamental difference is that there is more energy in the system. There’s more heat. And as the temperature goes up, there is an overall increase in the amount of moisture that the air is trying to hold. So that means when a storm happens, there’s more moisture in the air to tap into for a big, heavy downpour. It also means that when air moves over a region, it has the potential to suck more moisture out of the ground more rapidly. So the same phenomenon is leading both to more intensive rainfalls and floods and precipitation, and also to more stark drought conditions when they do occur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AI2mCS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are people affected by those changes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxYTEF"&gt;So, I personally live in New York City. We are affected by the water cycle, for example, when there’s a heavy downpour it can flood subway stations. It can lead to surface flooding in rivers and streets that can affect transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nckm5j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Heavy rain inundated New York City yesterday afternoon, partially submerging the 157th St Subway station in Washington Heights, footage shows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A flash flood watch was in effect for New York City through Thursday night. &lt;a href="https://t.co/VqbyR3hM2q"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VqbyR3hM2q&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NPR (@NPR) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NPR/status/1413523611504218116?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OwNzj9"&gt;Other parts of the world have different engagements with the water cycle. They may be concerned about the snow fall or river floods that affect broad areas. And then of course huge parts of the world are concerned about drought. When we look at something like drought, it doesn’t just affect agriculture. It also affects ecosystems and urban parks. It affects water resources and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573648/drought-california-power-grid-electricity-hydro-energy"&gt;infrastructure like power plants&lt;/a&gt; and roads and buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uYyU0"&gt;So in all of these climate factors, we see that more than one sector is affected by these changes. We also see that if you take any specific thing that we care about, like agricultural fields, they are affected by more than just one type of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSH041"&gt;A specific set of climate conditions can lead to two extremes at the same time. So for example, heat and drought often go together because as conditions become drier, all of that sunshine, all of that energy, all of that heat goes into warming the air. That is a reinforcing cycle that can make hot and dry conditions even more extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKShTi"&gt;The big picture, as we’re seeing it, is that climate change is affecting all of the regions on Earth, with multiple types of climate changes already observed. And as the climate changes further, these shifts become more pronounced and widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78V3IH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve read that “weather whiplash” is becoming more common because of climate change — what is “weather whiplash”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2hyqq"&gt;This idea that you can go from extreme to extreme very rapidly is giving society this sensation of a whiplash. This is part of the idea of an intensified water cycle. The water is moving faster, so when a wet condition comes it can be extremely wet. And then behind it could be a dry condition that can quickly get extremely dry. That type of shift from wet to dry conditions is something that we explore and understand in our climate models, but the lived experience of it can be quite jarring — and not just uncomfortable, but a direct challenge for ecosystems and other things that we care about in society. They really are connected in many cases to the same types of phenomenon, and this new report connects the dots between this phenomenon and our human footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRLTTl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do scientists study how climate change affects extreme weather events? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMcR6"&gt;There have been big steps forward in the methodologies and the scientific rigor of detection and attribution studies, which is another way of saying: understanding the human influence on these events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQQv2y"&gt;The basic idea behind the extreme event attribution is that we need to compare the likelihood that an event would have happened without human influences against the likelihood of that event happening, given that we have influenced the climate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxPJkm"&gt;We are able to use observational records and our models to look at what conditions were like before there was strong human influence. We look at what we call a preindustrial condition, before the Industrial Revolution and land use changes led to greenhouse gas emissions and other climate changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="esuhrt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A really exciting, cutting-edge field”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tdidUs"&gt;If we can understand how likely events would have been before we had our climate influences, and then compare it against the likelihoods today with those climate change influences factored in, that allows us to identify the increased chance of those events because of our influence. It allows us to attribute a human component of those extreme events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2FQVA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How have researchers gotten so much better at attributing extreme weather events to climate change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQz0fY"&gt;This is a really exciting, cutting-edge field right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rxKe9"&gt;Methodological advances and several groups that have really taken this on as a major focus of their efforts have, in many ways, increased our ability and the speed at which we can make these types of connections. So that’s a big advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nd9vDW"&gt;Every year, the computational power is stronger in terms of what our models can do. We also use remote sensing to have a better set of observations in parts of the world where we don’t have weather stations. And we have models that are designed to integrate multiple types of observations into the same kind of physically coherent system, so that we can understand and fill in the gaps between those observations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huEtaC"&gt;The other thing, of course, is when you look at any single attribution study, you get a piece of the picture. But what the new report does is bring them all into one place and assesses them together, and draw out larger messages. When you look at them all together, it is a much stronger and more compelling case than any one single event. And this is what the scientific community is showing us, that these things are part of a larger pattern of change that we have influenced.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A farmer walks back to his car between two barren fields once sown with row crops on July 23rd, 2021 in the town of Huron, California in California’s drought-stricken Central Valley. Before the drought, the fields were sown with hemp or garlic crops, but as a result of California’s water restrictions the farm decided not to plant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PVVhg9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should we expect in the future when it comes to extreme weather? And what might we need to do to adapt?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83S6Nh"&gt;First of all, it’s not like drought is a new phenomenon. There are parts of the world that are dealing with these conditions every day of the year. What we’re seeing, however, is that the overall set of expected conditions is moving into uncharted territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlBOVu"&gt;I want to emphasize it’s not just the record levels that we care about. We also care about the frequency by which these extremes occur, how long they last, the seasonal timing of when things like the last frost occurs, and also the spatial extent of extreme events — so where are conditions going to happen in the future that are outside of the observed experience of the last several generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIoP5G"&gt;It is a set of challenges that we have to face in terms of how do we adapt or manage the risk of these changes. Also, how do we prepare knowing that they may come in combination or in overlapping ways, with more than one extreme event happening at the same time, or in the same season in a sequence, or potentially hitting different parts of the same market or commodities trade exchange or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zoPziC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I still remain optimistic”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="NvfqKz"&gt;We are facing a situation where we have more information about these regional risks, but also know that every increment of climate change that occurs makes these changes more prominent. That sounds scary, but it also gives us agency. It gives us the ability to reduce these changes if we reduce emissions, and if we can eventually limit them to something like net zero — no total carbon emissions into the climate system. And in that sense, I still remain optimistic despite all this information that you’re seeing in the report about the changes that could come. The bottom line is we have the potential to reduce those changes, if we can get emissions under control.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qDHSVv"&gt;Chinese tech giant Xiaomi has unveiled a quadrupedal robot named CyberDog: an experimental, open-source machine that the firm says “holds unforetold possibilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEiU8y"&gt;CyberDog is the latest example of tech companies embracing the quadrupedal form factor in robotics. The most notable example of the trend is Spot, a machine built by US firm Boston Dynamics. Spot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292684/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-on-sale-price"&gt;went on sale last year&lt;/a&gt; for $74,500 and has been put to a range of uses, from &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GbcDK7E9rVQ"&gt;surveying dangerous mines&lt;/a&gt; to helping doctors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231855/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-covid-19-coronavirus-telemedicine"&gt;connect with patients remotely&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also been tested by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299140/nypd-boston-dynamics-spot-robot-dog"&gt;both law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371590/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-military-exercises-french-army"&gt;and the military&lt;/a&gt;, though not as a weapon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HkUo7e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Xiaomi says CyberDog has a “pet-like nature”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sl2YTv"&gt;It’s not clear what purpose Xiaomi envisions for CyberDog. In a press release, the company stressed the open-source nature of the machine’s design and that it would release only 1,000 units initially for “Xiaomi Fans, engineers, and robotic enthusiasts.” The company says it hopes these first users will “propel the development and potential of quadruped robots” and is pricing the robot to sell. The first 1,000 units will cost just 9,999 Yuan, or roughly $1,540 (though it’s not clear if this price will be the same for any future releases). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1Tb6J"&gt;The same press release highlights CyberDog’s “pet-like nature,” including its ability to respond to voice commands and follow its owner like a real dog. Looking at pictures of CyberDog, though, it’s clear Xiaomi isn’t pitching the machine as a rival to Aibo, Sony’s own robot canine. While Aibo is small and cute, CyberDog is sleek and futuristic — even a little menacing. Renders of the machine make it look like the protagonist in a sci-fi TV show, pacing up stairs and appearing silhouetted in doorways. Inevitable comparisons to &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/em&gt;’s “Metalhead” episode will be made, as they always are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MRgGwN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10694343"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3PMLry"&gt;Xiaomi says CyberDog is nimble enough to perform backflips, can trot along at speeds of 3.2m/s (compared to Spot’s 3.9m/s), and weights 3kg (compared to Spot’s 5.2kg). CyberDog is powered by Nvidia’s Jetson Xavier AI platform and is equipped with an array of cameras and sensors. These include touch sensors, a GPS module, an ultra-wide-angle fisheye lens, and Intel’s RealSense D450 camera for depth-sensing. These components enable the robot to navigate semi-autonomously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5yjEh"&gt;“CyberDog can analyze its surroundings in real-time, create navigational maps, plot its destination, and avoid obstacles. Coupled with human posture and face recognition tracking, CyberDog is capable of following its owner and darting around obstructions,” says Xiaomi. The machine can also respond to voice commands, including recognizing wake words and instructions, or it can be controlled using a connected smartphone app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlTNxN"&gt;CyberDog also has three USB-C ports and one HDMI port, which Xiaomi says can be used to customize its hardware. The company suggests lidar sensors, panoramic cameras, and search lights could all be added to the robot. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s5gkTHk6jHTTN7KQPV3TTBxRQAs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773144/CyberDog_05.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xiaomi’s CyberDog has a very similar design to Boston Dynamic’s Spot robot. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ug70ol"&gt;The release of CyberDog by Xiaomi is very interesting, though not necessarily as a product in its own right. Instead, it says a lot about the current robotics landscape and the accessibility of this tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kpkt4b"&gt;Boston Dynamics popularized the quadrupedal format for robots, and companies around the world are now exploring exactly how and where such machines can be deployed effectively. The price of this hardware has been falling though, allowing for new use-cases to be explored. Earlier this year, Chinese robotics firm Unitree released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527413/tiny-robot-dog-unitree-robotics-go1"&gt;quadrupedal bot that cost just $2,700&lt;/a&gt;, and Xiaomi’s own CyberDog undercuts that again. Obviously, the capability of these machines will not be identical, but broader access to the technology will show whether it’s worth these firms pursuing at all. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gaming companies should avoid predatory designs, lawmakers say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uXcE5CvGicISOUPBcyOAfzcraP0=/203x0:2405x1468/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69704078/lootbox.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8yqk4y"&gt;Democrats are calling on some of the largest gaming companies to better protect children by extending new UK design rules to children in the US. The regulations could ban companies from selling in-game loot boxes to minors, among other restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zrig6L"&gt;&lt;a href="https://trahan.house.gov/uploadedfiles/final_game_letters_-_combined.pdf"&gt;In letters to a dozen major gaming companies&lt;/a&gt;, including Blizzard, Epic Games, Microsoft, Nintendo, and Riot, Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), Rep. Kathy Castor (D-FL), and Rep. Lori Trahan (D-MA) pressed executives to extend new UK design regulations to children in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GtOFw"&gt;“It is imperative that Congress acts with urgency to enact a strong privacy law for children and teens in the 21st century,” the lawmakers wrote. “As we work towards that goal, we urge you to extend to American children and teens any privacy enhancements that you implement to comply with the AADC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zvVsVK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is imperative that Congress acts with urgency to enact a strong privacy law for children”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BmSPE5"&gt;The new UK rules, called the “Age Appropriate Design Code,” are set to roll out next month, applying to social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram as well as games like &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;. Specifically, the new rules force companies to design their products in the “best interests” of children, offer stricter privacy settings and policies for different age groups, and restrict “nudging techniques” often used to encourage users to continue using the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdAClo"&gt;The UK law does not extend to children in the US, but in Tuesday’s letters, lawmakers called on the 12 companies to voluntarily apply these same protections to Americans. Notably, the lawmakers argued that the Entertainment Software Rating Board’s (ESRB) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18226852/loot-boxes-gaming-regulation-gambling-free-to-play"&gt;loot box guidance&lt;/a&gt; does not go far enough in protecting children from “manipulation” associated with these in-game purchases and that the companies should create stricter regulations in compliance with the new UK rules in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3IWwk"&gt;“The prevalence of micro-transactions—often encouraged through nudging— have led to high credit card bills for parents,” the lawmakers wrote. “Loot boxes go one step further, encouraging purchase before a child knows what the ‘bundle’ contains— akin to gambling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkZZNV"&gt;The US already has some laws protecting children’s privacy — most notably the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, authored by Markey. But the law only applies to children under the age of 12. The UK rules extend to minors under the age of 18. Earlier this year, Castor reintroduced her &lt;a href="https://castor.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403677"&gt;“Kids PRIVCY Act”&lt;/a&gt; which includes elements of the UK’s Age Appropriate Design Code. Specifically, the bill would prohibit behavioral ad targeting to children and force companies to design their products in the best interests of young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q73Z38"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmj8i7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL announces new 6-series and 5-series TVs that come with Google TV instead of Roku</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TsVhJe5TqlZKcilBMKh4pTS3QcM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69704022/IMG_1105.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tMUdnH"&gt;TCL has long been the flag bearer of Roku TVs. The company’s 6-series is one of the best-performing sets you can buy for under $1,000. It features a fantastic picture with the help of Mini LED backlighting — TCL beat Samsung and LG to implementing that technology — and quantum dot HDR color. The 5-series and 4-series Roku TVs are no slouches either in their respective pricing tiers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urAnGl"&gt;But now TCL is taking a step that could dramatically shake up the US TV market: it’s expanding beyond Roku and will release updated versions of its most popular TVs that come with Google TV on board. The software that debuted on Google’s 2020 Chromecast (and also runs on recent TVs from Sony) will now be offered on the latest 5-series and 6-series TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14EAlh"&gt;I recently spoke with some of TCL’s executives who made it abundantly clear that the company is not transitioning to Google TV &lt;em&gt;instead&lt;/em&gt; of Roku or walking away from its longtime partner. Rather, TCL expects that the TV operating system landscape will take after smartphones and eventually consolidate down to two choices: Roku OS and Google TV. TCL wants to offer consumers the choice of either one, and the existing 6-series and 5-series Roku TVs will remain for sale. That stance seems just a bit dismissive of Samsung’s Tizen and LG’s webOS TV platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IlY0T4"&gt;The Google TV versions retain the same price points as the Roku models — but there are some tweaks and upgrades since they’re newer hardware. For one, the TCL 6-series with Google TV will be capable of 4K at 120Hz, an improvement over the Roku model, which can only reach 120Hz at 1440p. That’s a big deal for PS5 and Xbox Series gamers. The Google TV version comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports (one of which is eARC), with two additional HDMI 2.0 ports. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E2rWF6C3E3SnkkLSGpiwnfYm2cU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773200/IMG_1100.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 6-series with Google TV has two full-spec HDMI 2.1 ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3hdixt"&gt;Both the 6-series and 5-series with Google TV will also support HDR10+. And in what some people might perceive as a controversial decision, TCL is outfitting its Google TVs with always-listening microphones that can be used for voice commands. There’s a physical switch on the back of the TVs to disable the microphones if you prefer to stick to the remote’s press-and-hold method to Google Assistant controls. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qFNuGb6X0G8c93JBvuryWBohoAs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773206/IMG_1098.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL’s Google TVs have always-listening mics located at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LFXHVo5GmQoIBlMxTOv5iQYUEng=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773199/IMG_1097.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a physical switch to turn off the TV’s built-in microphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HbmU9e"&gt;The lower-priced 5-series doesn’t include 4K at 120Hz, but it still gives you full-array local dimming and both variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode when gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeDxwB"&gt;TCL is highlighting Google TV’s content-focused interface, which differs significantly from the grid-of-apps Roku homescreen UX. Here’s what the company says the new software offers customers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CNQx3I"&gt;With the addition of Google TV, TCL’s latest offerings will also come with notable features like the For You tab where users will find new content based on their interests, across their streaming services; the Watchlist to fine tune recommendations by clicking on content and saving to watch later, even from a browser or phone; and the Live TV integrated channel guide where recommendations for streaming content are visible alongside live program listings. In addition, quickly finding TV shows and movies by title, genre, and even actors, is made possible by pressing the dedicated Google Assistant button on the remote and saying the command; or simply make Google TV the hub of any smart home by easily controlling your connected devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="p3AaZZ"&gt;Preorders for TCL’s first Google TVs in the US begin today: I’ve included their Best Buy links below. The company tells me that the new 5-series will ship within the next couple weeks, and the 6-series should follow shortly after that. A 75-inch model of the 6-series is expected to come later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QRJge"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TCL 6-series with Google TV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748695675415496976" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch: $1,299&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748695712892295817" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch: $999&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgFuzC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TCL 5-series with Google TV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748695744417216631" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;75-inch: $1,299&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748695761875439072" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch: $899&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748695795187643160" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch: $649&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748695826735635451" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch: $599&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u11BwsVPeCrrNhukCEvyA6KxDzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773307/IMG_1101.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The remote for the TCL Google TVs is quite different from the Roku remote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2Ljud"&gt;It’s worth noting that TCL’s very best TVs, which include the 8-series and 8K-capable 6-series, will still exclusively run Roku OS in North America. But regardless, I’m curious to see how this will shake out over the coming months. As I said earlier, TCL has always been the premier Roku TV brand. The company’s vertical integration and in-house panel production has put it in a place where, for example, Amazon’s Fire TVs from Toshiba and other brands have been unable to compete in terms of picture quality. Now, Google TV is about to get a huge boost by serving as the backbone of that impressive hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRWSms"&gt;There are upgrades here (particularly on the 6-series) that might push people toward the newer Google TV TCLs instead of the previous Roku sets. But you’ll also have those people who have sworn off ever bringing a TV with microphones into their home — mute switch or not. I’m looking forward to taking a closer look at TCL’s Google TVs in the weeks ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Beats Studio Buds are already $20 off at Amazon and Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vcoTzDBjvW18DhQigmIWvGClqe4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703765/DSCF4152_Edited.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Typically $150, Amazon and Walmart are both taking $20 off the recently-released earbuds. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qh5ECz"&gt;The Beats name carries quite a bit of clout, which is perhaps the reason Apple is able to sell headphones and earbuds that fall under the Beats umbrella for a premium, regardless of their performance. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22533158/beats-studio-buds-features-price"&gt;Beat Studio Buds&lt;/a&gt; are a great case in point. The fitness-focused earbuds lack wireless charging and suffer from lackluster noise cancellation, however, they typically command a higher price than some of the like-minded competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJri1v"&gt;Thankfully, they’re currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/1141873/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBeats-Studio-Buds-True-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Black%2F643659699&amp;amp;partnerpropertyid=1065598" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $20 off, the first discount the colorful earbuds have received since making their debut in June. Noted flaws aside, the Beats Studio Buds still tout a comfortable, stem-less design and satisfying sound for the price, along with USB-C charging and support for a handful of Android-specific features — a hallmark we hope Apple brings to more devices in the future. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="LmGDy1"&gt;The latest iPad Air is, arguably, the best tablet for most people right now. The well-built, midrange device adopts some design elements from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features"&gt;2018 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; and is compatible with many of the same devices, yet it’s not nearly as big or expensive as its larger sibling. Nonetheless, it comes with a terrific display, USB-C connectivity, and Apple’s A14 Bionic processor, a chip that promises to provide ample speed for years to come. Normally $600, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748634717956796230#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are selling the 10.9-inch iPad Air with Wi-Fi and 64GB of storage for $500, matching the best price we’ve seen on the 2020 iPad Air this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi announces Mix 4 with under-display camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jo5Uu8jPjslxptbyKiozr17qA9E=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703667/mix4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pf5xvq"&gt;Xiaomi has announced the Mix 4, the first phone in the Mi Mix series to be announced in nearly three years. The Mix phones have always been about bezel-less designs with seamless screens, and the Mix 4 carries on that idea by commercializing a technology that Xiaomi has been working on for a long time: a selfie camera that’s located directly under the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PziUla"&gt;Xiaomi calls this CUP (Camera Under Panel) technology, though it’s similar to the under-display selfie cameras we’ve seen from other companies. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608812/oppo-next-generation-under-screen-camera-tech-announced"&gt;Oppo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597594/zte-axon-30-refresh-specs-availability-under-display-phone-camera"&gt;ZTE&lt;/a&gt;’s latest efforts, the Mix 4’s screen has a 400ppi area that lets light pass through to the selfie camera, which Xiaomi describes as “virtually invisible.” The camera is 20 megapixels and the display is a 6.67-inch 120Hz 1080p curved OLED panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky1XD1"&gt;Xiaomi says CUP is “a technology iterated through three major generations, five years, sixty patents, a $77 million investment, and hundreds of engineers.” Last year the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405241/xiaomi-under-display-selfie-camera-no-notch-hole-punch-2021-mass-production"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; to start mass-producing smartphones with its third-generation under-display camera technology in 2021, so it’s making good on that promise with the Mix 4. Xiaomi first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650166/xiaomi-under-display-selfie-camera-weibo-teaser-mi-9-notch-hole-punch"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; its take on the idea back in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JS4R8h5931q5lgahRKBbyHVS2HU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773053/Xiaomi_MIX_4_13.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MBQ0Ih"&gt;The Mix 4 is the first phone to be announced with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550723/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-cpu-ai-performance-mwc-2021"&gt;Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 Plus processor&lt;/a&gt;, a speed-bumped version of the flagship 888 chip with a top clock speed of 3GHz. (Honor did already say that it would use the 888 Plus in the Magic 3, but that phone is yet to be revealed in full.) The processor is paired with 8GB or 12GB of RAM and 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQ1Axr"&gt;The camera system centers around a 108-megapixel Samsung HMX sensor, suggesting similar or identical performance to the slightly outdated but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;still pretty good Mi 11&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also a 13-megapixel ultrawide and an 8-megapixel 5x periscope telephoto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tajwxO"&gt;The Mix 4 has a 4,500mAh battery that can charge at up to 120W wired and 50W wireless. This isn’t Xiaomi’s first phone with 120W fast-charging, but it might be the fastest — Xiaomi claims the battery will get a full charge in under 15 minutes, compared to 23 minutes for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363317/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-announcement-twitter-fast-charging"&gt;last year’s Mi 10 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. 50W wireless charging, meanwhile, will take 28 minutes to get you to 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgxMRA"&gt;Xiaomi will only confirm a mainland China launch for the Mix 4 so far. Preorders will start there tomorrow with general availability coming on August 16th, and the pricing starts at 4,999 yuan (~$770) for an 8GB/128GB model, going up to 6,299 yuan (~$970) for 12GB/512GB.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue’s $50 Icepop mic brings subtle improvements to some Logitech headsets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logitech Blue Icepop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7aLnFia2LUTCk6Z_5BKyiMTHqWk=/0x0:2056x1371/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703641/gproxicepop1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Icepop is compatible with the G Pro X Wireless, the G Pro X, G Pro, and Astro A40.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kGagu1"&gt;Not content with cornering the market with its USB microphones, the latest product from Logitech-owned Blue is a detachable mic called the Icepop. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluemic.com%2Ficepop&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F10%2F22612829%2Flogitech-blue-icepop-microphone-g-pro-x-wireless-gaming-headset" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s a $49.99 upgrade&lt;/a&gt; that can replace the default mics included with Logitech’s G Pro X Wireless gaming headset, the G Pro X, the G Pro, as well as Astro’s A40 headsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5Gjo1"&gt;Logitech is promising that the Icepop will deliver enhanced “broadcast-quality” performance with its 10mm electret condenser mic. It has a built-in pop filter that aims to eliminate those hard “b” or “p” sounds that can be a giveaway that you’re using a lesser mic, and its unidirectional cardioid pickup is said to eliminate background noise and focus more on your voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXxObM"&gt;Installing the Icepop is as simple as plugging it into one of the compatible headsets’ 3.5mm mic jack. Logitech sent over a G Pro X Wireless for testing, and there were no firmware or software updates required to get it working. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech Icepop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9bdgKTqn0l3vB7nvlSUPfQ9mgQg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766156/gproxicepop2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Icepop plugs into one of the compatible mics via 3.5mm jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NfHzF7"&gt;Now, yours truly isn’t a podcast host, so I don’t have preferred voice settings locked in for the times when I need to jump into a voice chat. But to illustrate how the recording quality differs between the Icepop and the default mic that ships with the G Pro X Wireless, I recorded several samples to show what they sound like with and without the special Blue Voice features built into Logitech’s G Hub software. If you’re using the Astro A40, you won’t be able to access the Blue Voice features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6kwBK"&gt;The first is a clean feed from the G Pro X Wireless default mic with no special voice presets via Blue Voice. (My voice sounds a little dull with this mic, and it’s relatively easy to hear my air conditioner running in the background once my voice stops near the end.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yrE8Ks"&gt;&lt;audio controls=""&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766084/gproxwirelessdefaultmic.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sslJH6"&gt;Here’s the default mic again but with Blue Voice turned on with the “Broadcaster 1” preset activated. (Background noise has been hushed, and my voice has much more depth, though it’s still not particularly warm-sounding.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hkig1g"&gt;&lt;audio controls=""&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766095/gproxwirelessdefaultmicbluevoice.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YDHFj0"&gt;Now, here’s how the Icepop sounds without any tweaks made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k8Dq2y"&gt;&lt;audio controls=""&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766097/icepopdefault.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bVQrg2"&gt;Lastly, here’s how the Icepop sounds with the same “Broadcaster 1” preset turned on in Blue Voice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sFSIms"&gt;&lt;audio controls=""&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766100/icepopbluevoice.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ehVM6u"&gt;After listening to the samples over and over, the difference in quality between Logitech’s default mic and the Icepop, while noticeable, isn’t as apparent as I was expecting considering its $49.99 cost. Of course, it’s not reasonable to expect this add-on to rival standalone microphones that cost more, and there are some things that I like about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5iQ6Y"&gt;The Icepop does a better job of accurately capturing what my voice sounds like in real life, replacing some of that shrill effect from the default mic with warmth. And those “b” and “p” sounds do sound great, as advertised, though I was surprised to hear it fumble a little when I made “x” and “s” sounds. That could be my slight lisp or it could be a flaw with the tuning or a limitation of the mic. Turning on the Blue Voice feature fixed most of my complaints, but I was expecting a little more out of the raw feed captured through the Icepop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9tPpiV"&gt;Given that voices have so much range and that hearing is, of course, subjective, I recommend giving this a try if you’re curious and already own one of the compatible headsets. Depending on how you like to gussy up your voice for chats, streams, or podcast appearances, you might be able to get some solid performance out of the Icepop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0mvab"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxoabH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rsutNN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
