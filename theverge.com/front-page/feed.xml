    <title>Elon Musk says the Biden administration shot down his carbon tax pitch</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TMg73D"&gt;Elon Musk says he pitched the Biden administration on instituting a carbon tax as a way to encourage a faster shift to renewable energy, but he was told the idea was essentially “too politically difficult.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4j7v3"&gt;Musk described the conversation with the Biden administration during &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2aB2swgyXqbFA06AxPlFmr?si=_8doDtUvSn-kkUNFE9Kp7w&amp;amp;nd=1"&gt;a new podcast with Joe Rogan that was released Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuMIU5"&gt;Rogan had asked Musk whether a new technological breakthrough is needed to increase the adoption of battery-powered vehicles. Musk argued the bigger issue is that “a hell of a lot of batteries [are] needed” in order to shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy. The best way to encourage that shift, in Musk’s view, is to “put a price on carbon.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="06as2e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Why don’t you just fight for that?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Zm0D4"&gt;“My top recommendation honestly would be just to have a carbon tax,” Musk said. “Because we’re not paying for the CO2 capacity of the oceans and atmosphere, we have what in economics is called an unpriced externality. The market is unable to respond to an unpriced externality. If we just put a price on it, the market will react in a sensible way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i53Q57"&gt;Musk suggested that consumers should pay the tax, and rebates could be offered to people who make lower incomes. A carbon tax could help further even the playing field for Tesla’s electric vehicles, though Musk said SpaceX (which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22245363/spacex-texas-oil-company-drill-natural-gas-lone-star"&gt;currently trying to acquire natural gas wells in Texas to fuel its rockets&lt;/a&gt;) would have to pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41WwFE"&gt;“I talked to the Biden administration, the incoming administration, and they were like, ‘Well, this seems too politically difficult,’” he said. Musk said he remembers thinking, “That’s at least half the reason you go elected, so why don’t you just fight for that?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDlexr"&gt;This isn’t the first time the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has agitated for a carbon tax. Musk reportedly floated the idea during early meetings with the Trump administration but got “little or no support,” &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-26/tesla-s-musk-said-to-float-idea-of-a-carbon-tax-to-trump-ceos"&gt;according to a 2017 report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjijUN"&gt;Musk has even &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/05/elon-musk-we-need-a-revolt-against-the-fossil-fuel-industry"&gt;previously called for a “revolt” against the fossil fuel industry&lt;/a&gt; while making the case for a carbon tax, and he &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-23/musk-suggests-big-oil-is-behind-critical-media-coverage-of-tesla"&gt;accused big oil companies of conspiring against Tesla&lt;/a&gt;. But he said on Rogan’s podcast that he is “not in favor of demonizing the oil and gas industry” because it would upset the people working in it, and also stopping its operations completely would mean everyone would “die of starvation, basically.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOKstJ"&gt;“We’re gonna need to burn fossil fuels for a long time. The question is just at what rate do we move to a sustainable energy future?” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="yC1Vhs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Musk said he’s “not in favor of demonizing the oil and gas industry” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RqOrwW"&gt;“There are people who have spent their whole career in oil, and gas and they started out in that career when it didn’t seem like that bad of a thing to do. So then they’re like, ‘Hey man, I just spent my whole career working hard to do useful things, and now you’re telling me I’m the devil.’ That’s gonna make them pretty upset,” he said, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-elon-musk-oil-and-gas-industry-2020-9"&gt;echoing remarks from late last year&lt;/a&gt;. “Honestly the smartest thing the oil and gas industry could do is say, ‘Let’s do a carbon tax. We’ll just do a carbon tax, and it will make us not the devil.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwY20t"&gt;One of Biden’s main campaign planks was his support for an aggressive clean energy strategy. He committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324575/joe-biden-jobs-climate-change-plan-energy-elections"&gt;eliminating carbon pollution from the power sector by 2035&lt;/a&gt; and reaching a “100 percent clean energy economy” no later than 2050. He even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324575/joe-biden-jobs-climate-change-plan-energy-elections"&gt;voiced support for ending fossil fuel subsidies&lt;/a&gt;. And since taking office, he has recommitted the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22239441/us-paris-agreement-rejoin-climate-change-joe-biden"&gt;to the Paris climate accord&lt;/a&gt;. But he has not committed to a carbon tax, despite agitation from &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/21/biden-infrastructure-plan-carbon-tax.html"&gt;other business leaders close to the administration&lt;/a&gt; and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who said &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/yellen-biden-carbon-pricing-energy-emissions-eee629c7-b4db-4f95-9d98-874269efdddd.html"&gt;the climate crisis can’t be solved without carbon pricing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra might have a tiny rear-facing display as a treat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rzry1JyEJDhay7pYddsSyxQ1QF4=/233x0:2633x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810744/screen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A YouTuber claims to have the unannounced Mi 11 Ultra featuring a 1-inch rear-facing screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXm4cCkjikHqZYY5YUVY_GQ" target="_blank"&gt;Tech Buff PH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0lkk74"&gt;A YouTuber has posted a video featuring what he claims are two prototype Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra devices, suggesting the phone might have an unusual feature: a 1-inch rear-facing screen right next to the cameras. The video shows this small screen displaying what looks like an image of the phone’s home screen, only... you know, microscopic. A more practical application might be for selfies using the rear-facing camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIr9WI"&gt;The video, since taken down, comes from a little-known Filipino vlogger who goes by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXm4cCkjikHqZYY5YUVY_GQ"&gt;Tech Buff PH&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-11-ultra-leak-120x-zoom-secondary-screen/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; the device model number checks out, and certain details align with previous leaks. Other details from this alleged leak include 67W fast wireless charging, a 6.8-inch curved OLED with an adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz, a 5,000mAh battery, and IP68 water and dust resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OHZ7Z5MDhlVBwSfjD6KkPn5m6QI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22300240/cameras.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tech Buff PH&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The device shows three cameras, including a periscope-style lens with 120x hybrid zoom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7iJtUE"&gt;The alleged devices include a huge camera bump with a 120x hybrid zoom camera, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363317/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-announcement-twitter-fast-charging"&gt;last year’s Mi 10 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a 50-megapixel main camera. If this phone is indeed the Mi 11 Ultra, then it looks like Xiaomi ditched the 2x telephoto lens on the previous model, offering just the longer periscope-style zoom lens instead. There’s also a 12mm ultrawide, which Tech Buff PH claims has a 48-megapixel sensor, upgraded from 12 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bseVcE"&gt;Xiaomi announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202973/xiaomi-mi-11-flagship-announced-chinese-variant"&gt;Chinese variant&lt;/a&gt; of the standard Mi 11 at the end of 2020, and more recently, it unveiled an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272003/xiaomi-mi-11-international-price-release-date-announcement"&gt;international version&lt;/a&gt;. Both feature a top-of-the-line Snapdragon 888 processor offering 5G connectivity. With those versions announced, Xiaomi will likely follow with other variants such as the alleged Ultra version featured here. Whether this device will shape up to be the real deal remains to be seen, but it’s an interesting concept to consider in either case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etz9aA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s $329 RTX 3060 graphics card is launching on February 25th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fHFJDDfAxVVuOMjFuruygt6xecM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810679/acastro_180529_1777_nvidia_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S1ooUb"&gt;We already knew &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226546/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Nvidia was making a $329 RTX 3060 graphics card&lt;/a&gt;, and today, the company announced that it will make its most affordable GPU in the RTX 3000 series available at retailers beginning on February 25th. Retailers will open orders for the RTX 3060 starting at 9AM PT / 12PM ET. Nvidia tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it will not be creating a Founder’s Edition of the RTX 3060 graphics card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fstpRG"&gt;Designed to succeed the aging GeForce GTX 1060 Pascal cards, the RTX 3060 features 12GB of GDDR6 memory. Like the other products featured in the RTX 3000 series, the RTX 3060 will also support DLSS and Nvidia’s suite of RTX applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qXPsa"&gt;With a new RTX 30 card coming later this month, we anticipate that the RTX 3060 GPU will sell out &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt;. These cards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228470/nvidia-evga-zotac-raise-prices-rtx-3080-3070-3060-3090"&gt;have been difficult to purchase&lt;/a&gt; since last fall when the RTX 30 series first debuted. In January, Nvidia said it anticipates supply for its GPUs to both consumers and partners “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;will likely remain lean through Q1&lt;/a&gt;,” which doesn’t end until late April. To alleviate the short supply and sky-high prices, Nvidia confirmed yesterday that it plans to bring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278562/nvidia-rtx-2060-gtx-1050-ti-gpu-shortage-global-chip"&gt;back its older RTX 2060 and GTX 1050 Ti graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches an augmented reality app to promote For All Mankind on Apple TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PRlv6-X2STPR9kjJD-TEpNuZrJg=/167x0:2066x1266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810589/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_11.53.08_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wzhgrz"&gt;Apple is gearing up for the release of &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt; season 2 on Apple TV Plus. It’s kicking things off with a new augmented reality app, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F02%2Ffor-all-mankind-time-capsule-a-new-augmented-reality-experience-based-on-the-apple-tv-space-drama-is-available-today-in-the-app-store%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F12%2F22278780%2Fapple-augmented-reality-ar-app-for-all-mankind-tv-plus#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;: Time Capsule&lt;/a&gt;, that looks to fill in the gap between the two seasons using AR artifacts from the world of the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYaejE"&gt;The app itself is a fun promotional gimmick to help promote the second season of one of Apple’s higher-profile original shows. It’s the broader strategy at play that’s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F-A2SPv3VJ5iEzKRt16P48rg6ZY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22300211/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_11.53.26_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JJNJeK"&gt;It’s no secret that Apple is interested in AR. The recurring AR demos at the last several iPhone and iPad product announcements, the addition of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21185200/apple-ipad-pro-lidar-sensor-ar-hardware-solution-software-apps-augmented-reality"&gt;AR-focused LIDAR cameras&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;latest iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro devices&lt;/a&gt;, and the persistent rumors of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;pending VR / AR headsets&lt;/a&gt; are all clear evidence of that. And Apple has been &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-26/apple-plans-augmented-reality-content-to-boost-tv-video-service?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;rumored to be working&lt;/a&gt; on the tie-in app for a while now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bcDepD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s rumored VR headset could cost $3,000, feature 8K displays and over a dozen cameras","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7Jd0Y0"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;: Time Capsule is one of the first indications of Apple tying all of its hardware, content, and service ambitions together. It’s an augmented reality app downloaded from the App Store that prompts users to subscribe to Apple TV Plus to watch &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;, with additional content for LIDAR-equipped Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ChQU3"&gt;It’s the kind of cross-promotional content that spans Apple’s wide array of businesses. It could also offer a glimpse at the kind of integrated hardware, software, and service bundle that Apple could be considering for any future AR devices. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sex and the City is now available in HD for the first time on HBO Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mAnpitTvj8WmQx7KLbDDvFRfW-8=/60x0:708x432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810387/cq5dam.web.768.432.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: HBO&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v5P22e"&gt;A newly remastered version of &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; is now available to stream on &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=SexCityHD021221"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, WarnerMedia announced on Friday. Thanks to the remaster, you can watch the hit show in a high-definition 16:9 aspect ratio for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enIPUF"&gt;“The series was originally shot on film and mastered in standard definition as high definition capabilities were unavailable at the time of filming,” &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/media-release/newly-remastered-hd-version-sex-and-city-now-available-hbo-max"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Over the past year, the series was updated from scratch as film negatives from the show were meticulously scanned at 4K to create HD masters.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="JfZzgH"&gt;The new HD remasters arrive ahead of a “new chapter” of &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; coming to &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=SexCityHD021221"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, called “And Just Like That...” Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, and Kristin Davis are set to reprise their roles as Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte, but playing the characters in their 50s. WarnerMedia has already given the series a &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/sarah-jessica-parker-cynthia-nixon-and-kristin-davis-star-max-original-series-and?language_content_entity=en"&gt;10-episode order&lt;/a&gt; and says it will begin production in New York City this spring.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s new Mario-themed Switch is available now</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nintendo Switch Mario Red &amp;amp; Blue Edition | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QwoMeU"&gt;Alongside the release of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-3D-World-Bowsers-Fury/dp/B08H9M7LDY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the Nintendo Switch, several retailers have a Mario Red &amp;amp; Blue Edition Switch game console available for purchase. You can buy one right now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Mario-Red-Blue/dp/B08M8YQMH4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1732041273955221131" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-mario-red-and-blue-edition%2F11114028.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-mario-red-38-blue-edition%2F-%2FA-82242753%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGb5kj"&gt;Similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21116081/nintendo-animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-unique-joy-con-colors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;-themed Switch released last year&lt;/a&gt;, this limited-edition console stands out from other models, with the entire Switch and its accompanying accessories based on the outfit typically worn by the mustached plumber. Retailing for $300, the limited-edition Switch features an all-red console, a red dock stand, a pair of red Joy-Cons, a red casing around the screen, and a blue Joy-Con grip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AvudIO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10338949"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1HC5Y2"&gt;Additionally, for $300, the Mario-themed Switch also includes a screen protector and a special carrying case that includes various symbols associated with the &lt;em&gt;Mario&lt;/em&gt; franchise at no additional cost. The Nintendo Switch included with the bundle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697601/nintendo-switch-new-model-battery-life-improvements"&gt;is the updated model&lt;/a&gt;, which includes two more hours of battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jg2C5x"&gt;If you are planning to buy this console, there are a few things to keep in mind. Firstly, the device does not include a copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;, despite both products having the same release date. Secondly, these limited-edition Nintendo Switch consoles tend to sell out quickly, and there’s no telling if and when it will be restocked. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read about how Facebook’s pseudo-Supreme Court came together</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SlEdJ2Wf8bxr1drFgmpaP9VOtnY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810210/VRG_ILLO_4033_007.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qfiutq"&gt;Can Facebook meaningfully have a Supreme Court?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSUolY"&gt;The title of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftech%2Fannals-of-technology%2Finside-the-making-of-facebooks-supreme-court&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F12%2F22280003%2Ffacebook-oversight-board-supreme-court-feature-new-yorker#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new feature in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;written by law professor Kate Klonick, implies that the answer is &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;. The story is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGpKKX"&gt;The feature is called “Inside the making of Facebook’s Supreme Court,” and it’s an unprecedentedly detailed look at the Facebook Oversight Board, a Facebook-funded semi-independent panel that can overrule Facebook takedown decisions. The Oversight Board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21530524/facebooks-new-oversight-board-platform-governance"&gt;launched in October&lt;/a&gt;, and it issued its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254155/facebook-oversight-board-first-rulings-coronavirus-misinformation-hate-speech"&gt;first decisions in January&lt;/a&gt;, saying Facebook had made the wrong call on four removed posts. In the coming months, it will make its highest-profile decision to date: whether Facebook should &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242616/facebook-refers-decision-suspend-trump-oversight-board"&gt;restore the account&lt;/a&gt; of former president Donald Trump. But as Klonick lays out, its actual power is complex and contested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C5dFK6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Employees worried a powerful court could accidentally kill Facebook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7hHWm0"&gt;Klonick writes candidly about months of heated debate over how the Oversight Board should function. Internally, Facebook employees worried that if the board could write policy, it might make a decision that destroyed Facebook: what if, one person speculated, it told Facebook to get rid of the News Feed? Externally, it faced pressure from conservative politicians. One group reportedly asked Facebook to add Trump’s children to the Oversight Board, and when the members were announced, Trump apparently called CEO Mark Zuckerberg to rail against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2P2nXp"&gt;But the biggest power struggle in the story isn’t any individual policy decision; it’s the protracted attempt to legitimize a Facebook quasi-government. Interestingly, Klonick &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Klonick/status/1360257727671468032"&gt;mentioned on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook “hated” the Supreme Court framing — even if “that’s how the public thinks of it.” But Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17187974/mark-zuckerberg-community-content-removal-appeal-vox-interview"&gt;mused about a system&lt;/a&gt; “like a Supreme Court” in 2018, and Klonick notes that the board’s charter was referred to internally as a “constitution.” In perhaps the story’s funniest detail, members “used pens topped with a feather, to evoke the quills used by the Founding Fathers.” (Sadly, “topped” implies they wouldn’t commit to &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; quill pens.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50iwJQ"&gt;Parts of the story’s framing have drawn objections from some critics and legal scholars. After all, the board doesn’t have formal legal power — it exists because Facebook is voluntarily abiding by its rules. “Facebook and others have been appropriating legal/civic language and frameworks from the beginning. It has always, ALWAYS been about declaring legitimacy,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jwherrman/status/1360247786197901313"&gt;tweeted &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reporter&lt;/a&gt; John Herrman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OrNT79"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Should we use the language of government for Facebook?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WPc2EG"&gt;That legitimacy comes partly from Facebook’s ability to pull critics into its orbit. Knight First Amendment Institute director Jameel Jaffer tells Klonick he turned down a spot on the board, and he’s anxious that Facebook is “co-opting” people who might push for change from the outside. Journalist and professor Zeynep Tufekci &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1360249282645929985"&gt;notes that&lt;/a&gt; the Oversight Board could meaningfully improve moderation, but “it is being rolled out BY FACEBOOK as part of a PR push, with Facebook trying to elbow it into a position where we treat it as a ‘Supreme Court’ despite the obvious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKAsYR"&gt;The Trump case will put the Oversight Board and its limitations in the spotlight. (The Knight Institute has asked it to delay the decision &lt;a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/facebook-oversight-board-should-delay-ruling-on-suspension-of-trump-knight-institute-says"&gt;for an outside review&lt;/a&gt;.) And it will do so as Congress looks at whether to regulate Facebook the old-fashioned way — with a government the social giant &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; build.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Notion was having technical issues, so I have no idea what my schedule is today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I3IReCnAx8bGX_0yMHSZ0T1y1mc=/0x62:1000x729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810108/akrales_180824_2908_0071_squ.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;This shows what Notion looks like when it is working | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZBKAre"&gt;Online organization app Notion was experiencing technical difficulties this morning and students, project managers, and other users — like me — who rely on it to organize our calendars are having minor freak-outs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20MJIG"&gt;The company said in a tweet around 8:30AM ET that it was “experiencing a DNS issue, causing the site to not resolve for many users.” The company didn’t provide much additional detail, but some speculated that it may have to do with Notion’s web address: notion.so. The “so” suffix is the domain for the country of Somalia, and a deleted tweet from Notion asked if anyone knew people in Somalia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iC4zji"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're experiencing a DNS issue, causing the site to not resolve for many users. We are actively looking into this issue.&lt;/p&gt;— Notion Status (@NotionStatus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NotionStatus/status/1360220589743480838?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wuDIdy"&gt;The app is mainly used as a workplace collaboration tool, but it has become popular among casual users — including teens on TikTok, who use it to organize their class schedules. Users complaining about not being able to access Notion on Friday morning suggested now might be the time for the company, which was &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/notion-hits-2-billion-valuation-in-new-raise/"&gt;valued at $2 billion&lt;/a&gt; in April 2020, to make offline access a priority in future versions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="513mQB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"TikTok teens’ latest passion is enterprise software","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215782/tiktok-notion-enterprise-software-teen-studyblr"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3TqG3z"&gt;Around 11AM ET, the company said the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NotionStatus/status/1360257098781659137?s=20"&gt;DNS issue was resolved&lt;/a&gt; and users should begin to see service restored. The company confirmed it was putting protections in place to prevent future issues in an emailed statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="tRBvd6"&gt;The reason for the downtime this morning was a very unusual DNS issue that occurred at the registry operator level. Our engineers jumped on it immediately and resolved the issue - we’re back up now. We’re in touch with the registry operator and registrar putting protocols in place so that we can avoid this type of incident from repeating in the future. This was a very rare chain of events to occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wNLnDQ"&gt;So far my Notion page is still down, so if I’m late to a Zoom meeting today, sorry boss, I tried. I mean, what are we supposed to do, write down our to-do lists on paper like olden times? (I do that, too, tbh. I have organization issues). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOx9X7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTHLcX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Z9Ulx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this article about how we got duped into cooking with gas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Blue natural gas flame on a domestic cooker gas hob." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zAcZu8JJGaQumdYHygC_AA95qxo=/0x0:4689x3126/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68809927/971550326.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Blue natural gas flame on a domestic cooker gas hob. | Photo by: Arterra/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bl00lP"&gt;I spend a lot of time fretting about how my home might be slowly killing me. As an environmental journalist, it’s part of my job to be hyper aware of any toxins that could be lurking around me. Lately, my gas stove has me especially worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFfwQe"&gt;I didn’t think much about the hazards of cooking with a gas stove in the past because, like a lot of people, I’ve been bombarded with ad campaigns from the natural gas industry since I was a kid. &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/how-the-fossil-fuel-industry-convinced-americans-to-love-gas-stoves/"&gt;Recent reporting from Rebecca Leber at &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; exposes how insidious that influence has been. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tIpZTA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gas stoves actually unleash indoor air pollutants&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fj2aqN"&gt;Gas stoves actually &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/5/7/21247602/gas-stove-cooking-indoor-air-pollution-health-risks"&gt;unleash indoor air pollutants&lt;/a&gt; like soot, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Beyond that, greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels like natural gas drive climate change. That’s why there’s a push now to electrify homes; electric stoves can run on clean energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Esi8pN"&gt;The history of how “cooking with gas” campaigns have made a source of fossil fuel combustion in our homes seem completely innocuous gets pretty ridiculous. Leber dug up a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJRQo5aawho&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;rap video&lt;/a&gt; from 1988 that spends an entire four minutes hyping up gas stoves in rhyme. “Gas is so hot, it’s not on when it’s off / it’s the only way to cook, that’s what I was taught,” the rap starts off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvkA7h"&gt;Fast forward to about two minutes into the video, however, and there’s a disclaimer in the lyrics that my colleague Sean O’Kane noticed: “Safe cooking begins with range location / avoid main traffic paths and also isolation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="QTSseV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;gas groups pay social media influencers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="izOhnj"&gt;Today, gas groups pay social media influencers to advertise the supposed benefits of cooking with the fossil fuel, &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2020/06/gas-industry-influencers-stoves/"&gt;Leber reports&lt;/a&gt;. A public relations representative even posed as a resident in a neighborhood to stir up backlash against building codes that would discourage natural gas hookups in new construction, she writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXr4f8"&gt;You have to read the truly bizarre and alarming history of gas that Leber traces in her article. With many of us spending more time working and hanging out at home during the pandemic, it’s more important than ever to be aware of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21325753/spending-time-at-home-health-effects-pandemic-great-indoors"&gt;what we’re exposed to inside&lt;/a&gt; the place that’s supposed to be our refuge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ONORB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Q8HrW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon sues to block state investigation of New York warehouse labor fight</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PC8hRT"&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299769/amazon_vs_letitia_james.pdf"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the New York state attorney general’s office as a preemptive effort to prevent legal action over the company’s handling of COVID-19 conditions at a Staten Island warehouse last spring. Amazon is seeking an injunction preventing the attorney general’s office from trying to exercise “regulatory authority over workplace safety responses to COVID-19 and claims of retaliation against workers who protest working conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpGYSa"&gt;Workers at Amazon’s JKF8 warehouse said last March that they didn’t have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;necessary protective equipment&lt;/a&gt; and were not informed when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21194739/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-covid-19-outraged-informed"&gt;co-workers tested positive&lt;/a&gt; for the virus. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21233891/amazon-coronavirus-protest-sick-out-tech-workers-climate-justice"&gt;fired several workers who protested&lt;/a&gt; the conditions, including Chris Smalls, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;organized a walkout in March&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGfROt"&gt;The company said Smalls was fired for violating social distancing guidelines, not for protesting. New York &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2020/ag-james-statement-firing-amazon-worker-who-organized-walkout"&gt;Attorney General Letitia James called Smalls’ firing “disgraceful”&lt;/a&gt; at the time and pushed for an investigation by the National Labor Relations Board. In April, five US Senators &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/8/21214117/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-senator-booker-chris-smalls-senators-letter"&gt;wrote a letter to Amazon&lt;/a&gt; questioning its handling of Smalls’ dismissal. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/technology/amazon-coronavirus-whistleblowers.html"&gt;Amazon said at the time&lt;/a&gt; that the workers “were not terminated for talking publicly about working conditions” but for violating safety policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hvBXA"&gt;In its complaint, Amazon argues that James’ office “lacks the legal authority” to demand legal remedies such as surrender of profit, instead claiming that the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has jurisdiction over any workplace safety claims brought under New York labor laws. In addition, the lawsuit claims, the National Labor Relations Board would have authority over Smalls and other employees’ claims of retaliation, not the attorney general’s office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqrn9T"&gt;The lawsuit claims the Staten Island facility passed an inspection by the sheriff’s office of New York on March 30th, which found that the workers’ safety complaints were “baseless.” The company claims it conducts regular temperature checks, provides staggered shifts, and promotes social distancing at the warehouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jmk35"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, James called Amazon’s lawsuit “nothing more than a sad attempt to distract from the facts and shirk accountability for its failures to protect hardworking employees from a deadly virus.” She added her office would “not be initimidated by anyone, especially corporate bullies that put profits over the health and safety of working people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XC52Fl"&gt;An Amazon spokesperson said Friday that since its complaint was very detailed it was not providing further comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xK8C9t"&gt;During its second-quarter earnings announcement last April, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21243112/amazon-q1-2020-earnings-covid-19-coronavirus-jeff-bezos"&gt;pledged to spend $4 billion&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the impact of COVID-19, but complaints from warehouse and other Amazon workers continued; in May, a French court shut down Amazon’s warehouses in the country after labor unions said the company wasn’t doing enough to protect them from the virus. And in June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246284/amazon-vp-resign-whistleblower-firings-warehouse-workers"&gt;a prominent Amazon vice president resigned&lt;/a&gt; from the company, accusing it in a scathing public blog post of ignoring the “the human costs of the relentless growth and accumulation of wealth and power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqgpG8"&gt;Amazon said in its fourth-quarter earnings report earlier this month that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22260133/amazon-q4-2020-quarterly-earnings-jeff-bezos-ceo-transition-andy-jassy"&gt;full-year 2020 net sales were up 38 percent&lt;/a&gt; to $386.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
