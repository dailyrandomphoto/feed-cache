    <title>YouTube will ask commenters to rethink posting if their message seems offensive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JKI8adtg2Ztzwsbgcg8jXS37J4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449820/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HBFLa3"&gt;YouTube is trying to combat offensive comments that appear under videos by following in the footsteps of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286855/twitter-articles-prompt-unread-feature-conversations"&gt;other social media companies&lt;/a&gt; and asking people before they post something that may be offensive: “Is this something you really want to share?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s15mkm"&gt;The company is launching a new product feature that will warn people when they’re going to post a comment that it “may be offensive to others,” in order to give them “the option to reflect before posting,” according to a new blog post. The tool won’t actually stop people from posting said comment. Prompts won’t appear before every comment, but it will for ones that YouTube’s system deems offensive, which is based on content that’s been repeatedly reported. Once the prompt does appear, people can post the comment as they originally intended or use additional time to edit the comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpeEwr"&gt;For creators, the company is also rolling out better content filtering systems in YouTube Studio (the backend where creators manage their channel). The new filter will seek out inappropriate or hurtful comments that were automatically flagged and held for review, and remove them from the queue so people don’t have to read them. The new feature will roll out on Android first and in English before appearing elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPSdLv"&gt;There’s no question that YouTube has a problem with hurtful comments on the site, but one of the bigger issues is hateful comments. Through automatic filtering, the company has removed over 46 times more daily hate speech comments since early 2019 than ever before, according to YouTube. Then there’s videos. YouTube claims that of the 1.8 million channels terminated last quarter, more than 54,000 were due to hate speech. Those were the most bans for hate speech content in a single quarter that YouTube has seen, and three times as high than in early 2019 when new hate speech policies went into effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zLBwRn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hateful speech and hurtful comments are just some of the problems that greatly affect the creator community&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eVck9F"&gt;YouTube is also trying to combat other issues affecting creators, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449717/youtube-age-restriction-machine-learning-rollout-kids-content-monetization-creators"&gt;monetization&lt;/a&gt;, bias, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/21/17879652/youtube-creator-youtuber-burnout-problem"&gt;burnout&lt;/a&gt;, and channel growth concerns. To better understand how different communities are impacted, the company will start to ask YouTubers to voluntarily supply information about their gender, sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity beginning in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ks4zXc"&gt;The goal is to use the data to pinpoint how different communities are treated both in terms of discovery on the platform and when it comes to monetization. The LGBTQ creator community &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21278050/youtube-lawsuit-lgbtq-google-doj-section-230-trump-executive-order"&gt;has consistently said&lt;/a&gt; that YouTube’s systems automatically demonetize their content or hide their videos, and they have publicly fought against the treatment they receive. YouTube’s teams also want to use the data to find “possible patterns of hate, harassment, and discrimination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsVu1T"&gt;One of the biggest questions is how that data will be used and stored once it’s collected. YouTube’s blog post states that the survey will outline how the information will be applied to the company’s research and what control creators retain over their data. The blog post as it stands does not specify that now. Instead, the company states that information will not be used for advertising purposes. People will also retain the ability to opt out and delete their information whenever they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aa6jQV"&gt;“If we find any issues in our systems that impact specific communities, we’re committed to working to fix them,” the blog post reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7xTav"&gt;There’s no current timeline for when the surveys will roll out, but more information about the project will be released in early 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Microsoft crushed Slack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/euTGg6BbDC8-dN9I1MEiCObXSLA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449684/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / Th&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WhCi46"&gt;Slack’s life as an underdog darling of Silicon Valley ended on November 2nd, 2016. That’s when the upstart communication startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad"&gt;published an open letter to Microsoft in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, offering the tech giant an insincere “welcome” to the world of workplace chat software. The occasion was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13405200/microsoft-teams-slack-competitor-launch"&gt;Microsoft’s launch of Teams&lt;/a&gt;, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDfNQi"&gt;In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding, “We’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;took Teams from zero to 115 million users&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z6b1wI"&gt;That disparity helps to explain why &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html"&gt;Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce&lt;/a&gt;. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/salesforce-acquires-slack-salesforces-reasoning-salesforces-opportunity/"&gt;offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5nRQry"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wzqXxm"&gt;But it also feels like the end of an era, one where workers gained new power to bring their own tools to the office and decide for themselves how they wanted to get work done. Slack first succeeded with small teams who wanted to accelerate their work and was often dragged into organizations by early adoption. But today, waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2Obsc"&gt;The rise of smartphones in the early 2010s brought with it a new surge of workplace productivity tools that made mincemeat of everything that had come before them. Box and Dropbox brought easy file storage and sharing. Evernote introduced the idea of ubiquitous, cloud-synchronized note-taking. Sunrise created a more social calendar, while Mailbox and Acompli reimagined email for the mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZZcJp"&gt;Slack tiptoed into the conversation in the middle of the decade and almost immediately became the fastest-growing enterprise software tool of all time. In 2015, just 18 months after it launched, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8836087/slack-1-million-daily-users"&gt;Slack reported having more than 1 million daily users&lt;/a&gt; — a figure then unheard of in enterprise software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUzVVw"&gt;It had a great backstory — a last-ditch pivot from a failed video game called &lt;em&gt;Glitch&lt;/em&gt; — and, in Stewart Butterfield, one of the tech world’s most charming founders. It also had a bold pitch: it was going to “kill email” — or, at the very least, reduce your reliance on it — and it would do so by integrating hundreds of other services into real-time work chat, creating a kind of all-knowing command console for your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2NpF8"&gt;The company embodied the belief, so common in Silicon Valley, that the best product would win in the end. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” the company wrote in its open letter to Microsoft. “How far you go in helping companies truly transform to take advantage of this shift in working is even more important than the individual software features you are duplicating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WlwJG9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; that this was the outcome for Slack&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uRlRnj"&gt;And yet, if there’s a lesson of the past four years, it’s that thoughtfulness and craftsmanship only got the company about 10 percent as far as Microsoft did by copy-pasting Slack’s basic design. In its open letter, Slack famously told Microsoft: “You’ve got to do this with love.” In 2020, looking at Slack’s size, the idea seems laughable. What’s love got to do with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Une4h"&gt;The thing is, I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; that this was the outcome for Slack. I love good productivity tools and was rooting for Slack to someday become as good as the company hyped it up to be. (And perhaps it still will: like most giants, Salesforce has a mixed track record when it comes to the success of its acquisitions, but some seem to be thriving. When I asked about this on Twitter, people had &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1333891286185644032?s=21"&gt;a lot of good things to say about post-acquisition Heroku&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xau72"&gt;But Slack’s struggle to succeed as an independent company sadly mirrors that of many one-time innovators in enterprise productivity. Mailbox died, and Acompli sold to Microsoft where it became the mobile Outlook app. Evernote is a pale shadow of its former self. Of that early cohort, only Box and Dropbox became — and still remain — public companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKNXAY"&gt;Why is this the case? To get some insight, I called up Aaron Levie, Box’s affable CEO. In Levie’s telling — and he also wrote &lt;a href="https://blog.box.com/salesforce-slack-and-future-work"&gt;a blog post about the Slack acquisition&lt;/a&gt; — it all comes down to sales. The idea that workers would someday choose all their own tools was always a fantasy, he told me, in part because most workers don’t even want to think about their tools. In such a world, the winning app will almost always be one with a giant, er... salesforce behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6R8FdL"&gt;Microsoft had one. Slack didn’t. Enter Salesforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwQ4wc"&gt;“The reality with the enterprise is that you can have the best product, but that’s not good enough,” Levie told me. “You need distribution. And what Salesforce has — they have the procurement officers, they have the finance people. They have all of the apparatus you need to interact with to sell software, and they have it for the top 100,000 corporations around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOuJST"&gt;Levie is bullish on the acquisition because it puts Slack and Salesforce on more even ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6nrAt"&gt;“The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage that Microsoft has had,” he said. “All of a sudden, they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity, because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5KLOrq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable or Notion or Coda?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OKVptR"&gt;Assuming Levie is right — and I wouldn’t bet against him — that means the medium-term future of work is increasingly a choice between three giants: Microsoft, Salesforce, and (in a distant third) Google. And with that, the golden age of worker choice in productivity tools seems to be coming to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cja2AV"&gt;That’s not to say that the incumbents won’t always face new challengers. But I wonder whether the low ceiling that Slack turned out to have has implications for some of the other fast-growing productivity companies of the current moment. Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable or Notion or Coda? Don’t get me wrong — I’m confident their investors will all get their money back, and then some — but do they have a real future outside the arms of a monolith?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSKlsx"&gt;If not, then the productivity market will become as consolidated as any number of other spaces on the internet, from app stores to search engines to social networks. And as our government antitrust regulators begin to awaken after a long period of hibernation, I wonder if they’ll have anything to say about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPOuVk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose ‘Sport Open Earbuds’ with ear hooks appear at FCC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cNDjKx5AEE607MeEioucYXWGgYg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449603/BoseOpen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: FCC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9sTRKY"&gt;It looks like Bose is planning another set of true wireless earbuds to join its QuietComfort and Sport Earbuds. Today, filings for the “Sport Open Earbuds” &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/A94109R"&gt;have appeared at the Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; — with plenty of photos of the unannounced product contained within. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJT3e4"&gt;The design makes clear that Bose is going for a fitness-first set of earbuds here, with a completely open, plastic exterior that seems to just rest against your ear. It’s held in place by an ear hook, and there’s a button visible at the bottom of each earbud. A charger for the Sport Open Earbuds is also seen in the filing. The product name is confirmed several times in the documentation and is visible on the labels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xlm8b1y6NVGstxUKwo2EMrPF2tw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141550/Screen_Shot_2020_12_03_at_12.17.12_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: FCC&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XLdHwF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Bose for more details on the Sport Open Earbuds. The Sport Earbuds released earlier this year cost $159, but they’ve got an in-ear design with silicone tips. This open alternative could be more targeted at people who don't like how earbuds feel and want greater awareness of their surroundings when running or during other fitness activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48OKJ6"&gt;There’s a lot we don’t know yet about the Sport Open Earbuds like battery life, sweat resistance rating, and how this totally open style will actually &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; compared to the company’s more traditional earbuds. But it might be worth holding off on your next purchase of fitness buds until we get the full story.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon now lets you text Alexa on iOS to ask for things instead of only using your voice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bq38Bgg-cWgI9IMVIOFLQouI9q0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449526/acastro_180510_1777_alexa_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mVMJ7w"&gt;Amazon is testing a new feature for its iOS Alexa app: the ability to type out Alexa commands, instead of having to ask questions or requests by speaking out loud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04yLIB"&gt;“Type with Alexa is a Public Preview feature available to iOS Alexa app customers allowing you to interact with Alexa without using voice, meaning everything you can currently say to Alexa can now also be typed using your Alexa mobile app. Type with Alexa is available to iOS customers in the U.S.,” said an Amazon spokesperson. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4-FQ4-QZGN0KR37kVM7MCFoTkUE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141390/Untitled.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5VVPli"&gt;The new feature — &lt;a href="https://www.the-ambient.com/news/type-with-alexa-new-keyboard-feature-2435"&gt;first spotted by &lt;em&gt;The Ambient&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — is available for iOS users in the Alexa app. To access it, simply tap the keyboard icon that now appears on the top left of the main menu of the app. The typed-out commands should work identically to verbal ones, although Amazon notes that it’s still a public preview, and Alexa is “still getting the hang of it.” In other words, there might be a bug or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUhBEU"&gt;Being able to type out your requests to a digital assistant isn’t a new idea (both Google Assistant and Apple’s Siri have offered it for years), but it’s good to see that Amazon is working to offer a similar option for Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yd8nbC"&gt;For now, Type with Alexa is available in public preview for iOS users. Amazon has yet to say when it’ll be releasing a final version of the feature or when it will be available on other platforms like Android. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Five new Android features coming this winter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L6eGCSbMHKYx4B3aJHEMcWZpaR4=/1304x0:4906x2401/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449450/Android_feature_winter.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New features coming for Google Maps, Gboard, Voice Access, Google Play Books, and Nearby Share.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OwKvTW"&gt;Google is rolling out five new Android features in the weeks ahead that enhance Maps navigation, Gboard emoji mashups, Voice Access, Google Play audiobooks, and Nearby Share file sharing. Google is also making Android Auto available in 36 more countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elcP0P"&gt;To start with, Google is giving Maps a new Go tab that lets you quickly navigate to favorite places without entering the address. Pin driving destinations to school or work, for example, and the Go tab will show directions, live traffic and disruptions, and an estimated arrival time. You can also pin your favorite public transport route to see departure and arrival times and any delays right from the tab. Google suggests pinning both driving and public transport options to the same destination to see which will get your there faster. The Go tab will start rolling out to Android and iOS devices “in the coming weeks,” according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o8FaD_OxNSmpuVhWpC0GD6zWN28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140893/maps_go.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quickly access pinned destinations in new Go tab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rxB2vT"&gt;Next up, Google is expanding those custom emoji sticker mashups available on Gboard from a few hundred unique combinations to more than 14,000. The so-called Emoji Kitchen now lets you tap two emoji to see suggested combinations, or double a single emoji to see “more intense” variations. Available already on &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.inputmethod.latin"&gt;Gboard beta&lt;/a&gt;, Google says the new Emoji Kitchen will be available on Android 6.0 and above “over the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WIuGGrfI_pEc6j0jxfP6TKxPEFg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140894/gif_mashup.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make mashups with Emoji Kitchen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jXXm4p"&gt;Google is also making a change that could result in more audiobooks in the Play Store. Google says that it’s providing publishers in the US and UK with a new auto-generated narrator tool than can be used to create audio versions of books that currently lack them. The tool is currently in beta, and should be coming to all publishers in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

The apps are sent via whatever method your two phones deem the fastest: Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, WebRTC, or peer-to-peer Wi-Fi. To share an app from Google Play you’ll need to head to the “Share Apps” menu in “Manage Apps &amp;amp; Games” and select the app to share. Your friend must then accept the incoming app. This particular update will start rolling out in “the coming weeks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZ5T3k"&gt;Lastly, Google says that it’s expanding &lt;a href="https://www.android.com/auto/"&gt;Android Auto&lt;/a&gt; support to 36 more countries over “the next few months,” bringing Google’s apps and services to the dashboard of &lt;a href="https://www.android.com/auto/compatibility/"&gt;compatible cars&lt;/a&gt; for anyone running Android 10 or above (Android 9 users can download the app).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android Auto expands to dozens of countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aqFUrIUYXDmCMqQrR-SrTW_WXpQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449411/akrales_190725_3567_0090.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jaQzWn"&gt;Android Auto, the Google-powered software system for cars, is expanding to dozens of new markets around the world, the company announced. In the coming months, Android Auto will be available in 36 additional countries, including much of Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and a handful of countries in Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYuJA7"&gt;Here’s the list of countries that will soon be getting Android Auto: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="DTKdcm"&gt;Europe: Albania, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Portugal, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Macedonia, Malta, Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Ukraine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bfyhzn"&gt;Asia: Turkey, Thailand, Indonesia &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OVw8Am"&gt;Africa: Angola, Botswana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JQoOel"&gt;Google is effectively doubling the number of countries in the world where customers can access Android Auto. It’s a sign that the company is feeling bullish about the future of its vehicle interface. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21377399/google-android-auto-android-11-wireless-phone-support"&gt;Google recently announced&lt;/a&gt; that the latest version of its operating system, Android 11, will allow any smartphone owner to connect wirelessly to Android Auto, as long as the connecting vehicle includes a head unit that supports 5GHz Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OABlSd"&gt;Google is also working with automakers to produce more cars with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18196234/google-android-auto-in-car-systems-apple-carplay-interview"&gt;natively installed Android Auto&lt;/a&gt;. Google struck deals with Volvo and Audi to start rolling out these systems, and over the last year, we’ve seen a few examples of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;what they will look like&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung begins wider rollout of Android 11 and One UI 3.0 to latest phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rsM98UEv-xmvDlsK2etfX2xxunE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449227/bking_200306_3928_0015.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Brennan King / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HAwEAy"&gt;Samsung is starting to &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-one-ui-3-android11-enhanced-user-experience/"&gt;roll out updates&lt;/a&gt; to Android 11 and One UI 3.0, its customized interface, to some of its latest phones. The first up are Galaxy S20 series devices in the US, Korea, and most of Europe, which will start receiving updates today. Updates for the Note 20, last year’s Note 10 and S10, and the Z Fold, Z Fold 2, and Z Flip are planned to arrive in the “coming weeks.” Updates for the Galaxy A series will arrive in the first half of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aemOdF"&gt;The updates come three months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427153/android-11-official-launch-google-pixel-oneplus-8-xiaomi-oppo-realme-update"&gt;the launch of Android 11&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung has historically been slow to deliver Android updates even to its latest phones. Three months isn’t a huge wait (it maintains &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21025221/android-10-samsung-galaxy-s10-availability-att-sprint-t-mobile-verizon-xfinity-mobile-one-ui"&gt;the same pace&lt;/a&gt; as last year), but a number of other phone manufacturers, including OnePlus, Xiaomi, and Oppo, managed to deliver Android 11 on day one this year. Samsung’s updates take longer in part because it heavily customizes Android with its own interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXJQTT"&gt;One UI 3.0 mostly brings visual refinements to Samsung’s existing interface. Menus and widgets are now presented with a frosty, translucent background, rather than the grayish look they previously had. Samsung has also added some richer lock screen widgets and a redesigned volume menu, and it says animations should be smoother, and camera autofocus should be faster. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/09/17/heres-absolutely-every-new-thing-in-samsung-oneui-3-0/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;has a thorough rundown&lt;/a&gt; of the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3mK0Y"&gt;It’s not entirely clear how soon any given phone will get these updates, even though the rollout is starting today. Samsung’s software rollouts often start slowly, and they’re frequently held up on a carrier-by-carrier basis. To illustrate just how chaotic it can be: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22149171/verizon-samsung-galaxy-s20-android-11-one-ui-3-0"&gt;Verizon preempted Samsung’s announcement&lt;/a&gt; and started rolling out this update to the Galaxy S20 5G UW yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Photos now lets you set a changing wallpaper that pulls images from your memories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MO_Bg18DwZNEv_C95AYK4biQwus=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449069/1BEB77B1_EB2C_4E1F_A9C1_1B863908E956.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t3IMGi"&gt;Android users who are bored of their usual wallpapers are in luck: an update to Google Photos now allows users to set their wallpaper as a random, rotating cast of saved photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yE8l3J"&gt;Version 5.22 of Google Photos automatically includes the update, so if you go to your phone’s wallpaper selector and look at the live wallpapers, you should see the option for one called “Memories.” Once selected, your phone will start pulling photos from the Memories section of Google Photos to cycle between as a background. You’ll then be able to preview what you’ll see as a wallpaper before confirming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SekiEk"&gt;The main catch here is that Google defines what &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/photos/relive-your-best-memories-new-features-google-photos"&gt;counts as a memory&lt;/a&gt; based on its machine learning algorithms, so you won’t be able to really decide what shows up. Photos could range from gorgeous vistas to a photo of your sad home office lunch. Who knows! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oEW9b"&gt;Of course, you might as well try this out now if you’re ever going to, considering Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;is eliminating&lt;/a&gt; unlimited, free photo storage on June 1st, 2021. Google Photos will start charging for storage over 15GB, which is beyond a bummer. If you think you might end up switching services, now’s the time to try out a live wallpaper.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Complex turned its fashion and music festival into a futuristic video game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6dv-MSJBwUJ1ZlripOv5BUiVgTo=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68448969/INTRO_RENDER_08.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A week of sneakers, panels, and... virtual food trucks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="SvPdhu"&gt;Since 2016, ComplexCon has been a place where streetwear enthusiasts can gather in one place to buy exclusive gear, listen to amazing live music, and gorge at high-end food trucks. As with most live shows, though, the event isn’t taking place in 2020 — at least, not in the traditional way. In lieu of an in-person festival in Long Beach, Complex has built a video game where users can shop, watch talks and performances, and, yes, order from local restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmfkO6"&gt;It’s not a sprawling virtual world where millions can gather in one place, but rather a single-player experience designed to mimic the feeling of being at a live show. ComplexLand is a video game where the main activity is shopping, and you chase after sneaker drops like a hero in the latest open-world blockbuster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ev9q1Z"&gt;&lt;a href="https://complexland.com/"&gt;ComplexLand&lt;/a&gt; will take place from December 7th–11th, and it’s completely free. The experience was built by design studio Jam3 in WebGL, meaning it’s accessible via a web browser, either on desktop or mobile. Once you create an account, you’re dropped into a sort of abstract, futuristic cityscape and immediately prompted to create an avatar, choosing from various brandname hats and sneakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1gDUd"&gt;From there, the experience opens up, with a big world full of NPCs to talk to and points of interest to explore. To emulate some of the social experience, there will also be a persistent chat where attendees can talk about the day’s events. Most importantly: there are plenty of places to shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="QGHljW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8GyQ_sOZ9jU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMNSQ1"&gt;Complex’s head of collaborations, Neil Wright, says the creative team was inspired by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott’s appearance in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, but they felt one key thing was missing. “Aesthetically, I thought it looked really cool. It was so over the top and whimsical in a way that was really creative,” Wright explains. “I think, for us, the one thing that it lacked was the commerce aspect. If you wanted to buy any of the merch, you had to go to Travis’ website. You had to go elsewhere for it. So when we were building this world, we wanted to make sure that commerce was top of mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VmG--dK0Iv9PRu56Phl0aVBkalI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141171/AVATAR_02_0020.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVXsLX"&gt;ComplexLand is essentially a game built entirely around shopping. Yes, you can watch talks where Fat Joe and Lil Yachty discuss the best sneakers of the year or listen to T-Pain’s thoughts on the future of esports. (All of the talks will be broadcast via YouTube Live.) But you’re also running through a sci-fi city in search of the latest gear. Complex has partnered with fashion brands like Adidas, BAPE, and Tokidoki for virtual booths that users can visit to shop for exclusive sneakers or hoodies. Everything is branded and shoppable: there are artists booths where individuals can sell their work, or you can pop by a Perrier booth plastered with Takashi Murakami’s iconic smiling flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cXdN5"&gt;The experience also gamifies that ever-present part of streetwear culture: the limited drop. As players are exploring the world, they’ll get notifications that a new drop is about to happen. From there, it works sort of like an open-world game like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt;. Your mini-map will show you the general area where the drop can be found, but it’s up to you to actually find it. If you manage to, you’ll be entered into a queue for the opportunity to buy whatever the item is. “In my perfect scenario, your avatar will be shopping around, and then you’ll be alerted that a drop is going to occur. And you have to stop what you’re doing and then try to locate it in the world,” says Wright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qVb-hCiWu12oxpDD33ccaBR9iTo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141163/ComplexLand_2020___Google_Chrome_2020_12_02_at_6.48.19_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uZB8B3"&gt;Perhaps the most ambitious aspect of ComplexLand is the food trucks. You’ll be able to go up to a virtual truck, order food, and have it delivered to your house. Here’s how Wright describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nrdFDa"&gt;It’s something that we really wanted to make sure we were able to execute on because the food trucks at ComplexCon are such an important part because the restaurants that we choose are really top-tier. Basically, what you’ll be able to do is, when you’re in the world, we’ll have four food trucks all based around things like burgers or tacos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWD6GS"&gt;At that point, your avatar will approach the truck, and you’ll be able to see menu items that are region-specific — so if you’re in New York, you get the New York burger, and if you’re in Chicago, you get the Chicago burger — and then we’ll work with the restaurant to have that item available through their delivery platform. Once you select the menu, you’ll be connected to the restaurant’s food delivery service of choice, and it’ll be delivered to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gXekud"&gt;ComplexLand represents the confluence of several trends, from events going virtual to the collision of fashion and gaming. Both of these became more prominent in 2020, whether it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/26/21721371/balenciaga-afterworld-the-age-of-tomorrow-fashion-launch-video-game"&gt;Balenciaga making a game to show off its next clothing line&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570454/lil-nas-x-roblox-concert-33-million-views"&gt;Lil Nas X performing inside &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21238703/animal-crossing-new-horizons-streetwear-fashion-outfits-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; fans working together to design in-game streetwear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFtTXI"&gt;ComplexLand differs in some ways because it’s so overtly commercial, designed explicitly for shopping, but that could also be indicative of the future of virtual worlds. After all, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s continued growth has been built largely off of pop culture collaborations with Marvel and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. Brands are everywhere. ComplexLand simply embraces this fact more than most. And while it was designed initially for a week-long event, it could also end up being a more permanent virtual space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="PqOXt6"&gt;“We built it with the objective that we would probably bring it back,” says Wright.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This is the best Nintendo Switch deal you’ll find this holiday season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/APQAtVw2YL5h_5I0Nv3HdQtBdQ0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68448780/jbareham_180301_2346_nintendo_switch_0034_mario.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fZ0yJN"&gt;Some of the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday have come and gone, but with the holidays just around the corner, there are still a ton of deals readily available at various retailers. If you are looking to gift a Nintendo Switch this holiday season, Walmart has one of the best deals right now, which includes &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-w-Neon-Blue-Neon-Red-Joy-Con-12-Month-Individual-Membership-Nintendo-Switch-Online-Carrying-Case%2F498089523&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the console, a carrying case, and 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online (individual membership)&lt;/a&gt; for $299.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qibft2"&gt;It’s a unique deal for a few reasons: the Nintendo Switch alone costs $300, and 12 months of Nintendo’s online service costs $20. Carrying cases vary in price but can cost anywhere between $13 to $33. Nintendo Switch Online is a great service if you plan to purchase games that take advantage of the online feature like &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAnimal-Crossing-New-Horizons-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496596439%2F720388718&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMario-Kart-8-Deluxe-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496590475%2F55432571&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSuper-Smash-Bros-Ultimate-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496592998%2F467273231&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562530/nintendo-switch-lite-sales-october-2020"&gt;ongoing popularity&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo doesn’t discount the Switch console itself. The only way you’re going to save money when buying one is through bundles like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside id="9iDVu1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"You can get Super Mario Odyssey for free when you buy a Switch Pro controller","url":"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/12/2/22016568/nintendo-switch-pro-controller-super-mario-odyssey-steelseries-arctis-pro-wireless-headset-amazon"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="V4DvMI"&gt;The Nintendo Switch included with the bundle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697601/nintendo-switch-new-model-battery-life-improvements"&gt;is the updated model&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the original version, which was released nearly four years ago, the updated Switch has two more hours of battery life. While playing the console in handheld mode, it can be used between 4.5 to nine hours on a single charge, depending on what games you play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ismdPA"&gt;With the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S kickstarting a new generation of consoles (and both being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult to find right now&lt;/a&gt;), the Switch still offers a lot of value as an eighth-generation console, thanks to its hybrid design of being both a home and handheld console.&lt;/p&gt;
