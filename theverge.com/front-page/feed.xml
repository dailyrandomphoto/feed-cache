    <title>LIDAR maker Velodyne boots its founder after an investigation into ‘inappropriate’ behavior</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Yandex NV Trials Driverless Taxis" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CvHocOCjEYsr94M-JX58RoBjlsg=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856898/1164317768.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YyAi76"&gt;Velodyne, which makes LIDAR sensors crucial for the operation of autonomous vehicles, has removed its founder, David Hall, as chair of the company’s board following an investigation, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports. Hall’s wife, Marta Thoma Hall, has also stepped down as chief marketing officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSRIC3"&gt;The investigation, which started in December 2020, concluded that the Halls “each behaved inappropriately with regard to Board and Company processes, and failed to operate with respect, honesty, integrity, and candor in their dealings with Company officers and directors,” the company said in &lt;a href="https://velodynelidar.com/press-release/velodyne-lidar-announces-changes-to-board-of-directors/"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xeePbf"&gt;David Hall had previously stepped down as chairman of the board “voluntarily,” the board said, and transitioned to a new role as executive chairman. Marta Hall was terminated as an employee of the company but will remain a member of the board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02nxsY"&gt;“The Board also formally censured both Mr. Hall and Ms. Hall, and directed them both to receive appropriate remedial training,” the company said. It is unclear what behavior proceeded this decision. A spokesperson for the company declined to provide further comment.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="apSl5d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“formally censured”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kMyDtQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16491052/velodyne-lidar-mapping-self-driving-car-david-hall-interview"&gt;David Hall has long been revered in the world of autonomous vehicle technology&lt;/a&gt; as a pioneer in the use of laser sensors to enable AVs to “see” the world around them. LIDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, uses thousands of laser beams to sense objects and measure their distance. The cone- or cylindrical-shaped sensor perched on the roof of a vehicle has become synonymous with self-driving cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tdqbvl"&gt;Ford was an early backer of Velodyne, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/16/12499622/ford-baidu-velodyne-investment"&gt;investing $150 million&lt;/a&gt; in the company in 2017 along with Baidu, the Chinese search giant. Ford contributed $75 million of that total and held 13.1 million shares in the company. But the automaker abruptly dissolved its stake in the LIDAR company earlier this month and noted in a regulatory filing that it would no longer be a customer for Velodyne’s sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVJe7q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055011/lidar-sensor-self-driving-mainstream-mass-market-velodyne-ces-2020"&gt;Hall stepped down as CEO of Velodyne in January 2020&lt;/a&gt;, replaced by the company’s chief technology officer Anand Gopalan. But he remained chairman of the board, steering the company’s major financial decisions, until earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQkauc"&gt;Last summer, Velodyne became the latest mobility technology company to go public via a reverse merger, or SPAC. The company struck a deal to merge with special purpose acquisition company Graf Industrial Corp., with a market value of $1.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Karma’s new GS-6 hybrid is a cheaper version of its luxury sports car</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jiZGZKr7qeYcID8bLYUK3HIsz7M=/17x0:2024x1338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856845/GS6__6_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Karma Automotive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u3HwHX"&gt;Electric vehicle startup Karma Automotive has fully revealed its newest hybrid car, the GS-6. While it shares the same design as the company’s ultra-luxury sedan, the Revero GT, Karma is pricing the GS-6 at nearly half the price — $83,900 — in a bid to reach a much wider set of customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ydo9r0"&gt;Karma says it’s able to do that because it plans to make more cars at its California production plant, is making them more efficiently, and has streamlined its supply chain, according director of public relations Jeff Holland. “It helps that our parent company also owns our battery supplier A123 Systems, but over the past few years we have also seen a substantial reduction in the cost of lithium ion batteries and other EV-related components including other items such as motors and generators,” Holland told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Gzzt2"&gt;If the new car is successful, Karma could finally realize its goal of becoming a small-volume manufacturer just in time to capitalize on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22194330/ev-startups-tesla-success-2020-electric-vehicles-spac-public"&gt;a new wave of optimism (and funding) in the electric vehicle space&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YEKXYX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Almost half the price of the Revero, but mostly the same car&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NMw5CE"&gt;The path to that goal has been difficult so far for Karma. The startup was born in 2014 when Chinese automotive conglomerate Wanxiang Group bought a bulk of the assets of Fisker Automotive following &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; company’s bankruptcy. Wanxiang named the new startup after the Fisker Karma, the defunct company’s failed hybrid sports car, and ultimately revived that vehicle as the Revero. (Henrik Fisker, who founded Fisker Automotive, now has a new company called Fisker Inc. that is also working on electric vehicles.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LiRUqV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10355814"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Llh3uy"&gt;Karma has spent the last few years selling a small number of Revero hybrids for nearly $150,000 while struggling to really get on its feet as Wanxiang allegedly waffled on fully backing the startup, as &lt;em&gt;Jalopnik&lt;/em&gt;’s Jason Torchinsky has reported. The startup has been &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/source-claims-that-karma-will-layoff-most-workers-and-s-1842985031"&gt;accused of making prototypes that are basically just “movie props,”&lt;/a&gt; and may have even &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/karma-was-reportedly-considering-chapter-11-sources-up-1844136394"&gt;considered filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year&lt;/a&gt;. (Karma has denied both claims.) Karma has also laid off more than one hundred employees over the last two years and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21314730/byton-lordstown-karma-ppp-loans-coronavirus-bailout-layoffs"&gt;took a PPP loan of more than $5 million&lt;/a&gt; from the government in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBREGp"&gt;The GS-6 is meant to help lift Karma out of that turmoil by appealing to a potentially much bigger group of buyers. It’s powered by a BMW-sourced, turbocharged three-cylinder engine and two electric motors that, altogether, generate a total of about 536 horsepower — the same powertrain found in the Revero. A 28kWh battery pack allows for up to 80 miles of driving on electricity alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsDJIT"&gt;The interior features a touchscreen in the center of the dashboard, which is compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as a digital instrument cluster for the driver. Karma says it’s sourcing a lot of sustainable materials for the trim and the seats, too, in an attempt to appeal to more conscientious buyers. Karma will sell a Sport and a Luxury trim of the GS-6, and an all-electric version (dubbed GSe-6) is due out later starting at $79,900. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="snMAnM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are not selling PowerPoints anymore, we’re selling real cars.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kbfR7T"&gt;“We are not selling PowerPoints anymore, we’re selling real cars,” Joost de Vries, Karma’s vice president of global sales, said on a conference call with reporters last week. de Vries explained that Karma hopes to target younger buyers with the lower price point, and more of them, too, with a total production capacity of 15,000 cars per year at the California factory. That said, de Vries was quick to point out that the startup has retained many of its older, existing customers whose Revero leases have expired. Karma is “starting to really feel like a more complete auto manufacturer here in the US,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FeSMS8"&gt;While Karma has spent time and money developing autonomous technology (it even &lt;a href="https://www.karmanewsroom.com/news/karma-automotive-debuts-all-new-level-4-autonomous-van-e-flex-platform/"&gt;created an allegedly self-driving van last year&lt;/a&gt;), de Vries said that’s not expected to come to the startup’s passenger vehicles any time soon. The GS-6 lineup will have optional driver assistance features like adaptive cruise control and lane keeping, but nothing more. “We’re not seeing anything in our near future on level three or level four,” de Vries said, referring to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ designations for hands-free driving and fully driverless capability within a certain area, respectively. “It’s on the roadmap, but I think we still want to wait another decade or so before the legislative problems have been resolved, and our customers are really not asking for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeibFP"&gt;Karma has a hand in a lot of other advanced technologies, too. The startup has shared that it’s working on a way to &lt;a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131161_karma-will-test-a-hydrogen-fuel-cell-car-without-the-infrastructure-hurdles"&gt;use methanol and hydrogen fuel cells to power future electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. It also &lt;a href="https://www.karmanewsroom.com/news/karma-automotive-completes-e-flex-platform-projects-to-offer-new-electric-mobility-solutions/"&gt;hopes to sell the technological platform that powers its cars to other automakers&lt;/a&gt;. An SUV is in the works, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apKNDd"&gt;To fund all of this, Karma announced last July that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21319273/fisker-inc-karma-automotive-fundraising-public-evs-tesla-nikola"&gt;had raised a fresh $100 million&lt;/a&gt;. That announcement came at the beginning of a wave of electric vehicle companies going public by merging with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition companies&lt;/a&gt; (including Fisker Inc.). But so far, Karma remains private. “Our management team is exploring all avenues for a larger financing with investment bankers. And of course, IPO has always been an aspiration for Karma when it is public company ready, but for now the key focus is on growing our business,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valheim tops 500,000 simultaneous players, breaking four more records</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EGZjH0EW7fxTBQCapk7_-8E1H2g=/155x0:829x449/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856757/valheim_steam.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s8EhFA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; is on a trajectory like nothing we’ve ever seen. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286507/valheim-steam-pc-game-2-million-sales"&gt;The Viking-themed indie survival game&lt;/a&gt; has been shooting up the Steam charts, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3059603718053006418"&gt;selling 3 million copies&lt;/a&gt; in an unheard-of 17 days. And people aren’t just buying it on a whim; they’re actively playing it, too. On Sunday, the game reached 500,000 simultaneous players, &lt;a href="https://steamdb.info/graph/"&gt;according to SteamDB&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the charred remains of four other all-time Steam player count records in its wake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jkKWvt"&gt;As of Friday, February 19th, the game had already passed &lt;em&gt;Postal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V &lt;/em&gt;to become the ninth most-played game on Steam at peak, but now it’s surpassed the records for &lt;em&gt;Among Us, Life is Strange 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fallout 4,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Terraria&lt;/em&gt; to reach the No. 5 slot, &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;according to Steam Charts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1kcZpnv9CsR-IwoJg3naUw32ZSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320792/chrome_uk2vwXiCeS.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h6QcpW"&gt;It’s going to be an uphill battle from here: the four records it broke were in the 400,000 range, but the next record is the 830,000-player record &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;set at its December launch. To beat &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt;, it’d have to cross 1.3 million players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNmhIX"&gt;It seems completely doable, though, considering how rapidly the game has already grown, and the way it can suck you (and your friends) in again and again. There’s a huge randomly generated world to explore and loads to craft and build, with up to 10 people cooperatively working together. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286507/valheim-steam-pc-game-2-million-sales"&gt;It’s fun&lt;/a&gt;, and with a remarkably shallow learning curve and a $20 price tag, I’d be surprised if it bottoms out anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VB99Hj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; was built by a five-person team, but &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valheim-dev-says-the-games-success-is-quite-incredible-and-very-humbling/"&gt;they tell &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt; they’ll be hiring up now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="OHYvOI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Steam’s biggest new hit is a Viking survival game that struck like a bolt from the blue ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286507/valheim-steam-pc-game-2-million-sales"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bYTIGR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best gaming laptops to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Best gaming laptop 2021: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a74agKGelGJbDn6_kSnV79bOs1M=/0x0:2068x1379/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856650/awhite_200319_3954_9.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best gaming laptops at every size and price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ow4mCb"&gt;The best gaming laptop of 2021 looks different from those of years past. The early days of mobile gaming were largely desktop replacements — clunky chassis, multiple power bricks, and RGB lighting galore. But the top gaming laptops now are different. Manufacturers are finally putting powerful specs in sleeker, more portable, and more professional builds. They have excellent, fast refreshing screens that are necessary for a great gaming experience. These laptops aren’t just great for gaming, but for everyday work as well. That’s why the best gaming laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;. It can handle the most demanding games on the market today and also makes a great daily driver.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1D14gn"&gt;We’ll be updating this page regularly as new gaming laptop models hit shelves throughout this year. Some exciting updates are on the way. AMD and Nvidia have announced their next-gen series of mobile processors and mobile graphics cards — the Ryzen 5000 series and the GeForce RTX 3000 series, respectively — and we’re already seeing them in premium gaming laptops across manufacturers. Intel’s Tiger Lake H series is also on its way, though we expect to see those more frequently in lighter-weight models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGRnFN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;QHD screen&lt;/a&gt; is another feature to watch for. A growing number of manufacturers are releasing configurations with 1440p displays, even in gaming laptops under $2,000. These options can hit a sweet spot for many gamers: a better experience than 1080p without the price premium or raw horsepower required for a 4K display. You can expect decently high refresh rates from these panels as well, depending on the model. The upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22215119/razer-blade-15-17-laptops-screens-graphics-gaming-price-release-date"&gt;Razer Blade 15&lt;/a&gt;, for example, will offer up to a 240Hz panel with QHD resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5KtNO"&gt;One more thing to keep in mind is the power you can expect. Not all chips with the same name are created equal — the RTX 3070 in one laptop may not deliver the same frame rates as the RTX 3070 in another laptop due to its wattage (as well as other factors like the processor and cooling). Nvidia now requires companies to disclose clock speeds and graphics power on each model’s product page, but plenty of manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;haven’t done that yet&lt;/a&gt;. Your best bet, if you can’t find those numbers on a company’s website, is to read some reviews and make sure the model you’re considering will deliver the frame rates you’re looking for. We will note the wattage used in any laptops we review with the new RTX graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best gaming laptop of 2021&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="PjVXGI"&gt;The ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best gaming laptop you can buy. We most recently reviewed last year’s model, which includes AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series up to the eight-core Ryzen 9 4900HS and an Nvidia RTX 2060 GPU. There’s a brand-new model out featuring the Ryzen 5000 series and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series graphics, which we’re looking forward to getting our hands on ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvmPMM"&gt;For well under $2,000, the Zephyrus crams one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market into a super portable 14-inch chassis. With capable cooling to boot, the laptop delivers frame rates we’ve never seen in a laptop of this size before. It handled every game we threw at it without breaking a sweat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRoiIm"&gt;But aside from its excellent gaming performance, the G14 makes a great daily driver. The keyboard, touchpad, display, and port selection are all excellent. Even the battery life is good — something we almost never get to say about gaming laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yypId"&gt;There are a few downsides to the G14, but they’re fairly small and user-dependent. The most significant note is that it lacks a webcam; you’ll need an external one if you plan on taking video calls. There’s also some bleed in the backlighting, there’s no Thunderbolt connectivity (since it’s an AMD system, and that’s an Intel standard), and the fans can get louder than most under load. But these are very much nitpicks that won’t have a large impact on plenty of people’s gaming experience. Overall, we have very few complaints. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="jT5h16"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="E8Fdz3"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 delivers some of the best gaming performance you can find in a laptop — but that’s not even its superpower. What makes Razer’s 17-inch flagship so impressive is it packs that unbelievable power into a thin and attractive chassis. It’s just 0.8 inches thick and only requires one charging brick — so you can carry it around in a backpack or briefcase without compromising on power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaBYbX"&gt;Gaming enthusiasts can opt for a model with a 300Hz screen — the highest refresh rate you can get on a laptop — while folks who want to combine gaming with some creative work can opt for a 120Hz touchscreen configuration. Both models come with a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, which adds a touch of color to the Pro’s design without being too obnoxious for the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsGaDN"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 certainly isn’t cheap, but it’s the laptop to buy if you want the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="DMtcRV"&gt;The best budget gaming laptop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="hCCjrZ"&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE offers a great gaming experience at a price range far below that of many competitors. It’s the best gaming laptop you can buy under $1,000, and it doesn’t ask too many compromises for that price. While it only comes with a 60Hz screen, the hardware inside (especially AMD’s Ryzen 7 processor) is capable of maxing that out on all kinds of demanding games at native 1080p resolution, so you can reliably expect a playable experience from your favorite titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6ozmE"&gt;We’re also impressed by the G5’s connectivity. It includes a Mini DisplayPort, an HDMI, and an Ethernet jack — all ports you don’t see every day on laptops at this price point. Overall, if you’re looking for great value for your money, the G5 is your best bet. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="wzRw2D"&gt;The best thin and light gaming laptop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="EcPuJg"&gt;The Blade 15 isn’t as powerful as its 17-inch sibling, but it may be a more pragmatic purchase for many people. If you’re looking for a balanced combination of performance and portability, the Blade 15 may hit that sweet spot. It still packs the top chips on the market and can come with a 300Hz display, but at just 4.7 pounds and 0.7 inches thick, it’s comparable in size to a number of 15-inch productivity machines like the Dell XPS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8vpQe"&gt;In addition to its reliable gaming performance, the Blade 15 works well as a productivity machine. We’re big fans of its keyboard, which is quite comfortable to use and has per-key RGB lighting, and the touchpad, which is roomy with a satisfying click. Our primary complaint is that this Blade got quite hot during our game testing — not only did the processor reach 99 degrees, but the hinge and palm rests were uncomfortable to touch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="7lPrCK"&gt;The flashiest gaming laptop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="SK7elL"&gt;If you’re looking for a “traditional” premium gaming laptop with colorful, flashy panache, the ROG Strix Scar 15 is for you. The Strix’s keyboard isn’t just one of the most comfortable that we’ve ever tested on a gaming laptop; it also has some of the coolest per-key RGB lighting we’ve ever seen with all kinds of effects. There’s also a colorful light strip wrapped around the front of the deck (customizable as well) and a colorful glowing logo on the lid. In short: if you use this in public, people will notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZuwqX"&gt;Of course, the Strix is great on the inside as well, delivering some of the best frame rates you’ll find from a 15-inch laptop with Intel’s and Nvidia’s top chips. You’ll get the full benefit of their power with a 300Hz screen option as well. And the Strix comes preloaded with various programs to help customize your gaming experience. You can personalize color profiles, bandwidth allocation, and more based on the type of game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="SH9RLt"&gt;If money and desk space are no objects for you, you might be interested in the Alienware Area-51m. This hefty rig is essentially a desktop in laptop form. It pairs a desktop-class processor and a full-power mobile GPU with a 17-inch display and a full-size keyboard, delivering true desktop performance in a chassis that’s still (technically) portable. PC enthusiasts will also appreciate that you can update many of the components yourself, including the processor, RAM, and storage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="YDSZZF"&gt;The best 13-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="8Da3D3"&gt;The Blade Stealth 13 is far from the most powerful gaming rig out there, but it is one of very few gaming systems that come in a 13-inch chassis. The Stealth can run AAA titles at native resolution and comes with a 120Hz screen, but it’s comparable in size and weight to a MacBook Pro. Use it in a meeting or a classroom, and passing observers may have no idea it’s a gaming laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xdg8S1"&gt;In addition to its powerful chips, the Stealth comes with a colorful keyboard, a sturdy build, and a decent webcam. Even the battery life is pretty good. If you’re looking for a laptop that’s small but mighty, the Stealth will get the job done as a gaming rig and productivity machine in one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="5tIPDZ"&gt;The best gaming laptop for content creators &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="cXeYk1"&gt;One of the benefits of gaming laptops is, with their powerful graphics cards, they can double as drivers for content creators who want to get photo or video work done on the go. For these folks, the Aero 15 is as versatile as it comes. It has gaming laptop chips inside and a flashy RGB keyboard on the outside, but it pairs them with a gorgeous OLED display rather than a high refresh rate panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XclmXe"&gt;Those specs don’t come cheap, and plenty of people will be just fine with a more affordable gaming laptop or a standard OLED ultraportable. But if you need powerful specs, a color-accurate screen, and a portable chassis, the Aero 15 delivers all three. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s latest feature automatically downloads shows based on what you like</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rtol9z"&gt;Netflix is adding a new mobile feature that will automatically download show recommendations and movies based on viewer history. Downloads For You launches globally today for Android users, the company &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/downloads-for-you-takes-on-the-go-to-the-next-level"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyQefJ"&gt;You’ll need to opt in to use the feature. Once toggled on from the downloads tab, you’ll need to set how much space — 1GB, 3GB, or 5GB — you’ll want to use. More space equals more Netflix recommendations downloaded. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/netflix-launches-downloads-for-you-a-new-feature-that-automatically-downloads-content-youll-like/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that although Netflix’s full catalog is available with the feature, some downloads will be limited because of licensing restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IpNGXj"&gt;The platform continues to improve its offline watching options; Netflix launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18215134/netflix-smart-downloads-ios-automatic-download-wi-fi-deletion"&gt;Smart Downloads&lt;/a&gt; on Android &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/10/17552858/netflix-smart-downloads-episodes-shows-android"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, which automatically deletes downloaded episodes after they’ve been watched. Although Downloads For You is currently only available on Android, an iOS version will begin testing soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Irregulars imagines a sinister Sherlock who steals credit for supernatural sleuthing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0LavfALOqGwtF7iwDud7qyaO_zI=/0x0:4096x2731/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856563/TheIrregulars_Netflix.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3sas8A"&gt;Netflix’s next Sherlock Holmes project, &lt;em&gt;The Irregulars&lt;/em&gt;, just got a new teaser highlighting the dark, supernatural adventures yet to come on the eight-part series. &lt;em&gt;The Irregulars&lt;/em&gt;, set to start streaming on March 26th, follows a group of “troubled street teens” who are “manipulated into solving crimes” by the “sinister Doctor Watson,” according to Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrZIQ0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Irregulars&lt;/em&gt; is based in part on the Baker Street Irregulars, a group of street urchins in Arthur Conan Doyle’s original Sherlock Holmes novels that helped Watson and the famous consulting detective gain a street-level view on London and handle some of the busy work of solving mysteries. Netflix’s version, created by Tom Bidwell, seems to take things in a far moodier and spookier direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZpwVYk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1APF6a4m74k?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4IffUW"&gt;The Baker Street Irregulars have appeared in some Sherlock Holmes films and television shows over the years (recently reworked as a “Homeless Network” in BBC’s &lt;em&gt;Sherlock&lt;/em&gt;), but &lt;em&gt;The Irregulars&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;choice to seemingly position Holmes and Watson as people taking advantage of these young kids seems ripe for some interesting stories. Bidwell summarized the idea in an &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/writersroom/entries/3f5c208a-d2f4-4a14-9e55-a6a05c9c2ddc"&gt;interview with the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ko48zH"&gt;Sherlock Holmes had a group of street kids he’d use to help him gather clues so our series is what if Sherlock was a drug addict and a delinquent and the kids solve the whole case whilst he takes credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DqH7IL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Irregulars&lt;/em&gt; follows Netflix’s recent success with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455049/enola-holmes-review-millie-bobby-brown-henry-cavill-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, focused on the younger sister of Sherlock Holmes. The film prompted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302942/netflix-enola-holmes-sherlock-arthur-conan-doyle-estate-lawsuit-copyright-infringement"&gt;Arthur Conan Doyle’s estate to sue Netflix&lt;/a&gt; for depicting Holmes’ personality as too emotional, an aspect of the character they claim wasn’t invented until later Doyle novels that aren’t in the public domain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boiW0B"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22193330/netflix-enola-holmes-doyle-estate-sherlock-holmes-emotions-lawsuit-dismissed"&gt;The lawsuit was dropped&lt;/a&gt;, but it is a funny coincidence that the aloof, elusive, icy Sherlock Holmes who likely wouldn’t care about the supernatural danger the Irregulars will face also happens to be the Holmes in the public domain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YMO747"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Irregulars&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;eight-episode series premieres on Netflix on March 26th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="8jFcLY"&gt;Sony’s upcoming WF-1000XM4 earbuds may have been shown off in a leak, with a slimmed-down design. &lt;a href="https://news.mydrivers.com/1/741/741151.htm"&gt;The leak from &lt;em&gt;MyDrivers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/sony-wf-1000xm4-design-leaked-wf-1000xm3-sucessor/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MySmartPrice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) claims to show the sequel to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features"&gt;Sony’s very good WF-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt; — and if it’s real, it seems like a nice design upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gj5iD7"&gt;The new purported design does away with the large, Popsicle-stick-like design that sticks out of the user’s ear, and instead goes with a more modern style of bud that fits in your ear — similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="quR3nx"&gt;The leaked image shows a copper accent cylinder that acts as a design flair similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/11/17844914/sony-1000x-m3-review-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;Sony’s 1000XM3 headphones&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/walkman/nw-wm1a"&gt;its modern, high-end Walkmans&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll likely have to wait for an official announcement to find out its purpose — whether it’s a charging port, microphone array for active noise cancellation, or something else entirely. At the moment, though, I can’t help but hope that this leak is real, as these are a considerable improvement over the old model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Malaysian news site fined $124,000 for five reader comments</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WSaXE6"&gt;A Malaysian news site was fined the equivalent of nearly $124,000 for five comments below an article. News outlet &lt;em&gt;Malaysiakini&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/malaysiakini/status/1362681271470551045"&gt;raised money&lt;/a&gt; to cover the fee of 500,000 ringgit, but human rights advocates say it was targeted for its reporting on government corruption, and they worry that the case could chill political speech online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hPpD5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/world/asia/malaysia-press-freedom-guilty.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; the verdict on Friday, when a panel of judges found &lt;em&gt;Malaysiakini&lt;/em&gt; guilty of contempt of court. &lt;a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/532693"&gt;The outlet argued&lt;/a&gt; that it wasn’t responsible for reader comments, and it removed them after police warned that the comments illegally insulted Malaysia’s judiciary. But the court said it should have preemptively moderated the comments and never allowed them online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knFm1b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Malaysiakini&lt;/em&gt; is a prominent independent outlet, and it’s earned international accolades for its reporting over the past two decades. It’s faced &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54277437"&gt;periodic legal harassment&lt;/a&gt; within the country, though, culminating in the contempt of court charges that were filed last year. Co-founder Steven Gan also faced charges and a possible prison sentence. Gan’s situation was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/business/media/freedom-digital-news-sites-autocrats.html"&gt;compared to that&lt;/a&gt; of Filipino journalist Maria Ressa, whom authorities accused of “cyber libel” after her site &lt;em&gt;Rappler&lt;/em&gt; published critical reporting. But unlike Ressa, who was &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/876943655/philippine-journalist-maria-ressa-found-guilty-of-violating-cyberlibel-law"&gt;convicted last year&lt;/a&gt;, Gan was acquitted of personal charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAPEC6"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reports that this case was the first of its type brought against a news outlet in Malaysia, and Amnesty International Malaysia called it “a grave setback for freedom of expression in the country.” But Malaysia’s internet crackdown echoes an international push to make sites legally responsible for what users post — including in the United States, where lawmakers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268421/cda-section-230-25th-anniversary-reform-stakes-big-tech-internet"&gt;have taken aim&lt;/a&gt; at a rule offering blanket protection against liability.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon rainforest fires got even worse last year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BRAZIL-ENVIRONMENT-FIRE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XYLmVJ6bQU_dSUIBJXJrXcX8G4k=/0x92:4494x3088/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68855922/1228063125.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smoke rises from an illegally lit fire in a section of Amazon rainforest, south of Novo Progresso in Pará state, Brazil, on August 15th, 2020.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Carl de Souza / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q65FYa"&gt;Fires in the Amazon reached devastating new levels in 2020, new NASA satellite imagery shows. The space agency developed a &lt;a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147075/a-new-tool-for-tracking-amazon-fires"&gt;new tool&lt;/a&gt; to track fires from space after Brazil’s Amazon suffered a record-breaking year of fires in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELU7zn"&gt;Specialized sensors on satellites collect visible and infrared imagery, which NASA uses to detect thermal anomalies — basically hotspots caused by fire. Its satellites found 1.4 million of those anomalies in the Southern Amazon last year, compared to 1.1 million in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEyaq0"&gt;“Fire activity was up significantly in 2020,” Douglas Morton, chief of the Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, said in the &lt;a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147946/fires-raged-in-the-amazon-again-in-2020"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; today. “All types of fires contributed to the increase, including deforestation fires and understory fires, the most environmentally destructive types.” The effects of these kinds of fires can last for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QWe3R_naXe3El1DwG64x0JGWYF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320513/amazonburnedwide_vir_2020_lrg.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NASA grouped fires into four different types marked on this map: fires caused by deforestation to make way for industry (red), uncontrolled fires that burn the understory of the forest (green), fires burning in savanna-grasslands (blue), and small fires set by subsistence farmers to clear land (purple). NASA looks at the duration, intensity, and movement of fire “hotspots” to identify what kind of fire is burning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZG6JT8"&gt;Fires caused by deforestation were up 23 percent in 2020 compared to the year before. These blazes are started intentionally to clear parts of the rainforest to make room for cattle ranching and farming. This was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836891/amazon-fires-brazil-bolsonaro-rainforest-deforestation-analysis-effects"&gt;the main culprit behind catastrophic fires in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, when deforestation in the country hit an &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-deforestation/brazil-amazon-rainforest-deforestation-hits-11-year-high-in-2019-government-data-idUSKBN1XS1PK"&gt;11-year high&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1HOck"&gt;There was a steep 60 percent rise in the most destructive kind of fire: uncontrolled understory fires that spread from a blaze that might have been intentionally set. Large fires aren’t natural in the Amazon’s wet terrain. In a typical year, fires are primarily the result of people setting chopped-down, dried-out trees aflame. But this year, drier conditions in the southeastern Amazon made it easier for human-made blazes to escape into parts of the rainforest that hadn’t been cleared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdnkI1"&gt;“As a result, the scale of the fires in this area was extraordinary and devastating,” Morton said. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Clearing the rainforest to make way for ranches and agriculture is a process that can take several years of logging and burning." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QypQYW_POMGOj5IGXpkD3geKSdg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320532/deforestationtimeseries_2013_2018.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clearing the rainforest to make way for ranches and agriculture is a process that can take several years of logging and burning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yw3A8f"&gt;The numbers are even more alarming considering how bad 2019 already was. That year, Brazil suffered a more than &lt;a href="http://queimadas.dgi.inpe.br/queimadas/portal-static/situacao-atual/"&gt;80 percent jump&lt;/a&gt; in the number of fires compared to 2018, according to the country’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE). Since entering office in 2019, Brazil’s right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has worked to &lt;a href="https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20210123-brazil-indigenous-leaders-sue-bolsonaro-for-killings-and-ecological-destruction"&gt;open up the Amazon to more development and set aside less land for Indigenous tribes&lt;/a&gt; and conservation efforts. NASA found that &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/amazon-deforestation-falls-where-land-is-under-indigenous-control/"&gt;Indigenous territories saw fewer fires&lt;/a&gt; compared to other lands without protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfpSOO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX’s Crew Dragon performing ‘beautifully’ on ISS as NASA eyes a backup ride</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dXqrkXmF6TRzYBtEoUh8JZZ6zDY=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68855875/50953553088_6da480ba2a_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Russia’s Progress 77 cargo resupply ship is seen approaching the International Space Station through the window of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft. | NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kmtr2l"&gt;SpaceX’s Crew Dragon astronaut taxi is doing “beautifully” so far in its first operational, long-duration stay on the International Space Station, NASA’s human spaceflight chief Kathy Lueders told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;The capsule, named Resilience, sent three NASA astronauts and a Japanese astronaut to the station last November, and a trivial housekeeping task is the only unexpected hiccup faced by the crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BG68Yx"&gt;“We’ve been very, very happy with how things are going,” Lueders said in an interview. “The only minor thing we had was we’re getting some little bits of lint on the seal” where Crew Dragon connects to the ISS, she added. Astronauts have been floating in and out of the spacecraft for months, leaving behind a buildup of lint and dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KN73np"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I can handle having housekeeping issues”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dGEtvw"&gt;SpaceX &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/15/21565237/spacex-crew-1-dragon-launch-success-falcon-9-nasa"&gt;launched the Crew-1 mission&lt;/a&gt; on November 15th carrying Commander Mike Hopkins, pilot Victor Glover, and mission specialists Shannon Walker and Soichi Noguchi, a Japanese astronaut. The mission marked SpaceX’s first fully operational mission under its NASA contract after nailing its final test milestone last summer with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21269703/spacex-launch-crew-dragon-nasa-orbit-successful"&gt;launch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/2/21350663/nasa-spacex-crew-dragon-astronauts-bob-behnken-doug-hurley-splash-down"&gt;return&lt;/a&gt; of two US astronauts, Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOnig4"&gt;Some extra dust is definitely not the worst problem NASA and SpaceX could face on a $100 billion orbital laboratory that has housed astronauts in low Earth orbit for over 20 years. “I can handle having housekeeping issues,” Lueders said. Astronauts have been using a vacuum to suck out all the lint, but for a longer-term fix to the pileup, a tiny cover was trucked to the station on the NG-15 cargo resupply mission, launched Saturday by Northrop Grumman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2uWXR"&gt;NASA and SpaceX have been closely monitoring Crew Dragon’s health in space as it tallies 98 days docked to the ISS — the longest duration for a human-rated US spacecraft. Perhaps most intimately familiar with the capsule is Hopkins, who’s been using Crew Dragon as his bunking quarters while others sleep elsewhere on the station. (Lueders made clear that Hopkins wasn’t solely to blame for all the dust — “don’t make me get in trouble with Mike Hopkins, Joey!”)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uCFWc33GxPo7FEAmHiLj3E61dMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320567/50902727167_f0845a77a0_k.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX’s Crew Dragon “Resilience” spacecraft is seen docked to the International Space Station’s Harmony module.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6MpT8X"&gt;SpaceX’s next mission, Crew-2, is slated for April 20th, reusing the capsule that flew Behnken and Hurley for the DM-2 mission. NASA decided to allow SpaceX to reuse its capsules for astronaut flights last year, setting the stage for a rigorous refurbishment and certification process for SpaceX. It’s similar to what the agency will go through with Boeing’s Starliner, Crew Dragon’s rival capsule that’s still in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FXZhRy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;refurbishing astronaut capsules in “dragonland”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3KJsqn"&gt;That refurb process will take place in Florida, where the company used to refurbish its old Cargo Dragon vehicles. Lueders said SpaceX engineers call their Kennedy Space Center refurbishment facilities “Dragonland.” SpaceX has already added infrastructure for Crew Dragon refurbishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1ynJLC"&gt;NASA still needs a backup seat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lmC4dj"&gt;Even though Crew Dragon Resilience is doing well on the ISS, and the upcoming Crew-2 launch is on schedule for April, NASA still wants to have a backup plan. The station’s other three crew members are two Russian cosmonauts and NASA astronaut Kate Rubins, who are due to return to Earth in April on the same Soyuz capsule they rode in on last year. If the Crew-2 spacecraft runs into problems before its April flight, NASA will need another option to get an astronaut to the ISS. Otherwise, they risk leaving the station with no NASA crew members for the first time since the station was first occupied in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xIlfIT"&gt;The agency announced earlier this month that it’s seeking another seat on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft as a safety net. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278958/nasa-axiom-soyuz-russian-commercial-crew-spacex"&gt;NASA was in talks with space infrastructure startup Axiom Space&lt;/a&gt; to book that Soyuz seat, instead of buying directly from the Russians — only the second time in the decades-long NASA-Russia relationship to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KaoAm9"&gt;Lueders said the US company (without specifically naming Axiom, because the talks were ongoing) reached out to NASA with its own proposal and offered the backup solution. So, as a legal formality, NASA issued a notice saying it’s looking to buy a Soyuz seat because — as Lueders put it — “one of our commercial providers out there said ‘Hey, there’s a commercial opportunity for me here,’ so they gave us an unsolicited proposal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEJ5LY"&gt;Axiom’s chief executive, Michael Suffredini, co-founded the Houston-based company in 2016 after spending 10 years as NASA’s ISS program manager. It’s unclear whether Axiom had already owned the Soyuz seat it’s selling to NASA or whether the Houston-based company is currently going through the process with Roscosmos to buy it. Roscosmos (Russia’s space agency) and Axiom both declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHhzjO"&gt;No matter the arrangement, the dealmaking and seat swapping is poised to give NASA the assurance it needs to keep a US astronaut on the ISS. NASA and the State Department are “in the final stages” of coming up with an agreement with Roscosmos to fly Russian cosmonauts on future flights of SpaceX’s or Boeing’s capsules in exchange for flying more US astronauts on Soyuz spacecraft, Lueders said. Nailing that agreement has been a yearslong process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qckd5"&gt;“We were hoping it would happen a little bit sooner, and so unfortunately it wasn’t happening in time for the April Soyuz seat,” Lueders said. That delay gave Axiom a chance to make a deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNaHHI"&gt;“If you said, ‘Kathy, what’s your logistics dream?’ I would say every vehicle going up to the ISS needs to have a US crew member on it, and we believe every US vehicle going up to have a Russian crew member on it,” Lueders said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ys04Dc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction February 22, 1:20PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated a cargo version of Crew Dragon that launched in January was the same spacecraft used in a previous uncrewed test mission, DM-1. The DM-1 spacecraft was destroyed in a testing explosion in 2019, and the cargo Crew Dragon was a new vehicle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
