    <title>Google Maps now lets you create Street View photos with just a phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oRExENHepnnLavE3wwtXKWpuKKE=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68447913/googlestreetviewnew.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nVtjyX"&gt;Google Maps is getting a new update that lets you create Street View photos using just a phone. Android users with &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices"&gt;ARCore-compatible devices&lt;/a&gt; can now capture imagery and publish it to Google Street View in certain areas. Google is allowing submissions initially in Toronto, New York, Austin, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Costa Rica. More regions will support this feature soon, and Google will use this user-generated content when it doesn’t have its own Street View imagery available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0bVxw"&gt; “While our own Street View trekkers and cars have collected more than 170 billion images from 10 million miles around the planet, there are still many unmapped parts of the world,” &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/anyone-can-share-their-world-with-street-view/"&gt;says Stafford Marquardt&lt;/a&gt;, product manager of Google Maps Street View. “Where people contribute connected photos, they will appear in the Street View layer on Google Maps as dotted blue lines.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9-lni3-wqZV9csDjuGFypzt8ozk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140929/streetviewgif.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Street View feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tlmvtv"&gt;The new beta feature has been in testing for months, and Google will automatically rotate and position the series of connected photos that are captured in its Street View app for Android. While users have been able to submit Street View imagery in the past, it required a special 360-degree camera. This new feature just makes use of a standard phone camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpeDrO"&gt;It opens up the Street View feature to many more areas, including hard to reach places that even Google’s Street View trekkers and cars haven’t visited. Google will also use this imagery to update Google Maps with information like new businesses or publicly posted open hours, and the company will apply its standard Street View privacy features to blur out faces and license plates.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Royole returns with a better folding phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gTO_lySveZO7vK50rtkouFR3yDs=/48x0:561x342/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68447874/DSCF74642.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The FlexPai 2 is a big improvement&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7k7Fme"&gt;Remember the first folding phone? No, not Samsung’s ill-fated original Galaxy Fold — the one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/5/18067116/royole-flexpai-flexible-display-foldable-smartphone-tablet-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;beat it to market&lt;/a&gt;. In hindsight, and honestly in foresight back then as well, Royole’s FlexPai was a hurried attention grab that existed solely to attain world-first status. But it’s not like it came out of nowhere; Royole had been set up several years earlier solely to develop flexible screen technology, so it’s understandable that the company would want to get ahead of Samsung to show off what it could do. A flex, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGko9G"&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18174278/royole-flexpai-foldable-phone-android-ces-2019"&gt;the FlexPai was bad&lt;/a&gt;. But now there’s a FlexPai 2, and it’s surprisingly pretty good. I’ve been using a Chinese model for a while and can report that it’s a big improvement over the original, with some neat refinements to the design. Samsung won’t have much to worry about, but that’s not necessarily the goal here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbYyRO"&gt;Royole doesn’t just see itself as a consumer electronics company. It has partnerships with hundreds of brands that see it providing flexible display and sensor technology to the likes of AirBus, Toyota, and Louis Vuitton. A Royole representative tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company is pleased with the FlexPai 2’s performance in China so far, but wouldn’t disclose sales data. At roughly $500 cheaper than Samsung’s Galaxy Fold 2, though, it’s worth a look however many units it sells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQXLfS"&gt;Royole also says it plans to announce global availability early next year. As such, this isn’t a full review of the FlexPai 2 — my review unit was loaded with Chinese-only software, so I can’t tell you much about the daily-driver experience. I can, however, tell you that the hardware is quite impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7KeW_1f_7b2AzcZ52pPa01Bj_f8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140904/DSCF7461.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;When unfolded, the FlexPai 2 is roughly the size of an iPad mini.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i4FfxbRpJOLuFoVf2Xx8wWFq-3Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140905/DSCF7457.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The FlexPai 2 runs Royole’s WaterOS Android 10 skin.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ikAyN_D5h3HitC12hfZqqR_sKc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140906/DSCF7465.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The FlexPai 2 is about the size of a passport when folded.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bjUggI"&gt;The FlexPai 2 folds the opposite way to Samsung’s Galaxy Fold devices; that’s to say that the main screen goes around the outside of the curve rather than the inside, so it remains exposed when the hinge is closed. It’s the same approach seen in Huawei’s Mate X folding phones. When folded, the FlexPai 2 is about the same size and shape as a passport, while the unfolded screen is comparable to an iPad mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y72o3B"&gt;You really get three screens in one with the FlexPai 2, although you only use one at once. The display is a 7.8-inch 1920 x 1440 4:3 panel which turns into a 5.5-inch 1440 x 900 16:10 panel or a 5.4-inch 1440 x 810 16.9 panel when folded, depending on which half you’re looking at. The reason it doesn’t fold evenly is because there’s a large bezel on one side of the screen that houses the phone’s quad cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebkGsb"&gt;Build quality is solid, although a slightly thicker plastic gasket on the opposite side of the screen to the cameras betrays the need for a little more durability protection than on your average smartphone. The phone feels great when unfolded, though, with a 6.8mm-thick slimline metal frame, and the hinge is smooth and torquey, without the awkward rubber concertina of the original FlexPai. One advantage of Royole’s new design over Samsung’s is that it can be folded tight without leaving a gap between the two halves of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ol4DgmeOlkkDIh9RevGsPWXQqM4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140909/DSCF74642.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PnCZst"&gt;The disadvantage is apparent in the display. The OLED panel itself looks decent enough, with good contrast and brightness, and while the resolution isn’t class-leading it’s sharp enough at 308 ppi. The problem is that because the screen has a larger bend radius than the Galaxy Fold’s, which folds at an acute angle on the inside, more of that crease is visible when the phone is unfolded. Basically, the crease is much bigger. I don’t find it too distracting, as it’s only really visible when light catches it the wrong way. But you can definitely feel the hinge behind the screen whenever you swipe across the middle, which isn’t ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zEFfg"&gt;I can’t really speak to durability other than to say I haven’t seen any problems in my month-plus with the device. I asked Royole for details on its own ULT-NSSP material used in the “Cicada Wing” display, and a representative wouldn’t confirm whether it was plastic or glass, only saying it’s “composed of ~100 micro-nano materials.” They also said it’s “shatterproof and functional after close to two million folds,” which makes me think it’s plastic. It definitely feels like plastic. But so does Samsung’s “ultra-thin glass,” so. Just know that Royole is not yet the one to make folding screens feel premium to the touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XaSaSC"&gt;The FlexPai 2 has high-end specs inside, with a Snapdragon 865 processor, up to 12GB of RAM, and a 4,450mAh battery. I found performance to be pretty good, with few of the software issues that plagued the original FlexPai whenever you wanted to switch up the orientation. As I mentioned before, I haven’t been able to use this as a primary device because of its onboard software, but Royole’s WaterOS does seem to have been improved quite a bit from the original FlexPai.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RntZ8-bUMhjFKrmUeCc87QGrAyI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140907/DSCF7462.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The FlexPai 2’s hinge is much sleeker than the original’s.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TXO0Jb"&gt;At 9,998 yuan, or roughly $1,500, the FlexPai 2 is still not exactly cheap. And Royole’s status as a newcomer to the mobile industry is another good reason to view the device with suspicion. But my experience of the hardware has been fairly positive, and Royole’s screen technology may well find itself into phones from other companies at some point; ZTE has been touted as an early partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="nr6yef"&gt;It’s still hard to recommend buying a folding phone from anyone, but Royole does deserve some credit for making a major improvement on its initial effort. The original FlexPai was a hasty attempt at notoriety, but its sequel feels like a much more credible device. If Royole can nail the software and maybe get the price down a little further for a Western release, it could be worth a look if you’re enamored with the form factor.&lt;/p&gt;

One UI 3.0 has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505517/samsung-one-ui-3-0-s20-plus-ultra-android-11-update-t-mobile"&gt;in public beta&lt;/a&gt; for the last two months, but this marks the official release of the final software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXcBJ7"&gt;One UI 3.0 has the messaging, notifications and security features of Android 11, along with some add-ons specific to One UI. Samsung has added easier ways to access widgets, take screenshots, and double-tap the screen to put your phone to sleep, to name a few, but if you want a more exhaustive list of all of the One UI 3.0 changes, you can check out this &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/09/17/heres-absolutely-every-new-thing-in-samsung-oneui-3-0/"&gt;roundup at &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the new lock screen and notifications shade in One UI 3.0.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="54sOyC"&gt;Outside the US, the international launch of One UI 3.0 also seems to be spinning up as well. &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; says that &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/02/samsung-shares-timeline-for-international-release-of-one-ui-3-0-for-galaxy-phones/"&gt;Samsung sent a full schedule of release dates&lt;/a&gt; to users in Egypt, with the flagship S20 line receiving Android 11 and One UI 3.0 some time in December, though after the US. According to the schedule, the next phones to receive the update will be the Note 20, Z Fold, Note 10, and S10 phones in January 2021. The update will take some time to hit every Samsung phone that supports it you’re using a Galaxy A10, A20 or A30S, don’t expect to see it before August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dvb3sE"&gt;When we reviewed Android 11 in September, we appreciated all its added features for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21426066/android-11-review-features-bubbles-priority-notifications-updates-pixel-oneplus"&gt;managing the complexity of modern Android phones&lt;/a&gt;, but noted the possibility for fragmentation, as Google and Samsung’s takes on Android have started to diverge yet again. Samsung was known for taking a long time to release updates, like when it took five whole months to send out Android Pie. But that’s changed over the years as it’s gotten better at managing its timeline. Last year’s Android 10 update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21025221/android-10-samsung-galaxy-s10-availability-att-sprint-t-mobile-verizon-xfinity-mobile-one-ui"&gt;took three months to hit the first phones&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s what we’re seeing with Android 11 this year too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OeAGu7"&gt;Issues like fragmentation are important because Samsung is the largest smartphone vendor globally, and the largest producer of Android phones in the US. That means the widespread adoption of new features largely relies on the company choosing to include them in new versions of One UI. From our early preview, it seems like the most important bits of Android 11 have made it into One UI 3.0; but when it comes to Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574451/android-rcs-encryption-message-end-to-end-beta"&gt;other Android projects&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung might not have as much to gain. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If you’ve got an older iPhone, your FaceTime calls just got better </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of the iPhone with the FaceTime icon" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xku19RnwtvfwXXAxhGVSoI4i50M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68446757/DSCF2931.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dsj7Hh"&gt;When Apple released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21547652/ios-14-2-available-now-download-new-emoji-wallpaper-airplay-2-iphone-ipad-update"&gt;iOS 14.2 last month&lt;/a&gt;, it didn’t mention that FaceTime calls would now be in 1080p for older iPhones. &lt;a href="https://macmagazine.com.br/post/2020/12/01/iphones-8-e-mais-recentes-agora-suportam-facetime-hd-1080p/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;MacMagazine &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has updated the product &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiphone%2Fcompare%2F%3Fdevice1%3Diphone8%26device2%3DiphoneXR%26device3%3Diphone11pro&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22149428%2Fiphone-facetime-1080p-facetime-hd-iphone8-ios-14-2#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;comparison pages&lt;/a&gt; of the iPhones 8, X, XR, XS, SE, and 11 (including the Max and Pro versions) to show that they now support FaceTime at 1080p over Wi-Fi, as opposed to before when they only supported 720p. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5O5KJ"&gt;Calls made over cellular will still be at the lower resolution, but if you’re FaceTiming over Wi-Fi you may notice increased clarity after the update. That is, unless both callers had the iPhone 12, which has had 1080p FaceTime calls from the start (including over cellular if you’re on 5G). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9InA3"&gt;My sister has an iPhone 8 with the update, so I called her up on FaceTime. I had her take a screenshot when we were calling over Wi-Fi, then had her switch to cellular and take another screenshot for comparison. For good measure, I also took screenshots on my iPhone 12 Mini to compare what it looked like on my end. You can judge for yourself if you can notice any differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AWS275"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10199176"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="kUiwK2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10199183"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lRrJaS"&gt;I’ve worked in video all my life, and the difference between the two is pretty striking to me, at least on her end. On my end the difference is a little noticeable, but I don’t think I’d be able to tell at a glance if the video coming from her phone was in full HD. Part of this could be that, while her phone is streaming to me at an increased resolution, the iPhone 8 still has the 7MP FaceTime camera, as opposed to the 12MP camera found on the iPhone 11 and later. Of course, whether you see a difference depends on how sensitive you are to changes in video quality, or how good your eyesight is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="2DvHSq"&gt;It’s unclear why Apple didn’t include this feature in the changelog for the update, given that it’s on the iPhone &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiphone-se%2Fspecs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22149428%2Fiphone-facetime-1080p-facetime-hd-iphone8-ios-14-2#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;product&lt;/a&gt; and comparison pages. Nevertheless, it’s a nice bonus given that a lot of people will be celebrating the holidays over video call in order to stay safe. Mom and dad will be able to see the kids’ smiles a little better, and when you can’t be together you might be surprised at the difference a seemingly small jump in clarity can make. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now record footage from Ecobee’s camera to Apple servers, but you may want to keep their app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Ecobee SmartCamera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Ip-buSprBFVdkoxGqRpyQlyWKI=/360x0:2520x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68446137/ecobee_SmartCamera_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ecobee&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A23RvO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/newsroom/press-releases/ecobee-reaffirms-commitment-to-open-ecosystem-with-homekit-secure-video/"&gt;Ecobee’s SmartCamera has received a firmware update &lt;/a&gt;that may interest Apple users who are feeling a little burnt-out on subscriptions. The camera, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221291/ecobee-smartcamera-haven-security-platorm-smart-home-price-specs-features"&gt;which doubled as an Alexa speaker when it launched this April&lt;/a&gt;, generally has the standard smart camera features: you can stream video from it to your phone for free, and with a $5-a-month subscription you can have it record video and notify you of any movement (or just human movement, if you prefer). But today’s update adds Apple HomeKit Secure Video support, and it may give you another, cheaper way to record and store that footage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QveM5I"&gt;If you’re a little unfamiliar with the service, you’re probably not alone. HomeKit Secure Video was launched at WWDC in June of 2019, but so far &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fhome%2Faccessories%2F%23section-camera&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22149216%2Fecobee-smart-camera-apple-homekit-support-firmware-update-subscription#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;only a handful of cameras&lt;/a&gt; support it. Like Ecobee’s service, it lets you stream video to your iOS devices for free, provided you have an Apple TV, HomePod, or stay-at-home iPad that can act as a HomeKit hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sOsZTy"&gt;If you want to record video, you’ll need to pay for Apple’s 200GB iCloud subscription, which costs $2.99 a month. But that’s cheaper than Ecobee’s service, and also includes extra space for your iCloud backups, Apple Photo Library, etc. You won’t have to worry about all that recorded footage eating up your iCloud storage. As a HomeKit Secure Video user myself, I can tell you that Apple doesn’t count the video towards your storage limit (though the service only keeps recorded clips for 10 days, as opposed to Ecobee’s 14 days). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vyGsiv"&gt;If you already have a device that can act as a hub, $2.99 a month versus $5 a month may seem like a good deal, and if you already pay for extra iCloud storage the service is included in your bill. It’s a bit of a harder sell  if you also have to buy an Apple TV, HomePod, or iPad, though. If you want to record more than one camera, you’ll also see less savings: Apple requires the $9.99-a-month 2TB iCloud storage plan to record up to 5 cameras (Ecobee or otherwise), which is the same price you’ll pay for unlimited recording on multiple Ecobee cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwRyq7"&gt;Before deciding to switch to HomeKit and ditch the Ecobee app, you should know that Ecobee tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Apple’s Home app doesn’t support the camera’s ability to pan and tilt (other HomeKit cameras have the same limitation, too). You might want to keep the Ecobee app around for that, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fcameras%2Fcircle-view-security-camera.961-000489.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22149216%2Fecobee-smart-camera-apple-homekit-support-firmware-update-subscription#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;or buy a cheaper HomeKit camera to begin with&lt;/a&gt;. I personally use Homekit Secure Video to manage my Logitech Circle 2, and it works well for its primary purpose: not having to pay an extra monthly fee to see what terrible disaster my cat has caused during the night.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A night-vision image of a cat sitting on a piece of furniture with its eyes glowing and mouth open" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s51x83WIq2ybzwIdlZMwA_DuNNo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22139878/IMG_0404.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lovely. Thank you, HomeKit Secure Video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

    <title>Climate change is already a disaster to health, doctors say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="FRANCE-WEATHER-HEATWAVE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EO1zBpxEg9fVTVmz-q7MPiLENI8=/0x0:7520x5013/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68446125/1151828008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This picture, taken on June 25th, 2019, in Clermont-Ferrand, shows a personal care assistant holding the hand of an elderly person as she visits her house to help her to avoid heatstroke and dehydration during a heatwave.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Thierry Zoccolan / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c52NdT"&gt;Dangerously high temperatures put hundreds of thousands of people’s health and livelihoods at risk every year, and a major new report shows how much the threat has already grown in a warming world. Among other alarming statistics, heat-related deaths among older adults grew by nearly 54 percent between 2000 and 2018, the report finds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVjObu"&gt;The sweeping health and climate change report was published today in the prominent medical journal &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The report was produced by more than 100 experts from academia, the World Health Organization, and other UN agencies. The report offers proof that climate change will not only reshape life in the future, but it is actively endangering lives now. Health care providers already see themselves treating a climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="9o9kE3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We don’t want our health system to be overwhelmed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BNtFje"&gt;Doctors held back tears during a briefing with reporters when asked to reflect on the results of the report and how it connected to their experiences in emergency rooms as the COVID-19 pandemic spread around the world. “It’s been a really, really hard year,” said Jeremy Hess, an emergency medicine physician and co-author of the study, before taking a long pause to collect himself. “We see really catastrophic impacts that are very distressing to us.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197467/extreme-heat-waves-covid-19-pandemic-coronavirus"&gt;Heatwaves&lt;/a&gt; and other natural disasters were particularly dangerous this year, as emergency responders and health care systems struggled to handle the pandemic. Experts fear that climate-related disasters could similarly overwhelm hospitals in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4IoZRi"&gt;“We really implore people to learn with us from our experience this year, and try and avoid the worst,” Hess said. “We don’t want our health system to be overwhelmed by climate change impacts, and we know what we need to do to stop this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PILJT8"&gt;The report, while covering a sweeping range of health threats from hunger to pollution, included brand-new findings on how many more lives have been taken by extreme heat. The number of heat-related deaths globally in 2018 reached an alarming 296,000 — and that’s just among people over the age of 65, who are among the most vulnerable to heat illness. China, India, Japan, and central Europe had the most deaths among older adults. In the US, heat-related mortality has nearly doubled for this demographic over the past 20 years, reaching a record 19,000 deaths in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uxFRks"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Heat-related mortality has nearly doubled for this demographic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uOB32e"&gt;People who work outside are also more vulnerable to heatwaves. Staying inside during a heatwave is often a healthier choice. But &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;working when it’s too hot outside comes with costs, too. US workers in the service, manufacturing, agriculture, and construction sectors likely lost $45 billion in earnings in 2015, the report estimates. Globally, people worked 302 billion hours less in 2019 because of scorching temperatures — 103 billion more hours than were lost in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fYeBI"&gt;Rising temperatures have also triggered more wildfires, which poses another set of health threats. Globally, the risk of people being exposed to a wildfire grew in a majority of the world’s countries in recent years when compared to the period between 2001 and 2004. The US saw one of the biggest increases in risk, with a 19 percent rise in daily exposures to wildfires. That means more people are breathing in more soot and pollution from the blazes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7U4p9s"&gt;Fortunately, other studies have shown how taking ambitious action on climate change &lt;a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/6/eaau4373"&gt;can save thousands of lives&lt;/a&gt;. “We don’t want to have regret that we didn’t do everything we could in order to prevent what we know is coming,” says Renee Salas, an emergency medicine doctor and lead author of a policy brief accompanying today’s new report. “That’s why we’re pleading [with people] to listen to the science. Let the science guide us, and prevent the most catastrophic outcomes that could lie ahead if we don’t do something.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google News will allow free access to paywalled articles from news sites</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tw72pU"&gt;As part of its $1 billion investment in partnerships with news publishers, Google will start paying for some paywalled content for its News Showcase program. News Showcase, a new addition to Google News that &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/google-news-showcase/"&gt;launched in October&lt;/a&gt;, displays story panels curated by publishers — but its not available in the US yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zzcKT"&gt;News Showcase will “start offering people access to paywalled content in partnership with select news publishers,” says a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/news/google-news-showcase-expands/"&gt;Google blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Google will pay partners for limited access to paywalled content. To access that content, users will still have to register with the individual publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDGk8r"&gt;Users in the US shouldn’t get too excited about free articles just yet. Google lists partnerships with publishers in several countries, but the US is not currently on the list. News Showcase went live in October in Brazil and Germany. Publications in other countries, including Argentina, Canada, France, UK, and Australia, have since signed on. “Conversations are underway in a number of other countries,” Google says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="CbSnxr"&gt;News Showcase was first launched for the Google News app on Android, and is now available on iOS. Google says it will be coming soon to &lt;a href="http://news.google.com/"&gt;news.google.com&lt;/a&gt; and Google Discover.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chevy Bolt batteries were catching fire, and now there’s a class action lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1KCypjGfvcw7L2cY-VIJ0WMXQCA=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68445863/aliptak_180919_2960_5226.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Liptak / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MJRghr"&gt;A class action lawsuit was filed against General Motors alleging that the Chevy Bolt’s battery is “prone to burst into flames.” The lawsuit comes on the heels of GM announcing that it was recalling 68,000 Bolts over a malfunctioning battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xJc5O"&gt;The lawsuit, which was filed in Northern District of Illinois, claims that the Bolt’s battery is defective and dangerous. Specifically, when the batteries in the electric vehicle are charged to full, or very close to full, they pose a risk of fire. The lawsuit accuses the company of fraud, negligent practices, and “knowingly introducing defective vehicles into the marketplace and defrauding consumers across the country.” The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sOZzQX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Knowingly introducing defective vehicles into the marketplace and defrauding consumers across the country”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xOTTyx"&gt;There have been at least five incidents of fires involving Bolts with fully charged or almost fully charged batteries, the &lt;a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2020/11/13/gm-recalls-68000-chevy-bolt-evs-potential-battery-fires/6279998002/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detroit News&lt;/em&gt; recently reports&lt;/a&gt;. Three of those fires are under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which oversees vehicle defects. GM has found two reports of injuries due to smoke inhalation. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;GM issued a recall &lt;/a&gt;for 68,667 Chevy Bolts on November 13th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MrCRc"&gt;While the investigation continues, GM said it has developed software that will limit vehicle charging to 90 percent of full capacity to prevent future incidents. Chevy dealerships have been tasked with updating their customers’ vehicle battery software beginning on November 17th to limit the maximum state of charge to 90 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wB3V5p"&gt;The plaintiff’s attorneys argue that the software patch renders the Bolt less effective. “GM’s only purported ‘fix’ to reduce the risk of fire is a software update that limits the maximum state of charge to approximately 90 percent battery capacity, thereby reducing the amount of mileage that these vehicles can otherwise travel on a full charge,” the attorneys said in &lt;a href="https://chimicles.com/cskd-files-chevy-bolt-battery-class-action/"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GyeIfv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The plaintiffs also accuse GM of exaggerating the Bolt’s capabilities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ngk1VL"&gt;The plaintiffs also accuse GM of exaggerating the Bolt’s capabilities. The automaker says the Bolt’s battery capacity is 60 kWh, while the plaintiffs claim it is actually 57 kWh. The lawsuit was filed by Bolt owner Andres Torres and seeks to be certified for class action status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKvKx0"&gt;“We are in the midst of executing a safety recall on certain 2017-2019 Chevrolet Bolt EVs,” a GM spokesperson said. “We are not going to comment on any related litigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSi1l8"&gt;GM, which owns Chevy, Cadillac, and GMC, is the latest automaker to issue a voluntary recall due to battery defects. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/10/18659983/audi-etron-recall-battery-fire-risk"&gt;Audi recalled over 500 E-Tron SUVs&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s first all-electric car, because of a risk for battery fires. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761067/nio-es8-electric-suv-recall-battery-fires-china"&gt;China’s NIO recalled nearly 5,000&lt;/a&gt; of its ES8 electric SUVs after multiple reports of battery fires surfaced in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1lFK7"&gt;There’s no evidence that electric vehicles catch fire at a rate that’s any different from internal combustion cars, but the topic has received increased scrutiny as more EVs hit the road. First responders are even being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/3/17530646/tesla-battery-fire-electric-vehicles-transportation-science"&gt;trained to handle EV battery fires&lt;/a&gt; since they can’t be extinguished via some traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9L4nTu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EuDXwr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Alexa can now intuitively switch between more languages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dwrpMOXyUWq3zgDdop-w7uZ9Yv8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68445707/dseifert_201020_4247_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="43Soz1"&gt;Amazon is updating Alexa to allow it to automatically switch between more languages. The update comes after a flurry of small Alexa additions over the course of November, increasing functionality and making Alexa more useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDorYQ"&gt;Alexa first gained the ability to automatically respond to requests &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20910086/amazon-alexa-spanish-multilingual-mode"&gt;in English and other languages in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. However, you were limited to only two languages at a time. That hasn’t changed, but now users can enable a few more languages in the Alexa app. Alexa can speak German, French, Canadian-French, Japanese, Spanish, US-Spanish, and Hindi — all paired with English. Additionally, users can switch languages without pulling up the app by saying “Alexa, speak Spanish” to set a new primary language or “Alexa, speak Spanish and English” to set up a pair to switch between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o345Tj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Alexa can anticipate “latent goals”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sfh3rJ"&gt;Alexa has also gained the ability to respond to what Amazon calls “latent goals.” This basically means that Alexa can address requests that are “hidden” within or naturally follow an original question. To borrow Amazon’s example, if you ask “How long does it take to steep tea?” then Alexa can assume that the latent goal is setting a tea timer, respond “Five minutes is a good place to start,” and follow that up with “Would you like me to set a timer for five minutes?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3WeqP0"&gt;Besides these two major changes, Alexa has gained the ability to include Fire TV commands in Alexa routines. So you can say “Alexa, I’m grabbing a drink,” and Alexa will know to pause your show and turn on your kitchen lights. And to contribute to the ever-growing Alexa creep across products and services, you can now also use the assistant in the Amazon Shopping app to search for products and status updates on orders hands-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJTcqW"&gt;These are just a few of the skill-oriented changes to Alexa that Amazon rolled out in November. Echo devices as a whole have been updated, too. The Echo Frames are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575243/amazon-echo-frames-smart-glasses-alexa-loop-second-gen-available"&gt;now widely available&lt;/a&gt;, the Echo Buds have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21593991/amazon-alexa-echo-buds-workouts-fitness-tracking-wireless-headphones"&gt;new Alexa-enabled workout skills&lt;/a&gt;, and Echo Shows now have access to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21560891/amazon-alexa-care-hub-how-to-use-setup"&gt;Amazon’s Care Hub for checking in on loved ones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zens’ new Modular wireless chargers offer a mix-and-match setup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EV0cRU2oc5XNEaUodWE6fH7QAsg=/276x0:1782x1004/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68444637/Screen_Shot_2020_12_02_at_3.57.31_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Zens&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dSCSDt"&gt;Zens has a new set of wireless chargers out called &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/blog/zens-introduces-modular-series-create-your-perfect-wireless-charger/"&gt;the Zens Modular&lt;/a&gt;. They are designed to fix the rigidity of most combination wireless chargers by letting users customize their own bespoke charging setup to suit their needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTbchn"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/modular-series/"&gt;Zens Modular system&lt;/a&gt; is divided into two halves: main stations and extensions. The main station (as the name implies) is the primary hub for your wireless charging setup and is the only thing that you’ll have to plug into the wall. Zens has three different main station options: the €99,99 / $121.16 &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/zens-modular-dual-wireless-charger-main-station/"&gt;Modular Dual Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt;, which is a flat pad that can charge two devices at once at up to 15W each; the €69,99 / $84.81 &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/modular-stand-wireless-charger-main-station/"&gt;Modular Stand Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt;, a single charger that offers a stand form factor and can charge at 15W; and the €59,99 / $72.69 &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/modular-single-wireless-charger-main-station/"&gt;Modular Single Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt;, a standard flat pad that also offers 15W charging. All three products are rated for both Apple’s 7.5W charging and Samsung Fast Charge, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xGOY8"&gt;But while the main station hubs are relatively standard wireless chargers, it’s the Modular system’s extension hubs that make things interesting. Using a magnetic connector, you can clip on additional charging pads to a main charger, adding multiple Apple Watch or wireless charging pads as you need (up to four total). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mS3BNGHhwWo5SKbqBIzGG81ycr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22138450/zens.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zens&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lIzaOq"&gt;To start, Zens is offering two extensions: a €39,99 / $48.46 &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/modular-single-wireless-charger-extension/"&gt;Modular Single Wireless Charger Extension&lt;/a&gt; block that adds a 10W charging pad and a €49,99 / $60.57 &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/modular-apple-watch-charger-extension/"&gt;Apple Watch module&lt;/a&gt; for Apple’s smartwatches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="55EhhZ"&gt;There are a few limitations: only those two extension pads can be used as add-ons (so you can’t chain together multiple stand chargers or multiple double pads). The new chargers also don’t use the multi-coil technology that Zens debuted with its excellent Liberty charger earlier this year, so you’ll still need to make sure you’re aligning your phone correctly. The Zens chargers are also pretty pricey for what they offer, but the customizable system and sheer number of devices you can charge off a single plug might make it worthwhile for customers who want to be able to charge up multiple devices frequently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ad5h2P"&gt;The new Zens Modular chargers are available now through the company’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeSkbg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Xkts7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
