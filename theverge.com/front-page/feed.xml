    <title>Corsair’s first gaming monitor is the pricey, 32-inch Xeneon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Corsair Xeneon" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1sabAkVu3fu11KzrTbBSFTQIY4w=/0x0:1989x1326/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931682/xeneonhero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Corsair&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0oJwLu"&gt;When it comes to PC components and accessories, there isn’t much that Corsair itself doesn’t make. The company’s adding gaming monitors to its list of offerings with today’s announcement of a 32-inch model called Xeneon. It uses a 1440p quantum dot IPS 16:9 aspect ratio panel that has a 165Hz refresh rate to display fast-paced content. Other standout specs include AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility for adaptive sync to eliminate screen tearing when the frame rate fluctuates. It also has 100 percent coverage of the SRGB color gamut, and on its back, there are plenty of ports, which I’ll expand upon later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jw9GYb"&gt;Corsair is utilizing its well-known presence in the market to go up against not just other monitor manufacturers, like LG, Samsung, BenQ and Acer, but other big names in PC gaming as a whole — specifically, Razer, which released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22524309/razer-raptor-27-gaming-monitor-vesa-freesync-features-2021-price-ports"&gt;revised 27-inch Raptor monitor earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. Corsair’s Xeneon leans on its iCue ecosystem, so you can change your monitor settings in the same app that can tweak the settings and lighting for your Corsair-branded mouse and keyboard. Perhaps the even bigger humble brag is that the Xeneon’s stand is compatible with rigging systems, &lt;a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/multi-mount-system"&gt;like Flex Arms released by the Corsair-owned Elgato&lt;/a&gt;. If you have an Elgato Stream Deck, you’ll be able to switch numerous display settings on the fly with one, including color temperature, response time, and inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Corsair Xeneon" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qxmp0FAr2vUuy-SxSOlci6QwrQ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22888459/XENEON_32QHD165_Gaming_Monitor_20.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Corsair&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contrary to what this image indicates, you can use accessories from non-Corsair brands with the Xeneon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DWIB3T"&gt;Even if you aren’t planning on using all of that integration, the Xeneon has plenty of other noteworthy features. It supports Vesa DisplayHDR400, topping out at 440 nits of brightness for HDR content. And speaking of Vesa, it has a standard Vesa mount, so you can stick it onto a monitor arm of your choosing if you’d like. The Xeneon supports a range of motion, including tilt, swivel and height adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0IzR2"&gt;In terms of video inputs, it has two HDMI 2.0 ports, one DisplayPort, and one USB-C port (this port also supports 15W PD charging). The HDMI 2.0 ports support QHD resolution at up to 144Hz, while the DisplayPort input and USB-C support up to 165Hz refresh rate at QHD, according to Corsair’s documentation. If you want to connect devices to the Xeneon to transfer data through the aforementioned USB-C video input, as well as through two USB-A ports, you’ll need to plug its dedicated upstream USB-C port into your PC. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Corsair Xeneon" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zxtRABgJlgakTyYteTia2NZBwKc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22888474/xeneon.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rear view of the Xeneon’s die-cast aluminum stand and cable management system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TTS5Zu"&gt;The nice thing about most things that Corsair makes is that there is usually a wide range of options at several price points. With the Xeneon, its first and currently only gaming monitor comes in at a rather high $799.99. I haven’t tried this model, so I can’t be the judge of whether it’s worth it. But of note, this cost has a pretty good warranty baked in — both a three-year hardware warranty and a “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.corsair.com%2Fxeneon-quickstart&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F30%2F22700882%2Fcorsair-gaming-monitor-32-inch-xeneon-price-features-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;zero dead pixel&lt;/a&gt;” warranty, which will let you swap it out if your Xeneon has one or more bright pixel or six or more dark subpixels. Both of those are more than zero, but to my knowledge, most monitor manufacturers require more than one dead pixel to warrant giving you a new panel at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dCx6YS"&gt;As good as that warranty seems, $800 is far more than I would spend for a QHD gaming monitor or even two combined (my Acer XV272U was a cool $300), though, for people who already have a lot of Corsair and Elgato gear, this might be the monitor you’ve been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Game Awards will take place in December</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MZG-owJccg44_WXjotenXcDbUiY=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931684/TGA2021_Statue_Exploration_4k_0001_OverTheTop_000338_38_0038.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJycmq"&gt;The 2021 edition of The Game Awards, the annual Oscars-like award show for video games, will take place on December 9th. The show will take place at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, and unlike last year, there will be an in-person audience — though it will be an invite-only event. Details about specific health and safety protocols for the in-person event will be shared “in the coming weeks,” according to a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmeNiy"&gt;The awards, which will be hosted by creator and executive producer Geoff Keighley, will also be livestreamed on more than 40 different platforms, so you’ll be able to watch from home if you want. The show organizers are also promising that there will be “free playable game content” available as part of an “immersive digital experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="i3CFNt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There could be some surprising reveals in store&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qWuOXv"&gt;Like previous years, The Game Awards will also feature “first-look world premieres and new game announcements.” There was some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166109/the-game-awards-2020-announcements-trailers-fortnite-smash-bros-among-us-mass-effect"&gt;big news in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, including the announcements of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166187/fortnite-master-chief-halo-the-walking-dead-the-game-awards"&gt;Master Chief in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168749/next-smash-bros-character-sephiroth-fighters-pass-2"&gt;Sephiroth in &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft brought a huge surprise to the 2019 show: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21016575/microsoft-xbox-series-x-next-xbox-console"&gt;the reveal of the Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. There aren’t any details about what announcements to expect this year, but if past years are any indication, there could be some fun surprises in store.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Buy is restocking Nvidia RTX 30-series cards in stores on Friday morning </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jAdQx1H-SNR7Y41qDQMFPJZ1IPo=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931646/twarren_rtx3080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8fCgOv"&gt;If you’re an avid PC builder, you know that getting your hands on any of Nvidia’s 30-series GPUs has been next to impossible since they debuted. But Best Buy is hosting an event in select stores starting Friday, October 1st to give you the opportunity. If you haven't been outside in a while, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfGVRfNviLw#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can use this page to find the store closest to you&lt;/a&gt; that will have these GPUs in stock, sold at their retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HVneEe"&gt;Unfortunately, you can't just head down there cash in hand and hope to snatch one up. Best Buy has stated that you’ll need to line up at one of the designated stores before 7:30AM local time. This is when employees will begin handing out a limited amount of tickets (one per customer) that will allow you to purchase a single GPU. Of course, this is not a guarantee that everyone in line will get a ticket, or that everyone will get their graphics card of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K8vle2"&gt;A spokesperson from Best Buy has shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the following models will be available at all participating stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="1Cqm9z"&gt;So grab your favorite space blanket and your comfiest lawn chair; if you line up early, there's a fair chance you could take home one of these GPUs. But don’t sweat it if you can’t make it to this one. Best Buy hosts these restock events just about every month. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s MagSafe Battery attaches to any iPhone 12 or 13 model.&lt;/em&gt; | Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nx10mw"&gt;The Apple MagSafe Battery pack recently launched in July, and we are now finally seeing the first significant discount on the magnetic power bank that usually costs $99. The MagSafe ecosystem &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;may still be a bit underdeveloped&lt;/a&gt;, and there are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08TW7BRTJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some compelling alternatives from other manufacturers&lt;/a&gt;, but the little battery is a svelte option for juicing up an iPhone 12 or 13 on the go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1ReJh"&gt;With 1,460mAh and 11.3Wh, the MagSafe battery doesn’t earn its praise on specifications alone, but it has the software integration that no other power bank — magnetic or wired — has, with on-screen animations and charge levels visible, so you know exactly how much charge is left. Not only can it charge certain iPhones, but while it’s recharging via its built-in Lightning port, Dieter Bohn mentioned in his review that it works great as a wired MagSafe charger. You can buy the MagSafe Battery for &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/vergeAppleMagsafeCharger093021/https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/batteries/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-white.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;15 percent off today at AT&amp;amp;T, bringing the price down to $84&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sqt3ZV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10782055"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rNRkiL"&gt;Google’s first-generation Nest Hub makes for a great Google Photos-powered digital picture frame, as well as a basic smart display and speaker in the kitchen or around the house. It features a seven-inch touchscreen and far-field microphones for giving voice commands to the Google Assistant. There is a newer model out now; though, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"&gt;in our review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the advancements may not be compelling enough over the original — especially with a discount as big as the one you can get today on the first-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEBxFL"&gt;You can pick up the first-gen Nest Hub at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfGURhaeqVs#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1434980-REG%2Fgoogle_ga00515_us_tabletop_smart_screen.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F30%2F22701993%2Fapple-magsafe-battery-pack-google-home-nest-hub-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; for just $40. That is a $50 discount off its normal $90 asking price and $60 cheaper than its second-gen replacement. But if you’re more immersed in the Amazon Alexa ecosystem than the Google Assistant, you can also get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Charcoal/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; to tackle similar duties, along with video chatting with its built-in camera, for just $5 more. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yZFjuz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10782108"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GfBECa"&gt;Amazon has a big discount on the large and powerful Gigabyte Aero 15 laptop. This 15.6-inch computer packs a ton of features, including a 4K OLED display, Nvidia RTX 3080 GPU, 1TB SSD, and an 11th-Gen Intel Core i7 processor. It’s billed as a creator laptop, and it will be very capable for Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere, etc., but it can work its way around some AAA games as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeMoH9"&gt;Normally, the Aero 15 goes for $3,000, but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-AERO-15-OLED-YD-73US624SP/dp/B093Z1JLHT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;today’s discount has it at an all-time low price of $2,113&lt;/a&gt;. The one caveat to keep in mind is its webcam, which is unfortunately located below the screen for a low-angle view right up your nose. Maybe use a portion of the money you save to budget for a webcam if you’re using Zoom all the time? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21255234/gigabyte-aero-15-review-creator-laptop-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review of last year’s model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FNnXMp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505961"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uCkr1f"&gt;If you’re in need of charging multiple devices with a whole lot of wattage on tap, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Faukeyplus.com%2Fcollections%2Fpower%2Fproducts%2Faukey-omnia-mix3-90w-3-port-pd-charger-pa-b6s-white&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F30%2F22701993%2Fapple-magsafe-battery-pack-google-home-nest-hub-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Aukey’s Omnia Mix3 90 watt charger&lt;/a&gt; could be a great option. As its name indicates, it has a mix of three ports to output through: one USB-A port, one USB-C, and a primary USB-C with Power Delivery. The charger is smaller than Apple’s own 87-watt charger but can charge the 16-inch MacBook Pro all the same. If you plug in multiple devices, it will share the 90 watts across them, enough output for a 15-inch laptop and Nintendo Switch simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8BzDI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Faukeyplus.com%2Fcollections%2Fpower%2Fproducts%2Faukey-omnia-mix3-90w-3-port-pd-charger-pa-b6s-white&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F30%2F22701993%2Fapple-magsafe-battery-pack-google-home-nest-hub-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Aukey is offering an exclusive price on the Omnia Mix3&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers. Use promo code &lt;strong&gt;VERGE26&lt;/strong&gt; to take 47 percent off at checkout and knock the $56 price down to $30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LNSHP9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10739723"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wkvBLm"&gt;You can never have too many camera bags. That is a universal truth that just about every photographer knows all too well. Today, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1363557-REG%2Fpeak_design_bsl_10_bk_1_everyday_sling_10l_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F30%2F22701993%2Fapple-magsafe-battery-pack-google-home-nest-hub-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H has a great price on a very popular and well-regarded bag, the original version of the Peak Design’s Everyday Sling 10L&lt;/a&gt;. The 10L sling from Peak Design is a convenient size and style that easily commutes or travels with a camera, a couple lenses, and still enough room to spare for small items, like a water bottle. You can even squeeze some iPads into it, especially those of the Mini persuasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7h8ou"&gt;Today’s deal on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1363557-REG%2Fpeak_design_bsl_10_bk_1_everyday_sling_10l_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F30%2F22701993%2Fapple-magsafe-battery-pack-google-home-nest-hub-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Peak Design Everyday Sling 10L is just $70&lt;/a&gt;, saving 53 percent off its normal $150 price tag. Peak Design bags are known for premium quality and premium prices, so this deal is sure to sell out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="mAVDjU"&gt;A few quick iPad deals:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="g5ysyz"&gt;We know iPads can go on sale pretty frequently. Here are a few quick hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Esb1SU"&gt;Walmart has the base &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1157734/9383?subId1=vergeAppleMagsafeCharger093021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Sky-Blue%2F462727496&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=6890999&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A6890999&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10.9-inch iPad Air (2020) with 64GB of storage for $539&lt;/a&gt;. Not its best price ever, but a nice $60 discount with your choice of colors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CJPCG7"&gt;The higher capacity &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1157734/9383?subId1=vergeAppleMagsafeCharger093021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F325933358&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=6890999&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A6890999&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Air with 256GB is $100 off&lt;/a&gt;, just $650, also at Walmart.&lt;/li&gt;

We’ve seen this deal at Walmart prior, but now it’s available at Amazon.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Sony acquires Bluepoint Games, the studio behind its incredible remasters and remakes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cpOvCR2eBMl6J3ccRTrCBBcaMpY=/114x0:1346x821/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931319/bluepoint.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HoFCeX"&gt;Some of the very best games on PlayStation 5 so far are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;old titles made new&lt;/a&gt; — so it’s fitting that &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/30/welcoming-bluepoint-games-to-the-playstation-studios-family/"&gt;Sony is officially acquiring Bluepoint Games&lt;/a&gt;, the acclaimed studio that specializes in remasters. It’s the team &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21288462/demons-souls-remake-ps5-teaser-trailer-playstation-5-sony"&gt;that brought us the &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Colossus&lt;/em&gt; remakes&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/14/9529389/uncharted-nathan-drake-collection-review-playstation-4"&gt;fantastic remasters of the first three &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; games&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/26/10777180/gravity-rush-remastered-review-sony-ps4"&gt;cult-classic &lt;em&gt;Gravity Rush&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and both the &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid HD Collection &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Ico &amp;amp; Shadow of the Colossus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Collection &lt;/em&gt;for previous gen consoles. Bluepoint was behind the excellent 2013 port of &lt;em&gt;Flower&lt;/em&gt; to the PS4 as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3GpMI"&gt;That’s not the only reason Sony’s Bluepoint buy isn’t surprising though. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555358/sony-housemarque-returnal-developer-acquisition-bluepoint"&gt;The company spilled the beans in June&lt;/a&gt; when it bought &lt;em&gt;Returnal &lt;/em&gt;developer Housemarque, but accidentally uploaded an image showing a Bluepoint acquisition instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dMX9WE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;..so apparently PlayStation Japan uploaded the wrong image with their first tweet on Housemarque's acquisition, and it actually mentions a Bluepoint acquisition &lt;a href="https://t.co/yQBHtLbG5c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yQBHtLbG5c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nibel (@Nibellion) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/1409822833631502338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T2nkv6"&gt;Perhaps we’ll see remasters and remakes more often with Sony’s additional resources, but the studio is also going to create its own original game, according to a statement given to &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-acquires-bluepoint-next-game-playstation-exclusive"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Our next project, we’re working on original content right now. We can’t talk about what that is, but that’s the next step in the evolution for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9VZyx"&gt;Sony’s under some pressure right now to show that it has killer content for the PS5, since every first-party game it promised to deliver in 2021 (save the great &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523093/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-ps5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) have been delayed. &lt;em&gt;God of War: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432601/sony-playstation-studios-ps5-games-25-new-ip-interview"&gt;were all originally supposed to be 2021 releases&lt;/a&gt;, but even &lt;em&gt;Horizon &lt;/em&gt;recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22602306/horizon-forbidden-west-playstation-delay-2022-february"&gt;got pushed back to February&lt;/a&gt;. Third-party games have seen delays as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHWuMK"&gt;The company’s been shoring up its studios to make that happen — in addition to Housemarque and Bluepoint, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662706/sony-firesprite-the-playroom-developers-playstation-studios"&gt;it purchased Firesprite, developers of &lt;em&gt;The Playroom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GthlK"&gt;Sony also announced a remake from another acclaimed remastering and porting studio: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665460/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-ps5-darth-revan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is in development at Aspyr, perhaps best known for porting countless titles to Mac &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_ported_by_Aspyr"&gt;but also recently active&lt;/a&gt; in bringing older games to the Nintendo Switch. It’ll be console-exclusive to PS5. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455810/sony-ps5-profitable-uncharted-4-pc-investor-presentation"&gt;as we spotted in May&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Uncharted &lt;/em&gt;games are coming to PC... and PS5, too, with the new &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfrfJn_-24g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that includes both &lt;em&gt;Uncharted 4&lt;/em&gt; and a very good spinoff in &lt;em&gt;The Lost Legacy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ut3SeS"&gt;It’s a great time to love old games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch flags multiple types of irregular heartbeats, study shows  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Watch Series 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nI4eE3YWBBmkd5xpULj_tMwBQ0o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931094/akrales_171113_2119_0074.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Watch | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="btdYqJ"&gt;People who get irregular pulse notifications on an Apple Watch but don’t have atrial fibrillation — the condition the feature focuses on detecting — could still have another type of problem with their heartbeat, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/CIRCEP.121.010063"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwctQo"&gt;The findings show that even if someone with a concerning alert from their Apple Watch doesn’t get an atrial fibrillation diagnosis, they may not be in the clear, says study author Marco Perez, the director of the Inherited Arrhythmia Clinic at Stanford University Medical Center. “Even if you didn’t find atrial fibrillation, we were finding a lot of people who had something else that probably needed some clinical attention,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIkRfb"&gt;The analysis, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Circulation&lt;/em&gt;, was done using data from the Apple Heart Study, which was designed to test the Apple Watch’s ability to detect irregular heart rhythms. It launched in 2017 and included over 400,000 participants. In the study, anyone who got an irregular pulse notification from the watch was sent a clinical ECG patch, which could monitor their heart rhythm over a longer period of time. About 2,000 participants got an irregular pulse notification, and an earlier analysis showed that around &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1901183"&gt;a third of those people&lt;/a&gt; who then wore an ECG patch had atrial fibrillation show up during that monitoring period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpZsC6"&gt;This new study looked at the ECG patch data from the remaining participants that &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; have atrial fibrillation detected. “If we didn’t find atrial fibrillation — what did we find?” Perez says. Around 40 percent of those people had some other type of irregular pulse, including premature atrial contractions (extra heartbeats coming from the top of the heart) and premature ventricular contractions (extra heartbeats from the bottom of the heart). “They had a lot of these extra heartbeats,” he says. “Those are things that we pay attention to.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apUjzJ"&gt;Cardiologists still don’t have a good grasp on how dangerous those types of frequent extra heartbeats can be, and often don’t agree on how or if they should be treated, Perez says. They’ve been linked to the development of atrial fibrillation and heart failure, but there isn’t a clear understanding of the best way to manage them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWmqT4"&gt;The study also showed that almost a third of study participants who did not have atrial fibrillation detected on the ECG patch said that they eventually went on to get the condition diagnosed outside of the study. So even if someone doesn’t get a diagnosis on an initial evaluation, it may make sense to keep an eye on them going forward. “We probably have to start thinking about the best strategy for following those patients over time,” Perez says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a63Ifo"&gt;Right now, there’s a wide range of responses to these types of alerts. If someone tells a cardiologist that they had an irregular pulse notification, the doctor might do a quick, 10-second check on an ECG in the office. Other doctors might send them home with a patch for a week. Still others, if there are other factors that make them suspicious, might want to do longer-term monitoring. The technology is still new and the approach is still evolving, Perez says.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IsmnP9"&gt;Additional research will help refine the approach. But for now, this study implies that people who get irregular pulse warnings should keep an eye on their heart health, Perez says. “There might very well be something that is going on that could cause you to have an irregular pulse, and could be a sign of something wrong with your heart.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The rumored Noctua-equipped RTX 3070 appeared on Asus’ Facebook page</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Asus x Noctua RTX 3070" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Kdwmc3K12Hsy5a3YIUI3l7rFdM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931062/asusnoctuartx3070.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://wccftech.com/asus-geforce-rtx-3070-graphics-cards-featuring-noctua-cooling-solution-pictured/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wccftech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e4vPrZ"&gt;There have been rumors that Asus partnered with Noctua, maker of very quiet PC case fans and this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535729/noctua-nh-p1-passive-cpu-cooler-no-fan-silent"&gt;silent, fan-less CPU cooler&lt;/a&gt;, to make a custom Nvidia RTX 3070 desktop graphics card that looks like no other. While its existence has leaked a few times, picked up by &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/asus-noctua-30-series-graphics-card/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in recent months, &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-geforce-rtx-3070-graphics-cards-featuring-noctua-cooling-solution-pictured/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wccftech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was quick to spot that an Asus employee in Vietnam posted images of the graphics card and other info to the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/asusvn/posts/"&gt;Asus ROG Vietnam Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;. Those assets have since been taken down, but not before &lt;em&gt;Wccftech &lt;/em&gt;was able to snag the photos and take note of the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQ3Ka3"&gt;This new GPU, apparently called the RTX3070-08G-NOCTUA, won’t be as affordable as your average RTX 3070 (MSRP of $499), plus the cost of a couple of Noctua fans. Asus’ Facebook page temporarily listed the price as 26 million đồng, which converts roughly to about $1,100. &lt;em&gt;Phew&lt;/em&gt;. Though, we won’t know the official pricing or release dates and regions until Asus posts the info again without quickly removing it afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://wccftech.com/asus-geforce-rtx-3070-graphics-cards-featuring-noctua-cooling-solution-pictured/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wccftech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Renders that show off the Asus x Noctua RTX 3070.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="btBDOr"&gt;In case Noctua isn’t a familiar name to you, its fans are often the brand of choice for PC builders who are looking for a way to keep their rig running quietly, while also adding a unique look. It’s best known for the beige and brown colorway seen above, which looks both sophisticated and retro. Beyond aesthetics, though, Noctua products tend to keep your gear cool while running quietly, while sometimes coming in a slimmer profile than other aftermarket fans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfL6EV"&gt;Noctua’s fans have such a good reputation, in fact, that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMaL3KCQ1Hg"&gt;some people have done surgery on their GPUs&lt;/a&gt;, removing their stock fans and replacing them with Noctua case fans. There seem to be plenty of people who have done it, after glancing at &lt;a href="https://linustechtips.com/topic/1132866-using-noctua-fans-as-gpu-fans-on-the-stock-1080-heatsink/"&gt;this forum post at Linus Tech Tips&lt;/a&gt;. This Asus and Noctua collaboration seems like the ideal option for people who aren’t as familiar with disassembling components. It seems like you’ll pay dearly for it, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejPmq3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Stagg electric kettle has the best boiling button</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RisR5kIO444z_YFTZjdJciBZQ-g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931058/dbohn_210622_4648_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YHTVDL"&gt;It’s a strange thing that one of the most enjoyable physical interfaces I use in my day-to-day life is on a kettle. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffellowproducts.com%2Fproducts%2Fstaggekg&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22696994%2Ffellow-stagg-kettle-dial-button-tea-coffee-interface" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Stagg EKG Electric Kettle&lt;/a&gt;, specifically, a $150 appliance that’s almost entirely controlled through a single, magnificent dial that is a strong contender for the best way to turn on a kettle (a competition that, admittedly, lacks much competition). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f13Sz2"&gt;Using the Stagg is a delightful experience of tactility. The main control is a single dial/button located on the front right of the base. Turning it on takes just a single press, a deep, solid click that lets you know through touch and sound that you’ve turned on the kettle. Turning it off is a similar single press, another resonant click to announce that the kettle is off. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r4kPI0mXtliotXRmTRa6a332xlQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687321/dbohn_210622_4648_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ffVZuZ"&gt;Lastly, there’s adjusting the target temperature, done through an incredibly satisfying rotation of the dial, with each step on the infinitely rotatable ratcheted wheel giving a physical indication that you’re adjusting it forward and back. You can watch the temperature tick up or down on a small display opposite the dial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnqhdF"&gt;And it’s here that the Stagg shines: adjusting the temperature is intuitive and, more importantly, fast and easy. On my old kettle, temperature had to be adjusted by manually clicking plus/minus buttons each time, with a complex system of programmable presets (meant to alleviate the awkward controls) that, after years, I still never really grokked. The Stagg, on the other hand, is as simple as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/21/18105423/ipod-click-wheel-button-music-control-hardware-design"&gt;adjusting the volume on an iPod&lt;/a&gt; or the flame on a stove burner — just spin and win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7elxs6"&gt;Once you’ve dialed in your temperature, that’s it. The Stagg will heat your water to the desired degree (in either Fahrenheit or Celsius), and then you’re ready to enjoy it for tea, coffee, or any other hot beverage of your choice. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-AC92wYNLuOHDdz6FsGXMVDbSxU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687318/dbohn_210622_4648_0001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jzNGIg"&gt;The Stagg also builds an extra feature hidden into its dial. Pressing and holding it down will activate a built-in stopwatch, perfect for timing your steeping tea or brewing coffee without requiring any other gadgets or gizmos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lki8bX"&gt;The best proof of how capable the Stagg kettle’s dial is, however, comes in the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffellowproducts.com%2Fblogs%2Flearn%2Fhow-to-play-wormy-on-your-electric-kettle&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22696994%2Ffellow-stagg-kettle-dial-button-tea-coffee-interface" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rather unique easter egg&lt;/a&gt; that Fellow includes on every electric kettle: a functional version of &lt;em&gt;Snake&lt;/em&gt; known as &lt;em&gt;Wormy&lt;/em&gt;, which can be activated by rapidly toggling the Fahrenheit / Celsius switch located on the rear of the device back and forth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DVl19X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A luxury product, but one that’s enjoyable to use&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sZmsi9"&gt;Of course, it’s hard to talk about the Stagg without mentioning the elephant in the room: it’s a $150 gadget that boils water. It is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; much a luxury product. There are cheaper kettles out there that will do the same thing (that is to say, boil water to a specific temperature) as fast and efficiently, if not faster, than the Stagg. You can buy a stovetop kettle for $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydubjI"&gt;You’re paying a premium here for the design, and Stagg’s main control scheme — the single, otherwise nondescript dial — is a big part of that. It’s what allows for the core function of the Stagg to be as elegant as its Instagram-fodder form: simple, easy to use, and stylish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vt6hmn"&gt;Is it worth $150 for the button alone? Not for a kettle. But it is certainly the caliber of button that you’d want from a kettle that costs that much, a piece of UX that elevates the entire product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8e0fvC"&gt;And most important of all, it makes a morning cup of tea just a little more enjoyable. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo categorically denies that a 4K Switch Pro is in development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nintendo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kzndv147yiO9wZfKx_61I1fa9VI=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69929036/nintendo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f4M4eY"&gt;It is rare for a big company to come out and categorically deny an entire report, but that’s what Nintendo just did — the Japanese corporate entity issued a press release insisting &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-29/nintendo-switch-4k-developers-make-games-for-nonexistent-console?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s seeming revelation&lt;/a&gt; that Nintendo was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701210/nintendo-switch-4k-pro-rumors-oled"&gt;pushing developers to build 4K-resolution games&lt;/a&gt; for an upcoming but potentially canceled “Switch Pro” handheld was entirely incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNMMYO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1443366440183074819"&gt;Nintendo writes&lt;/a&gt; the report “falsely claims that Nintendo is supplying tools to drive game development for a Nintendo Switch with 4K support” and insists that it’s “not true.” Separately, it says that it has no plans for any new Nintendo Switch other than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22690483/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-oled-console-hands-on-preview"&gt;the slightly refined OLED model&lt;/a&gt; that’ll be out next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BLEqT"&gt;On Thursday morning, Zynga spokesperson Sarah Ross also denied the report, saying in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/report-games-in-the-works-for-4k-nintendo-console-that-1847771280"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “To clarify, Zynga does not have a 4K developer kit from Nintendo.” Zynga was the only developer named out of the 11 companies that &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported receiving a 4K Switch developement kit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gvtXQt_gsnw_c91aFLwK8mp6mWA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22889057/nintendo_twitter_bloomberg_report_switch_pro.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1hUcdR"&gt;While there’s always a possibility that the language technically allows for most if not all of &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; report to be correct — that, for instance, there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a 4K Switch development kit, and that Nintendo &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; push developers to build 4K content, and that Nintendo is simply &lt;em&gt;not pushing that anymore — &lt;/em&gt;Nintendo is attempting to say that the entire report is not true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ewPtO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; appears to be standing by its report, which isn’t much of a surprise. It comes from respected game/tech industry journalists who have been extremely well-sourced in the past, and this report is no exception: it cites anonymous employees at 11 different game companies all saying they have a 4K Switch development kit. Following Nintendo’s tweet, the publication simply added an additional line about Nintendo’s denial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDB7HZ"&gt;Weighed against a Nintendo statement with even a little bit of wiggle room, I’d tend to believe 11 sources over the company, particularly when that company’s under investor pressure to have its new OLED handheld do well on launch day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zPHp6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:56PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Bloomberg has minimally updated its post to include Nintendo’s new denial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIPxAQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 30th, 9:58AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Zynga denying possession of a 4K developer kit from Nintendo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NY5UHR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYcQ1i"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games makes children’s privacy services free for developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lr2Qbf_zCLyMSal9OlUp_Ia29f4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69930857/acastro_210429_1777_epic_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MIQAtb"&gt;Epic Games announced Thursday that it would be &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-games-and-superawesome-offer-free-parent-verification-for-all-developers"&gt;making its parent verification services&lt;/a&gt; free for all developers in order to make it easier to build games that keep kids safe online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUlpxu"&gt;Epic Games bought SuperAwesome, a safe kidtech company, last September. With this new addition to the company, Epic Games was able to leverage its Kids Web Services (KWS) program, allowing developers to “verify the identity of parents or guardians when granting their children permission to use features that collect personal information.” Once a parent is verified through the system, they become part of what Epic calls the “ParentGraph,” which makes it simpler to offer verification for other games on the Epic platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCWI8D"&gt;Epic says that this system not only protects children and parents, but “minimizes personal data processing, since the parent or guardian is only providing their verification details once.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YBpCit"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The metaverse will be made up of many types of experiences and will not be controlled by any one company”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WY48IK"&gt;As part of the announcement, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney couldn’t help but offer yet another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;definition of the metaverse&lt;/a&gt;. “The metaverse will be made up of many types of experiences and will not be controlled by any one company,” Sweeney said. “This will require all of us who are building toward this future to create experiences that are not only interoperable but also take the safety of our audiences into account, no matter their age. By making KWS parent verification free we hope to enable more developers to create safer digital experiences, while empowering parents to make the choices that are right for their families.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtWDl0"&gt;Over the last few weeks and years, children’s safety and online privacy has grown into a more pressing issue for federal regulators. Earlier this month, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported on internal research &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701445/facebook-instagram-mental-health-research-pdfs-documents"&gt;at Facebook suggesting that&lt;/a&gt; Instagram knew how the social network had a negative effect on the mental health of teenagers. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/27/18243312/tiktok-ftc-fine-musically-children-coppa-age-gate"&gt;TikTok paid nearly $6 million&lt;/a&gt; to the Federal Trade Commission for violating a children’s privacy law, called the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ei4yHG"&gt;By making KWS free for developers, Epic Games says that it’s making it easier for more companies to provide kid-friendly services while adhering to laws like COPPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQsxH1"&gt;“Regulators around the world have led the charge by introducing laws intended to make the internet safer for kids like COPPA in the US, the Children’s Code in the UK and GDPR-K in Europe,” Dylan Collins, founder of SuperAwesome, said in a statement Thursday. “We share this vision and want to make compliance an accessible reality for developers and creators of all sizes. Free parent verification is a critical industry step to make it easier for everyone to say yes to kid-safe experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6l3QnL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;An earlier version of this piece erroneously stated that Epic Games launched KWS. In fact, the company obtained ownership as part of the EpicAwesome acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ciBx4P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
