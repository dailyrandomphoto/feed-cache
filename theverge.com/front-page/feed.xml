    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uNHMij"&gt;There is never a better time to dive into the smart home than Black Friday and its close cousin Cyber Monday. Traditionally, tech deals on home gadgets are huge this time of year, plus, it’s the only time you’ll find real bargains on gear from some of the smaller companies, such as Eve, Level, and Nanoleaf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rjy6kh"&gt;Whether you’re thinking about dipping a toe into this home automation shindig with a smart speaker or maybe a connected door lock, or want to bolster an already impressive smart home setup, it’s worth investing some cash this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRU2qz"&gt;Also, if you just want to upgrade your home cleaning routine or have a way to check in on Fido now that you’re back at work (the separation anxiety is real), this is a good time to get a great bargain on smart cameras, robot vacuums, and even a smart mop. Here’s our roundup of the best deals on smart home gear you can buy right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQmoq2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for more Black Friday deals? Be sure to check out our continuously updated roundup of all the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;&lt;em&gt;best early Black Friday sales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eero’s mesh Wi-Fi products are 40 percent off right now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lKgkN0"&gt;Mesh Wi-Fi router deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KckJmY"&gt;The foundation of any smart home is good Wi-Fi, and if you’re looking to start out or are having trouble with connections in your home, a mesh Wi-Fi router is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="fos0TC"&gt;Eero Pro 6 is offering up to 40 percent off its excellent mesh Wi-Fi routers that have Thread radios built-in (and which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22741839/eero-ceo-confirms-matter-support-thread"&gt;Eero has said will get upgraded to the new smart home standard Matter&lt;/a&gt;, when it arrives next year). The Eero Pro 6 two pack is selling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0866V73R6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Amazon for $299&lt;/a&gt;, a savings of $100, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-eero-6-3-pack/dp/B085WSCTS4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eero 6 two pack&lt;/a&gt; is down to $167 from $279. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22193059/eero-pro-6-review-mesh-router-wifi-6-test-speeds-network"&gt;Read our Eero review.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="X69mMR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10876145"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Iowp5C"&gt;Google has discounted its Nest Wifi mesh networking system this week. Save $100 off a router and two points (now $249, regularly $349), both of which also double as Google Nest smart speakers. You can currently pick up these deals at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Wifi-3-Pack-AC2200-Mesh-Router-with-2-Points%2F911265019%3Fathcpid%3D911265019%26athpgid%3DAthenaItempage%26athcgid%3Dnull%26athznid%3Dsi%26athieid%3Dv0%26athstid%3DCS004%26athguid%3DYs_KI6dqeEolIlSSTQ_CpjOWULKYy9aKRqT0%26athancid%3Dnull%26athena%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBlackFridaySmartHomeTechDeals112221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3rUqBpdcL" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_wifi?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google’s&lt;/a&gt; own store. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review of Google Nest Wifi.&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;li id="dVxpNu"&gt;The spherical Echo fourth-gen with the built-in Zigbee smart home hub (which Amazon has also committed to upgrading to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761340/amazon-matter-smart-home-standard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt;) is now also almost half price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-4th-Gen/dp/B07XKF5RM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, $59.99 compared to $99.99. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our Echo fourth-gen review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Google Nest Cam with floodlight is $50 off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NR9KWv"&gt;Smart security camera and security system deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eZyOKA"&gt;The cheapest Ring video doorbell, Ring Video Doorbell Wired, gets even cheaper with an $18 price cut to $41.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-Wired/dp/B08CKHPP52?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, you can get an Echo Dot smart speaker with it for free with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095DWJ1XC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this bundle&lt;/a&gt;. The Ring Wired uses existing doorbell wiring and works over 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="alHazy"&gt;For a battery-powered option, the new Blink video doorbell is just $34.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Video-Doorbell/dp/B08SG2MS3V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a savings of $10, and it can also be wired if you prefer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3Ijz8w"&gt;The tiny Blink Mini camera is selling for an even tinier price. Just $20 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-plug-security-detection/dp/B07X6C9RMF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now, down from $34.99, this is the cheapest indoor smart security camera you can buy right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QsMbFF"&gt;For outside surveillance, Google’s very good &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776184/google-nest-cam-floodlight-review-smart-security-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nest Cam with floodlight&lt;/a&gt; is $50 off ($229.99 instead of $279.99), and this deal can be found at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3r1JbYWRz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll want to make sure you can mount this on the side of your house first, as it has a rather awkward under-the-eave install. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776184/google-nest-cam-floodlight-review-smart-security-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review of this floodlight camera&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XQjdTT"&gt;Speaking of Google, the older, hardwired Nest Doorbell is $80 off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/nest_doorbell_wired?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Google-Nest-Doorbell-Wired/381881630?athbdg=L1600&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1L6cm1smu?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/google-nest-hdr-video-doorbell-wired/-/A-52629447#lnk=sametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, dropping the price to $149. This is still one of the best smart doorbells, despite its age. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700859/google-nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-launching-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A new model is coming in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, but this is a great price on a long-standing product from Google.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="2CyBiw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10876165"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PyzsDl"&gt;Abode’s great little Abode Cam 2, an indoor / outdoor camera that works with or without an Abode system, is $24.95 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoabode.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22789311%2Fblack-friday-2021-smart-home-tech-speakers-cameras-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Abode.&lt;/a&gt; If you want to add a security system, too, Abode has an excellent bundle exclusively &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoabode.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22789311%2Fblack-friday-2021-smart-home-tech-speakers-cameras-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on its website for $299&lt;/a&gt;, a savings of $300. It includes the Abode Cam 2, the security gateway, a keypad, two door sensors, a motion sensor, a keyfob, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; an Echo Show 5, with the option of professional monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9F8lFk"&gt;Another smart security deal is the Ecobee SmartCamera with voice control for $69.99 (regularly $99.99). This versatile indoor camera works with Alexa, Google, and HomeKit. Pair it with &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3r4buHSfh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ecobee’s SmartSensors&lt;/a&gt; ($59.99 for two, $20 off) and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3r4Doic6b" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ecobee SmartThermostat&lt;/a&gt; (now $50 off at $199), and it can be a professionally or self-monitored home security system that automatically turns off when it sees someone it recognizes. Find the deals at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecobee.com%2Fen-us%2Fcameras%2Fsmart-camera-with-voice-control%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22789311%2Fblack-friday-2021-smart-home-tech-speakers-cameras-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ecobee.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee-SmartCamera-Control-Built-Security/dp/B087D6DRCC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3r5PeL3Eo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; through Wednesday, December 1st.&lt;/li&gt;

You can get the basic five-piece kit for $80 off ($119 instead of $199) and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Alarm-8-piece-kit/dp/B07ZPMCW64?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eight-piece for $100 off &lt;/a&gt;($149.99 instead of $249.99) through November 29th at &lt;a href="https://ring.com/products/security-system-alarm-5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Alarm-5-piece-kit/dp/B07ZDTXJ93?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Level’s line of invisible smart locks rarely goes on sale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ncjqi1"&gt;Smart locks and lighting deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JEwGgK"&gt;If you’re looking to upgrade your door lock, the Level Lock is a very good, usually very pricey solution.

    <title>Democrats’ plan to boost ‘tree equity’ is actually a good idea </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gold shovels surround tree to be planted at Joyce Kilmer..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Hggj7vP0JtJ9A2cYC48Y1V0RhI=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70189736/498219190.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;THE BRONX, NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK, UNITED STATES - 2015/11/20: Gold shovels surround tree to be planted at Joyce Kilmer Park.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Andy Katz/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ilMjE4"&gt;Trees have become a contentious piece of Democrats’ Build Back Better Act, the budget reconciliation bill that encompasses sweeping social and environmental programs. Congressional Republicans have seized on the $3 billion in the proposed nearly $2 trillion bill earmarked for planting trees, with a focus on boosting ‘tree equity’ — despite the fact that this is a strategy that experts say could reduce health disparities in cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sUyYU"&gt;While opponents have called the tree equity provisions an indicator of Democrats’ “reckless spending &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepBalderson/status/1455180262082596866"&gt;spree&lt;/a&gt;” and a “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepFrenchHill/status/1455255972700729349"&gt;waste&lt;/a&gt; [of] even more taxpayer dollars,”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in reality, disparities in tree coverage across American cities are a huge problem that affects heat exposure, air quality and more, with serious consequences on people’s health. This inequity actually builds on a legacy of segregating, polluting, and disinvesting in communities of color. Planting trees in the right places could be one step towards healing some of those injustices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rrv8g1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re depriving communities”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bz547H"&gt;“We’re depriving communities that need and depend on those trees to help them live a good quality of life,” says Charity Nyelele, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Earth System Science at the University of California, Irvine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YyNrsN"&gt;Neighborhoods where a majority of residents are people of color have, on average, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/29/trees-america-cities-study-disparities"&gt;33 percent less tree canopy cover&lt;/a&gt; than majority white neighborhoods, according to data from the Tree Equity Score, an initiative backed by the nonprofit American Forests. Americans of color are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452777/hot-summer-weather-race-urban-heat-island-us-cities"&gt;more likely&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/2013/07/minorities-more-likely-to-live-in-urban-heat-islands-study-finds#:~:text=Comparing%20satellite%20images%20and%20Census,at%20risk%20during%20heat%20waves.&amp;amp;text=Another%20story%20on%20this%20topic%20appeared%20in%20Popular%20Science."&gt;live in ‘urban heat islands,’&lt;/a&gt; places that trap heat because there’s a lot more concrete and asphalt than trees and greenery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63dNIP"&gt;That’s no accident. Urban heat islands also overlap with maps of &lt;a href="https://grist.org/justice/extreme-heat-redlining-portland/"&gt;redlined&lt;/a&gt; neighborhoods, places where Black Americans were pushed to move into since the 1930s because of discriminatory housing policies that denied them home loans and insurance. Now, these neighborhoods reach temperatures up to 7 degrees Celsius hotter than nearby non-redlined neighborhoods, according to &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/12/htm"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDZXKl"&gt;One solution to cool down urban heat islands is to plant more trees. Trees not only provide shade, they also dial down temperatures when water evaporates from their leaves (a cooling &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/using-trees-and-vegetation-reduce-heat-islands"&gt;process&lt;/a&gt; called evapotranspiration that’s similar to humans sweating). One &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S161886671400106X"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in Phoenix found that trees were even more effective at helping neighborhoods chill out during the daytime than other heat mitigation strategies, like painting roofs and streets white to reflect the sun’s radiation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yE8Nwf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A life-saving service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wXX5i0"&gt;That is a life-saving service. Extreme heat has killed more people than any other weather-related disaster in the US over the past &lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/"&gt;thirty years&lt;/a&gt;. The deaths are often concentrated in the most vulnerable communities. &lt;a href="https://grist.org/article/heat-check/"&gt;In New York City&lt;/a&gt;, for example, extreme heat has killed a &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/datatable47.pdf"&gt;disproportionately high number&lt;/a&gt; of Black residents. Heat waves are only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;becoming more dangerous because of the climate crisis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ISTTk"&gt;“Most people just think it’s about beautification or aesthetics, just plant trees because they’re pretty and beautiful to look at,” Nyelele says. “But that’s not the case. It’s about the benefits that we can derive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxDruf"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://envirobites.org/2020/08/03/unequal-access-to-urban-tree-benefits-in-the-bronx/"&gt;other benefits&lt;/a&gt; to having more trees in neighborhoods. Trees can actually help clean up air pollution, which is another common problem in neighborhoods without a lot of green space. And they can reduce street flooding because their roots and the soil they grow in absorb water, as opposed to impervious surfaces like asphalt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sq8rVJ"&gt;Funny enough, Republicans have attacked the Build Back Better Act and its tree provisions even though they’ve actually been a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21300277/republicans-democrats-climate-change-strategies-pew-research"&gt;fan&lt;/a&gt; of tree planting as a strategy to tackle climate change. Last year, former President Trump even &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/one-trillion-trees-world-economic-forum-launches-plan-to-help-nature-and-the-climate/#:~:text=The%20World%20Economic%20Forum%20has%20launched%20a%20global,businesses%20and%20individuals%20in%20a%20%22mass-scale%20nature%20restoration%22."&gt;committed&lt;/a&gt; the US to joining an initiative to plant a trillion trees around the world. Although that initiative has garnered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;significant criticism&lt;/a&gt; from scientists, healthy forests are important carbon sinks, because trees trap and store planet-heating carbon dioxide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9qpBq"&gt;“There are also the benefits that you can’t really that you can’t measure,” says Ariane Middel, assistant professor at Arizona State University who focuses on urban climate science. “Just being in nature has benefits, overall for people’s health. And those are really tough to put into numbers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4fW8zJ"&gt;As it now stands, the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376"&gt;Build Back Better Act&lt;/a&gt; includes $3 billion in grants to tribes, state agencies, local governments, and NGOs for tree planting. It prioritizes “projects that increase tree equity,” but details on how the money would be spent are otherwise scarce. There’s another $100 million in the bill for the Forest Service to create new urban forests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNubLs"&gt;While it would become the single biggest &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/28/president-biden-announces-the-build-back-better-framework/"&gt;package&lt;/a&gt; of climate policies in US history if it ultimately passes into law, the bill still faces a tough vote in the divided Senate after months of political wrangling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDmbam"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5V0dMO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Macy’s is auctioning off Thanksgiving Day Parade NFTs, including this creepy elf</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L6R-Z6naYPVymfAref3ysSXMWMs=/0x34:1102x769/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70189710/Screen_Shot_2021_11_24_at_2.20.49_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Elf is one of 10 Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade NFTs up for auction. | Image: Macy’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8XPy4T"&gt;Macy’s department stores might be closed this Thanksgiving, but that doesn’t mean the company has run out of things to sell. The retailer is auctioning off &lt;a href="https://www.macys.com/social/macys-parade-nft/"&gt;10 one-of-a-kind NFTs&lt;/a&gt; to mark the 95th year of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqPJUa"&gt;Each NFT references a parade balloon from decades past, going back to a black and white toy soldier from the 1920s. Also featured is an elf character from the 2000s and a spaceman from the 1950s, who &lt;a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/despite-predictions-of-the-day-before-that-rain-was-in-news-photo/97328196?adppopup=true"&gt;lost an arm&lt;/a&gt; in the 1955 parade after colliding with a lamppost (the NFT version is fully inflated). Proceeds from the auction benefit the Make-A-Wish Foundation, with current bids generating tens of thousands of dollars. The auction ends on November 30th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47enlx"&gt;In addition to the 10 unique NFTs, Macy’s is giving away 9,500 other parade-themed pieces of varying rarity on a first-come, first-served basis on Thanksgiving Day. Ten percent of any future sales of any of the pieces will also go to Make-A-Wish. Macy’s is using Polygon to mint the NFTs, touted as a more &lt;a href="https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-the-eco-friendly-blockchain-scaling-ethereum-bbdd52201ad/"&gt;eco-friendly solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7ALORm"&gt;&lt;iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/647560441?h=fb9bf36863" width="640" height="798" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6eJfsn"&gt;The retailer joins a long list of companies hedging bets on NFTs, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319868/taco-bell-nfts-gif-tacos-sell"&gt;Taco Bell&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pringles/status/1372242606902673409?"&gt;Pringles&lt;/a&gt;. In the FAQ section below Macy’s announcement, the company says it’s releasing NFTs because “we’re always looking to innovate our classic celebrations.” After posting nearly $4 billion in pandemic losses last year on top of already declining sales, it’s perhaps unsurprising the retailer is looking for new ways to show the brand isn’t a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="aLGXuV"&gt;The agencies say they’re focusing on setting expectations for what banks can do when it comes to holding crypto, allowing customers to obtain crypto, issuing their own stablecoins (or cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to a fiat currency like the US dollar), and taking crypto as collateral for loans and keeping it on their balance sheets. According to the letter, the goal is to make sure consumers are protected and that banks act responsibly. The regulators also say it’s an attempt to make sure the financial industry isn’t used to launder ill-gotten currency, something the Treasury Department &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685930/treasury-sanctions-cryptocurrency-exchange-ransomware-colonial-pipeline"&gt;has been focusing on recently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PePNy6"&gt;The OCC has &lt;a href="https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-121.html"&gt;already made moves in this direction&lt;/a&gt; — on Tuesday, the acting comptroller &lt;a href="https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2021/int1179.pdf"&gt;released a letter&lt;/a&gt; clarifying decisions that the office had made throughout 2020 and early 2021. Now, the letter says, banks will have to ask permission from regional regulators before getting into certain crypto fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DvYhQw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Banks now have to show they can safely handle crypto&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lgafeA"&gt;Previously, the Comptroller said banks were allowed to &lt;a href="https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2020/int1170.pdf"&gt;hold cryptocurrencies for customers&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2020/int1172.pdf"&gt;assets being used to back stablecoins&lt;/a&gt;. Banks &lt;a href="https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-2a.pdf"&gt;were also told&lt;/a&gt; they could use stablecoins and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22654785/blockchain-explained-cryptocurrency-what-is-stake-nft"&gt;act as nodes on blockchain networks&lt;/a&gt;. While financial institutions will still be able to carry out these activities, they’ll have to be able to prove to regulators that they can do so safely and responsibly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzxheJ"&gt;These announcements come as some crypto companies have skirmished with regulators over what legal classifications their products fall under. Recently, Coinbase &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684169/coinbase-crypto-lend-feature-discontinued-sec-lawsuit-threats"&gt;canceled its Lend program&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662826/coinbase-sec-lend-regulation-crypto-lawsuit-exchange"&gt;a public feud with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; over whether what it was selling counted as securities (and would therefore fall under heavier legal scrutiny). The Treasury has also proposed that large cryptocurrency transfers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446364/treasury-cryptocurrency-irs-fraud-tax-evasion"&gt;be reported to the Internal Revenue Service&lt;/a&gt;, and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757899/us-treasury-stablecoins-regulated-banks-cryptocurrency-yellen-congress"&gt;asked Congress to start regulating stablecoins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, many retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score a great deal before it sells out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nypGAV"&gt;Latest deal highlights:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="title"&gt;The Bose QuietComfort 35 II, a terrific pair of wireless headphones with multipoint pairing and effective noise cancellation, are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B0756CYWWD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now on sale for $180 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, their best price to date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DhcuES"&gt;A three-pack of Philips Hue white and color A19 bulbs is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf4mSqQBHLo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to $100 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Bluetooth-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B08D9N7RJ4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, the second-best price we’ve seen on the Bluetooth-equipped smart bulbs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="P7oTy0"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeBestBlackFridayStaplesEarlyDeals112321/https://www.staples.com/apple-homepod-mini-my5h2ll-a-bluetooth-speaker-white/product_24490473" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Staples&lt;/a&gt; is offering Apple’s compact Homepod mini for $89 instead of $99. We found the mini smart speaker offers good sound for its size and works well with other Apple devices. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jD9mxI"&gt;Normally $249, the Microsoft Surface Headphones 2 are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NEW-Microsoft-Surface-Headphones-Matte/dp/B086QCFRQ5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for just $163&lt;/a&gt;, easily the best price we’ve seen on the over-ear headphones. They may not be the most comfortable to wear during extended listening sessions, but they offer excellent multipoint pairing, improved battery life, and terrific controls. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267032/microsoft-surface-headphones-2-review-noise-canceling-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="lwMndD"&gt;Right now, Amazon is discounting all sizes of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, the LG C1. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model is on sale for $1,097&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,297, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is selling for $1,297&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $1,797&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, all sport several features gamers will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, and support for HDMI 2.1. Best Buy is offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWewqARCyb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same discounts&lt;/a&gt;, except with 30 days of FuboTV Pro and three months of Apple TV Plus, as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV, a camera accessory that brings wide-angle video chats to your TV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="MqKN84"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="E5gVG7"&gt;Amazon is also discounting various sizes of Samsung’s The Frame, a unique kind of TV that functions both as wall art and an HDR-compatible QLED. Right now, for example, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,498&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $998&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. The TV offers a decor-friendly design while also displaying customizable images when somebody’s in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into a smart 4K TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and a 120Hz refresh rate. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeAej60sy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is matching this deal&lt;/a&gt; as well, and including 30 days of FuboTV Pro as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="jNcvZm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="mExVb6"&gt;This 70-inch LG TV may only feature midrange specs, but Best Buy has brought it down to its lowest price ever. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTimnyrsb7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG NanoCell 75 series TV is down to just $750&lt;/a&gt; for a limited time, a staggering $450 off the list price. The 4K panel is powered by LG’s WebOS smart platform, which offers a solid array of streaming services and includes HDR10 for vivid picture quality. The 75 Series also comes equipped with three HDMI ports and ARC compatibility, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2, which allows you to cast content from your Apple device to your TV. It may not be as impressive as an OLED TV, but $750 for a 70-inch panel is still a solid value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="YkAdjB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10835005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="wcr0Gl"&gt;Naturally, Amazon is offering some great discounts on its own products, taking between $140 and $150 off the Omni Series (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;) and 4-Series 4K Fire TVs (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08SVZ775L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QB66R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lDDnQ9"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on streaming devices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="qcHKiS"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K, which just launched in September, is selling at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Froku-streaming-stick-4k-2021-streaming-device-4k-hdr-dolby-vision-with-voice-remote-and-tv-controls%2F-%2FA-52709600%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayTechDeals111921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vrWZYkTQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is offering the streaming device for around $30. The 2021 model is faster, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, which means you can use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="PuNKYt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="xfNVil"&gt;This accessible Roku alternative from Google features support for Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, and the current sale at the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/chromecast_google_tv?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1JKx5U7SD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has brought the Chromecast with Google TV down to $40, saving you $10 off the regular price. The streaming device features access to all of your favorite streaming services and has a built-in voice assistant to help you find your favorite shows. You can even cast media from your phone through the Chromecast app. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="bsLjhK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10872711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="6O5W6j"&gt;Sideclick’s Universal Remote Attachment adds more functionality to your Roku streaming player remote and makes it possible to control Blu-ray players, soundbars, TVs, and more with a single remote. Right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3TymSJkl9" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can buy it for $15&lt;/a&gt; instead of $30.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ADYgqg"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on laptops and tablets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="c5Ol71"&gt;The Lenovo Yoga 9i remains one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687992/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-pro-8-hp-spectre-macbook-air-creator-laptops-compare-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our favorite alternatives to the Microsoft Surface line of ultrabooks&lt;/a&gt; and, right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThlWBLJhS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is offering the slick 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; for $1,350. While this model received a similar discount a couple of months ago, it still remains a solid value. The foldable laptop boasts some impressive specs, too, with an 11th Gen Core i7 CPU, 512GB of storage, and Iris Xe integrated graphics. This hardware, paired with a 4K touchscreen display and a garaged stylus, makes the 9i a great choice for creators.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="nisc5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10689258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1BiPh2"&gt;HP’s 15.6-inch laptop with Windows Home in S Mode is on sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3sBxrPIx7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $330&lt;/a&gt; instead of $500. This particular model features 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i3 processor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9kKV5j"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Chromebook-Celeron-Processor-Gigabit/dp/B07XL4JHXR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 11.6-inch Galaxy Chromebook 4&lt;/a&gt; is now on sale for $180 instead of $250 at Amazon. This particular model includes 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eNqjUh"&gt;The Dell XPS 15 ultrabook is currently enjoying a solid discount. &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-14349898?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Fxps-15-9510-laptop%2Fsmx15w11p1c6700p%3Fpreview%3Doff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has reduced the price of this particular configuration to $2,199&lt;/a&gt;, taking $396 off the usual price tag. This is the best deal we’ve seen on this laptop so far, with some retailers charging as much as $2,600 for the same configuration. This model boasts some impressive specs with an 11th Gen Core i9 CPU and an RTX 3050 Ti graphics card, not to mention 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Our reviewer, Monica Chin, liked the 16:10 display and snappy keyboard, even though the XPS 15 tended to get a little hot under load. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="G5or8D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10842148"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="vAdouM"&gt;The latest model of the Dell XPS 13 takes what made last year’s model so great and makes it better. During its Black Friday sale, &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-12578053?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops-and-notebooks%2Fxps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fsmx13w11p2c3100p" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has marked down this configuration to $1,369&lt;/a&gt;, taking about $260 off the regular MSRP. While not quite the same configuration, aforementioned reviewer Monica Chin described the Dell XPS 13 as the company’s “best-in-class 13-inch ultraportable laptop.” This particular configuration comes equipped with an Intel Core i7-1195G7, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. While the integrated Iris Xe GPU doesn’t have enough juice for gaming, this lightweight laptop is remarkably versatile and remains a powerful choice in the 13-inch laptop class. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21310825" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="TALLIn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10845789"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="7OxW8A"&gt;If you need a powerful iPad with plenty of storage and a gorgeous display, B&amp;amp;H is selling the Wi-Fi version of the latest &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1636230-REG%2Fapple_mhnh3ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_wifi.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; with 256GB of storage for its lowest price to date. Normally $1,199, the retailer is selling it for $1,099 for a limited time. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25603205.13772/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNDQyMDg0L2lwYWQtcHJvLTIwMjEtcmV2aWV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLXNjcmVlbi1taW5pLWxlZC1tMS1wcm9jZXNzb3I/60ca3952dba83e591470a57aB376c5282" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In Dieter Bohn’s review&lt;/a&gt;, he deemed this model to be the nicest iPad available, even with its strange camera placement. The 2021 iPad Pro is also a speed demon thanks to Apple’s M1 chip and comes with welcome features such as a Mini LED display, Thunderbolt connectivity, Wi-Fi 6 support, and Face ID, which allows you to unlock the device with just a glance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

It’s not going to match an iPad in terms of performance, but it still offers reliable battery life, solid speakers, and a vibrant display. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150980/samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-tablet-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="fDTpC7"&gt;Typically $400, Amazon is currently selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best-sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users — the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VW98ZKG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; — in black for $228 or in white for $220. That’s one of the lowest prices Amazon has ever sold them for. As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the comfortable headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound while providing 17 hours of playback per charge. They even come outfitted with a USB-C port and a compact, foldable design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

It may not be the all-time low as far as pricing goes, but it’s the closest you can get right now if you’re shopping early. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Although they’re beginning to show their age, we initially praised the comfortable headphones in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14051984/beats-solo-3-review-apple-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2016 review&lt;/a&gt; and noted how well they isolate exterior noise. They also offer great wireless performance and come in two colorways: black and rose gold.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Typically $249, the MagSafe-ready AirPods Pro are now just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MLWK3AM-A-New-AirPods/dp/B09JQMJHXY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$159 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1191364/9383?subId1=VergeEarlyBlackFridayDeals112321&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-Pro%2F975690481%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.

While we still recommend the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods sport shorter stems, IPX4 water resistance, and improved sound over the last-gen model. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

While this phone doesn’t come packaged with a complimentary pair of earbuds like some other models, you do get a free 11-inch Chromebook. While free is generally a good thing, just note that the model on offer here isn’t exactly premium, as it comes with just 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Electronics-Unlocked-Smartphone-Long-Lasting/dp/B08BX7N9SK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon also has the Note 20 Ultra for $1,076&lt;/a&gt; though without any freebies. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

This is the only model currently on sale that doesn’t net you any extra goodies, but it’s a solid value regardless. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li id="TImMO9"&gt;Probably the best deal in gaming — one that spans video games and tabletop games — is Target’s &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestEarlyBlackFridayDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fbuy-2-get-1-free-mix-match%2F-%2FN-93tfb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mix and Match sale&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to buy two items from an approved list and get a third for free.

&lt;h2 id="bE0eBv"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="OnH62Q"&gt;The older GoPro Hero8 Black often retails for $300 on its own, but &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoPro-HERO8-Black-Dual-Battery-Charger-Bonus-Battery%2F199369934&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is offering a bundle that includes the popular 4K action cam for just $249&lt;/a&gt;. Other retailers offer &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3ssYV7eRw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the camera alone for $250&lt;/a&gt;, so this bundle is the better value. It includes a dual battery charger and a total of three batteries, so you’ll never run out of juice. This rugged digital camera is perfectly suited for capturing fast-moving action wherever and whenever it happens. The HyperSmooth technology provides an amazing level of image stabilization, while the LiveBurst feature automatically records anything that happens two seconds before and two seconds after your shot. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Normally $500, B&amp;amp;H is now selling the popular action cam for $450. The Hero10 Black boasts all the amazing features found on its predecessor — which we once called the “biggest, baddest action camera out there” — and more, like a new processor that allows it to shoot in higher frame rates and upload videos to the cloud while charging. It’s also compatible with Hero9 accessories, meaning those looking to upgrade won’t necessarily need to purchase new add-ons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Vh1LyO"&gt;Other great deals happening now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dfpgis"&gt;A great companion to any streamer or podcaster, the Blue Yeti microphone is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $100&lt;/a&gt;, matching one of its best prices to date. The Yeti can conform to a number of recording environments thanks to the Blue VO!CE software, which allows you to change pickup patterns, modulate, and otherwise fine-tune your audio. The mic comes packaged with its own stand but is also compatible with a wide variety of booms and mic arms if that's more your style.

Western Digital claims up to sequential read / write speeds of 1,050MB/s and 1,000MB/s, respectively, and the deal also includes a USB Type-A adapter in the box.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals on noise-canceling headphones 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ymSCVgQ1EyxfS2GWFiLZ64jXkoQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177196/cwelch_202109_4775_5619.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5KTAD"&gt;Whether you’re overdue for a new pair or are just trying to cancel out the usual onslaught of holiday music, Black Friday season is a great time to invest in some noise-canceling headphones. You’ll find significant discounts on many of our favorite headphones featured in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;noise-canceling headphones buying guide&lt;/a&gt;. These include picks from Sony, Bose, Apple, Sennheiser, and others. In some cases, these deals will save you $100 or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKhJxM"&gt;Aside from the steep discounts, another good thing about buying headphones during the holidays is the extended return period at many retailers. That gives you plenty of time to try out your new cans and make sure the sound quality, ANC, comfort, and other factors are all to your liking before you’re stuck with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="maTlax"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021: news, deal highlights, and money-saving tips ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22783359/black-friday-2021-news-tips-deals-retailers-cyber-monday"},{"title":"Know the price-matching policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"},{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="BdzHRb"&gt;Noise-canceling headphones deals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="zyLNwd"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 remain our overall pick as the best noise-canceling headphones you can buy today. They’ve got excellent noise cancellation, lively bass-forward sound, and fantastic comfort. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="3mytn2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10875864"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ApgUlE"&gt;Released only a few months ago, Bose’s QuietComfort 45 headphones mark a return to the company’s classic design that has no equal when it comes to comfort. You can wear these things for hours upon hours without any issues. It also helps that Bose made improvements to sound quality and ANC compared to the QC35 II headphones. The QC45s haven’t really been on sale since their release, so the Black Friday 2021 deals are coming at just the right time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698629/bose-quietcomfort-qc-45-headphones-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="D4gpLa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10857708"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="3wgngs"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max can be had for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Blue/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$429 from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down from their hefty $549 standard price. You’ll get that deal on the black, blue, and white colors, though green and pink are a bit higher (but still on sale) at $479.  The AirPods Max justify their price with top-tier sound quality, terrific noise cancellation, great voice call performance, and the usual deep integration with Apple’s ecosystem of devices. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="jCtQQh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880023"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="pmB83v"&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum 3 Wireless &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-Cancelling-Headphones-Functionality/dp/B07VW98ZKG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are all the way down to $247.46&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon, saving you over $100 compared to their regular $400 price tag. With a classy, premium look and feel that’s matched by their phenomenal audio quality, the Momentum 3s are perhaps the best choice if you’re focused on sublime sound over everything else. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="df8rra"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gtxggQ"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Headphones 2 over-ear, noise-canceling headphones are steeply discounted at Amazon. Originally $250, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NEW-Microsoft-Surface-Headphones-Matte/dp/B086QCFRQ5?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;they’re down to $162.49&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="a94Deh"&gt; If Bose’s QC45s are too pricey, perhaps its QC35 II may be within your budget. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B0756CYWWD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The black-colored version costs $180&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon. These normally cost around $250.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday 2021 phone deals</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DZmJoRq3qPSACPgLEfXKLC9DK0U=/0x0:2002x1335/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70187660/vpavic_210916_4760_0240.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are the best Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals for iPhones this year? Read on to find out.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zXFrPb"&gt;Need a new phone? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are a great time to be shopping for a phone for yourself or as a gift to your nearest and dearest this holiday season. This is the time of year when retailers and carriers are dropping their best deals, whether it’s to make room for next year’s models or to sign up new cellular customers. Android users can cash in on a number of excellent deals from the likes of Samsung, Google, OnePlus, and Motorola; however, Apple is notoriously stingy when it comes to iPhone discounts. You might get a gift card or a pair of AirPods when buying an iPhone, or a carrier might offer a higher trade-in value for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22684911/iphone-13-true-cost-of-free-phone-iphone-13-pro"&gt;“free” iPhone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPtDSg"&gt;Here are all the best Black Friday phone deals we’ve found so far. If possible, we recommend buying an unlocked phone, so there won’t be any strings attached to the purchase. If we include a carrier promotion, we’ll call out each requirement necessary to get the deal. Given all the supply issues many phone makers have been having all year, there might not be a lot of stock available out there. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fBJR1Q"&gt;Apple iPhone Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UqdK1t"&gt;From our experience, Apple doesn’t offer price cuts on any of its iPhone models. At most, you’ll get a pair of free AirPods and / or a gift card to use toward a future purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QgRz4p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="FVnSGE"&gt;The best deal so far is on a prepaid, 64GB iPhone SE (2020), which is &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FWalmart-Family-Mobile-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-64GB-Red-Prepaid-Smartphone%2F421691612%3Fathcpid%3D421691612%26athpgid%3DAthenaItempage%26athcgid%3Dnull%26athznid%3Dsi%26athieid%3Dv0%26athstid%3DCS055%26athguid%3DNWMTEvRDxRLI2FjMmMVSPsOsaXotayIvaG6W%26athancid%3Dnull%26athposb%3D0%26athena%3Dtrue%26athbdg%3DL1300&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayPhoneDeals2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now $199 at Walmart with Walmart Family Mobile&lt;/a&gt; — that’s a 50 percent discount on a phone with the same chipset as the iPhone 11 and will get four years of software support from Apple.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="r9e8dz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556638"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PXbynW"&gt;You can get a free pair of Beats Studio Buds in black and a virtual gift card for up to $200 if you purchase an iPhone SE and activate it on &lt;a href="https://visible.pxf.io/c/482924/976691/12909?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.visible.com%2Fdeals%2Fchoose-your-own-gift-card&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayPhoneDeals2021"&gt;Visible Wireless&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll need to transfer your number and make at least three months of payments before you’ll be able to redeem your gift, however. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="NwCbzf"&gt;You can get $300 on a Walmart e-gift card with the purchase of an &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAT-T-iPhone-13-128GB-Midnight%2F549396996%3Fathbdg%3DL1800&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayPhoneDeals2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAT-T-iPhone-13-mini-128GB-Blue%2F634815121%3Fathbdg%3DL1800&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayPhoneDeals2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAT-T-iPhone-13-Pro-128GB-Sierra-Blue%2F932171430%3Fathbdg%3DL1800&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayPhoneDeals2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAT-T-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-128GB-Sierra-Blue%2F160882297%3Fathbdg%3DL1800&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayPhoneDeals2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;s&gt;iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (sold out) on either AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon. The exact amount depends on which iPhone you choose (see below), and you can also get an additional $250 Walmart e-gift card by trading in an eligible phone. The deal runs through December 3rd, but you need to activate the new phone no later than December 3rd at 11:59PM local time to take advantage of the deal. If you prefer to get this deal and trade-in squared away in person, you need to schedule an in-person appointment, starting as early as 5AM on November 26th. This in-store deal also ends on December 3rd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SE8tmd"&gt;You can get a free pair of wireless earbuds and a virtual gift card for up to $200, depending on which iPhone your purchase and activate on &lt;a href="https://visible.pxf.io/c/482924/976691/12909?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.visible.com%2Fdeals%2Fchoose-your-own-gift-card&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayPhoneDeals2021"&gt;Visible Wireless&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll need to transfer your number and make at least three months of payments before you’ll be able to redeem your gift, however. If you opt for an iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, or iPhone 13 Pro Max, you’ll get a pair of AirPods Pro. If you buy an iPhone 13 mini, you’ll get a pair of Beats Studio Buds.&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many of the 2021 Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals are for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g0EjRt"&gt;Samsung phone deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZogOsh"&gt;This year’s Samsung phone deals aren’t much better than Apple’s: you get a free pair of Galaxy Buds 2, but there aren’t any deep price cuts unless you have some devices you can trade in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="3bp5ZH"&gt;The best deal so far might be at Walmart, where you can get a &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAT-T-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip3-5G-Black-128-GB%2F208015415%3Fathbdg%3DL1800&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayPhoneDeals2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$500 Walmart gift card&lt;/a&gt; with the purchase and activation of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8RaJCW"&gt;We also dig the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FStraight-Talk-Samsung-Galaxy-S20-FE-128GB-Navy-Blue-Prepaid-Smartphone%2F660796214%3Fathbdg%3DL1800&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayPhoneDeals2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now on sale at Walmart for $249&lt;/a&gt; (limited availability). Typically $699, the flagship phone features a 6.5-inch 1080p display with a 120Hz refresh rate but in a plastic body. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full Galaxy S21 FE review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

This unlocked 5G phone has all the perks of being a Pixel but without the flagship-level pricing of the new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro.

    <title>Dragon Age 4 creative director leaves BioWare</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dZDn7qVluxMaA9uN2xyt6H1nTm4=/115x0:1342x818/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70189174/da_screenshot_vgas_04.jpg.adapt.crop16x9.1455w.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mPqgl5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon Age 4&lt;/em&gt; has lost its senior creative director. According to a report from &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ages-senior-creative-director-has-left-bioware-1848114644"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Matt Goldman left BioWare after working at the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Knights of the Old Republic&lt;/em&gt; developer for four years. In an email shared with &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;, BioWare general manager Gary McKay wrote, “We understand that Matt’s departure has an impact on you, as well as the game’s development. Rest assured our commitment to a high-quality &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt; game has not wavered, and we will not ship a game that is not up to BioWare’s standards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQxkUK"&gt;A BioWare spokesperson also commented on Goldman’s departure to &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; saying, “He leaves the next &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt; game in excellent hands, with the team here at the studio who will carry forward our vision for the game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EG6MHE"&gt;BioWare has not yet announced who will replace Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jh773"&gt;This is yet another high-profile departure from the studio and the &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age 4 &lt;/em&gt;project, which lost executive producer Mark Darrah in December of last year. BioWare has also struggled overall with the failure of&lt;em&gt; Anthem&lt;/em&gt; and the departure of studio general manager and celebrated &lt;em&gt;Mass Effec&lt;/em&gt;t project director Casey Hudson. Since its announcement during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18126070/dragon-age-4-trailer-teaser-ea-announcement-release-date-game-awards-2018"&gt;2018’s Game Awards&lt;/a&gt;, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21404442/dragon-age-4-behind-the-scenes-bts-bioware"&gt;tiny, insubstantial updates&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age 4&lt;/em&gt;’s development progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEcxkr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Is the music industry’s future on the blockchain?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="3lau, aka Justin Blau, performs during Day 2 of the Electric Zoo Wild Island Festival at Randall’s Island on September 3, 2016 in New York City." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s1qyPIY05NhvS-AEwv8YN4Kkn4s=/35x0:2819x1856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70189172/599070892.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZFW5DL"&gt;One big knock on cryptocurrencies is that they’re a technology in search of a problem. Venture capitalists want to put everything on the blockchain and generate big returns, but why not just use a database instead? To skeptics, everything else in the space looks like noise — a bunch of grifters and try-hards changing their Twitter profile pictures to pixelated punks and apes in an effort to eventually flip those NFTs to a greater fool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIKAMs"&gt;But even as my mentions and direct messages fill up with readers fulminating about crypto — last week, after &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-crypto-backlash-hits-discord"&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt;, a paid subscriber wrote to me telling me he hopes that I die! — good and useful new things keep revealing themselves. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725083/axie-infinity-sky-mavis-blockchain-economy-game-pokemon"&gt;a video game that pays you to play it&lt;/a&gt;. Or a series of free NFTs that are now assembling themselves, based on the wishes of their various owners, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22655077/loot-social-network-open-source-nft"&gt;into movies and games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ak7i6"&gt;Skepticism is still warranted, as a group of thousands of people found out this week when they attempted to buy the Constitution and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjb8av/constitutiondao-aftermath-everyone-very-mad-confused-losing-lots-of-money-fighting-crying-etc"&gt;found themselves at a structural disadvantage&lt;/a&gt;. (They had to convert all their contributions from Ethereum to dollars before the auction began; the winning billionaire simply outbid them after it started.) The fact that ConstitutionDAO participants largely lost their intended refunds to network fees is worth noting, too — promising though it might be, Ethereum is so slow and expensive that I have come to think of it as the world’s worst computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWqUas"&gt;But like I said: good and useful new things keep revealing themselves. Today let’s talk about another of them: a startup called &lt;a href="https://royal.io/"&gt;Royal&lt;/a&gt; that hopes to upend the traditional relationship between music labels and artists, with potentially significant implications for the kind of culture that gets created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="JJ9K7R"&gt;Why everybody hates record labels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2yv8lZ"&gt;If you know anything about the relationship between record labels and artists, you know artists typically get the worse end of the deal. Mega-stars are rare, and so record labels hold on to as much of their earnings as possible to finance all the swings they take and miss. (Also, to maximize their profits.) This is a reliable source of frustration for lots of people, but especially the mega-stars, some of whom become famous in part due to their friction with labels: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/10/history-prince-contractual-controversy-warner-paisley-park"&gt;Prince wrote “slave” on his face&lt;/a&gt; to protest his treatment at the hands of Warner Bros.; Taylor Swift is now&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/22/753393630/look-what-they-made-her-do-taylor-swift-to-re-record-her-catalog"&gt; re-recording all her old albums after her former label sold the material out from underneath her&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uhqWBr"&gt;Before the year 2000 or so, labels had all the leverage here. They controlled the production and distribution of records and CDs; they had the money and relationships needed for promotion. Occasionally, an alternative artist would strike out on their own and start an independent label. But for the most part, the major record labels controlled the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2anaQu"&gt;Then came the internet. At first, it seemed that file-sharing services like Napster might kill off the major record labels altogether. But the labels were saved by the rise of streaming services like Spotify, which helped them make their existing back catalogs more profitable than ever before. That was great news for the record labels, but the fundamental tensions with artists remained. Most artists &lt;a href="https://djmag.com/news/82-artists-earn-less-200-year-streaming"&gt;make almost no money from streaming&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/universal-sony-warner-music-profits-covid-1085112/"&gt;the majors are reporting record profits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JFq8I3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Decoder: Olivia Rodrigo and how the music business makes songwriters fight over credits","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22672704/olivia-rodrigo-switched-on-pop-charlie-harding-music-copyright"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hDFByZ"&gt;The internet knows a vulnerable middleman when it sees one — “&lt;a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/01/13/margin/"&gt;your margin is my opportunity&lt;/a&gt;” and all that — and few middlemen look more vulnerable, from this perspective, than record labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UMjj44"&gt;Royal comes for the royalties&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iTA2s4"&gt;Before Justin Blau set out to upend the record industry, he learned how to navigate it as an artist. Recording and producing electronic dance music under the name 3LAU — pronounced “blau,” like his surname — he produced original tracks and remixes for artists including Rihanna, Katy Perry, and Ariana Grande, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUT0Oc"&gt;In 2016 he launched his own record label, Blume Records. But a couple years earlier he had met the Winklevoss twins, of &lt;em&gt;The Social Network&lt;/em&gt; fame, who had successfully reinvented themselves as crypto evangelists. (They love dance music. Also they’re &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fthe-ascent%2Fbuying-stocks%2Farticles%2Fhow-the-winklevoss-twins-amassed-a-6-billion-bitcoin-fortune%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22800746%2Fmusic-industry-royalties-blockchain-crypto-royal-paradigm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;billionaires now&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mEcR4"&gt;Blau had studied finance in college, and had became enchanted by the vision the twins shared with other crypto backers: a means for creating a frictionless transfer of value anywhere in the world. But it wasn’t until 2017, when Ethereum began its rise, that he began to consider the implications for music. Ethereum’s “smart contracts,” which can automatically execute transactions without the need for an intermediary, felt like they could be a building block for something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JUET9k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;By selling ownership directly to fans, Blau generated far more than any record label would have paid him&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DBfZVD"&gt;Earlier this year, Blau put it into practice. In February, he sold various NFTs of his album &lt;em&gt;Ultraviolet &lt;/em&gt;in an auction. To almost everyone’s surprise, &lt;a href="https://www.cultr.com/news/3lau-just-sold-his-ultraviolet-album-nfts-for-11-7-million/"&gt;the auction generated $11.7 million in sales&lt;/a&gt;. This offered an early hint of how the blockchain could uniquely change the music industry: by eliminating the record labels and selling ownership of his music directly to fans, Blau generated far more than any record label would have paid him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYFSbW"&gt;That planted the seeds for Royal, a startup whose name hints at its core purpose. After Blau’s success with selling his own album, investors lined up to throw money at him. In August, while still at the seed stage, he raised an eyebrow-raising $16 million for a platform that would let other artists sell ownership stakes to their fans. Here’s how Danny Nelson &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/08/26/3lau-raises-16m-to-tokenize-music-royalties-for-artists-and-fans/"&gt;described the process at &lt;em&gt;CoinDesk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="a8XMaj"&gt;Limited digital assets, or LDAs, are the backbone of the system, Blau explained in a call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWUzl7"&gt;An artist decides how much of his or her royalty share to reserve for LDA-holding fans and how many “official editions” to mint for a given song. Royal then facilitates the sale of those LDA tokens, generating cash for the artist and the possibility of future income from the song owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYah4p"&gt;A song with 100 “official editions” might entitle each holder to 0.5% of the royalties it generates, Blau said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="neCSbp"&gt;The idea is to take the traditional record industry model, in which the label might keep 80 percent of all future royalties, and flip it to one where the artist keeps 80 percent. (Royal takes a cut of primary sales that is under 10 percent, the company said, as well as a cut of secondary sales.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="twHyrG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SgPf4z"&gt;This summer, Blau tested the platform by giving away 333 NFTs representing half the streaming ownership in his new single. Those songs have now generated more than $600,000 in sales and are worth more than $6 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0Quar"&gt;And so just four months after Royal raised its seed round, investors are even more excited. On Monday, Blau announced that Royal &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/86564/nas-chainsmokers-join-55m-raise-nft-music-platform-royal"&gt;had raised another $55 million&lt;/a&gt;, with new investors including The Chainsmokers, Nas, and Kygo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DmAXc"&gt;“I really do think we’re scratching the surface here,” Blau told me in an interview this week. (In true rock ‘n’ roll fashion, he Zoomed in from a boat.) “Creativity always leads culture in a lot of ways. And we’re starting to see creatives really buy into this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iJWjcI"&gt;The future of music&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SqgUGm"&gt;Royal is so early in its life — the core product is still in private beta — that it’s basically impossible to guess at its chances. It isn’t alone in its space, either: competitors with a similar take include &lt;a href="https://www.royaltyexchange.com/"&gt;Royalty Exchange&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.songvest.com/"&gt;SongVest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtYDjF"&gt;But it doesn’t feel too early to ask what might happen in a world where artists keep more or even most of the value that they create. This is personally relevant to me, of course, as a creative type who also stepped away from a “major” — a staff job at a big publication — in favor of selling my work directly to readers. But the larger cultural consequences could be significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1pC5c"&gt;On Tuesday morning, I Zoomed with Blau (on his boat) and Fred Ehrsam (in an office) about the possibilities. Ehrsam, who sits on Royal’s board, is the co-founder of the crypto VC firm Paradigm. (He previously co-founded Coinbase, and served as its president until leaving in 2017 to be start Paradigm with Matt Huang.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrajPK"&gt;The potential for more consumer applications of crypto have been apparent since Ethereum was created, Ehrsam told me. But they have only recently begun to come into view, with NFT-based projects like Blau’s leading the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxvRpr"&gt;“I’ve sort of been waiting for this moment for years now, and we’re finally here,” Ehrsam said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2SJMJ"&gt;Here are some of the possibilities that Blau and Ehrsam see if more artists use crypto tools to sell their work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfTnTQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artists own their own businesses on the internet&lt;/strong&gt;. Maybe the most obvious implication, and on one level, not all that new. (Many artists already create businesses of various sorts to publish albums, organize tours, and so on.) What’s new is that the record label doesn’t necessarily need to be a part of it at all. This is important for a lot of reasons, but perhaps the most important one is that …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkneAu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You incentivize the creation of different kinds of music&lt;/strong&gt;. Stories  abound of record labels not recognizing the genius of their talent. (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Trying_to_Break_Your_Heart:_A_Film_About_Wilco"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of my favorite music documentaries, chronicles the rejection of Wilco’s masterpiece &lt;em&gt;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&lt;/em&gt; and the band’s struggles to release it anyway.) So do stories about the consolidation of the terrestrial radio industry &lt;a href="http://www.futureofmusic.org/press/press-releases/radio-station-ownership-consolidation-shown-harm-musicians-and-public-says-fmc-"&gt;dramatically limiting the music that gets airplay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyrUHU"&gt;One idea suggested by Royal is the label’s opinion — and the radio station’s — is about to matter a lot less. All of a sudden, if you can grow a big enough social following, you can make a living off whatever music makes you happiest. This is somewhat true today, of course, but primarily to musicians who can live off touring and streaming revenue — a very small number of people, at least compared to the number of creators who make a living off (for example) YouTube and TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4s5qU0"&gt;“We’ve seen this with other new internet platforms in the past — and YouTube is a great example — where you end up getting all these creators, and all this novel content, that you never would have gotten without the platform,” Ehrsam told me. “And I think something similar can happen here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxNLBV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You promote remix culture&lt;/strong&gt;. Some of my favorite music of the past couple decades involves remixes that are at best tolerated by music labels. Think of&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grey_Album"&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Grey Album&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Danger Mouse’s inspired 2004 mashup of the Beatles’ &lt;em&gt;White Album&lt;/em&gt; with Jay-Z’s &lt;em&gt;Black Album&lt;/em&gt;. Or take Girl Talk, who managed to eke out a career throwing dozens of songs into a blender and stitching them together into &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDDdpxEf9hM"&gt;spectacular new tracks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DySN35"&gt;But those were the exceptions: for the most part, record labels have never embraced this kind of remixing. (It’s legally difficult, given byzantine copyright arrangements; also; where are the profits?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kO8RAk"&gt;Now imagine what might happen if an artist could effectively buy into a song by purchasing some of its tokens on Royal or another platform, and then profit directly from the success of the remix. Suddenly, all the right incentives are aligned. The creators can create, and the owners get paid. (Also, they are the same people.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrMu9n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You reinvent the music “collection.” &lt;/strong&gt;Blau pointed out to me that music collections were once a source of pride for lots of people. (They still are, to vinyl collectors.) Royal’s model encourages music fans to think of themselves more like art collectors, Blau said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qz0dB4"&gt;“One of our new hires at the company, when I was interviewing him, said something that was so powerful to me, which was we all have the same music collection — and then he held up his phone,” Blau said. “And [he’s] right. There’s nothing special about that. […] What you own is an expression of yourself. And we’re about to see that scale in a really big way, with Royal being the music end of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKv4Sw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fans become marketers&lt;/strong&gt;. Today’s internet has created its share of big fandoms, who mostly work in exchange for likes, comments, and shares. About the best you can hope for is that your favorite artist replies to you, or shares one of your posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRc5Xr"&gt;One question Royal raises: What happens if every song has its own stans who benefit financially the more it is played?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="F0zRlI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When you own it, you want to evangelize it. I think we’ll see that with music in a similar way.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yWi11S"&gt;“Your fans become your biggest promoters and your distribution,” Ehrsam said. “We’ve seen that with Bitcoin in the past. When you own it, you want to evangelize it. I think we’ll see that with music in a similar way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvZ0I1"&gt;Ehrsam also predicted we will eventually see new kinds of creative work coming from fans. Fine art, video pieces, mixed media — who knows? To the extent it becomes valuable, fans with ownership would benefit from its growth in value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFoWYQ"&gt;“I suspect that now that people have ownership over this IP, they’ll probably figure out other things to do with it, too,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glAVYO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crypto enters the mainstream&lt;/strong&gt;. Ehrsam is a crypto maximalist, as you might imagine, and believes that in 10 years or so, almost everyone will own at least one NFT. Music rights might be one of the things that gets us there, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sw7rnW"&gt;“Crypto is becoming culture, and culture and investing are becoming one of the same,” Ehrsam said. He said this year’s mania for GameStop and other meme stocks was as much about building fun online communities as it was about financial gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQ5OQ4"&gt;“When you look at what Royal and Web3 are doing broadly, it’s exactly that,” he said. “It’s packaging entertainment, community and economics into a single thing. And that, I think, will be extremely powerful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmskFm"&gt;Of course, you could take a more pessimistic view of all this, too. I keep imagining trying to pitch Royal to the Sex Pistols in 1975, only to have Johnny Rotten punch me in the face. What could be less punk rock than giving every song, in effect, its own homeowners association?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tw398y"&gt;But it’s clear that today’s record industry isn’t working for the vast majority of artists. And even if companies like Royal are only able to nudge labels into offering more lucrative deals, it still may all have been worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAWfL6"&gt;In the meantime, Blau says he’s courting major artists to begin selling on Royal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E8Judg"&gt;“Our enemy at Royal is the bad record deal,” he said. “And not every record deal is bad. But many of them are.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon and AT&amp;T offer to temporarily lower 5G’s power to avoid aircraft interference</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5FdF8n"&gt;As the Federal Aviation Administration continues examining whether mid-band 5G spectrum could pose a risk to aircraft safety systems, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have offered to dial back the power coming from 5G cell towers for a period of six months to ease any industry concerns. Both carriers are preparing to launch crucial upgrades to their respective 5G networks using spectrum acquired in the C-band auction. This will lead to more robust 5G connectivity and faster speeds compared to the base-level 5G experience that Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T currently offer today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nq2jFU"&gt;In early November, both companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;agreed to push back the rollout by an additional month&lt;/a&gt; to January 2022. In a letter sent to the FCC today, they made clear that they’ll be moving forward with the planned mid-band 5G launch at that time. “This spectrum will be the backbone of our 5G networks for many years to come,” the companies said in the letter, as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-verizon-propose-5g-limits-to-break-air-safety-standoff-11637778722?page=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZwhKz"&gt;In support of the technology, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T point to years of research about potential interference and note that mid-band 5G hasn’t wreaked havoc for flights in other countries where mid-band 5G is already in place. “While we remain confident that 5G poses no risk to air safety, we are also sensitive to the Federal Aviation Administration’s desire for additional analysis of this issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnmOzh"&gt;To help prevent a drawn-out conflict with the FAA, the two carriers say they’ll voluntarily take extra precautions through July 2022 “to minimize energy coming from 5G base stations — both nationwide and to an even greater degree around public airports and heliports.” That should be enough to “allay concerns about radio altimeter performance,” the companies said, while also maintaining strong performance for wireless customers. Altimeters can assist aircraft operators during landings, especially when dealing with poor visibility conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9sqaC"&gt;It’s not yet clear whether the proposal will be accepted by the FAA, which has warned pilots of the possibility that “interference from 5G transmitters and other technology could cause certain safety equipment to malfunction, requiring them to take mitigating action that could affect flight operations.” After July 6th, both carriers say they’ll set everything back to normal “unless credible evidence exists that real-world interference would occur if the mitigations were relaxed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ig6lkc"&gt;“Our use of this spectrum will dramatically expand the reach and capabilities of the nation’s next-generation 5G networks, advancing US leadership, and bringing enormous benefits to consumers and the US economy,” Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T claimed in their joint letter sent to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746223/net-neutrality-fcc-jessica-rosenworcel-chair-gigi-sohn-ajit-pai-broadband"&gt;FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
