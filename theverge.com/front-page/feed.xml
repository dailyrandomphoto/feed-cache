    <title>Google’s Guacamole may be premature, but it sounds ripe to become an Android feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Chef Todd Hall Alive And Cooking" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y21RpXP6WOPoPcGBl39SODG9c6E=/0x408:4638x3500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69178862/456804252.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Pat Greenhouse/The Boston Globe via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QgiIuq"&gt;Google probably wasn’t planning to reveal this until &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371782/google-io-2021-date-announcement-virtual-online-event-date-android"&gt;the company’s I/O developer conference on May 18th&lt;/a&gt;, but it looks like a cat may be out of the bag: the company’s testing a feature that should let you stop alarms and answer calls on your Android phone simply by saying “stop” — no need to pick up your phone or even say “Hey Google.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfJrAn"&gt;We know this because a mysterious new setting called “Guacamole” has popped up in the Google app on Android 11 for some users — including me. (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/23/googles-guacamole-isnt-just-a-delicious-dip-its-a-mysterious-new-assistant-feature/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/23/google-assistant-guacamole/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tipped us off.) And while none of us journalists have been able to actually turn on the feature yet, it’s fairly easy to imagine what it does.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R8TKHNyd4pn8JRw2MsKun1uidj4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22466190/guacamole_google.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The menus where Guacamole can be found, for some users running Android 11 and Google app version 12.15.9.29.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iCGMuz"&gt;If you’d rather not imagine, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;’s sources say it specifically will handle alarms, timers, and calls by saying “Stop”, “Snooze” and “Answer/decline the call” respectively. None of those worked for me after I flicked the switch, likely because I wasn’t able to access a Google internal website for dogfooding employees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CR9sGeTza32x4HOSzk_BGhDr4Is=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22466225/guacamole_web.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TAqzgC"&gt;I even tried adding a period to make it g.co/assistant-guacamole, thinking the “go” might have been a typo for one of Google’s g.co shortlinks, but no dice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBwruN"&gt;If the feature sounds familiar, it’s probably because Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535647/google-assistant-alarm-stop-timer-hey-update-io-2019"&gt;already shoved some guacamole into its Google Home / Nest Hub smart speakers and displays at Google I/O 2019&lt;/a&gt;. You’ve been able to simply say “stop” to stop their alarms ringing for nearly two years already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jC4zaF"&gt;“We’re constantly experimenting with new ways to improve the overall experience with Google Assistant. We have no additional details to share at this time,” Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Officials lift pause on Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="COVID-19 vaccinations for people ages 16 and up in Los Angeles" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zgwwl3uPZCQ4_vT_LQ-C_FQExnQ=/0x0:4200x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69178672/1232332507.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lJPEZm"&gt;Federal officials said that the United States &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-and-cdc-lift-recommended-pause-johnson-johnson-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-use-following-thorough"&gt;should resume&lt;/a&gt; use of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, which has been on pause &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381469/covid-vaccine-pause-blood-clots-johnson-fda-cdc"&gt;since April 13th&lt;/a&gt;. The company updated the fact sheets about the vaccine for doctors and patients to include information about the risks of clots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYlSZH"&gt;Vaccinations with the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot could start back up as soon as tomorrow morning, said Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, during a press briefing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kt6pJB"&gt;The decision to reinstate the J&amp;amp;J vaccine follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399998/covid-vaccine-johnson-cdc-pause-clots-risk"&gt;the recommendation&lt;/a&gt; of an independent CDC advisory group earlier today. The committee stressed that officials should make people aware of the risk of rare blood clots, which appear most often in women under 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udUiC2"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had instituted the pause after receiving reports of unusual blood clots in a handful of people who received the shot. As of Friday, officials had 15 reports of women developing rare blood clots called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis after receiving the vaccine. Other unconfirmed reports are under investigation. Around 8 million people have received the shot in the US, including 4 million women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMMQ6z"&gt;The clots, which form in the brain, appeared in combination with low levels of platelets, a type of blood cell involved with clotting. The federal agencies recommended the pause so that experts could gather more information about the clots and so they could give doctors information on how to recognize and treat the condition — in this case, the standard blood clot treatments could make things worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0ZrVJ"&gt;Many states were using the one-shot, easy-to-store Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine for people who are homebound, people experiencing homelessness, and other underserved groups. While many vaccination &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2021/04/13/johnson-and-johnson-covid-vaccine-pfizer-moderna/7202207002/"&gt;sites&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://abc7chicago.com/johnson-and-vaccine-pause-moderna-pfizer/10517507/"&gt;switched&lt;/a&gt; people scheduled for the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine to the Moderna or Pfizer / BioNTech shots instead, some people in vulnerable groups &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/covid-vaccine-johnson-homeless-pause"&gt;weren’t able&lt;/a&gt; to get vaccinated because of the halt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52K3UA"&gt;The CDC will keep monitoring cases of the clotting condition in people who get the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmiWV1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bad software sent postal workers to jail, because no one wanted to admit it could be wrong</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BRITAIN-JUSTICE-POST OFFICE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5LLUV01rzm3ydClpD5AzlR2afDw=/0x2:7981x5323/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69178397/1232474525.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by TOLGA AKMEN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O3AXE6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.postofficetrial.com/2019/01/articles.html"&gt;For the past 20 years&lt;/a&gt; UK Post Office employees have been dealing with a piece of &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56718036"&gt;software called Horizon&lt;/a&gt;, which had a fatal flaw: bugs that made it look like employees stole tens of thousands of British pounds. This led to some local postmasters being convicted of crimes, even being sent to prison, because the Post Office doggedly insisted the software could be trusted. After fighting for decades, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56859357"&gt;39 people are finally having their convictions overturned&lt;/a&gt;, after what is reportedly the largest miscarriage of justice that the UK has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kswYiP"&gt;The impact on these employees has been vast: according to the BBC, some have lost marriages or time with their children. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56859357"&gt;Talking to the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Janet Skinner said that she was taken away from her two kids for nine months when she was imprisoned, after the software showed a £59,000 shortfall. She also says she lost a job offer because of her criminal conviction. The time she and others like her spent in jail can’t be bought back, and it happened because software was taken at its word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3Gl8l"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56859357"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, another woman, who swore she was innocent, was sent to prison for theft while she was pregnant. One man &lt;a href="https://www.private-eye.co.uk/special-reports/justice-lost-in-the-post"&gt;reportedly died by suicide&lt;/a&gt; after the computer system showed that he had lost almost £100,000. Within a few months, his replacement also faced losses due to discrepancies from the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kZMeFw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The UK’s prime minister weighed in, calling the original convictions “an appalling injustice”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8aSmvw"&gt;Horizon was made by Japanese company Fujitsu, and information from it was used to prosecute 736 Post Office employees between 2000 and 2014, some of whom ended up going to jail. Bugs in the system would cause it to report that accounts that were under the employees’ control were short — the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56718036"&gt;has reported&lt;/a&gt; that some employees even tried to close the gap by remortgaging their homes, or using their own money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59dKWt"&gt;It does seem like the nightmare for the employees may be coming to an end. The 39 who had their convictions overturned are following &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55271193"&gt;another six who were cleared of wrongdoing back in December&lt;/a&gt;. The Post Office has also been working on financially compensating other employees who were caught up by the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMfCxQ"&gt;In 2019 the Post Office settled with 555 claimants and paid damages to them, and it’s also set up a system to repay other affected employees. So far, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56718036"&gt;according to the&lt;em&gt; BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, more than 2,400 claims have been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAXLnD"&gt;Earlier this month the chief executive of the Post Office &lt;a href="https://www.postofficetrial.com/2021/04/nick-reads-speech-to-troops.html"&gt;said that Horizon would be replaced&lt;/a&gt; with a new, cloud-based solution. In the same speech, he said that the Post Office would work with the government to compensate the employees who were affected by Horizon’s inaccuracies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YKyAot"&gt;The UK’s prime minister Boris Johnson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1385550075498278921"&gt;also weighed in today&lt;/a&gt;, calling the original convictions “an appalling injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CDYuhg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I welcome the Court of Appeal's decision to overturn the convictions of 39 former sub-postmasters in the Horizon dispute, an appalling injustice which has had a devastating impact on these families for years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lessons should and will be learnt to ensure this never happens again.&lt;/p&gt;— Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1385550075498278921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YjzN76"&gt;Some employees seem happy with just a monetary settlement and their names being cleared. But there is also now a campaign group calling for a full public inquiry, and some of the people whose names were cleared today have called for those in charge to be held responsible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRLKu7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52905378"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;BBC &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the Post Office argued the errors couldn’t have been be the fault of the computer system — despite knowing that wasn’t true. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52905378"&gt;There is evidence &lt;/a&gt;that the Post Office’s legal department was aware that the software could produce inaccurate results, even before some of the convictions were made. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56859357"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the representatives for the Post Office workers said that the post office “readily accepted the loss of life, liberty and sanity for many ordinary people” in its “pursuit of reputation and profit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtnFbr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4holV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oculus has turned on wireless PC streaming for the Quest 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hbEyUi-Lzsts5F8-Q47ZCVfDlX8=/781x0:9219x5625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69178322/Oculus_Quest_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jPmiJh"&gt;Oculus is turning on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382805/oculus-quest-2-facebook-wireless-pc-streaming-120hz-infinite-office"&gt;Air Link PC streaming feature&lt;/a&gt; for the Quest 2 virtual reality headset. Air Link is part of the Oculus v28 software update, which recently started rolling out to Oculus headset owners. Facebook Reality Labs head &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1385654671008620544"&gt;Andrew Bosworth says&lt;/a&gt; you can find the feature if you’re running v28 on your PC and Quest 2 headset; if you haven’t gotten access to the update yet, “it’s coming very soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSQ9iR"&gt;Air Link lets Quest 2 owners with a strong Wi-Fi connection play PC VR games wirelessly on their headsets. Air Link was initially disabled on v28. But &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/air-link-launch/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Upload&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, Quest 2 owners had found a way to unofficially turn it on, and Oculus had warned that the experience was “not representative” of the final result. Bosworth says Oculus is releasing the feature today because “the excitement over Air Link can’t be contained”; the release was originally scheduled for next week, so Bosworth’s tweet moves it up by a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="twyoJG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Looks like the excitement over Air Link can’t be contained, so we’re officially making it available today for everyone who has both Quest and PC v28. If you don’t have v28 yet, stay tuned, it’s coming very soon!&lt;/p&gt;— Boz (@boztank) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1385654671008620544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jOgJlY"&gt;Air Link evolved from Oculus Link, which used a USB-C cable to run PC VR games on the otherwise standalone Oculus Quest line of devices. (Oculus says a cable will still give you the best graphical fidelity, and unlike Air Link, it will charge your headset while you’re playing.) A similar wireless feature was already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218827/oculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to"&gt;built into &lt;em&gt;Virtual Desktop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a third-party app. Depending on performance, Air Link could make &lt;em&gt;Virtual Desktop’s&lt;/em&gt; alternative less appealing to Quest 2 owners. But Oculus isn’t currently bringing the feature to its original Quest headset. Air Link is also classed as an experimental feature. If it’s like the original Link, users can expect some bugs around the launch — but at least that launch is coming a little sooner than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yoda has no time for shoes, but you might for Adidas’ Yoda-themed sneakers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q3ZWkoD3O14uZUBsO9y-G_0_PEQ=/0x167:4000x2834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69178303/_PR_adidas_SS21_StanSmith_FY5463_StillLife.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Adidas&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wVTeUJ"&gt;Adidas has designed a pair of Stan Smith sneakers that could be perfect for the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fan in your life who also pulls double-duty as a hypebeast. The Yoda version of the Stan Smith, Forever sneakers features a design inspired by the famous green alien, with quotes and illustrations. Adidas says the shoes will go on sale right after&lt;em&gt; Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; Day, on May 5th, for $120.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGsRS9"&gt;The Stan Smith, Forever line is named after American tennis player Stan Smith, with “Forever” standing for the shoe’s environmentally friendly bent due to its use of “Primegreen” fabric. Adidas claims Primegreen is made from 50 percent recycled materials. The Yoda version is also green in another way, of course. The back heels of the shoes have Yoda’s face embossed in green fabric, and the tongues of both shoes feature illustrations: on one, Yoda, and on the other, Stan Smith himself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BkbGQH0_6p6QcPmBNMAknLcMVs8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465438/_PR_adidas_SS21_StanSmith_FY5463_Detail_Tongue.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Adidas&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s Yoda, judging you for judging these Yoda sneakers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AamVwpPPvha-LIuTurqW_7N9OZg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465778/_PR_adidas_SS21_StanSmith_FY5463_Detail_Heel.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Adidas&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There he is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PHj5kV"&gt;Adidas didn’t exactly dig deep for the quote printed on both shoes: together, they read “Do or do not, there is no try.” But it’s sneaky when you think about it: it’s a way to lift Nike’s famous “Just do it” slogan by using the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; version.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iconic and inspiring Yoda quote printed on Adidas’ new sneakers. Note Stan Smith on the tongue as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RR3IRJ"&gt;One sort of odd thing about making a Yoda-themed shoe: Yoda doesn’t wear shoes. In every appearance in the film series or &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars &lt;/em&gt;animated television series, Yoda is either barefoot or his cloak covers his feet. The dude is clearly no sneakerhead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoda conducting Jedi Council business, clearly sans-shoes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BThal2"&gt;The same can be said for Yaddle, who — outside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/6/20997564/baby-yoda-disney-plus-star-wars-mandalorian-merchandise-stranger-things-game-of-thrones-streaming"&gt;Grogu / Baby Yoda&lt;/a&gt; — is the only other known member of Yoda’s species. She also enjoys her three-toed feet unconstrained.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F7g6gSrYrb5mR338dAjl-SLNcVQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465605/YaddleJediCouncil.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;Wookiepedia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yaddle, besides always looking incredibly chill, also scorns shoes and all they represent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VAGdlk"&gt;Is a distaste for foot coverings something specific to Yoda’s mysterious alien species? Plenty of other nonhuman Jedi wear shoes. Is it perhaps due to Yoda having thick, leathery, Hobbit-like feet? &lt;a href="https://boards.theforce.net/threads/no-shoes.13529531/"&gt;Some &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fans hypothesized way back in 2003&lt;/a&gt; that Yoda’s species could have the same resilient soles that J.R.R. Tolkien gifted his hobbits. Feet strong enough to not need shoes. I certainly see how their argument makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6lDP9"&gt;Regardless of the truth, there’s an unspoken tension that comes from Adidas choosing to make shoes based on an alien who clearly despises footwear, and this isn’t the first time it’s done so. Adidas &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/style/adidas-the-mandalorian-sneakers-baby-yoda-superstar-release-info"&gt;also made shoes based on Baby Yoda&lt;/a&gt;, a character, you may remember, who spent a large part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/star-wars/2020/10/30/21517931/the-mandalorian-news-reviews-disney-plus-star-wars-baby-yoda"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with his feet never touching the ground, thanks to a hovering crib. Where does it end, Adidas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWxevO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHAivj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nm4c6w"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNC5Ao"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfT9kS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJz6OK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykla2L"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sn5zrs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A fourth Captain America movie is in the works from the creator of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nYOL0etI6PQvoLs-Cc1o--wKE4o=/639x0:3201x1708/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69178289/OPN0260_105_comp_v099_20201210_r709.1088.147623.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XbAOfb"&gt;A fourth &lt;em&gt;Captain America&lt;/em&gt; movie is on the way, set to be co-written by &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22333905/falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-captain-america"&gt;Malcolm Spellman&lt;/a&gt;, the creator, showrunner, and head writer of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399269/falcon-winter-soldier-disney-plus-marvel-captain-america-future"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which just aired its season finale on Disney Plus on Friday). Dalan Musson, a staff writer on the series, will also co-write the upcoming film, according to reports from &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/captain-america-4-in-the-works-with-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-showrunner-malcolm-spellman-exclusive"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/captain-america-4-in-development-with-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-ep-malcolm-spellman-writing-1234742675/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EM8p4t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a blueprint for the next decade of Marvel heroes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399269/falcon-winter-soldier-disney-plus-marvel-captain-america-future"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="95xwsV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for the season finale of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iszm11"&gt;Details on the upcoming film, including a director, cast, and a release date, have yet to be officially announced by Disney. But both reports note that the upcoming film will likely follow up on the finale of the Disney Plus series, which saw Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson take up the shield and title of the new Captain America. The involvement of Spellman would also point to a continuation of that story, which left several plot threads unfinished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsJMDF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;’s report also notes that the upcoming Spellman project is said to be separate from a rumored project that would see the original Captain America, Chris Evans, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/captain-america-eyes-return-to-the-mcu-as-chris-evans-nears-deal-to-reprise-role-in-future-marvel-project-1234672430/"&gt;return to reprise his role as Steve Rogers&lt;/a&gt; in the Marvel universe. Evans and Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige &lt;a href="https://ew.com/movies/kevin-feige-chris-evans-captain-america-return/"&gt;have denied those rumors&lt;/a&gt;, although it wouldn’t be the first time that a &lt;a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/tatiana-maslany-denies-she-hulk/"&gt;member of a Marvel project&lt;/a&gt; has tried to deny their involvement in one of the superhero films &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/she-hulk-tatiana-maslany-mark-ruffalo-disney-plus"&gt;only to appear later on&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70qL5H"&gt;Marvel has yet to make an official announcement about the project, although it’s possible news could be coming soon, similar to how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188516/boba-fett-disney-plus-show-2021-release-date-mandalorian-finale"&gt;Disney formally announced its &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; spinoff&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; following that show’s season finale last December. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Even Ellen has an NFT</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FbxkDRwHUej86_GOTMT5aQ6jiTg=/0x6:827x557/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69178018/ellen_nft_stick_cat.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R2Y9qD"&gt;How much would someone pay for the digital rights to an autographed copy of a selfie — featuring talk show host Ellen DeGeneres and a crude stick-figure drawing of a cat? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="8A0W7y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FDXGRW"&gt;We’ll soon find out — because Ellen is about to drop her very own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt; next week, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/ellen-degeneres-nft-auction-1234958788/"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, quite possibly making her the most mainstream celeb to cash in on the craze yet. The “Woman With Stick Cat” selfie will be one of them, as will her video monologue itself (in 4K resolution). The auction will start 9am PT on Monday, April 26th &lt;a href="https://www.bitski.com/ellen"&gt;at Bitski.com/ellen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNdtqc"&gt;Never fear, feline lovers: you’ll be able to get a high-res digital copy of “Woman With Stick Cat” in the auction as well, either by bidding on one of the 10 “rare” copies, an unlimited number of not-rare copies — or, no doubt, by right-clicking or long-pressing and saving the image to your device. Because you obviously want to inspect that cat’s finely penned features up close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHMo42"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; reports that it’s all for a good cause: proceeds will go to &lt;a href="https://time.com/collection/apart-not-alone/5809169/jose-andres-coronavirus-food/"&gt;Chef José Andrés’ World Central Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;, which has been donating tens of millions of meals in the wake of tragedy, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qFFNlP"&gt;Ellen definitely isn’t the first celeb to hop aboard the NFT train; &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/68570/snoop-dogg-twist-nyan-cat-nft-sells"&gt;Snoop Dogg reportedly sold his tweaked Nyan Cat NFT for $33,000&lt;/a&gt;, and the likes of deadmau5 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353219/gorrilaz-artist-nft-release-environmental-concerns"&gt;and the Gorillaz&lt;/a&gt; have NFTs too. You could also argue that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;the NBA’s Top Shots&lt;/a&gt; or the New York Times (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350663/new-york-times-nft-auction-half-million-dollar-article-charity"&gt;whose columnist sold an NFT for over half a million dollars&lt;/a&gt;) are more mainstream than Ellen, too, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/business/media/ellen-degeneres-ratings-decline.html"&gt;now her viewership has declined by nearly half&lt;/a&gt; due to the backlash over &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/21357113/ellen-degeneres-canceled-mean-backlash-toxic-workplace"&gt;reports of a toxic work environment&lt;/a&gt; on her show. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CDC committee backs Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Grubb’s Pharmacy" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Nwby9ZzgEFQJXsVidk4bRQQBvs=/0x0:4364x2909/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69177968/1232272873.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DfT8ju"&gt;The United States should resume use of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine for all adults, an independent advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today. There is a small risk of a rare type of blood clot in women under 50, and health officials should warn patients of that risk, the committee stressed during its deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47Tv12"&gt;Federal officials at the CDC and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could lift the pause on the shot based on that recommendation soon —  &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/22/johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-blood-clots/"&gt;within hours or days.&lt;/a&gt; The FDA will likely add a warning label to the vaccine about the blood clots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DMhyBd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Federal officials at the CDC and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could lift the pause on the shot based on that recommendation soon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cb9kqp"&gt;Use of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381469/covid-vaccine-pause-blood-clots-johnson-fda-cdc"&gt;paused&lt;/a&gt; in the US since April 13 as officials gathered more information about reports of unusual blood clots in a few people who received the shots. The patients had a type of blood clot that appears in the brain, called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, along with low levels of blood platelets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jig12"&gt;CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) said that the pause should be lifted after discussing the ways that the benefits of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot outweigh the risk of the blood clot, which is extremely rare.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This vaccine can protect people from COVID-19, and is also a key tool to protect vulnerable groups like people experiencing &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/johnson-johnsons-covid-19-vaccine-emerges-as-preferred-shot-for-homeless-11617530400"&gt;homelessness&lt;/a&gt; from the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ZejL9y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H8XJo4"&gt;There have not been similar reports in people who received the Pfizer / BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. Around 200 million doses of those vaccines have been administered in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BoRmD"&gt;As of today, around 8 million people in the US have received the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot and there are 15 confirmed cases of the clots, all in women. Other potential cases are under investigation. Two of the women with confirmed cases are over 50 years old, and 13 are between 18 and 49 years old. Three of the women died, seven are hospitalized, and five are recovering at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZR7W3B"&gt;Based on the available data, the risk of the clotting condition in women under 50 is seven cases per 1 million doses of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine, the ACIP’s COVID-19 Vaccines Safety Technical Work Group &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-04-23/05-COVID-Lee-508.pdf"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt;. The risk for women above 50 and men is less than one case per 1 million doses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="g9Uxtx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The risk for women above 50 and men is less than one case per 1 million doses&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aJLO2h"&gt;The risk of this unusual condition has to be balanced against the benefits of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine, said Grace Lee, associate chief medical officer for practice innovation at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital in California and chair of the work group. The shots can prevent death, hospitalization, and clots associated with COVID-19. Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson calculated that for every 1 million doses of its vaccine given, 2,000 COVID-19-related deaths and 6,000 COVID-19-related hospitalizations could be prevented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqM2SW"&gt;Part of the reason for the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson pause was to give doctors and health care providers information about this clotting condition. Blood clots are usually treated with the blood thinner heparin, but in these patients, that type of medication could make the condition worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQsTYU"&gt;Increased awareness of the condition generated during the pause and investigation should help keep people safer, said Michael Streiff, the medical director of the Johns Hopkins Hospital Special Coagulation Laboratory, during a presentation at today’s ACIP meeting. Doctors know to look out for signs of these rare clots, and people who got the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine will now know to look out for symptoms like a severe headache. Some of the people with the clots took a few days before they went to the doctor, and by that time, they were very sick, he said. “I think that education of the public and physicians will improve outcomes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trPASy"&gt;The ACIP met last week just after the pause to discuss the initial reports, but said then that it did &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22384503/johnson-johnson-covid-vaccine-pause-cdc-acip-clots"&gt;not have enough information&lt;/a&gt; to make a recommendation — effectively extending the pause. The CDC spent the interim collecting more information about the clots and their relationship to the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine. “We would have done this work regardless of whether there was a pause or not,” Tom Shimabukuro, a member of the CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force, said during the committee meeting. “The pause did really focus our efforts on getting to the bottom of this quickly.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cccUxs"&gt;The CDC will continue to monitor cases of the clotting condition using the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html"&gt;vaccine safety surveillance programs&lt;/a&gt;, which let patients and doctors report potential health problems after vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California Governor sees an end to oil extraction in the state</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gavin Newsom visits an oil field in California" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/56jXfdFDeKxXyWhSbITPB1Qelt0=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69177864/1157611018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Gov. Gavin Newsom tours the Chevron oil field west of Bakersfield where a spill of more than 900,000 gallons of oil and brine water oil has flowed into a dry creek bed July 24, 2019 near McKittrick, California.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Irfan Khan/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D28MCQ"&gt;California Governor Gavin Newsom today set an aspirational 2045 deadline to stop all oil extraction in the state. He also said that he plans to ban hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking” for oil by 2024.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8PPW2"&gt;“As we move to swiftly decarbonize our transportation sector and create a healthier future for our children, I’ve made it clear I don’t see a role for fracking in that future and, similarly, believe that California needs to move beyond oil,” he said in a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/04/23/governor-newsom-takes-action-to-phase-out-oil-extraction-in-california/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yWPP7Q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;NEW: California is now the first state to declare an end to oil extraction in the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, we're announcing that we will phase out all oil extraction — as part of a world-leading effort to achieve carbon neutrality — and ban fracking by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;— Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1385671067147005953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CovhfX"&gt;Newsom directed the state’s Department of Conservation to quit issuing new permits for fracking. Halting all oil extraction, however, will be more difficult. For now, he’s asked the California Air Resources Board to “analyze pathways” that could put an end to digging up new oil by 2045. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVfiNn"&gt;The embattled governor, who could soon face a recall election, previously &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-04-23/gavin-newsom-executive-limit-fracking-california"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; he didn’t have the “authority” to ban fracking. State lawmakers tried to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/17/fracking-california-senate-bill-ban"&gt;pass legislation&lt;/a&gt; banning fracking earlier this year but &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/legislature-san-francisco-scott-wiener-legislation-oil-and-gas-industry-963839657250764c4296dfd461dbe22a"&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt;. Fracking is a &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/4/14/18076690/fracking"&gt;controversial way&lt;/a&gt; of accessing hard-to-reach oil and gas reserves that poses threats to air and water quality. It only accounts for about two percent of oil production in the state, so Newsom will have to make good on his other commitment if he wants&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to have a big impact on the state’s oil production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E65X0K"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’d be the biggest oil producer ever to announce an end to oil extraction”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDOeAr"&gt;California is the world’s fifth-largest economy, so its environmental goals hold weight. “This is significant. If California was a country, it’d be the biggest oil producer ever to announce an end to oil extraction,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonathangaventa?lang=en"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Jonathan Gaventa, a senior associate at the climate think tank E3G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqWQAn"&gt;Some said Newsom still isn’t getting ambitious enough. “Phasing out drilling by 2045 is inadequate. That’s twenty-four wildfire seasons away, with exponentially worsening conditions every year,” the Los Angeles chapter of the environmental organization Sunrise Movement &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SunriseMvmtLA/status/1385673184846909450"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="859OSB"&gt;California has led the way on ambitious climate policy in the past. Last year, it became the first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;state to ban&lt;/a&gt; the future sale of new internal combustion vehicles. In 2018, former governor Jerry Brown set a target for the whole state to be carbon neutral &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/9/11/17844896/california-jerry-brown-carbon-neutral-2045-climate-change"&gt;by 2045&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it won’t put out more planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions than it can offset or capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PW6jnd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGcnwh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLUofS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter may let you tip people for their great tweets right from their profiles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5hcBbucs8OH_JYIGlKNLGeBC6fg=/0x14:1064x723/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69177768/Ezph50pVoAszQCf__1_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out that cash button.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1385527493931593728" target="_blank"&gt;Jane Manchun Wong on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aB2eIC"&gt;Twitter has said &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-test-communities-tipping-super-follows-183101868.html"&gt;it’s exploring features&lt;/a&gt; like tipping to give people a way to pay other Twitter users, and now we have further evidence that a tip feature may be on the way. App researcher Jane Manchun Wong shared images on Thursday and Friday showing that Twitter could offer a tipping button right on user profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHkLU1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1385375100841586689"&gt;Here’s one iteration of what it could look like&lt;/a&gt; — check out the little blue cash button under the “@wongmjane” watermark in the left image. Clicking or tapping that button apparently shows options to let you tip via Bandcamp, Cash App (made by Square, which counts Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey as its CEO, too), Patreon, PayPal, and Venmo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZEXXWp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter is working on Tip Jar right on the user profile &lt;a href="https://t.co/kqzQmiDFKc"&gt;https://t.co/kqzQmiDFKc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/VacGyJJ8DU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VacGyJJ8DU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1385375100841586689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhuCji"&gt;As you can see in this tweet, Wong also found evidence in March that Twitter is working on a “Tip Jar” feature for Twitter Spaces, the company’s Clubhouse-like social audio rooms (Clubhouse just introduced its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368929/clubhouse-direct-payments-creators-stripe"&gt;direct payments feature on April 5th&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEqLK4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1385527493931593728"&gt;Here’s another look at the tipping button on profiles&lt;/a&gt;, from Wong. These screenshots show a black tipping button instead of a blue one. They also show designs Twitter is apparently testing for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers"&gt;forthcoming Super Follows&lt;/a&gt;, which will let you charge followers so they can access extra content. (Think Patreon, but for tweets.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ehJ7sI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter is working on the “Super Follow” button,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;as a small circular button , or a big “Super Follow” one&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;p.s. that cash button is for tipping: &lt;a href="https://t.co/A6Q6TiA1ku"&gt;https://t.co/A6Q6TiA1ku&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter is also making their color scheme more monochrome, and is also using their new “Chirp” font &lt;a href="https://t.co/qSEjh0ohm8"&gt;https://t.co/qSEjh0ohm8&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/jb3Y9o4Yct"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jb3Y9o4Yct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1385527493931593728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bkjdzV"&gt;Twitter has not formally announced a tipping feature, so there’s no guarantee the company actually releases it publicly. Even if it does, it’s unclear if there would be any restrictions on who could put a tipping button on their profile. It seems possible that the feature will be gated in some way, perhaps requiring you to have a certain number of followers or be verified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqsc6A"&gt;Twitter declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
