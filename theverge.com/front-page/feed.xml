    <title>Teledyne is buying FLIR to create a super-sized sensor shop with thermal and laser vision</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e4GWfyae328dV0C-5owXnSL6VEA=/129x0:1071x628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68619175/flir_teledyne.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="speakable-summary"&gt;Industrial sensor giant Teledyne will acquire FLIR, an Oregon-based company that makes thermal-imaging and night vision technology, the &lt;a href="https://www.teledyne.com/en-us/news/Pages/Teledyne-to-Acquire-FLIR-Systems.aspx"&gt;companies announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The deal is worth $8 billion in a mix of cash and stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuDXhu"&gt;“At the core of both our companies is proprietary sensor technologies. Our business models are also similar: we each provide sensors, cameras and sensor systems to our customers,” Teledyne chairman Robert Mehrabian said in a &lt;a href="https://www.teledyne.com/en-us/news/Pages/Teledyne-to-Acquire-FLIR-Systems.aspx"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. The companies’ sensors are “uniquely complementary, with minimal overlap,” he added, which could be important when regulators decide whether to approve the acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cZtl4J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You probably already know FLIR&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cslfoO"&gt;Oregon-based FLIR makes thermal-imaging and night-vision technology for the military and for industrial and consumer applications — if you’ve ever seen infrared footage, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/6/6/15743628/flir-one-thermal-camera-iphone-android-specs"&gt;there’s a good chance it was captured&lt;/a&gt; with a FLIR camera. FLIR also has some &lt;a href="https://www.suasnews.com/2020/05/flir-wins-20-6-million-contract-to-provide-black-hornet-nano-uav-systems-for-u-s-armys-soldier-borne-sensor-program/"&gt;$60 million in contracts with the Army&lt;/a&gt; for its Black Hornet drone, and its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flir.com%2Fdiscover%2Fcores-components%2Fflir-hadron-enables-lightweight-and-affordable-suas%2F%3Futm_source%3Daffiliate%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3DSkimlinks%26cjevent%3D6abd03b34eda11eb837e00300a24060f&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F4%2F22213966%2Flidar-flir-teledyne-thermal-sensor-drones-nasa#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hadron thermal camera&lt;/a&gt; is used in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21376917/drone-us-government-approved-dod-diu-uas-blue-china"&gt;other Army-approved drones&lt;/a&gt;. FLIR also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flir.com%2Fnews-center%2Fcamera-cores--components%2Fflir-to-provide-thermal-imaging-cameras-for-zoox-robotaxi%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F4%2F22213966%2Flidar-flir-teledyne-thermal-sensor-drones-nasa#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;supplies thermal imaging&lt;/a&gt; cameras for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173971/zoox-amazon-robotaxi-self-driving-autonomous-vehicle-ride-hailing"&gt;Zoox’s self-driving robotaxi&lt;/a&gt;, which helps the vehicles better “see” people and driving conditions, particularly important in urban areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kM2HC0"&gt;Teledyne might also have tech that’s handy for self-driving vehicles: in addition to making thermal sensors for defense and industrial clients, including NASA, it’s one of the companies that the builds the LIDAR (light detection and ranging) sensors you might see atop a self-driving car. Its LIDAR was also used in NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission last October, helping to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540873/nasa-osiris-rex-spacecraft-asteroid-sample-bennu-storage-success"&gt;map the surface of the Bennu asteroid&lt;/a&gt; so it could collect samples to bring back to Earth. Teledyne isn’t to be confused with Velodyne, whose LIDAR featured in some of the earliest self-driving prototypes and in Google’s early cars, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Owcr2"&gt;The acquisition is expected to close sometime in the middle of the year, the companies said, pending regulatory approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEE1yO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Dorsey says proposed cryptocurrency regulation would create ‘perverse incentives’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9_8akmTRQZ5K_01t8Z8UvInIj9s=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68618962/acastro_170726_1777_0007_v6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wgIkVO"&gt;Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and Square, isn’t happy about the new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsquareup.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpress%2Ffincen-letter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F4%2F22213863%2Fjack-dorsey-cryptocurrency-fincen-regulation-letter#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;proposed cryptocurrency regulation&lt;/a&gt;. He emphasized how the regulation would hurt Square, a financial services company, in a letter posted to the company website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="soTiJq"&gt;In October, Square &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507533/square-50-million-bitcoin-dorsey-cryptocurrency"&gt;bought $50 million in bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;. The company also has invested heavily in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, so Square has plenty of skin in the game. The regulations create “unnecessary friction and perverse incentives for cryptocurrency customers to avoid regulated entities for cryptocurrency transactions,” Dorsey writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0SkQIt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The regulation could end up driving customers “to use non-custodial wallets or services outside the U.S.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x50Dtq"&gt;The regulation, proposed by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), would require financial institutions (like Square) to collect personal information about the parties involved in cryptocurrency transactions. You can read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195834/cryptocurrency-fincen-regulations-private-wallets"&gt;a deep-dive on them here&lt;/a&gt;, but the more important requirement is for financial institutions to collect the name and physical address of both parties of any large transaction they’re involved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Caso08"&gt;The regulation aims to help prevent some of the illegal uses of cryptocurrencies, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/"&gt;such as drug trafficking&lt;/a&gt;, money laundering, and “international terrorist financing.” But Dorsey’s major complaint is that they would create “unnecessary friction” between cryptocurrency users and financial institutions, which could lead to “perverse incentives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hOCgNF"&gt;To put it plainly — were the [regulations] to be implemented as written, Square would be required to collect unreliable data about people who have not opted into our service or signed up as our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yQgdWh"&gt;To use an example included in the letter, say a parent uses Square to send their daughter $4,000 in bitcoin. Even if the daughter is using a private bitcoin wallet on her own computer, Square would then be obligated to collect her personal information, including her physical address. Dorsey, &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/us-government-targeting-cryptocurrency-expand-reach-its-financial-surveillance"&gt;along with other privacy advocates&lt;/a&gt;, sees that as an overreach, particularly given the open nature of the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4jR2n"&gt;Dorsey argues the regulation could end up driving customers “to use non-custodial wallets or services outside the U.S. to transfer their assets more easily,” leading to FinCEN having “less visibility into the universe of cryptocurrency transactions than it has today.” Put simply, if people have to provide private information to a bank in order to make a transaction, they’ll avoid using the bank — something the CEO describes as a perverse incentive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMd8Gn"&gt;What’s more, Dorsey writes, it hampers innovation. “The burdensome information collection and reporting requirements deprive U.S. companies like Square of the chance to compete on a level playing field to enable cryptocurrency as a tool of economic empowerment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNzA4o"&gt;The letter was submitted as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/us-government-targeting-cryptocurrency-expand-reach-its-financial-surveillance"&gt;unusually short comment period for the regulation&lt;/a&gt;. The standard public comment period for these types of policies is 60 days, but the comment period for this proposal is 15 days — many of which were holidays. The Treasury Department’s reasoning for this is due to “significant national security imperatives,” but it doesn’t provide any further examples. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Start the first week of 2021 with the Awesome Games Done Quick speedrunning marathon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U0XiOaVieNOCxc8QauqaEAKTqh0=/223x0:2629x1604/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68618659/Screen_Shot_2021_01_04_at_4.37.16_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Games Done Quick&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xOGkQp"&gt;Games Done Quick (GDC), the charity event series that raises money while expert players blast their way through classic games, &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick"&gt;kicked off its first 2021 iteration yesterday on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, and the event is running all week for anyone interested in tuning in to this year’s speedrunning spotlights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwzC33"&gt;The January event, typically focused on “awesome” games done quick, is on its second day and has some great titles on the schedule over the next few hours, including speedruns of &lt;em&gt;Dishonored 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Divinity: Original Sin II&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Diablo 3&lt;/em&gt;. Later this week, we’ll see speedruns of classics like &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mega-Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening&lt;/em&gt;. Check out the full schedule &lt;a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L5MZ45"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?channel=gamesdonequick&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yl7syX"&gt;GDC has been organizing its charity speedrun marathons since 2010, and this year’s event is raising money for the &lt;a href="https://www.preventcancer.org/"&gt;Prevent Cancer Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. The event series is notable for its consistency, the rather sizable viewership and charity metrics it regularly posts (over $25 million raised so far), and the fact that it often features live world records set in real time on Twitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAbGNO"&gt;Earlier today, two world records were set in two separate &lt;em&gt;Sonic &lt;/em&gt;games back to back: &lt;em&gt;Sonic 1&lt;/em&gt; (by speedrunner flyingfox) and &lt;em&gt;Sonic 3: Angel Island Revisited&lt;/em&gt; (by Zaxon96). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="support watchOS 7" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-2TkUJkurmgX8ZHUE8HnJGYxv-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9693867/akrales_171113_2119_0045.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ns6w5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 3 (non-LTE) review: third time’s the charm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $169 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K37HKT8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=0d1a72f49279f5c3ff832b7b9721e419&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725327349047065530" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D0%26wl13%3D2435%26%26adid%3D22222222227257067173%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D304471618288%26wl4%3Dpla-546497580682%26wl5%3D9008008%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D8175035%26wl11%3Dlocal%26wl12%3D499753351%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA664EIRAtCz_lz7elMSJ9eUHfN0gX3036s_ONGfk5-66T-g5QFKrPNRoCoA0QAvD_BwE&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is $30 off its usual price of $199.

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="NYyAAC"&gt;The 44mm with GPS is also on sale at several retailers.

    <title>Fortnite developer Epic Games just bought a North Carolina mall for its new headquarters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JQR_w2nkxQ6k7QSGzVszllnjTk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68618411/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="engadget-post-contents"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic Games is moving its Cary, North Carolina headquarters across town to a large shopping mall, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt;. It’s planning to convert the 87-acre Cary Towne Center into its new home base by 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uN2uQi"&gt;Once development is complete, Epic says the site will include recreational and office space, “customized from the ground up to accommodate its long-term growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCZmXf"&gt;The company says it plans to begin development on the new HQ site this year. Epic purchased the property from Turnbridge Equities and Denali Properties, which bought it in January 2019 as part of a distressed sale after the mall lost three of its anchor tenants, &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2021/01/03/epic-games-buys-cary-towne-center-for-headquarters.html"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Triangle Business Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Turnbridge and Denali planned to turn the site into a mixed-use development named Carolina Yards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ts5SQj"&gt;Epic’s plans for developing the property include demolishing some of the existing structures on the site, a spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but the company didn’t offer any further specifics. saying plans are still in the early stages. Until the new headquarters is ready, Epic will continue to operate out of its current offices at Crossroads Boulevard in Cary, about &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Cary+Towne+Center,+Walnut+Street,+Cary,+NC/Crossroads+Blvd,+Cary,+NC+27518/@35.7692517,-78.7568751,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89acf37095e4a5e7:0x39896f5137e1e57b!2m2!1d-78.7602778!2d35.7738889!1m5!1m1!1s0x89acf499dfeab493:0x58a15f123e5914fa!2m2!1d-78.7342361!2d35.7590385!3e0"&gt;three miles away&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POEqzw"&gt;Epic raised $1.78 billion in a funding round last summer and has a &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/gaming/news/fortnite-epic-games-1-78-billion-funding-sony-1234727436/"&gt;valuation of around $17.3 billion&lt;/a&gt;. And even though the company is still embroiled in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;ongoing legal battle with Apple&lt;/a&gt; over fees in the App Store, Epic’s&lt;em&gt; Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; remained hugely popular in 2020, with more than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249497/fortnite-350-million-registered-players-hours-played-april"&gt;350 million registered players&lt;/a&gt; as of May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgfF58"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGjoX8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNHNbx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack starts 2021 with a massive outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5hmEn0gT2hC75DNR_TmjXVKGriw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68616251/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / Th&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hY6sOv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://status.slack.com/2021-01/9ecc1bc75347b6d1"&gt;Slack went down&lt;/a&gt; on the first full work day of 2021. The company said Monday morning “Customers may have trouble loading channels or connecting to Slack at this time. Our team is investigating and we will follow up with more information as soon as we have it. We apologize for any disruption caused.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfkjSd"&gt;Users began reporting issues around 10AM ET, and the company posted its first status update about the problem at 10:14AM. As of 12:29PM ET, the service appeared to be slowly returning to normal for some users — we here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; were able to transition back to Slack and resume work there at around 1:30PM ET, and we’ve had no disruptions since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3gbrDr"&gt;At first, Slack was reporting issues with connecting to the service and messaging. An update on its status page at 11:20AM ET upgraded the situation to a full-blown outage, with all aspects of Slack— including log-ins, messaging, calls, and connections— showing as unavailable. “All hands are on deck on our end to further investigate,” according to the &lt;a href="https://status.slack.com/2021-01/9ecc1bc75347b6d1"&gt;update page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hHrjws"&gt;Slack’s latest update at 1:51PM ET suggests the company is still working to resolve some lingering issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="YWbpM3"&gt;For those customers who are unable to access Slack (e.g. seeing a blank screen or error), please try reloading (CTRL/CMD + R). Otherwise, please hold off on reloading, as this could prevent you from accessing Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlNnpO"&gt;In addition, Google Calendar and Outlook Calendar aren’t working as expected, and some email notifications (e.g. a notification of a new direct message in Slack) are failing to send.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="c1vgzo"&gt;An update at 3:12PM ET indicated that most of the problems were resolved and the platform was functioning normally, but that some Google and Outlook calendar integrations and email notifications were still not working as expected. “We’re working to resolve this issue, and we’re sorry for the trouble,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfeVkX"&gt;Slack hasn’t yet said what may have caused the outage, which lasted several hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgnDBp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 11:30AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Slack has upgraded the problem to a full outage of its services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="heftUf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 12:35PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that the service may be returning for some users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAouLE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 2:14PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Slack’s latest update note, and that we at The Verge don’t seem to be experiencing issues anymore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0A6vBA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 3:32PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added latest from Slack that most functions were returning to normal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s Breath of the Wild basically uses fancy Miis as NPCs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image showing a Mii as a character in Breath of the Wild" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/atdK6lCdXGh0xiLM0L6r0aD2IX0=/679x0:1225x364/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68618002/Eq3DiNmXAAEKRKC.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/HEYimHeroic" target="_blank"&gt;@HEYimHeroic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VmaJBZ"&gt;If you’re Nintendo and you need a bunch of non-playable characters (NPCs) for your soon-to-be smash-hit &lt;em&gt;Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;, what do you do? Apparently, you may use your Mii creation tool to generate them. Twitter user &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HEYimHeroic/status/1345946860222033923"&gt;and self-proclaimed Mii expert Alice (@HEYimHeroic)&lt;/a&gt; has discovered that some of the minor characters in the game’s world (shopkeepers, townsfolk, etc.), are based on Mii characters, and Miis are able to be brought directly into the game — albeit with a fair amount of effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W5ktPb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As with all systems like this, there are edge cases and caveats&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KeKF3u"&gt;It’s &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/7xjqmj/i_have_a_theory_that_they_ran_out_of_time_to/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;been speculated before&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;’s NPCs were somehow related to Miis (especially after the discovery that their game files were labeled as UMiis), but Alice’s discovery reveals that Miis can be directly mapped into the game, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HEYimHeroic/status/1345947273046482947?s=20"&gt;with only a few exceptions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image showing a Mii as a character in Breath of the Wild" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dVzsgSCqd6jfsFzL9qVrdy_jts0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22213173/Eq3DiNmXAAEKRKC.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/HEYimHeroic" target="_blank"&gt;@HEYimHeroic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obviously, the game doesn’t render the characters exactly like Miis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fgiwzp"&gt;These characters in &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; aren’t exactly Miis, as you can tell by just looking at a picture of them. UMii files have many of the same attributes as Mii files, and the game interprets those into the characters that you can see in game. The consequence of this is that it’s relatively straightforward to convert a Mii into a UMii, as they have basically the same attributes. This will result in your Mii being brought to life in the game and in the game’s art style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAJQm2"&gt;If you want to actually get your Mii into &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll need a modded Wii U or Switch (though that may have been obvious). &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SwitchHaxing/comments/kq13jn/hi_mii_expert_here_turns_out_the_npcs_in_tlozbotw/gi1zw1q?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;The process involves extracting and editing an existing game character’s .bumii file&lt;/a&gt; to match the values your Mii has, then visiting them in the game. Apparently, the Zelda Modding Discord is reasonably active if you really want to dig into the system, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HEYimHeroic/status/1346070177528635392?s=20"&gt;and Alice credits it&lt;/a&gt; for helping them test out their hypothesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U58KVc"&gt;If that all seems like a lot of work or you don’t want to mod your console, Alice has mentioned that they’re taking commissions, though it seems like they’ve gotten a lot of requests already. Those, by the way, have gone exactly as expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mj2xI7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;please stop asking me to add peter griffin into the game &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZEJTWcglf5"&gt;https://t.co/ZEJTWcglf5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— i'm alice (@HEYimHeroic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HEYimHeroic/status/1345971542027612160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="Co2fL4"&gt;There are many characters in the game that aren’t created this way. Main characters like Link, Zelda, Mipha, and pretty much anyone who’s a major part of the story are going to be made the traditional way, as custom 3D models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGBp24"&gt;Let the fact that some &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; characters are basically heavily skinned Miis with some extra modifications be a lesson: you don’t always have to reinvent the wheel to get a system that works. If there’s something you’ve already put a lot of work into, &lt;a href="https://wiifactsplus.tumblr.com/post/627210022619922432/super-mario-3d-land-supports-the-use-of-miis-via"&gt;as Nintendo seems to have done with the Mii system&lt;/a&gt;, think about other ways that system could be used. This isn’t just good game design; it’s good life advice — though hopefully your results won’t be as terrifying as the &lt;a href="https://i.redd.it/ywaswgjos7g01.jpg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;-ified Miis sometimes are&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Florida counties use Eventbrite to schedule COVID-19 vaccine appointments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SgVsw5"&gt;Health departments in many Florida counties are using event management website &lt;a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/d/united-states--florida/covid-19-vaccine/?page=1"&gt;Eventbrite&lt;/a&gt; to schedule COVID-19 vaccine appointments for the public. Officials told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the platform was the easiest way to get vaccinations up and running quickly during the initial rollout, which has been &lt;a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/12/30/so-far-few-coronavirus-vaccines-or-answers-for-florida-seniors/"&gt;confusing&lt;/a&gt; for residents and inconsistent across the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5R1GyR"&gt;Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis bumped all adults over the age of 65 to the &lt;a href="https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2020/12/23/residents-over-65-will-get-covid-19-vaccine-next-under-florida-governors-executive-order/"&gt;front of the vaccination line&lt;/a&gt; along with health care workers and long-term care facility residents — breaking from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations around vaccine prioritization, which said essential workers should have first access. That opened up vaccine access to over 4 million people in the state while supplies were still limited, creating overwhelming demand. There was no statewide distribution system in place. Local health departments were charged with creating their &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/30/us/florida-coronavirus-vaccine-line/index.html"&gt;own systems&lt;/a&gt; to distribute vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxN4gd"&gt;Brevard County on the east coast of the state found out that it would get an allotment of COVID-19 vaccines on December 28th. The Department of Health originally planned to use phone lines to schedule vaccine appointments. But the first day the lines opened, people weren’t able to get through to the number. Jesi Ray, a social media, marketing, and communications specialist for the county, had seen that other places in the state were using Eventbrite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcEmlh"&gt;“I said that this is the way I think we should go,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This is the only option we have right now, this is the quickest, easiest, and most efficient way that we can think of to help the department of health solve this issue right now.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IEmNNS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is the only option we have right now.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xf70a5"&gt;Within 24 hours of launching the Eventbrite, every vaccination slot in the county for the first vaccine shipment was taken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZOqGx"&gt;Manatee County officials used Eventbrite as a way to distribute vaccines quickly, said Christopher Tittel, communications director for the Department of Health in Manatee. Emergency management officials were already familiar with the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nz82Ja"&gt;“The state is instructing all counties to push the vaccine out as quickly as possible,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email. The faster the doses are distributed, the faster the county will get additional doses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAowcM"&gt;Eventbrite has worked well so far in Brevard County, Ray says. There was one minor hiccup, though: every question on the sign-up was mandatory, including one asking whether someone was pregnant or breastfeeding. Many people weren’t answering that question. “Either they were male and thought it didn’t apply to them, or they felt like, I’m 65, I don’t need to answer that,” Ray says. “But on the whole, the report that we got back from people was that this was easy.” The county plans to use the system for its next vaccine allotment and hopes to have the phone lines up and running as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xNbeT"&gt;Eventbrite did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBOrda"&gt;A system like Eventbrite (or any other online platform) is only available to people who have internet access. It’s most accessible to people who are savvy enough to quickly navigate through a website and grab a spot before they’re full. Relying on these systems for the sake of speed means poor communities and communities of color, which have been disproportionally affected by COVID-19, could be shut out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOd8TD"&gt;Ray recognizes that issue. “We know that there are people who can’t get appointments,” she says. “But we needed to get shots in arms, and get people appointments as soon as possible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Htof2Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Republican operatives sidestep Facebook policies ahead of Georgia runoff</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Candidates Jon Ossoff And Rev. Warnock Campaign Day Before Georgia Runoff Election" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a9w_wXAUOB_1TETknKct013fX9A=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68617813/1294459712.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uZfcEv"&gt;As the Georgia runoff election nears, Facebook’s messy political ad rules have created new opportunities for operatives and political groups looking to spread disinformation. In the weeks leading up to Tuesday’s election, Republican super PACs have used Facebook to spread disinformation targeting Georgia voters in the last few critical days before the state’s special election on Tuesday, January 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkE7yn"&gt;In one instance, the Republican Party wrongly accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris of conspiring to remove President-elect Joe Biden from office in a Facebook ad, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/04/technology-202-republican-facebook-ads-targeting-georgia-runoff-contain-disinformation-researchers-find/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Senate Leadership Fund has also run false ads suggesting that Democratic Senate candidate Jon Ossoff would “defund the police,” despite the candidate refusing to support such a position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtZm3p"&gt;Republican super PAC American Crossroads has run several dishonest ads about Democratic Senate candidate Raphael Warnock over the last few weeks, &lt;a href="https://popular.info/p/facebook-fails-georgia"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Popular Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;In one example, the PAC published an ad of Warnock saying “God damn America,” framing it as if he was making an un-American statement. However, the clip came from a 2013 speech in which Warnock was quoting &lt;a href="https://popular.info/p/facebook-fails-georgia"&gt;a noted speech from Rev. Jeremiah Wright&lt;/a&gt;.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCvXfG"&gt;Facebook later removed the ad, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1341089874150088704?s=20"&gt;a tweet&lt;/a&gt; from spokesperson Andy Stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8F51YO"&gt;Facebook’s political advertising policies have also led to misleading fundraising outside of Georgia. The week before the November presidential election, Facebook shut down the ability for advertisers to submit new political ads for approval. On December 16th, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176825/facebook-political-ad-ban-resume-georgia-senate-runoff-elections"&gt;started allowing&lt;/a&gt; authorized advertisers to run ads for the Georgia runoff election. With most other political advertising still shut down, lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) ran ads allegedly raising money for Georgia’s Republican Senate candidates. But &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ted-cruz-is-pocketing-the-money-hes-raising-for-georgia-gopers-hes-not-alone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast &lt;/em&gt;reported last week&lt;/a&gt; that money accrued from those ads was going directly to Cruz. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) were also found to have fundraised through this advertising loophole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maYADc"&gt;With control of the Senate hanging in the balance, the runoff election appears to be a dead heat, with &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/final-polls-show-loeffler-vs-warnock-ossoff-vs-perdue-dead-heat-1-day-before-georgia-election-1558744"&gt;nearly all final polls&lt;/a&gt; projecting 1 percent margins between candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yAgOb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google may be updating the Nest Hub by adding Soli gestures</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KpT5SLY9C4kzL1H9brnw43Zv2b8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68617668/dseifert_181018_3039_1286.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XtiJfJ"&gt;Google’s Nest Hub may be getting an update for the first time since its debut in 2018. The company registered a new “interactive device” &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/A4RGUIK2"&gt;at the Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; that’ll feature a screen, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Zigbee support, along with what seems to be Google’s Soli radar gesture technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPDF8F"&gt;Taken together, it seems that Google has a new smart home device of some sort on the way; &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/04/new-nest-hub-fcc/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, that “interactive device” classification is similar to what Google uses for its other smart devices like the original Nest Hub, Nest Hub Max, Nest Mini, Nest Wifi, and Nest Audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CJ4lkA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s working on something new&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SlOm2o"&gt;The addition of Zigbee — a popular smart home networking standard — would help integrate whatever the new device is even better into smart home setups. And Soli tech has appeared in Google’s smart home devices before, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review"&gt;entry-level Nest Thermostat&lt;/a&gt; released last year, which uses the technology for detecting when users are nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqvcAB"&gt;According to the FCC filing, the unknown smart device is rated for the same, broader 58-63.5 GHz range of frequencies as the Pixel 4, which, unlike the Nest Thermostat, used the Soli technology for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20907715/google-pixel-4-motion-sense-gesture-controls-radar-sensor-project-soli-demo-features"&gt;its Motion Sense gestures&lt;/a&gt;. It’s easy to imagine Google using the radar technology for motion gestures on a next-generation version of its smaller Nest Hub, which lacks the integrated camera that the larger Nest Hub Max already uses for similar gestures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxH3Y6"&gt;Lastly, the Nest Hub is one of Google’s oldest smart home products (having launched back in October 2018). It actually predates the use of the Nest brand for Google’s smart home products — the device first was released as the Google Home Hub — so it’s probably due for a refresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKPML9"&gt;Unfortunately, the FCC filing doesn’t reveal many other details for the mysterious product. But if Google is already working on regulatory registration, we may not have too long to wait. &lt;/p&gt;
