    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mrCmsy"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, the Google Nest Mini is a miniature take on the larger smart speakers that came before it. The compact device doesn’t boast the same sound quality as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt;, but it's impressive for its size, especially when mounted to a wall or placed in a smaller room. What’s more, it packs backlit volume buttons and many of the same features that have come to define the category, including the ability to answer voice queries, control your smart home, and play music, adding to its overall versatility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvIwq9"&gt;If you’re already tapped into the Google ecosystem or are looking for an inexpensive way to strew audio throughout your home, BuyDig is currently offering a three-pack of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F334087468632%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDeals073021%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F30%2F22600005%2Fgoogle-nest-mini-smart-speaker-apple-magsafe-charger-macbook-air-m1-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Minis on eBay for $64&lt;/a&gt;, significantly less than if you were to pay per Mini. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="lJFfNl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt; has officially arrived, however, if you’re looking for a cheaper means for charging your iPhone 12, 12 Pro, or an older device that supports Qi charging, there’s always Apple’s MagSafe Charger. The simple, wired accessory attaches magnetically to the latest iPhone 12 models and allows for 15-watt charging speeds when paired with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20-watt power brick&lt;/a&gt; (sold separately). And while far slower than a traditional USB-C cable — it takes about an hour to charge an iPhone 12 to 40 percent — it’s also more convenient, especially given that it can charge AirPods models with a wireless charging case and older Qi-compatible accessories. Normally $40, Apple’s MagSafe Charger is currently &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13527013?sid=VergeDeals072921&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-magsafe-charger-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Woot for $30&lt;/a&gt;, matching its best-ever price.&lt;/p&gt;

If you still want to make the jump to Apple’s M1 chip, however, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747617164066258670#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is currently knocking $250 off&lt;/a&gt; the price of the 256GB model with 8GB of RAM, a new low for Apple’s 13-inch laptop. To take advantage of the deal before it expires on August 1st, you need to log in or sign up for a free My Best Buy account and enroll in the Student Deals program, a move that takes an additional $100 off the $850 sale price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wvXJY"&gt;If you’re unfamiliar with the latest MacBook Air, it’s currently one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt; you can buy. The 2020 model boasts excellent battery life, impressive performance, and a well-built design. Plus, it’s available in three colorways: gold, space gray, and silver. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla agrees to pay $1.5 million to settle battery throttling lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uqgT5nkQefNjFAYNf66IKXsQoYQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69656244/sokane_181116_3101_fremont_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GieOUA"&gt;Tesla agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle a lawsuit alleging the company used a software update to reduce the maximum battery voltage for some of its Model S sedans, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-agrees-pay-15-mln-settle-claims-over-temporary-battery-voltage-reduction-2021-07-29/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BNihWo"&gt;The software update, which was released in 2019, resulted in slower charging speed and diminished range for around 1,743 vehicles, the plaintiffs alleged. As a result of the settlement, Tesla agreed to pay $625 to each of the affected vehicle owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5YGEYM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla agreed to pay $625 to each of the affected vehicle owners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bRHx1G"&gt;“This amount is many times the prorated value of the temporarily reduced maximum voltage, and thus represents an excellent and efficient result for the Settlement Class,” the court document reads. “In return, the Settlement Class will release claims related to the software updates that imposed and then restored the batteries’ maximum voltage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ze74f3"&gt;Lawyers for the owners said they conducted an investigation that found that “voltage limitation was temporary, with a 10% reduction lasting about 3 months, and a smaller 7% reduction lasting another 7 months before the corrective update was released in March 2020. Following that second update, the vehicles’ voltage showed steady restoration over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdNCLq"&gt;It’s not immediately clear how the plaintiffs will receive their payment from Tesla. A US district court judge will convene a hearing on the proposed settlement on December 9th. A spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment; Tesla dissolved its PR department in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7wFs4"&gt;This isn’t the first time Tesla has been forced to pay its customers for throttling their vehicle batteries. Last May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451101/tesla-fine-norway-throttle-battery-charging-speed"&gt;the company was ordered to pay&lt;/a&gt; 136,000 kroner ($16,000) each to thousands of customers in Norway for slowing down charging speeds. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The bad science behind trans healthcare bans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A pile of papers with their text blacked out with a marker. The top of the pile is a red paper titled “outcomes of gender affirming treatment” with lines blacked out in a way that leaves negative space to form the line through circle “no” symbol." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j13uwnJAY_iAHqAu9jDEvxKrksY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69656210/acastro_210729_4685_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Lawmakers cling to flawed evidence while restricting care for trans youth&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="co53IH"&gt;Conservative legislators and special interest groups are using scientific studies as a cudgel in their attempts to limit children’s access to gender affirming healthcare. One of the biggest battles is taking place in Arkansas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0rhd0"&gt;“We can’t act like these studies don’t matter,” Arkansas state Senator Alan Clark said on March 29th, arguing in support of &lt;a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?id=HB1570&amp;amp;ddBienniumSession=2021%2F2021R"&gt;HB 1570&lt;/a&gt;, a ban on gender affirming healthcare for minors in Arkansas. Clark was referring to cherry-picked research that depicted various treatments as dangerous, experimental, and unsafe for children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgqgvF"&gt;After a vote, Arkansas became the first state to pass such a bill into law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gl8cHD"&gt;The ACLU &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/were-suing-arkansas-over-its-ban-on-health-care-for-trans-youth/"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Arkansas in May challenging the constitutionality of the law. A judge &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/judge-blocks-arkansas-ban-gender-affirming-care-transgender-minors-rcna1477"&gt;temporarily blocked&lt;/a&gt; the ban on July 21st, days before it was set to go into effect. “We were able to show that these laws are irrational,” said ACLU attorney Chase Strangio at a press conference, “we’re going to keep arguing that up through the court system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIDOSh"&gt;Arkansas is &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/legislation-affecting-lgbt-rights-across-country"&gt;one of 20 states&lt;/a&gt; to attempt bans on gender affirming medical care for young people in the last year. All of the bills try to weaponize science — in the form of questionable, outdated, or misinterpreted research — against trans children and their parents while willfully ignoring both the experiences of trans people and the expert opinion of many groups of scientists, scholars, and doctors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjMdmx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;They’re saying they’re doing science, but they’re ignoring what all the scientific associations are saying,” says Florence Ashley, a transfeminine jurist and bioethicist who studies the ways science and legal systems affect trans youth. The &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/health-care-advocacy/advocacy-update/march-26-2021-state-advocacy-update"&gt;American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/newsroom/news-releases/frontline-physicians-oppose-legislation-that-interferes-in-or-criminalizes-patient-care"&gt;American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.aappublications.org/news/2021/03/09/transgender-legislation-030921"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Latest_News/AACAP_Statement_Responding_to_Efforts-to_ban_Evidence-Based_Care_for_Transgender_and_Gender_Diverse.aspx"&gt;American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/news-and-advocacy/news-room/2019/transgender-custody-statement"&gt;Endocrine Society&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.wpath.org/media/cms/Documents/Public%20Policies/2020/FINAL%20Joint%20Statement%20Opposing%20Anti%20Trans%20Legislation%20Jan%2028%202020.pdf?_t=1580243903"&gt;World Professional Association for Transgender Health&lt;/a&gt; (WPATH), and others have consistently opposed the bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0PRwy"&gt;HB 1570 shares nearly identical language with proposed trans healthcare bans that are making their way through legislature in other states. That’s because they’re &lt;a href="https://19thnews.org/2021/03/anti-lgbtq-orgs-drafting-anti-trans-bills-policymakers/"&gt;copy-paste bills based on “model legislature”&lt;/a&gt; from a coalition backed by anti-LGBTQ hate groups. Here’s a breakdown of why the arguments presented in these bills don’t hold up to scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Su9wwl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HB 1570&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“For the small percentage of children who are gender nonconforming or experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, studies consistently demonstrate that the majority come to identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most physiological interventions unnecessary.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="B1at2J"&gt;The idea that many trans kids will grow out of it is referred to in research as desistance. The term comes from criminology, where it describes the process of ceasing criminal behavior. The concept of desistance is often used to remove children’s agency in discussions of their own identities, painting them as confused or going through a phase. It’s also used to advocate for “reparative” conversion therapies, which, unlike gender affirming care, are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/transgender-conversion-therapy-associated-severe-psychological-distress-n1052416"&gt;unethical and dangerous&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0k6hTd"&gt;The most frequently cited desistance statistic is that around 80 percent of kids who experience gender dysphoria will go on to be cisgender adults. This percentage is usually attributed to four studies, published from 2008 to 2013, which looked at young children at gender identity clinics in Canada and the Netherlands. There are a number of problems with how those studies were carried out and how their findings were interpreted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9uTOW"&gt;All of the studies included children who had not actually expressed gender dysphoria and had instead been deemed gender-nonconforming by their parents. Labeling those children as desistant drastically inflates the percentage. In three of the studies, participants who didn’t follow up with the researchers in adolescence or adulthood were assumed to be desistant, again inaccurately raising the desistance percentage. The methodological issues are further discussed in an article &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5951646/"&gt;by researchers&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="https://juliaserano.medium.com/detransition-desistance-and-disinformation-a-guide-for-understanding-transgender-children-993b7342946e"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://juliaserano.medium.com/reframing-transgender-desistance-debates-68648a4fd01a"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; by trans writer and biologist Julia Serano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0Et2F"&gt;The desistance myth is also beside the point because it refers to children younger than those who would be eligible for the physiological interventions listed in the bills. “It’s just not relevant,” says Ashley. “This is a prepubertal population. It’s not the group that’s being offered puberty blockers. Those being offered puberty blockers are the ones that have already not desisted.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qRvIqE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HB 1570&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“Even among people who have undergone inpatient gender reassignment procedures, suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly elevated above the background population.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EDK1Ih"&gt;This line is likely referencing &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885"&gt;a 2011 study conducted in Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, which sponsors of the bill have mentioned specifically in their arguments. That study did find that adult trans participants had higher rates of mental illness, suicide attempts, and death by suicide than cisgender people of the same age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmpwEV"&gt;What the senators failed to mention is that the researchers &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; acknowledged that gender affirming surgeries alleviate gender dysphoria, and that their findings should inspire better care for trans people after surgery. The researchers state explicitly that their results should not be interpreted to say that gender affirming surgeries increase mortality. The study is also limited in several ways; most notably, its focus was trans people who were treated in the 1970s and ‘80s, and significant improvements in treatment, from mental health care to surgical techniques, have been made since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l27dh4"&gt;Avery Everhart, a trans medical and legal geographer who studies trans healthcare access, points out another issue with these kinds of studies — it’s difficult to directly compare the mental health of cis and trans kids because there are so many variables to take into account. “It’s not ideal to compare to cisgender, mentally healthy, well-adjusted, youth of the same age, instead you should be comparing to other youth who also experience comorbid issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qW54OV"&gt;Trans youth aren’t more predisposed to mental illness and other problems simply by nature of being trans, Everhart says. Living in a transphobic society, where children may not have family support and lawmakers are trying to restrict their rights, is bound to have negative effects on mental health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgNG3W"&gt;“In biomedical research, in general, there’s an assumption that it is better to pathologize the individual,” says Everhart, “as opposed to diagnosing the society that gave them suicidality, that caused them to be depressed, that may have led them to have substance abuse issues.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="wtCIDZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HB 1570&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“The prescribing of puberty-blocking drugs is being done despite the lack of long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such distress or gender transition.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="CXPV6y"&gt;“Puberty blockers have been around a long time, and weren’t invented for trans children,” says Jules Gill-Peterson, trans historian and author of &lt;em&gt;Histories of the Transgender Child&lt;/em&gt;. There’s plenty of evidence that they do what they’re supposed to do: delay puberty. They’ve been prescribed for decades &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epnzjk/no-one-had-a-problem-with-puberty-blockers-when-only-cis-kids-took-them"&gt;for cis children&lt;/a&gt; who enter puberty at particularly young ages, and are approved by the FDA for that use. The blockers used for trans and cis children are the same, are only used temporarily, and their effects are reversible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0luOK"&gt;A lack of long-term studies doesn’t equate to a lack of knowledge about puberty blockers’ risks or benefits for trans children. The use of puberty blockers for trans children is in line with the WPATH &lt;a href="https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc"&gt;Standards of Care&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/102/11/3869/4157558?login=true#99603316"&gt;Endocrine Society’s guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(17)30099-2/fulltext"&gt;2017 review&lt;/a&gt; of available evidence determined that puberty suppression is reasonably safe and is associated with improved psychological health. Preliminary results from a &lt;a href="https://ijpeonline.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13633-020-00078-2"&gt;longitudinal study in the US&lt;/a&gt; suggest lowered depression and suicidal ideation in trans youth on hormone treatments, including puberty blockers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ECRCgD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HB 1570&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;em&gt; “Healthcare providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, despite the fact that no randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the purpose of treating such distress or gender transition.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4q5xSe"&gt;The lack of randomized clinical trials isn’t really a smoking gun here. It would be unethical to run studies where hormones were given to some people and withheld from others. Like puberty blockers, hormone therapies are prescribed to cisgender people for a variety of reasons. For example, anti-estrogen drugs are recommended for &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6166145/"&gt;teen cisgender boys with persistent gynecomastia&lt;/a&gt; (breast enlargement) who experience psychological distress, though they’re not approved by the FDA for that use. There are no randomized clinical trials for such treatments for cis children. Lawmakers seemingly have no objections to hormone therapies unless they’re used for trans children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIyhrd"&gt;Minors are prescribed hormones after careful consideration and discussion between healthcare providers, children, and their caregivers. There are plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1054139X16000963"&gt;barriers and gatekeeping&lt;/a&gt; to gender affirming care, and &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11673-020-10086-9#Abs1"&gt;researchers argue&lt;/a&gt; that young teens are often capable of making their own decisions about when to start hormones. WPATH, the Endocrine Society, and other medical associations consider hormone therapy safe and beneficial for trans youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="u8pQtw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HB 1570&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“It is of grave concern to the General Assembly that the medical community is allowing individuals who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex to be subjects of irreversible and drastic nongenital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently sterilizing genital gender reassignment surgery, despite the lack of studies showing the benefits of such interventions outweigh the risks.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tfoe26"&gt;Very few minors undergo gender affirming surgeries of any kind, especially genital surgeries. Those who do are usually at least 16 years old and have already been socially and medically transitioning for some time with the guidance of healthcare providers. The WPATH Standards of Care recommend waiting until the age of majority, and having been on hormones for at least a year. It’s also worth noting that the use of puberty blockers can prevent trans children from needing many surgeries later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyDPOT"&gt;The vast majority of trans youth do not get any surgeries until they’re over 18, but there is growing evidence that there are benefits to having certain procedures done at a younger age. &lt;a href="https://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(17)30108-X/fulltext"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; noted that transfeminine patients were more likely to keep up with vaginoplasty aftercare while at home with family members, as opposed to recovering while away at college. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2674039?utm_source=TrendMD&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=JAMA_Pediatrics_TrendMD_1"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; of transmasculine people who had chest surgery earlier in life found very low rates of regret, as well as significantly lower dysphoria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcNFXC"&gt;People who oppose trans healthcare rely on fear-mongering language around gender affirming surgeries, using words like “irreversible” and “sterilizing” and making comparisons to mutilation. But bodies go through irreversible changes all the time, from puberty and aging to appendectomies and tonsillectomies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxRSEW"&gt;“It’s a fantasy that the cis body is some sort of organic, naturally developing body that just perfectly unfolds according to nature’s plan, and never undergoes any sorts of significant changes,” says Gill-Peterson. “The human body is fundamentally biologically plastic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kab9Ue"&gt;“Irreversibility makes a couple of assumptions when we see it talked about this way, that it’s a zero sum that something either is or is not reversible, as opposed to on a spectrum,” says Everhart, “some things will return to their previous state, but maybe not fully, others will totally reverse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yfPGQU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HB 1570&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“Gender transition procedures” do not include: (i) Services to persons born with a medically verifiable disorder of sex development including a person with external biological sex characteristics that are irresolvably ambiguous [...] (ii) Services provided when a physician has otherwise diagnosed a disorder of sexual development that the physician has determined through genetic or biochemical testing [...]”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dKuYhL"&gt;The bill bans surgeries for trans youth, but specifies that the ban doesn’t apply to procedures on intersex people. This exception leaves room for healthcare providers to continue the traumatizing practice of operating on intersex children of all ages without their consent or knowledge. “They’re going to force intersex people to endure the things that they’re withholding from trans people,” says Gill-Peterson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QAif7U"&gt;Unlike medical treatments that trans youth seek out to affirm their identities, procedures done on intersex children, often during infancy, do cause irreversible physical and psychological harm. Medical opinion has &lt;a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/09/17/us-medical-association-stands-against-unnecessary-intersex-surgeries"&gt;shifted away&lt;/a&gt; from promoting intersex surgeries as medically necessary, and intersex activists are still &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/nicolang/lurie-childrens-hospital-intersex-surgery"&gt;calling on hospitals&lt;/a&gt; across the country to stop performing them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pfDkzh"&gt;“That’s the tell. That’s how you know none of these bills have anything to do with science and are purely ideological,” says Gill-Peterson. “[It’s] all the same medicine for cis, trans, and intersex people. They’re just treated entirely differently now under the law, and I think that’s really, really disturbing.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use transitions to make your TikTok videos more interesting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ntvV3iB9aOvgQt8w_Z3xKqT-hJ8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69656197/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s4bJQV"&gt;If you’re a TikTok creator, then you know how quickly those minutes of video can fly by. One of the ways you can move storytelling along is by using transitions between clips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUBOh7"&gt;While TikTok offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573640/tiktok-video-template-how-to-beginner"&gt;a handful of templates&lt;/a&gt; that resemble slideshow presentation transitions, these don’t seem to be very popular. Instead, many users opt for manual transitions that use video editing and recording tricks to make their video flow from one clip to the next. Some of these transitions are relatively simple and only require a couple of steps, while others need a little bit of planning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E8cecE"&gt;All the transitions serve a purpose, though, and that is to move the video along and keep pace with either the music or what the person is saying. Transitions can also be used to reveal something new, like an appearance change, or to signal the speaker is moving onto the next topic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dJD4d"&gt;Here’s how to do a simple TikTok transition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="92Wr7J"&gt;Use one hand to hold your phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qGZSmU"&gt;Turn your camera so it’s on selfie mode. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AGkRXz"&gt;Press and hold the record button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="APPS2s"&gt;Say or do whatever you would like to say or do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="x0k4H5"&gt;Once you’re finished talking, use your free hand to cover the phone’s camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4nO9Fc"&gt;Stop recording.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="g2zw4p"&gt;Set up your next shot by moving elsewhere or getting ready to start speaking again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TRpDNp"&gt;With your hand still on the camera, start recording again. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="75vIxH"&gt;As you start speaking, move your hand away from the camera. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5Frj3U"&gt;Finish the clip and stop recording.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Nf4EgN"&gt;Play the clip back on the next screen to make sure the transition looks smooth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="i9Gtof"&gt;Either continue recording or publish the video! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lbKYyn"&gt;If you need an example, I use this transition method below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oAnOXG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/6989714772916833542" data-video-id="6989714772916833542" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@verge" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@verge"&gt;@verge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;How to turn yourself into a cartoon for your next Zoom call &lt;a title="techtok" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/techtok"&gt;#techtok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="technologyhacks" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/technologyhacks"&gt;#technologyhacks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="zoomuniversity" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/zoomuniversity"&gt;#zoomuniversity&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="howtomake" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/howtomake"&gt;#howtomake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - The Verge" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6989714661298014982"&gt;♬ original sound - The Verge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eNzWpd"&gt;Once you’ve mastered the basics, you can begin experimenting. Making transitions convincing really comes down to placement of the camera and timing. Some combinations require your phone, body, or both to stay in the same place for each frame. Other transitions, especially with objects or body movements, need the right timing when you’re editing the clips. Matching up the previous movement to the next movement is what makes a transition feel seamless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcSQ33"&gt;Here is an example of a more intricate transition and a visual explanation of how the creator did it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gngGTE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@nickviddzz/video/6982950961073474821" data-video-id="6982950961073474821" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@nickviddzz" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nickviddzz"&gt;@nickviddzz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;RESULTS AT END &lt;a title="transition" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/transition"&gt;#transition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="transitiontutorial" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/transitiontutorial"&gt;#transitiontutorial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp"&gt;#fyp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ Master - ߹߰robert⑉❦" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Master-6968110527289494277"&gt;♬ Master - ߹߰robert⑉❦&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="jv3tj7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R89sgq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Russia blames software glitch for misfired engines that shoved ISS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eq2GEayCaShfdZpF6_ryNNUth-8=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69656143/5689982352.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Roscosmos&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5eE4im"&gt;Russia’s space agency blamed a “short-term software failure” for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600306/uncontrolled-firing-from-russian-module-causes-brief-tug-of-war-on-international-space-station"&gt;yesterday’s engine mishap&lt;/a&gt; with its new science module. The module’s thrusters unexpectedly fired hours after docking, shifting the International Space Station off its normal position. The software glitch caused the Nauka module to think it was supposed to back away from the station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pAn0x"&gt;The space station, a football field-sized research laboratory floating 270 miles up in low-Earth orbit, was shoved 45 degrees off track once Nauka’s thrusters started firing. NASA said it lost control of the station’s positioning minutes later, but it was eventually repositioned back to normal after thrusters from another Russian module counteracted Nauka’s errant firings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EM39dn"&gt;“Due to a short-term software failure, a direct command was mistakenly implemented to turn on the module’s engines for withdrawal, which led to some modification of the orientation of the complex as a whole,” Vladimir Solovyov, the flight director of the space station’s Russian segment &lt;a href="http://en.roscosmos.ru/22251/"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Friday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OFLxF"&gt;Roscosmos will lead the investigation into the erroneous thruster firings and keep its US partners posted on any fixes, NASA’s space station manager Joel Montalbano told reporters on Thursday. The mishap forced a delay to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22595730/boeing-starliner-astronaut-capsule-launch-nasa-oft2"&gt;Boeing’s planned launch of its uncrewed Starliner capsule&lt;/a&gt; to the ISS, which was slated for Friday at 2:53PM ET and is now planned for Tuesday, August 3rd at 1:20PM ET, the agency said in a &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2021/07/29/update-to-nasas-boeing-orbital-flight-test-2-mission/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ThoL7N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nauka is operating normally, Solovyov said&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hz1oqL"&gt;The space station and its new Russian module are “operating normally” now, Solovyov said, adding that “a reliable internal power and command interface was created, as well as a power supply interface that connected the module to the station.” He said the station’s Russian cosmonauts Oleg Novitskiy and Pyotr Dubrov are balancing the pressure in Nauka and plan to enter the module to start “purifying the atmosphere and begin normal regular work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRKWNi"&gt;Nauka, which means science in Russian, is a multipurpose science module designed to hold cargo and humans. Its long-delayed development began in 1995 and has gone through several design changes that pushed its original launch date of 2007 to 2021. It finally launched July 21st. Upon reaching space, it almost immediately encountered propulsion and communications issues that delayed its insertion into orbit. The module docked successfully eight days later, on Thursday, before its thrusters glitched out and shoved the station off-track.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Mark Cuban-founded audio app Fireside is asking its own users to invest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ccaAj5n5B1QvdZobYVbgd25AKWw=/225x0:1515x860/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69655806/Screen_Shot_2021_07_29_at_10.12.20_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Fireside&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8cqlOx"&gt;The Mark Cuban-funded and co-founded audio app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272148/mark-cuban-fireside-podcast-app-launch-creator-conversations"&gt;Fireside&lt;/a&gt; has yet to publicly launch, but already it’s asking the limited creators on its platform for money. In an email sent to users late last night and viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, co-founder and CEO Falon Fatemi says she and the team are accepting investments through the month of August from anyone who’s interested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmDmUG"&gt;“If you believe in our vision, this is your chance to be part of it,” she writes. “Put your money where your mouth is :) (We did.)” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FusHV9"&gt;The email says more details are to come and doesn’t disclose the deal terms, how the investments will work, what the app’s valuation is, or how much the team is hoping to raise. But the email does also make a couple other announcements about the future of the app and its vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kZ3MDy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fatemi says the live conversation app was “miscategorized” as social audio&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QC9akC"&gt;Next week, at the conference Podcast Movement, Fatemi says she and Cuban will take the stage to announce a partnership with podcast hosting service Libsyn. As &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315866/mark-cuban-fireside-app-podcast-platform-clubhouse"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;, Fireside hosts live audio chats similarly to Clubhouse and allows users to record those conversations. The team had told creators it planned to allow them to distribute their files as RSS-based podcasts, and the Libsyn partnership appears to be the solution for that goal. Fatemi says users will be able to optionally distribute their shows as a podcast with “one tap.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFpvef"&gt;Additionally, she says the team has arranged a deal with audio hardware company Rode to offer users discounts on various equipment. Again, no details were provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKOwQj"&gt;A Fireside spokesperson declined to comment. We’ve also reached out to Libsyn and Rode and will update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0H4t76"&gt;Meanwhile, the Fireside app launched on iOS last week in a closed beta. Users who download the app can sign up with their phone number and email to try to get off the waitlist. Fatemi writes in her email that the app is very much not like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586845/clubhouse-open-beta-invite-access-android-ios"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22540508/facebook-live-audio-rooms-clubhouse-rival-spaces-greenhouse"&gt;Live Audio Rooms&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455799/twitter-spaces-web-browser-clubhouse-social-audio-room"&gt;Twitter Spaces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaRHtH"&gt;“As many of you know the early media speculation miscategorized us as social audio — as many of you have stated we are creating an entirely new category,” she writes. What exactly that new category is, I’m unclear. You can see a teaser trailer for the app below, which focuses on digital creators owning their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="84HfMr"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/564324070?byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UfX1sV"&gt;Still, despite Fireside’s ownership goals, podcasting newsletter &lt;em&gt;Podnews&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://podnews.net/article/podcast-hosts-tos?utm_source=podnews.net&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=podnews.net:2021-07-26"&gt;flagged last week&lt;/a&gt; that some of the app’s terms stood out as not creator friendly. Notably, Fireside and associated parties may use the “recordings, including your name and likeness, for any commercial and non-commercial purposes (including the creation of NFTs), including to use, reproduce, distribute, and license to others in accordance with Fireside’s Terms of Service, in any manner of media whatsoever now or hereafter known, without further compensation or permissions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4d2tV"&gt;The terms also seem to give Fireside ultimate ownership of recordings that happen in the app, and an arbitration clause is included, as well. Some of these details might be standard, but again, they stand out because of Fatemi’s stated interest in freeing creators from binding ownership agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwhpPa"&gt;It’s unclear when Fireside will publicly launch, arguably the detail everyone wants to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon fined record $887 million over EU privacy violations</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qpo5Uq"&gt;Now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600255/amazon-q2-2021-earnings-aws-andy-jassy"&gt;Amazon’s Q2 earnings are in&lt;/a&gt;, it has submitted a 10-Q filing with the SEC that includes &lt;a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001018724/f373b2a5-224e-4ace-b470-bdb5d2e1b223.html#"&gt;additional details&lt;/a&gt; like this eye-popping note about a fine imposed by Luxembourg’s National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD) (via &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-30/amazon-given-record-888-million-eu-fine-for-data-privacy-breach?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3EGvXK"&gt;On July 16, 2021, the Luxembourg National Commission for Data Protection (the “CNPD”) issued a decision against Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l. claiming that Amazon’s processing of personal data did not comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. The decision imposes a fine of €746 million and corresponding practice revisions. We believe the CNPD’s decision to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CMwS9e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The largest GDPR fine to date was a €50 million penalty handed to Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="psN8At"&gt;That converts to about $887 million US, which would be the largest fine ever under Europe’s data protection law. The CNPD has not publicly committed on its decision, and Amazon didn’t specify what revised business practices the commission is proposing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4u6H8"&gt;EU commissioners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;announced in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; that it was their belief Amazon’s retail business misused non-public data to compete with other sellers in France and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOPoaw"&gt; In a statement given to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-hit-with-record-eu-privacy-fine-11627646144"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon says, “the proposed fine is entirely out of proportion with even that interpretation.” The &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;notes that GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) regulations allow for fines of up to 4 percent of a company’s revenue, with the released number amounting to about 4.2 percent of Amazon’s reported $21.3 billion income for 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9X6ik"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="78oJY3"&gt;Maintaining the security of our customers’ information and their trust are top priorities. There has been no data breach, and no customer data has been exposed to any third party. These facts are undisputed. We strongly disagree with the CNPD’s ruling, and we intend to appeal. The decision relating to how we show customers relevant advertising relies on subjective and untested interpretations of European privacy law, and the proposed fine is entirely out of proportion with even that interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9LTTFp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 30th, 9:35AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to clarify that the Luxembourg commission is imposing the fine, and to add a statement from Amazon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRTySy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The bipartisan infrastructure bill is good for EVs, bad for the climate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Tesla Charging Station And Store Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KCEr_RAuHEtRvRmxWeLaX8934BM=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69655610/1234128057.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7INSXj"&gt;If it’s approved, the bipartisan infrastructure deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598636/white-house-infrastructure-broadband-package-bipartisan"&gt;announced this week&lt;/a&gt; will make it easier for Americans to buy and own an electric car. But it won’t help meet President Joe Biden’s ambitious goal to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22394366/joe-biden-pledge-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2030"&gt;cut carbon emissions in half by 2030&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLAcFT"&gt;Experts in urban policy and electrification told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the money authorized for a nationwide network of EV chargers would have a measurable impact on Americans’ car-buying choices. The $1 trillion deal ($550 billion of which is new spending) includes $7.5 billion to fund Biden’s plan to build half a million EV chargers across the country, which will help mend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419150/ev-charging-us-joe-biden-infrastructure-plan"&gt;the mostly fractured, occasionally broken system&lt;/a&gt; we currently have. A more dependable charging network will likely help juice EV sales in the US over the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAsd9Y"&gt;But it won’t help to steer people away from cars and toward more environmental modes of transportation, which many experts believe is necessary to reduce carbon emissions and fight climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lYraWd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A lot could happen between now and then&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xIll6v"&gt;There is a long way still to go. While a bipartisan group of Senate negotiators agreed on a broad framework of a deal, the bill still needs to pass through both chambers of Congress before it ends up on Biden’s desk for his signature. A lot could happen between now and then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jn74dK"&gt;If this deal passes, though, it will likely entrench — not disrupt — the transportation habits of millions of Americans. The bipartisan infrastructure plan “will make it more feasible for Americans to buy EVs and then drive them around with fewer problems,” Yonah Freemark, senior research associate at the Urban Institute, said in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrmBfX"&gt;But when it comes to the question of whether the deal will encourage Americans to use modes of transportation that are cleaner than EVs, Freemark was more pessimistic. “The bill does not seem likely to produce the conditions for a movement of Americans away from driving and toward other modes like transit, walking, and biking,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks At Mack Truck Facility In Pennsylvania" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c9fBYLnrNiGvV4ONyscRnNqEl28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22749220/1331154824.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZtSPZs"&gt;There was an opportunity to revolutionize the way people get around. The proposal unveiled by the White House earlier this year was billed as an “equity-promoting, climate-change-preventing proposal,” Freemark tweeted. But as the process wound its way through the legislative meat-grinder, those radical elements — like funding for housing, schools, and racial equity — were left out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="198NrZ"&gt;For example, the bipartisan deal makes no provisions to require states and localities to “fix it first” before building new roads and highways. The original proposal called on states to repair existing roads and bridges before committing to new projects. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said as much in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412233/pete-buttigieg-transportation-secretary-interview"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in May: “When we fix things, let’s fix them right,” he said, “not just redo the status quo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fsOUKQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Our highway system is likely to expand at a much greater rate than our transit infrastructure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6Wey9f"&gt;But that provision was dropped from the bipartisan deal, which allocates nearly three times as much money for highways ($300 billion) as it does for public transportation ($105 billion). That means our highway system is likely to expand at a much greater rate than our transit infrastructure. Wider roads typically lead to more car traffic — which, in turn, generates more planet-warming emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMiYAv"&gt;“The bill provides next to nothing for non-motorized modes of transportation,” Freemark said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhOlDF"&gt;In the days leading up to the bipartisan deal’s announcement, public transportation emerged as a sticking point in the negotiations. Democrats wanted 80 percent of the funds allocated for highways and 20 percent for transit, citing past precedent, while Republicans thought that 20 percent for transit was too much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCm72P"&gt;In the end, the deal would allocate $39 billion to modernize public transit, which the White House argues is the largest investment of its kind in US history. (As Freemark notes, the US spent more on transit proportionally in the late ’70s and early ’80s.) It would also replace thousands of buses and other transit vehicles with zero-emission upgrades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e85r86"&gt;Biden’s plan to shift Americans away from fossil fuel vehicles and toward ones powered by electricity is in slightly better shape. The president originally wanted $15 billion for EV charging; instead, it looks like he’ll get $7.5 billion. But while that looks bad on the surface — that’s 50 percent less! — the EV industry argues it will nonetheless be transformational. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GRymRT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is an historic investment in charging infrastructure, which is a really big deal.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mnxP5e"&gt;“It is an historic investment in charging infrastructure, which is a really big deal,” said Joe Britton, executive director of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571747/zero-emissions-transportation-association-tesla-uber-rivian-lobby"&gt;Zero Emission Transportation Association&lt;/a&gt; (ZETA), a Washington-based lobbying group that represents companies like Tesla, Uber, Rivian, Lucid Motors, and others. “Consumers will say, ‘Wait a minute, this is happening.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EL2reH"&gt;The White House had a plan to make up for the missing funds. &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/infrastructure-deal-whittles-down-climate-spending/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;E&amp;amp;E News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the administration thought it could use its “Infrastructure Financing Authority” to tap another $7.5 billion for charging stations. But that financing authority was dropped from the deal announced this week, leaving the administration without a replacement for the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqR9rr"&gt;In total, the bipartisan deal contains about $20 billion less for public transportation and EVs compared to the bipartisan framework that senators and the White House announced last June, &lt;em&gt;E&amp;amp;E &lt;/em&gt;reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUbuhM"&gt;Also missing from the bipartisan deal is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22334634/schumer-electric-vehicle-swap-discount-infrastructure-interview"&gt;Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s proposal&lt;/a&gt; for point-of-sale discounts for anyone trading in a gas car for an electric one. Nor does it include incentives for manufacturers to phase out their production of internal combustion engines. The Democratic leader had said his goal was for every car manufactured in America to be electric by 2030 and every car on the road to be clean by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="US-TRANSPORT-INFRASTRUCTURE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ylMtYHgqfreH1HAIuyYiKG707I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22749227/1234018090.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="10upUn"&gt;That’s ZETA’s expressed goal as well. But Britton said it won’t happen without “strong consumer incentives and strong charging investments.” He said he was holding out for additional incentives for EVs to be included in the budget reconciliation bill that Schumer has said he wants to pass alongside the bipartisan deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYnoiB"&gt;The current federal EV tax credit of $7,500 could increase to $12,500 under an amendment that was introduced by Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) to the Clean Energy for America bill. “I don’t know that that full [$12,500] survives reconciliation,” Britton said, “but you know, very strong consumer incentives are in the works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlWrhM"&gt;But if the question is whether this deal would help meet Schumer’s goal of turning every car on the road electric by 2040 or Biden’s goal of cutting carbon emissions in half by 2030, the answer is definitely not under this current framework. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eAgIwy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t know that that full [$12,500] survives reconciliation.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OJTK9J"&gt;To understand why, look to this &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mateosfo/status/1420262881652744194"&gt;Twitter thread by Matthew Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, communications director at pro-housing group California YIMBY. In it, he notes that there are 280 million cars and trucks on the road in the US today, only 3 percent of which are electric. Americans typically buy 16–17 million cars every year, which would mean it would take roughly 16 years of EV-only sales to completely replace all of the gas cars currently on the road. Also, we would need a total ban on the sale and use of gas cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kR3s7H"&gt;Some states have indicated they want to prohibit the sale and use of internal combustion engine vehicles in the future. But that’s not a sure thing, and there’s no national plan in place to phase out gas car production. Meanwhile, modest changes to land use and transit to transform cities into virtually car-free environments would be a better approach to electrifying every car in America. Better transit and more walkable and bikeable environments would mean fewer cars would be needed overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aDEAP"&gt;Without these changes, &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab7c89"&gt;a climate catastrophe would be difficult to avoid&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Facebook became a lifeline for immigrant bike messengers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GSbq7U198iPSVu-TOoLqN_fm2C0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69655640/VRG_4679_Bike_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ari Liloan for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘We are delivery boys who want to raise our voices’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="Kzt2Fs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QWhwYT"&gt;It was a Monday night in June when César Solano Catalán heard that two of his fellow delivery cyclists had been robbed on the Willis Avenue Bridge, a thousand meters of trussed pavement running from Harlem to the Bronx. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Fc1IA"&gt;At 10:45PM, one of the couriers sent a message to &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/RepartidoresDecomidasEnNY/?ref=page_internal"&gt;El Diario de los Deliveryboys en la Gran Manzana&lt;/a&gt; (The Diary of the Delivery Boys in the Big Apple), a Facebook page that Solano operates with five of his uncles. The message urged fellow delivery workers to take precautions when crossing the bridge since two bikes had been stolen that same night. As Solano finished dinner with his uncles, he sent messages to the workers’ group chat and gathered a group to arrive at the bridge. Together, they escorted their compañeros across the bridge and helped them deliver their orders safely. That night, Solano and other delivery workers undertook the work the NYPD is not doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cgXNi"&gt;Food delivery workers in NYC have become part of a growing labor movement of gig workers. They’re demanding strong security protocols to respond to violence and theft of electric bikes; better safety protections; support when they are injured; and access to restrooms in restaurants or public facilities. And parts of that movement are playing out on pages like Solano’s, which use social media as a springboard for in-person collective action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MMxiEs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We publish whatever is related to us.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MLMd8L"&gt;Solano created El Diario de los Deliveryboys en la Gran Manzana in November 2020 after two food delivery cyclists were killed on the road. The page documents the issues that immigrant delivery workers face in New York, and sheds light on the structural inequities that impact their lives. With over 25,000 followers, El Diario has become a community space for delivery workers, mostly from Mexico and Central America, to report assaults and robberies, honor those who have been killed on the job, and amplify their fight for safety and dignity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="339hPE"&gt;“This page has several purposes: to support colleagues like us without asking for anything in return, whether in a vigil, accident, or robbery. We publish whatever is related to us,” explains Solano, who left his town of San Juan Puerto Montaña, located in the High Mountain region of Guerrero in southern Mexico, at the age of 17. “There are other pages that existed before us, but they were linked to certain groups or nationalities. But we do not have any flag, color, country, or race. We are only helping.” The term &lt;em&gt;diary&lt;/em&gt; helps describe the mission, says Solano. “It is called like that so that you can see what food delivery workers go through every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IY5QiF"&gt;According to the advocacy organization New American Economy, almost &lt;a href="https://research.newamericaneconomy.org/report/undocumented-immigrants-covid-19-crisis/"&gt;1 in 3&lt;/a&gt; food delivery workers in New York State are undocumented. Economic hardships and rising unemployment keep pushing immigrants to food apps, which are being recommended by word of mouth. If they hear about a relative or member of their community who has lost their job, Solano explains, they recommend the least worst app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="scKs6Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Your tire goes flat, your bike is stolen, they don’t answer for us. Because we are independent workers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3WPzfU"&gt;Solano had been working double shifts as a busboy in Manhattan since arriving in the US, while also working for delivery services like DoorDash to earn extra cash and pay off his crossing debt. When the pandemic began, he was laid off from the restaurant and moved to food delivery full-time, signing up for the Relay delivery app because of its secure hourly rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6yANB"&gt;“I am working with food apps because I don’t have a boss and I have flexible hours. I can rest whenever I can. That’s one of the advantages that applications give you,” says Solano. “But there are other times that apps do not understand you. Your tire goes flat, your bike is stolen, they don’t answer for us. Because we are independent workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkKjlv"&gt;Before delivering food full-time, Solano’s electric bicycle was stolen, and the average cost for one can go from $1,500 to over $4000. He felt powerless and isolated, with no means to recover it and without someone to go to for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8Vq5uu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s dangerous ... It’s like going to war without weapons.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qkb7tK"&gt;“You just filed a report with the police, and the police tells you here’s the report and that’s it. They say they will call when they have something, but they never called me. The same happened to my uncle and other acquaintances,” affirms Solano, who also created another popular &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/JrCesarSolanoCatalan"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; that promotes the preservation of his native language, Tlapanec, and highlights the customs of the Meꞌphaa people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20JvC0"&gt;Amid a system that silences and erases marginalized voices, El Diario, along with their Telegram and WhatsApp groups, has been key in organizing a community-led strategy that answers directly to the impacted communities. Every time an e-bike is stolen, a delivery worker now knows where to reach out for help. If the bicycle still has a tracker, a group of three to five members goes to look for it. Or they publish a photo on the Facebook page, alerting the members to pay attention in case someone tries to sell the stolen bike. If so, again, they organize and go as a team to recover it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F95YYo"&gt;“I have participated in the recovery of five bicycles. What makes me most happy is seeing a compañero&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with his recovered bike,” says Solano. “It’s dangerous. We go without weapons, knife, or razor when going to retrieve a bicycle. It’s like going to war without weapons. As undocumented immigrants, we do not have that right or that facility to carry a weapon as self-defense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gB3BY1"&gt;The Willis Avenue Bridge, a key route for many delivery workers, has seen repeated assaults and robberies. In March, 29-year-old Francisco Villalva Vitinio, a delivery worker also from Guerrero, was shot and killed near the bridge when he refused to give his e-bike to a robber. While they wait for the NYPD to increase security measures, Solano says, they will continue to protect themselves. Every night since June 14th, they’ve been taking turns watching over their colleagues as they cross the bridge en route to a delivery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ino39n"&gt;“We have been there almost a month and the police have never come to accompany us. During the day they are there issuing tickets, but at night they aren’t. What we’re going through is awful,” adds Solano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AnOdM"&gt;With every live stream of a vigil to demand justice for their killed compañeros,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;or of a night spent protecting fellow workers despite long workdays, El Diario not only earns new followers, but also positions itself as a digital space that houses a growing community movement. A movimiento led by workers who are carving out a space in a country that continues to deny their right to exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="T0hvg6"&gt;“We are not an organization,” explains Solano. “We are delivery boys who want to raise our voices. We demand results and progress. We are food delivery workers and want to come together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4NehX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXzefY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vaccine carrots only got us so far — now, it’s time for sticks</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6CVBBY"&gt;This week, the dam broke. With COVID-19 surging around the United States and vaccination rates stagnating, federal agencies and state governments started announcing vaccine mandates for their workers. The Department of Veterans Affairs was the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/26/mandatory-vaccinations-urged-health-workers/"&gt;first federal agency&lt;/a&gt; to introduce a mandate, and Thursday, President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/29/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-new-actions-to-get-more-americans-vaccinated-and-slow-the-spread-of-the-delta-variant/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that all federal employees would have to be vaccinated or face testing and other protocols. New York City and Los Angeles will also &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/26/1020709931/nyc-will-require-vaccines-or-weekly-tests-for-hundreds-of-thousands-of-city-work"&gt;require&lt;/a&gt; city workers to get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9YVjv"&gt;Private companies are doing the same. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598316/google-vaccination-requirement-return-offices-covid-19-delta-variant"&gt;said Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that employees would have to be vaccinated to come to the office, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598818/facebook-vaccine-requirement-us-office-employees"&gt;Facebook and Lyft&lt;/a&gt; followed with their own announcements hours later. Some &lt;a href="https://ny.eater.com/2021/7/29/22599695/union-square-hospitality-group-requiring-vaccinations-restaurants-nyc"&gt;New York City restaurants&lt;/a&gt; are requiring that employees get vaccinated and are asking diners to show proof of vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rVZWt"&gt;For months, states and organizations have been using incentives to encourage people to get vaccinated — lottery entries, free baseball tickets, free beer. Those can work, and can spur people who were dragging their heels to make an appointment for a shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1H8oT"&gt;“Those are carrots, or positive behavioral nudges,” Aaron Carroll, chief health officer for Indiana University, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/opinion/covid-vaccine-mandate.html"&gt;wrote in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “When it comes to incentives, most people like carrots.” Carrots are continuing — the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600571/biden-vaccine-payment-incentive"&gt;said yesterday&lt;/a&gt; it wants state and local governments to give $100 to the newly vaccinated. But carrots can only go so far. It’s clear that they’re not going to push enough people to get vaccinated to drive back the pandemic. “Sometimes, though, people need sticks,” Carroll said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vV0FBX"&gt;The US has been tiptoeing around the issue of vaccine mandates since the COVID-19 shots were first authorized. Lawmakers across the country have tried to introduce legislation &lt;a href="https://www.nashp.org/state-lawmakers-submit-bills-to-ban-employer-vaccine-mandates/"&gt;banning&lt;/a&gt; mandates. But now, with major players stepping up to require vaccinations, other, smaller organizations have cover to introduce more — they won’t be in the lonely position of being the first to do so and can point to those bigger precedents to back up their decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hcidTp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Wow, talk about hitting a tipping point…. As each organization and industry finds the courage to mandate or strongly incentivize vaccination, it makes it that much easier for the next one to do so. Until all the pressure is on leaders who have NOT done it.&lt;/p&gt;— Bob Wachter (@Bob_Wachter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Bob_Wachter/status/1419735338059124750?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PdEAh1"&gt;Vaccine mandates have always been key to stopping pandemics, Carroll said in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. It took mandates to eradicate smallpox and eliminate polio. We control measles, diphtheria, and other infectious diseases by requiring kids get their shots before going to school. When vaccines aren’t required, uptake tends to stay low — it’s one reason rates of HPV vaccination aren’t as high as health experts would like, even though the shots can prevent cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aZe7K"&gt;The politicization and backlash around the COVID-19 vaccines means that, like the rest of the pandemic, mandates will be patchwork. They’re far more likely to be in place in states with higher vaccination rates and liberal leadership than in places like Florida, where Governor Ron DeSantis is &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-miami-coronavirus-pandemic-247f603722fc0f1d38d0bd97a9006c25"&gt;vocally against mandates&lt;/a&gt; and has new powers to cancel local emergency orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SWNikc"&gt;But in the places where they’re implemented, mandates will get more shots in more arms. It may have been preferable to get to high vaccine rates without requirements. In the US, though, it’s unrealistic — vaccine hesitancy and misinformation is too entrenched, and too many people don’t think COVID-19 is a serious enough problem to make it worth their time. Mandates won’t fix that problem on their own, but they’re one more strategy that could help. At this point, we need all the help we can get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Var7Ef"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;

They’ve made the disease far less lethal — a fully vaccinated 80-year-old has the same risk of death from COVID-19 as an unvaccinated 50-year-old. (Oliver Barnes and John Burn-Murdoch / &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLbeEq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/breakthrough-infections-cdc-data/2021/07/28/dcaaa6b2-efce-11eb-a452-4da5fe48582d_story.html"&gt;CDC reversal on indoor masking prompts experts to ask, ‘Where’s the data?’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The CDC released new recommendations that even people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 wear masks indoors in some situations. The agency hasn’t released the data that prompted that change but says it’s concerning. (Joel Achenbach, Yasmeen Abutaleb, Ben Guarino and Carolyn Y. Johnson / &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

Breakthrough cases were still rare. (Rob Stein / NPR)&lt;/p&gt;

States that have the lowest vaccination rates are now giving shots faster than the rest of the country. (Drew Armstrong / &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="grbPRu"&gt;Perspectives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="diOmZf"&gt;Most of the cats and the great apes—the gorillas and orangutans—are trained for voluntary vaccination, so they will be easy to vaccinate. And then the smaller animals are trained to go into a little mesh box, so those will be fairly easy. The trickier ones are going to be some of the mid-sized primates that maybe aren’t so interested in voluntarily being injected and are also super smart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DNxBgY"&gt;— Keith Hinshaw, the director of animal health at the Philadelphia Zoo, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/07/animal-covid-vaccine-philadelphia-zoo.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about the process for vaccinating animals with an experimental COVID-19 vaccine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IOqaIp"&gt;More than numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4tzoD2"&gt;To the people who have received the 3.9 billion vaccine doses distributed so far — thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdsoGE"&gt;To the more than 196,280,506 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbHqHe"&gt;To the families and friends of the more than 4,192,702 people who have died worldwide — 611,904 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYEI4E"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
