    <title>California accuses Activision Blizzard of ‘withholding and suppressing evidence’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y2hQOy"&gt;Activision Blizzard’s leaders have promised to work to make the company a safe place for women to work — but California has now accused the company of illegally “withholding and suppressing evidence” and shredding documents that it requested for its investigation (&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-temporary-workers-4a8fa284-a003-4c56-819c-43c7c2d3f3ca.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;originally filed the suit in July&lt;/a&gt;, which accused the company of creating a frat-like culture where female employees faced “constant sexual harassment” and discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sk1xpJ"&gt;The updated complaint can be read below, and you can read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;the original version here&lt;/a&gt;. Since the new version contains the same extremely disturbing details, it warrants the same &lt;strong&gt;content warning&lt;/strong&gt; as the original. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SCW4TK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The amended complaint says that Activision Blizzard cited attorney-client privilege when asked for evidence&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hbEK6Y"&gt;In a new section of the complaint, the DFEH says Activision Blizzard is encouraging employees to talk to attorneys at the WilmerHale law firm instead of state investigators — and then denying the state access to that evidence because the conversations were confidential. Activision Blizzard had already been criticized by both a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618776/activision-blizzard-shareholder-letter-soc-investment-group"&gt;company shareholder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618776/activision-blizzard-shareholder-letter-soc-investment-group"&gt;the press&lt;/a&gt; for hiring WilmerHale, a noted union-busting law firm that reportedly helped Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;initially defeat&lt;/a&gt; its workers’ efforts to organize in Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hO4CIz"&gt;The DFEH also claims Activision Blizzard tried to get employees to sign away their ability to speak freely to investigators in waivers, “secret settlements,” and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), which would require employees to notify Activision Blizzard before disclosing information about incidents covered by the NDA or settlements. They would also decide how much employees could freely say, giving the company the ability to “take all steps it deems to be appropriate to prevent or limit the required disclosure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GawM4h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The complaint now accuses the company of shredding “documents related to investigations”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xh0vEW"&gt;Activision Blizzard has promised to try to fix its culture after its initial public response was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598128/activision-blizzard-employees-ceo-letter-response-key-concerns"&gt;panned by employees&lt;/a&gt;, who would later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595922/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-sexual-harassment"&gt;stage a walkout&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;letter to employees published in late July&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s CEO promises that “anyone found to have impeded the integrity of our processes for evaluating claims and imposing appropriate consequences will be terminated.” The allegations in the updated complaint don’t paint a picture of a company working on fixing its culture, though. For its part, an &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-hr-shredded-documents"&gt;Activision Blizzard spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the company didn’t shred any documents, and that it had preserved “information relevant to the DFEH investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obOY6C"&gt;The complaint has also been updated in several places to clarify that it’s not just full-time employees, but also temps and contingent workers that experienced sexual harassment and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJnRvD"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. Both the AirPods and AirPods Pro are compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which isn’t always the case with even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;. The AirPods Max, the latest pair of headphones to join the AirPods lineup, are just as dependable, albeit at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Luckily, many of the most popular models routinely undergo a price cut. There are often sizable discounts available on the base model as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best AirPods deals available, including those on the AirPods AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. We’ll also include options for the AirPods model with the wireless charging case, if that’s something you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2RS0YX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;The AirPods are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. They usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted. Right now, for instance, you can find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods for $119 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747976896193620917#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with a wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one thing: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature, but, thankfully, chargers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-PowerWave-Upgraded-Fast-Charging/dp/B07THHQMHM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt; are now relatively cheap. If you have no use for wireless charging, however, we recommend opting for the base AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but be on the lookout for deals that bring the price down to $150 or below. Right now, you can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747977841356115870#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the models above, offer noise cancellation, and support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, a feature Apple recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rolled out to Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;. We think they’re the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ci8unb"&gt;Thankfully, the AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their asking price of $249, and sometimes drop to as low as $180. The lowest price you can grab a pair for right now is $197 at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D0%26%26adid%3D22222222227317608597%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D395477009936%26wl4%3Dpla-834433976587%26wl5%3D9061079%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D8175035%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D520468661%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwr56IBhAvEiwA1fuqGoJTvXd60Wil7w2NpRvHJQwNPXUkWno3r0nNI2Z3XwNpX4tSWE601RoCuScQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or for $200 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1122332/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro%2F-%2FA-54191101" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdTSzD"&gt;If you want to get an Apple Care Plus protection plan for your wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1570785-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is also selling a bundle that includes both for $239&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, wrapped in aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max have been discounted to under $450 in the past, there are currently few notable sales to speak of. You can, however, pick up a pair at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747975436149246309#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; right now for $50 off, their typical sale price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alaska Airlines evacuated a plane after a phone burst into flame</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G5YjJhmNfJA9h6tw6r0fPt6jJfg=/0x32:1000x699/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69771584/2_210618_sunset_15.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alaska Airlines airplanes.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Alaska Airlines&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EgrbgQ"&gt;A cell phone caught fire in the cabin of an Alaska Airlines flight that had landed in Seattle from New Orleans on Monday evening. The phone was a Samsung Galaxy A21, Perry Cooper, a spokesperson for the Port of Seattle, &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/flight-to-seattle-evacuated-after-passengers-cellphone-catches-fire/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exEGF5"&gt;“After much digging, I can tell you that the phone was burned beyond recognition,” Cooper said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/em&gt;. “However, during an interview with one of our Port of Seattle Police officers, the passenger volunteered the phone was a Samsung Galaxy A21. Again, we could not confirm it by looking at the remains of the device.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aic3fY"&gt;Samsung did not immediately reply to a request for comment from The Verge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYxQMY"&gt;An Alaska Airlines spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the plane’s crew used fire extinguishers and a battery containment bag to “stop the phone from smoking.” Passengers were evacuated from the plane via the evacuation slides “due to hazy conditions inside the cabin,” and two of were treated at a local hospital, the spokesperson said. A Twitter user who said they were on the flight described the cabin as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Madddzh/status/1430070384670347264"&gt;“like a smoke machine.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XvBAZT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;That’s me on my phone on the right. The passenger was 2-3 rows behind me on the opposite side. It was like a smoke machine. Flight attendants did an excellent job and all passengers were very calm. I believe one person sitting beside them might have minor injuries.&lt;/p&gt;— Maddy Harrison (@Madddzh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Madddzh/status/1430070384670347264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F8tRtd"&gt;Passengers were taken by bus to the terminal, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/flySEA/status/1430032802825658374"&gt;according to a tweet by Seattle-Tacoma International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, and two passengers were treated at a local hospital, the Alaska Airlines spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6HKcR"&gt;While the situation may bring to mind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12767670/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-fire-risk"&gt;Samsung’s recall of the Galaxy Note 7&lt;/a&gt; over fears of exploding batteries, it’s unclear if there’s any sort of common defect with any model of the A21 just yet. There have been many isolated incidents of phone batteries catching fire across many different brands. As for why those batteries can catch fire, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/8/12841342/why-do-phone-batteries-explode-samsung-galaxy-note-7"&gt;here’s our explainer about why that happens&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FAA grants could clean up airport emissions </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Coronavirus Pandemic Causes Climate Of Anxiety And Changing Routines In America" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/72GPQJs7TAIymG3LQ8GHyV2A_PY=/0x0:5172x3448/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69771272/1220188719.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yv66Nv"&gt;The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is giving out more than $35 million in grants so that airports in the US can cut down their pollution, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=26463"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; today. Gas-burning vehicles that shuttle travelers and their luggage around airports and other on-the-ground equipment create emissions that worsen air quality and add to the climate crisis. Electrifying those operations could make travel at least a little more sustainable &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/faa-grants-airports-zero-emissions-c6dfadca-3257-448e-8612-4e8987503fc7.html"&gt;while the technology to clean up planes’ pollution is still nascent&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kXb20s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;$5.9 million will go towards “zero-emission” vehicles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="67gril"&gt;$5.9 million will go towards “zero-emission” vehicles and charging infrastructure. Charlotte/Douglas International Airport in North Carolina will get the biggest chunk of that change: $3.9 million for five electric shuttle buses. Three other airports in California, Indiana, and Ohio will also get new electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUDtMU"&gt;$14.5 million is earmarked for electric ramp equipment that services planes between flights and for systems that keep planes cool and provide power to them when their engines aren’t running. Pittsburgh International Airport, for example, will receive $4.6 million for 18 new units that pump temperature-controlled air into planes when their air conditioning systems are turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snP1AI"&gt;Louisville, Kentucky’s Muhammad Ali International Airport will receive a &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=26462"&gt;$10.6 million grant&lt;/a&gt; for a new geothermal system to heat and cool its terminal building. That system will replace gas-fired boilers, and slash pollution like soot, smog, and carbon monoxide, according to the FAA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNNfLw"&gt;The Biden administration has set a broader goal of making the nation’s power sector carbon-free by 2035. Meeting that goal will be key to gutting climate pollution in the US, which has the second-highest emissions in the world. It will be especially important as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22600226/bipartisan-infrastructure-plan-ev-charging-climate-change"&gt;transportation industry turns to electric vehicles to slash emissions&lt;/a&gt;, both at airports, and on the roads. Biden announced this month that he wants half of new cars sold in the US to be either &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22610501/biden-2030-ev-goal-trump-emissions-rollback"&gt;hybrid or all-electric by 2030&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="0C3G0D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even more cash could flow into airports soon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NVieva"&gt;Some of the FAA’s funding comes from the $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed in March. Even more cash could flow into airports soon. The bipartisan infrastructure package making its way through Congress includes $25 billion over five years for the nation’s air infrastructure. That bill is supposed to help airports take care of repair and maintenance backlogs and introduce new technology to cut pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0XWtN"&gt;Separately, the FAA also announced today that it set aside more than &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=26462"&gt;$22 million in grants&lt;/a&gt; that are supposed to make airports more accessible for people with disabilities. Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina plans to spend $16.4 million to expand its terminal with more gate seating, retail and restaurant space, and TSA screening areas that are ADA accessible. Fort Wayne International Airport will receive $6.1 million to expand its terminal and buy “hearing loop” technology that sends gate announcements straight to compatible hearing aid devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0xWtt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Conservative pranksters face $5 million proposed fine over robocalls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="robocall" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TDOjCvEp1nHKk9zmVfC_5bSsme0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69771062/DSCF2964.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JVzlyo"&gt;On Tuesday, the Federal Communications Commission proposed &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-375180A1.pdf"&gt;an over $5 million fine&lt;/a&gt; against conspiracy theorists and conservative activists John Burkman and Jacob Wohl for making hundreds of robocalls spreading 2020 election misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GP5nh"&gt;In its proposal, the FCC said that the agency is weighing a $5,134,500 fine against Burkman and Wohl for making over 1,100 robocalls in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA. The violating pre-recorded calls told voters that their personal information would be “part of a public database” that would be used by “police departments to track down old warrants and be used by credit card companies to collect outstanding debts” if they chose to vote by mail in the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bOZbX"&gt;It’s the largest TCPA fine the FCC has ever proposed, according to a press release from the agency Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bLlB0"&gt;Last October, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497823/jacob-wohl-jack-burkman-michigan-robocall-voter-intimidation-felony-charges"&gt;filed four felony charges&lt;/a&gt; against Burkman and Wohl, accusing the pair of discouraging Detroit residents from voting in the 2020 election. Specifically, the case accuses them of targeting voters in Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Illinois in around 85,000 calls last August. According to the Michigan Attorney General’s Office, the calls claimed to come from “Project 1599, a civil rights organization” founded by the pair and targeted areas with large populations of Black voters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCZvXd"&gt;“We remain committed to defending democracy against misinformation spread in an attempt to undermine our free and fair elections,” Nessel said in a statement earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3p4l7"&gt;A trial date &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/ag/0,4534,7-359-92297_47203-558712%E2%80%94,00.html"&gt;has not been set&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s OLED TV from my dreams reportedly delayed to 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vWJ1UQYTEcPA7RPZr9BxDJInNmw=/22x0:1030x672/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69770987/LG_Dolby_Vision_Gaming_02a.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XfIZuU"&gt;At CES 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224137/lg-display-42-inch-oled-tv-panel-announced"&gt;LG Display announced&lt;/a&gt; that it intended to produce a 42-inch OLED TV panel sometime in 2021. You weren’t alone if, like me, you got really excited, and also expected one of these more compact OLED panels to have already launched. That’s not happening this year, according to sources speaking to &lt;a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202108190017"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Korea Economic Daily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who say that the launch of LG’s planned 42-inch OLED TV has been pushed to 2022 instead, alongside the new 2022 TV lineup and debut at CES 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9AynW"&gt;The delay doesn’t seem to have been caused by issues with production, according to &lt;em&gt;The Korea Economic Daily. &lt;/em&gt;While its sources expected LG to launch the 42-inch in the second half of 2021 following mass production of the panels, they say the company switched the launch window to “maximize its marketing efforts rather than unveiling it later this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JVX2IBv3-2yRgRvXj0fJql5rzBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227031/44900793067647000_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;LG Display&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’d probably pose like this with an OLED if I owned one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z4WtQr"&gt;Compared to LG’s entry-level A1-series OLED TVs that have 60Hz displays, LG is apparently angling this new 42-inch model to fit in with its other high-end OLED TVs, like the OLED G1 evo and C1 lineups, despite its smaller size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYNtdq"&gt;If all of this pans out, it’ll ideally have a 120Hz refresh rate display with multiple HDMI 2.1 ports that allow 120 frames per second 4K gameplay (in games that support it) on PC, PS5, or Xbox Series X. It should also support variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low-latency mode, which are features that can make gaming look and feel smoother and more enjoyable. Though, with specs like that, I wouldn’t expect this to be a particularly affordable TV. The current 48-inch C1 was originally priced at $1,499.99 (but can currently be purchased for $1,299.99), so this smaller one will hopefully cost a little less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvXNZq"&gt;At 42 inches, this OLED panel isn’t going after the average TV viewer. This size straddles the line between TV and gaming monitor, and it seems ideal for gamers with desk space — and disposable income — to spare. There are plenty of big gaming monitor options north of $700 that offer competitive specs like HDMI 2.1 ports and VRR, but none that have a panel that can compete with the rich contrast, color accuracy, and brightness of an OLED. Well, except for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382201/gigabyte-aorus-4k-gaming-monitor-tv-oled"&gt;Gigabyte’s $1,500 Aorus FO48U gaming monitor&lt;/a&gt;. Okay, &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/b52e629c-c63e-4d6b-877d-6dff584c7863"&gt;the $2,500 curved Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is rad&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nRTH9t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to LG for confirmation of this alleged delay, and whether it can confirm if the TV will appear at CES 2022 next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung will let you unlock your Z Fold 3’s bootloader, but at the cost of your cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/knM-Jr7vnUGfjkP4IUKRywCWjMk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69770961/dbohn_210820_4722_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jPLB9Z"&gt;Samsung seems to be trying to discourage users from modifying the software on their new Galaxy Z Fold 3s, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-unlock-bootloader-broken-camera/"&gt;giving them a message&lt;/a&gt; that unlocking the phone’s bootloader will render the phone’s cameras unusable (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/08/24/samsung-cripples-the-galaxy-z-fold3-if-you-unlock-the-bootloader/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/11/20/unlocking-bootloader-sony-phones-no-longer-wrecks-camera-pie/"&gt;isn’t the first time&lt;/a&gt; we’ve seen phone manufacturers pull this sort of trick, but it seems to represent an escalation in Samsung’s fight against its users who want to gain complete control over their phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJ7TsX"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/unlocking-bootloader-will-disable-the-camera.4321957/"&gt;XDA Forums user confirms&lt;/a&gt; that after unlocking the bootloader, the Z Fold 3’s cameras were completely non-functional: facial recognition, loading the camera app, and trying third-party camera apps all failed for them. The user reports that re-locking the bootloader made the cameras work again. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LvBdSg7b7QZMbhQfWtdtpKa3zOE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803288/20210820_121528.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/unlocking-bootloader-will-disable-the-camera.4321957/#post-85506611" target="_blank"&gt;白い熊 on XDA Forums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The message shown to users trying to unlock their bootloader.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HvNHFu"&gt;According to a photo (seen above) posted by a member of the forums, the message users receive when trying to unlock their Z Fold 3’s bootloader reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ote4a"&gt;Unlock the bootloader to install custom operating system software. Doing so will cause the camera to be disabled and may cause your phone or apps to stop working correctly. To prevent unauthorized access to your personal data, your phone will be factory reset, which will erase all data, including files and downloaded apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XK1Fmd"&gt;Volume up: Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cw29iv"&gt;Unlock bootloader (may void warranty)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seJ0cP"&gt;Volume down: No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpUVLP"&gt;Do not unlock bootloader and restart phone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3vtrq1"&gt;(A factory reset is &lt;a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/239798/how-to-unlock-your-android-phones-bootloader-the-official-way/"&gt;generally standard&lt;/a&gt; after a bootloader unlock, as is the possibility of a voided warranty.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsQDBi"&gt;While this may be an escalation, Samsung has previously had a somewhat unfriendly stance towards modders. &lt;a href="https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/faqs/faq-115013719548.htm"&gt;Samsung’s Knox documentation says that&lt;/a&gt;, if you root your phone and flash it with an unofficial Android build, anything having to do with its Knox security will &lt;a href="https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/faqs/faq-115013562087.htm"&gt;be permanently disabled&lt;/a&gt;, and will only be restored if you replace the phone’s hardware. This means that, if you root a Samsung phone, features like Samsung Pay and Secure Folder won’t ever work again. To be clear, this doesn’t happen if you just unlock your phone’s bootloader — it only occurs after you make changes to the phone’s OS (though doing so is the main reason to unlock your bootloader, so it’s perhaps a distinction without much difference).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xiX36T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving up your cameras seems like an unreasonable ask&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yCF0eD"&gt;While that’s certainly more destructive and permanent, you could also argue that it’s not unreasonable to give up Samsung Pay and Secure Folder if you really want root access to your phone. Giving up your ability to take pictures is a much bigger ask. Plus, unless Samsung’s changed how Knox works, rooting your Fold 3 after unlocking it will also shut down those features, leaving you with a phone that has no cameras, no NFC payment, and no Secure Folder (not that you could take any sensitive pictures anyways). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FElkUr"&gt;There are some ways in which turning off features for rooted users makes sense. In the case of Knox, the phone doesn’t know what code is running on the phone, so it can’t make any promises of security. In the same vein, it wouldn’t be unreasonable if Samsung didn’t let you use the Fold 3’s &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00062630/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;facial recognition unlock feature&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s hard to see how turning off the cameras entirely is anything but a punishment for users who want to mod their phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BDAExV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to see how turning off the cameras entirely is anything but a punishment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RxYodS"&gt;If you’re a US-based Samsung customer, though, you’d have to try a lot harder to even run into these issues — because Samsung reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.thecustomdroid.com/sampwnd-unlock-bootloader-samsung-snapdragon/"&gt;doesn’t officially allow bootloader unlocking&lt;/a&gt; on Snapdragon-based phones sold in the US. There are services you can pay for that claim to unlock your US phone’s bootloader, but it’s not &lt;a href="https://www.hardreset.info/devices/samsung/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2/faq/bootloader-unlock/"&gt;the relatively simple process&lt;/a&gt; found on the global version of the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hP20J"&gt;At the moment, it’s unclear whether the Galaxy Z Flip 3 will also have the same limitation, though one of XDA Forums’ members &lt;a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/unlocking-bootloader-will-disable-the-camera.4321957/page-2#post-85526781"&gt;posted a picture of the unlock bootloader screen on their Flip&lt;/a&gt; and the notice doesn’t mention the cameras. Samsung didn’t immediately answer &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s questions about whether the policy also applied to the Flip, or provide a statement about the policy in general.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="rOrmEZ"&gt;Twitter is experimenting with a way to make it easier to find Spaces that you might be interested in.

&lt;p id="PU2twZ"&gt;Twitter has already been surfacing Spaces in that top bar (where you might have also seen Fleets before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;Twitter shut them down&lt;/a&gt;), but previously, it only showed Spaces from people you follow who were &lt;em&gt;hosting&lt;/em&gt; the social audio rooms. Now, though, you might also see when somebody you follow is tuning into one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AIW7E5"&gt;

&lt;p id="jZSyAQ"&gt;If you don’t want your followers to know what Spaces you’re attending, you can turn that off by navigating to the “Settings and privacy” menu, then “Privacy and safety,” and then toggling off the option to “allow followers to see which Spaces you’re listening to.” Turning this off won’t hide your presence inside Spaces, though. If you’re attending a Space, the people in the room with you will still be able to see that you’re there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaC8XG"&gt;Just last week, Twitter added another way to make Spaces more discoverable by making it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631036/twitter-spaces-developers-api-v2"&gt;easier for other apps to point to Spaces&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also continuing to iterate on the experience of being in a Space, adding the ability &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611609/twitter-spaces-co-host-feature-moderate-manage-social-audio-rooms"&gt;for Spaces hosts to designate up to two co-hosts&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is forcing the popular Groovy Discord music bot offline</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oEXBkWIjsMe87-WEvXlW4S0ORK8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69770729/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YqxuLA"&gt;Google-owned YouTube is starting to crack down on Discord music bots. The search giant has sent a cease and desist to the owners of the popular Groovy Bot, which lets Discord users play music from YouTube videos and is installed on more than 16 million Discord servers. Google wants the service gone within seven days, and Groovy is complying by shutting down its bot on August 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yB2X5"&gt;Google confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it took action in this case: “We notified Groovy about violations of our Terms of Service, including modifying the service and using it for commercial purposes,” a YouTube spokesperson writes, adding that its APIs are for developers who comply with its terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W01GSq"&gt;“Groovy has been a huge part of my life over the past five years. It started because my friend’s bot sucked and I thought I could make a better one,” says Nik Ammerlaan, Groovy Bot owner, in a message announcing the closure. The Groovy Bot sources music from YouTube and allows Discord users to play and share it in servers where the bot is installed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BxiRZ"&gt;Groovy Bot allows for a social listening party on Discord, largely using the audio from YouTube videos. It has become hugely popular over the past five years, with &lt;a href="https://tinelund.dk/groovy-bot-the-best-music-bot-for-discord-groovy-15/"&gt;some estimates&lt;/a&gt; suggesting it has more than 250 million users. It has now caught the attention of Google and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zNUjSM6-Hhbdh3vEJR_x10w1Ggw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803360/99nShh7.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Groovy Bot service will end later this month.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fkw0fF"&gt;“I’m not sure why they decided to send it [a cease and desist] now,” says Ammerlaan in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “They probably just didn’t know about it, to be honest.” Ammerlaan admits Groovy Bot has been a “huge weight” on his shoulders over the past five years, and that Google’s actions were always something he saw coming. “It was just a matter of seeing when it would happen,” says Ammerlaan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3oiVH"&gt;While Groovy Bot supports Spotify, YouTube, Soundcloud, and other services, “something like 98 percent of the tracks played on Groovy were from YouTube,” admits Ammerlaan. Google’s move to force Groovy Bot offline could mean we’ll now see similar action against other Discord bot owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8S2XK"&gt;Rythm, the most popular Discord music bot, is still standing strong... for now. “We don’t currently plan to shut down,” a Rythm bot co-owner, Jet, wrote in a message to its community of users. Rythm is installed on nearly 20 million Discord servers and says it has more than 560 million users as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOQy1T"&gt;We tried to reach out to one of the owners of Rythm, but after initially responding the owner didn’t respond to requests about whether Google had issued a cease and desist. If Google isn’t happy with Groovy Bot, then it’s hard to imagine it’s going to let Rythm continue, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xuVVJV"&gt;Groovy Bot shutting down comes just weeks after several YouTube video downloading sites have disappeared randomly. The removal of this bot also leaves a giant hole in Discord’s bot offerings. “We take the rights of others seriously and require developers who create bots for Discord to do the same,” says a Discord spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If a bot running on Discord violates someone else’s rights, that third party or Discord may take action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBtHY1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 7:32 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Google’s confirmation and statement that it told Groovy that it violates YouTube’s terms of service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart is launching a new white label delivery service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OG9w12n4b0isSU-v35v1RKq3C8E=/11x0:856x563/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69770424/WalmartGoLocal.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Walmart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M05JKc"&gt;Walmart plans to offer its logistics and delivery services to other companies as part of a new last-mile delivery business, &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/08/24/walmart-launches-walmart-golocal-a-new-delivery-as-a-service-business"&gt;the company announced on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The service, called Walmart GoLocal&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;hopes to serve as a white label delivery offering for businesses big and small, and yet another way for Walmart to try to edge out Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JswpFg"&gt;Details on Walmart GoLocal are fairly sparse, though Walmart does say the service will be “competitively priced” and that it has “already established a number of contractual agreements with national and enterprise retail clients.” Walmart tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;pricing will be based on “the needs of the client and based on what they want to offer to their customers.” &lt;a href="https://one.walmart.com/content/go-local/home-page.html"&gt;The GoLocal website&lt;/a&gt; offers a few more details: customers will order directly from a small business, that business’s platform will ping Walmart, Walmart GoLocal will dispatch a delivery driver, and then collect relevant feedback to give to the business. It’s not a wholly unusual setup, both &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpostmates.com%2Fdeveloper&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F24%2F22639778%2Fwalmart-golocal-delivery-service-small-business-drones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Postmates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://get.doordash.com/en-us/products/drive"&gt;DoorDash&lt;/a&gt; offer white label solutions that work more or less the same. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o1B7G5jUzR-WCJmmxF1Yd4hHa3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803050/Screenshot_2021_08_24_11.10.06_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Walmart&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The basic flow of a Walmart GoLocal order.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gDMCUv"&gt;One difference in Walmart’s version is its driver pool. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/with-holidays-around-corner-walmart-starts-last-mile-delivery-service-2021-08-24/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the drivers delivering for Walmart GoLocal customers will be pulled from the company’s Spark delivery service. Walmart piloted Spark &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17828028/walmart-partners-bringg-logistics-platform-grocery-delivery"&gt;as a sort of Uber for grocery delivery&lt;/a&gt; — Instacart, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363507/walmart-instacart-partnership-same-day-grocery-delivery-amazon-whole-foods-rivalry"&gt;another Walmart partner&lt;/a&gt;, is a good analog — but opening them up to non-Walmart deliveries (and non-food deliveries) could make Spark work a lot more like a white label &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/29/9413787/amazon-flex-package-delivery-seattle"&gt;Amazon Flex&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8PDkm"&gt;Walmart claims it will also make deliveries via drone or autonomous vehicle depending on the size of the delivery and the location. &lt;a href="https://dronedj.com/2021/08/24/walmart-delivery-drone-golocal/"&gt;As noted by DroneDJ&lt;/a&gt;, Walmart’s investment &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/06/17/walmart-invests-in-droneup-the-nationwide-on-demand-drone-delivery-provider"&gt;in DroneUp’s 10,000 Federal Aviation Administration certified pilots&lt;/a&gt; will probably help with the drone part of the equation. Delivery by autonomous car might similarly be supported by another Walmart investment — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557603/cruise-walmart-autonomous-vehicles-delivery-arizona"&gt;Cruise’s self-driving electric cars&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KJP2E"&gt;GoLocal, Spark, DroneUp, and the rest are a mess of brand names and business investments, but further proof of all the bets Walmart is placing on mastering delivery before Amazon becomes the de facto standard. Not every one of Walmart’s moves against tech giants like Amazon or Netflix have worked out — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21228486/fandango-vudu-streaming-purchase-walmart-comcast-nbcuniversal-amazon-itunes"&gt;see the sale of Vudu to Fandango&lt;/a&gt; — but with last-mile delivery, Walmart is at least playing in a space it's already familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
