    <title>YouTube TV loses ESPN, other Disney networks after failing to reach new deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IIpNoJ"&gt;YouTube TV has failed to reach an eleventh-hour deal with Disney to keep more than a dozen Disney-owned channels on the live TV streaming service. As of December 18th, popular networks including ESPN and ABC have been removed from the service. As promised, YouTube TV has dropped its subscription to $50 per month as a direct result of the lost programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RmJt1"&gt;Disney said in a statement late Friday that after ongoing negotiations with YouTube TV, “they have declined to reach a fair deal with us based on market terms and conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59idpb"&gt;“As a result, their subscribers have lost access to our unrivaled portfolio of networks including live sports and news plus kids, family and general entertainment programming from ABC, the ESPN networks, the Disney channels, Freeform, the FX networks and the National Geographic channels,” the company added. “We stand ready to reach an equitable agreement with Google as quickly as possible in order to minimize the inconvenience to YouTube TV viewers by restoring our networks. We hope Google will join us in that effort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yybvk"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-disney-programming-update/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube TV said it would “continue conversations with Disney to advocate on your behalf in hopes of restoring their content on YouTube TV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SL1MYp"&gt;“We’ve held good faith negotiations with Disney for several months,” YouTube TV said. “Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we’ve been unable to reach an equitable agreement before our existing one expired, and their channels are no longer available on YouTube TV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEBkGZ"&gt;The announcement follows a notice shared with subscribers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22833849/youtube-tv-disney-carrier-dispute-abc-news-espn-december-17"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; that the channels could vanish from YouTube TV on Friday, December 17th if a deal was not reached between the two companies. Should negotiations have failed, YouTube TV said it would lower its price by $15 a month from its normal price of $65 per month to compensate for the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68xPDf"&gt;Earlier this week, a positive resolution to the service loss seemed likely. For one, the service told subscribers in an email on Monday that the House of Mouse “is an important partner for us,” adding that it hoped to negotiate a deal with Disney “provided we can reach equitable terms.” But the companies failed to reach a deal as their current agreement lapsed after December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAjBqy"&gt;The loss of over a dozen channels doesn’t exactly help YouTube TV remain competitive against other internet cable services like Hulu with Live TV or Fubo TV. Not only are a dozen-plus channels getting wiped from service, but the list of Disney-owned properties that would be axed is extensive, including not only Disney channels but FX, ESPN, and National Geographic channels as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mt6lX8"&gt;The full list of channels that left because a deal was not reached include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="kSVKDl"&gt;Your local ABC channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gFaE4O"&gt;ABC News Live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="72HTNZ"&gt;Disney Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ewvx48"&gt;Disney Junior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pZSi1J"&gt;Disney XD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iqBij3"&gt;Freeform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8KgIcc"&gt;FX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U7e16Q"&gt;FXX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5zOJgq"&gt;FXM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XlAuvW"&gt;National Geographic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vWgOJw"&gt;National Geographic Wild&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eHN7rI"&gt;ESPN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="38eRKt"&gt;ESPN2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cgi7xm"&gt;ESPN3 (by authentication to the ESPN app)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="I7dODa"&gt;ESPNU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XwESS1"&gt;ESPNEWS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1o3Azw"&gt;SEC Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SKLTHR"&gt;ACC Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Kw6GWW"&gt;Carriage disputes are frustratingly common in our new streaming landscape, and they often play out publicly before a resolution is reached — as was the case recently with YouTube TV and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22701682/youtube-tv-reaches-deal-nbcuniversal-carriage-channels"&gt;NBCUniversal-owned channels&lt;/a&gt;. Less frequently, two parties &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495642/youtube-tv-fox-regional-sports-networks-streaming-sinclair-mlb-nhl-nba"&gt;fail to reach a deal&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s the consumer who winds up paying the price by having to shop around for a new provider if they want support for their favorite programming.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s new flagship soundbar shoots voices up in the air so you can hear</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZwFXRCFQPqTEb2RB9xSi_B1gnfY=/201x0:2360x1439/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70290131/LG_Soundbar_01_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q4EGjE"&gt;LG has &lt;a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/12/new-premium-soundbar-from-lg-delivers-next-level-audio-for-todays-at-home-lifestyle/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new 9.1.5-channel Dolby Atmos and DTS:X soundbar featuring a novel upward firing center speaker that bounces dialogue off the celling and to your ears so you can hear clearly. While up-firing drivers are a big part of how soundbars produce surround sound in general — it’s one of five here — LG claims the up-firing center is a world-first. The soundbar also includes a pair of wireless rear speakers that can now additionally send audio to the side walls of the room, which could also increase the audio immersion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htKUdc"&gt;It’s important to note that the new up-firing center speaker is still the same channel as the regular center, but adds to the clarity of dialogue. Same goes for the two extra side-firing drivers of the rear speaker pair; it’s the same channel as the side speakers of the soundbar. LG claims its AI Room Calibration can auto configure the timings of each speaker and sync up everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twPfQw"&gt;This new LG soundbar (model S95QR), its rear speakers, and the included wireless subwoofer collectively have a power output of 810W. With both Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, the LG S95QR is positioned as a premium soundbar and a successor to the 7.1.4-channel LG SP11RA soundbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwytbA"&gt;Unfortunately, the new soundbar — like its predecessor — still does not support passthrough for 4K 120Hz with HDR. If you have a newer 4K HDR TV and a Series X or PS5, you might not want to plug your game console directly into the bar. You should still get the benefit of Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) support, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5wYI3_XusYjSkKM1Sj105R5c2LE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23110301/Screen_Shot_2021_12_17_at_5.45.37_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A visual representation of LG’s 7.1.4-channel soundbar configuration. To get to 9.1.5, imagine a third wave firing up from the soundbar (center) and two waves shooting from the rear speakers to the left/right walls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SXarET"&gt;The soundbar also supports Auto Low-Latency Mode (ALLM) and can be controlled using smart devices with Google Assistant, Alexa, and “other AI assistants”. The older LG SP11RA soundbar had AirPlay 2 support and could be controlled using Siri, but it’s not clear from LG’s press release if the new soundbar also features it (but we’re hopeful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGcPyK"&gt;LG also says there’s support for its Wowcast Wi-Fi audio dongle, which was originally released this past fall, and is available on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fuk%2Fspeakers-sound-systems%2Flg-wtp3%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F17%2F22841919%2Flg-s95qr-soundbar-ces-2022-with-upward-firing-center-channel" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s UK page&lt;/a&gt;. The Wowcast is a device that makes the soundbar wireless, for situations where running a cable between the TV and the soundbar would be difficult. It mounts behind your TV and can stream an HDMI eARC connection between it and the soundbar. LG says the Wowcast will be sold separately, so we expect a US release alongside the new soundbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAQwLP"&gt;LG did not share a price or release date for the new LG S95QR, though. The soundbar will be among the first of the company’s products being announced and displayed in its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fglobal%2Fces2022&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F17%2F22841919%2Flg-s95qr-soundbar-ces-2022-with-upward-firing-center-channel" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;virtual CES 2022 booth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adidas sold more than $22 million in NFTs, but it hit a few snags along the way</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WTy1vLBVc8MzwKRJ1rOen5iwrDY=/30x0:813x522/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70289854/Screen_Shot_2021_12_17_at_5.28.28_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adidas’ NFTs were quite popular.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Adidas&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CsP7xb"&gt;All 30,000 of Adidas’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22822143/adidas-nft-launch-into-the-metaverse-price-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Into the Metaverse&lt;/em&gt; NFTs&lt;/a&gt; were minted within a matter of hours of going on sale Friday. Each NFT cost 0.2 ETH, which currently equates to about $765, and the company sold 29,620 NFTs (“Adidas and partners” held onto 380 for “future events”), meaning the company earned more than $22 million from the sales in the span of an afternoon. (The price of Ethereum has been falling while writing this story, making an exact number difficult to pinpoint.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7iQWg"&gt;Adidas made the NFTs in partnership with Bored Ape Yacht Club, Punks Comics, and GMoney (a pseudonymous crypto enthusiast). Buying an NFT gives owners access to special physical goods, like a hoodie and the tracksuit worn by the Bored Ape that Adidas owns, and upcoming digital experiences. However, the physical merch won’t be available until 2022, &lt;a href="https://adidas.njih.net/c/482924/264102/4270?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adidas.com%2Finto_the_metaverse%2Ffaq&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to Adidas’ FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, so buyers essentially just put in expensive pre-orders for the clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zqjO1H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Adidas offered 20,000 NFTs in early access&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vmo3Ld"&gt;The company offered 20,000 of the NFTs in early access to people who own special Adidas Originals tokens, GMoney tokens, Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs, and Pixel Vault NFTs — making an already hard-to-get NFT available first to a very limited set of people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRH3J0"&gt;Early access minting began &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adidasoriginals/status/1471909577658675204"&gt;shortly before 1:30PM ET&lt;/a&gt;, but Adidas quickly hit an issue with Mutant Ape Yacht Club owners not being able to mint the NFTs that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adidasoriginals/status/1471914441591640065"&gt;forced it to pause&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adidasoriginals/status/1471938993797632000"&gt;Adidas has promised&lt;/a&gt; to reimburse everyone who lost gas fees (which are fees taken in order to mint the NFT) while there were problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ALxRQ"&gt;Early access &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adidasoriginals/status/1471958608363589637"&gt;resumed at 5PM ET&lt;/a&gt;, and public minting &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adidasoriginals/status/1471978538635087875"&gt;kicked off at 6PM ET&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear exactly when the NFTs were fully sold out, but Adidas’ website showed that &lt;a href="https://adidas.njih.net/c/482924/264102/4270?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adidas.com%2Finto_the_metaverse%2Fmint&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;all the NFTs had been minted&lt;/a&gt; minutes after the public sale began. However, one person &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UntagP/status/1471986754588581890"&gt;was apparently&lt;/a&gt; able to mint many of the NFTs, which may have disrupted how many were actually available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GY9GPM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;All &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adidasoriginals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@adidasoriginals&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gmoneyNFT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@gmoneyNFT&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/punkscomic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@punkscomic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BoredApeYC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BoredApeYC&lt;/a&gt; Into the Metaverse NFTs have now been minted&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The official link to purchase the NFT on the secondary market is: &lt;a href="https://t.co/PAJs82Jyib"&gt;https://t.co/PAJs82Jyib&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks again for your patience today&lt;/p&gt;— adidas Originals (@adidasoriginals) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adidasoriginals/status/1471985083280199680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fxNyFn"&gt;It’s unclear if Adidas plans to offer more NFTs in the future, but it teases on its website that &lt;a href="https://adidas.njih.net/c/482924/264102/4270?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adidas.com%2Finto_the_metaverse&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“this is just the beginning.”&lt;/a&gt; Given how quickly the first batch sold out — and how much money Adidas made in just a few hours — it seems unlikely this will be the only NFT offering from the apparel maker. And it will almost certainly want to compete against archrival Nike, which just bought a company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22833369/nike-rtfkt-nft-sneaker-shoe-metaverse-company"&gt;that makes virtual shoes and NFTs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBZ0yV"&gt;Other companies may also be looking at the success of Adidas’ NFTs with dollar signs in their eyes, but before they rush to the nearest blockchain, they might want to consider the cautionary tale of the planned NFTs for &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.K.E.R. 2&lt;/em&gt;. Developer GSC Game World announced the NFTs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22834567/stalker-2-nfts-metahuman-dmarket"&gt;on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; but received swift backlash from fans. The developers tried to lower the heat by tweeting out an explanation on Thursday, but it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840383/stalker-2-developer-explain-nfts-gsc-game-world-deleted-tweet"&gt;quickly deleted that&lt;/a&gt; before announcing it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840488/stalker-2-nft-metahuman-gsc-web3-canceled"&gt;canceling its NFT plans altogether&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnEGuh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TyvuQU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The story of Elizabeth Holmes now belongs to the jury  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lawyers Make Closing Arguments In Elizabeth Holmes Theranos Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v1GcW8yIpkP_D9N2x6QhiDdO4nY=/0x80:3883x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70289827/1359543294.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;They’ll decide whether or not she was the one in control&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="hHNPqT"&gt;From the beginning, Elizabeth Holmes knew how to tell a good story. She launched her blood testing company, Theranos, with a tale of a powerful vision to revolutionize health care and change an old, outdated industry. She presented herself as Steve Jobs, part two. She sketched out a picture of someone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22820995/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-testimony-defense-abuse"&gt;in control.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdIYI2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That &lt;/em&gt;Holmes, and that story, is what prosecutor John Bostic worked to reset back to during his rebuttal argument, the last word before the case went to the jury on Friday afternoon. It wasn’t reasonable to think the CEO of a company didn’t know exactly what impression she was giving to investors, Bostic said. It was clear she &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692600/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-bad-tests-complaints"&gt;knew about problems&lt;/a&gt; with the Theranos tests. Holmes knew that the technology wasn’t working as intended, and that Theranos might not be able to change the world. When that story started to fall apart, she tried anything she could to try and keep it together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Qm4ZPT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We admire people who set ambitious goals and set out to achieve them”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N1sQh3"&gt;“We admire people who set ambitious goals and set out to achieve them,” Bostic said. “Instead, we see a CEO of a company so desperate for success, so afraid of failure, that she was willing to do anything to keep that company from failing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S49S1i"&gt;But in the closing arguments of her trial for fraud, which wrapped up Friday, her defense attorney Kevin Downey also told a story. This story was about a well-meaning CEO who trusted what experts told her, who didn’t know about problems at her company, and who couldn’t be faulted if people misinterpreted the things she told them about Theranos. It relied on undercutting the origin story in order to convince the jury that she wasn’t guilty of the charges against her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgLX0c"&gt;To find her guilty of those charges — wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud — the jury has to believe Holmes &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; to give people misleading information about what the Theranos technology could do. That intent matters, Downey stressed through his closing arguments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvrHA0"&gt;Figuring out that intent takes getting inside Holmes’ head during the times she lied or said things that could be misleading. When Holmes told investors and reporters that the Theranos devices could run hundreds of accurate tests, Downey said she actually was referring to what the company was going to be able to do in the future, on future iterations of the Theranos device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJQl93"&gt;And when Holmes told investor Bryan Tolbert, vice president of finance for Texas-based Hall Group, that the company was “doing a lot of work” with the military, she didn’t mean that Theranos devices were actively in use in the military — just that the company was working towards that goal. (Investors say Holmes told them the company’s devices were used in Afghanistan and on medevacs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYqIG9"&gt;If investors got the wrong idea, well, that was because they misinterpreted things, Downey said. And, even if they did misinterpret things, that didn’t actually matter, he said. Those types of statements from Holmes weren’t why investors decided to give Theranos money. Holmes and the things she said weren’t actually that critical to the decision making process, Downey said. Investors just cared that Theranos had a partnership with Walgreens. (Multiple investors said they trusted the stories Holmes told them about Theranos’ capabilities.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvmLdo"&gt;Holmes also couldn’t be responsible for any problems with the Theranos technology, Downey said. Other people were responsible — like former Theranos lab director &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692600/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-bad-tests-complaints"&gt;Adam Rosendorff&lt;/a&gt;. Holmes thought the tests were accurate. She saw positive reviews from satisfied customers, and the company apologized any time there was an error. She had no reason to think there were any issues that she needed to be concerned about, Downey said. (In fact, Theranos’ scientists repeatedly flagged serious issues to Holmes in emails revealed throughout the trial.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEVD0T"&gt;Holmes didn’t behave as someone who had something to hide, Downey said. She hired a high-profile board of directors — a former secretary of state, a former senator, a retired Marine Corps four-star general. She allowed people from drug companies and academic institutions to scrutinize her company’s tech. She gave information to the Food and Drug Administration. And, when news reports and a federal investigation found problems with her labs, she doubled down on work to figure out what went wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="nc5MxE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You know that at the first sign of trouble, crooks cash out, criminals cover up, and rats flee a sinking ship”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bqsetv"&gt;“You know that at the first sign of trouble, crooks cash out, criminals cover up, and rats flee a sinking ship,” Downey said. But Holmes was a devoted CEO who believed that her company was going to change the world. Instead of running, she brought in experts to scrutinize the testing program, Downey noted. “Are those the actions of someone who had been engaged in a conspiracy to defraud people?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BunTUQ"&gt;There are versions of Holmes everywhere: there’s the one she offered in media interviews, the ones sketched out in podcasts, the one that will be fictionalized in the upcoming Hulu series. Over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684354/elizabeth-holmes-trial-wire-fraud-theranos"&gt;past three months,&lt;/a&gt; there have been two more, presented by prosecutors and defense attorneys. Now, those versions go to the jurors. It’s up to them to decide which story is the closest to reality — and if that reality is criminal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3eKKt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVpOmB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yVVGM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Movie theaters are breaking records thanks to Spider-Man, even as omicron spreads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jvpiDI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; eclipsed previous box office records on its first night at some of the biggest theater chains in the nation. That’s big news for theaters whose continued existence seemed under threat at the start of the pandemic, and it suggests moviegoers’ interest hasn’t yet changed dramatically in response to the latest COVID variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLWODg"&gt;AMC announced Friday that roughly &lt;a href="https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2021/AMC-Theatres-Eclipses-Box-Office-Records-With-SPIDER-MAN-NO-WAY-HOME-Achieving-Highest-December-Opening-Night-Ever-and-Second-Highest-Opening-Night-of-All-Time-/default.aspx"&gt;1.1 million moviegoers&lt;/a&gt; attended the opening night of &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt;, making it the highest-grossing opening night for a December title in AMC’s history. Cinemark &lt;a href="https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2021/AMC-Theatres-Eclipses-Box-Office-Records-With-SPIDER-MAN-NO-WAY-HOME-Achieving-Highest-December-Opening-Night-Ever-and-Second-Highest-Opening-Night-of-All-Time-/default.aspx"&gt;called the film’s debut&lt;/a&gt; its “best opening night of all time.” And Regal said the film became its second-highest Thursday box office title in its history and &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spider-man-no-way-home-swings-into-regal-with-second-biggest-thursday-ever-with-imax-4dx-screenx-and-rpx-outperforming-301447693.html"&gt;shattered records&lt;/a&gt; for IMAX, 4DX, ScreenX, and RPX formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biQ1xt"&gt;“The anticipation for &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; has completely exceeded our expectations,” Mooky Greidinger, CEO of Regal parent Cineworld, said in a statement. “We are just as excited as our moviegoers to see our favorite webslinger back on the big screen at Regal and we would like to thank our friends at Sony for delivering another amazing tentpole.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWWJ75"&gt;Justin McDaniel, Cinemark SVP of global content, said that the number of moviegoers who flocked to the premiere “underscores the irreplaceable value of the in-theatre experience, which we are thrilled to continue to offer in collaboration with our studio partners.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDVrcF"&gt;While the film is &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/12/spider-man-no-way-home-50m-preview-easily-pandemic-record-all-time-for-sony-100m-friday-likely-1234898486/"&gt;expected to perform well&lt;/a&gt; heading into the weekend, it’s unclear what effect the omicron variant will have on &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;’s performance going forward. Much is still unknown about the variant, such as whether omicron causes more severe illness or death than the original virus and the Delta variant, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/omicron-variant.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. However, breakthrough cases in those who are vaccinated are expected to happen, the agency said, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22814974/anime-nyc-omicron-case-coronavirus-covid-19-superspreader"&gt;examples of which&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/buzzfeed-staffers-test-positive-for-covid-19-following-holiday-party-2021-12"&gt;we’ve already seen&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ExXJd"&gt;Also unclear is how theaters plan to navigate the omicron variant’s spread. None of the major US distributors returned &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s requests for comment on Thursday about moviegoer safety protocols and whether exhibition delays and closures could be imminent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsH36k"&gt;Given the unknowns, it’s a bit early for theaters to be taking another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641318/hybrid-film-releases-cinemacon-theater-exclusivity"&gt;pandemic victory lap&lt;/a&gt; — shattered records or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How panic over rumored school shooting threats went viral</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hV6pQb55XUNTDEhrDCa7M4IcRRQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70289525/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Videos warning of attacks on schools spread across the US, but nobody can pinpoint where the rumors started&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="er1mQb"&gt;For many students across the US, what should have been the last day of school before winter break instead became a day filled with fear and rumors of imminent danger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i15EIB"&gt;On Thursday, officials across the country were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840621/tiktok-december-17-school-threats-district-cancellations-alleged-shootings"&gt;responding&lt;/a&gt; to viral posts on social media saying schools would be the target of shootings on December 17th. Some canceled classes or allowed kids to stay home. Others said they would increase police presence on campus. And some simply said they were monitoring the situation. But just about everyone was united in one message: the threats officials were hearing about were deemed to be not credible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJVssi"&gt;TikTok, meanwhile, was awash in videos: “POV your parents are making you stay home because of the December 17th trend,” reads one post. “Guys stay safe; I’m staying home,” says another. “Hope everybody is okay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="iI6O5a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Adult society has always been concerned about how new media ... [is] going to corrupt young, impressionable minds”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SFAUIs"&gt;Now into Friday afternoon, there thankfully haven’t been reports of widespread violence at schools, and TikTok has begun to remove some of the more alarming warnings on its platform about the potential for violence. But it’s still unknown where the warnings started — or if threats of violence even existed in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GncPLi"&gt;It’s easy to see how the concern spread, though, since people who saw warnings of school violence on TikTok were likely primed to react. The rumors were spreading just weeks after a deadly school attack. And viral threats have a history of taking hold when they prey on what people worry about the most, especially when the source is thought to be a new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWIfR2"&gt;“We can think about media panics going back several centuries, potentially, but at least over the past 100 years,” James Walsh, associate professor at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, who has written about social media and societal panic, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Adult society has always been concerned about how new media content or new media technologies are going to corrupt young, impressionable minds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPx1Zf"&gt;To understand how unfounded rumors can spread so effectively, experts say it’s important to look at the context. Walsh says the recent attack at Oxford High School is likely top of mind for many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CzDNQ"&gt;“Some of the specifics of the Oxford High case may be driving the panic as well, given that it sounds like a pretty clear case of institutional failure where all the signs were there but not enough action was taken in advance,” Walsh says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lKI0uz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're taking the TikTok “challenge” seriously. Challenge encourages students to make violent threats on schools on Fri, 12/17. Proactive policing can be expected w/ marked squads and an increased police presence at all &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ISD728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ISD728&lt;/a&gt; schools, despite having no specific threats reported. &lt;a href="https://t.co/n1CpmKe8lR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/n1CpmKe8lR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elk River Police Department (@elkriverpolice) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elkriverpolice/status/1471860298395136001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qrU1K6"&gt;And compared to viral challenges like students &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/18/health/devious-licks-tiktok-challenge-wellness/index.html"&gt;vandalizing bathrooms&lt;/a&gt;, the gravity of a school shooting is significant. The need to respond to a potential threat, even without definitive evidence, may take precedence. “I’m always hesitant to close because we’ve learned school in-person is the most effective thing but not at the risk of student or staff safety,” says Jake Langlais, superintendent of Lewiston Public Schools in Maine, which closed down on Friday after receiving reports of a threat on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gea1L2"&gt;Possible threats take hold even without concrete proof because they often touch on people’s legitimate fears, says Christine Elgersma, senior editor of social media and learning resources at Common Sense Media. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18244890/momo-youtube-news-hoax-demonetization-comments-kids"&gt;Momo hoax&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, for example, preyed on parents worried about suicide and was amplified by celebrities, police, and schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZGF4B"&gt;“We don’t really know where they originated or how valid they are,” Elgersma says of viral threats. “And we still feel compelled to amplify them in case there is some legitimacy to them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TZhMaP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If a kid had told their parent about it and then the parent had posted it on Facebook, I think it could have taken on a similar kind of life”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zvka2e"&gt;And though letters to parents and statements from police list TikTok as the source of the alleged violence, Elgersma says the way this kind of information travels is likely less about platforms and functionality and more about the context and the type of threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gfp5vY"&gt;“I think in this case, if a kid had told their parent about it and then the parent had posted it on Facebook, I think it could have taken on a similar kind of life,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5iiHk"&gt;TikTok being seen as a mysterious new space for kids may have played a role, too. Walsh points out that panic around a medium — whether it’s a new app, or comic books, or heavy metal — predates the internet. With digital spaces specifically, Walsh says, there’s a fear that kids will parrot anything they see that could cause serious harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkaLBA"&gt;The viral nature of the supposed threats also made it difficult for local districts to know how to react. In Rapid City, South Dakota, public schools shut down after seeing a concerning message mentioning a “North Middle” School. “And so here at Rapid City, we have a North Middle School — and so does every state in the United States,” says James Johns, captain of criminal investigations at the Rapid City Police Department. The department eventually determined the message originated in another state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ns3yXd"&gt;Though there haven’t been reports of violence, some local news outlets report arrests made for potential threats or jokes. In Frederick County, Maryland, officials say a 13-year-old student confessed to making false threats against a middle school after seeing TikTok content. In &lt;a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2021/12/17/flagler-deputies-arrest-teen-accused-of-making-school-threat-on-tiktok-instagram/"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, police arrested a 13-year-old for social media posts on TikTok and Instagram that he said were a joke. Another 13-year-old was also arrested &lt;a href="https://www.ctinsider.com/news/article/Some-CT-schools-closed-after-TikTok-threats-spread-16709315.php"&gt;in Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; for threats made against a school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSA5er"&gt;TikTok said it searched but did not find any content promoting violence at schools today. It’s now working to remove “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22841431/tiktok-removes-school-violence-challenge-warnings"&gt;alarmist warnings&lt;/a&gt;” about potential shootings, saying the posts violate rules against misinformation. But videos referencing attacks still racked up millions of views, with kids, parents, teachers, and advocates expressing concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KcEDzN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you see a threat of violence against a school or any other public place posted on social media, immediately contact local law enforcement or your local &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FBI?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#FBI&lt;/a&gt; office. DO NOT share or forward the threat. Doing so can spread misinformation and cause panic. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ThinkBeforeYouPost?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ThinkBeforeYouPost&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/1v87a2DHMX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1v87a2DHMX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FBI Boston (@FBIBoston) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FBIBoston/status/1471888395894935562?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="II2sab"&gt;The best thing schools and officials can do, Elgersma says, is to give the public as much background as possible and to be clear that they’re erring on the side of caution but that threats aren’t credible. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FBIBoston/status/1471888395894935562"&gt;FBI’s Boston office on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; asked the public to refrain from forwarding or sharing threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yTptyZ"&gt;TikTok users say that though they didn’t see threats firsthand, the fear sparked by viral posts is very much real. Kantina Saunders, a mom of two who lives just outside of Cleveland, Ohio, hadn’t heard about the threats until she saw other parents posting letters they received last night. Then she got a note from her school superintendent this morning, saying that though threats were unfounded, the school was granting excused absences for those who wanted to stay home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfqRnG"&gt;For Saunders, who herself survived a school shooting at her high school in 2008, the letter brought on intense flashbacks and fear. In a TikTok she made after putting her kids on the bus, Saunders is crying — she couldn’t keep them home today because she has to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xQ8UK6"&gt;“I’ll feel a little better after they come home,” Saunders told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a text message. “But I probably won’t ever be ok with them going to school because I know what could happen at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>macOS 12.2 is getting a better Apple Music app, and you can test it now</title>

  &lt;p id="XtzuaH"&gt;With the introduction of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20902020/macos-catalina-review-apple-music-podcasts-catalyst-ipad-apps"&gt;macOS Catalina&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, Apple finally brought the reign of iTunes to an end by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647182/apple-itunes-podcasts-music-tv-mac-os-wwdc-2019"&gt;splitting its features into dedicated Podcasts, TV, and Music apps&lt;/a&gt;. There was just one problem — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18563328/apple-new-standalone-music-app-macos-15-itunes-uikit-macos"&gt;the new Music app isn’t really that different from iTunes&lt;/a&gt;, and even the new streaming elements render like web pages instead of natively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Si7GCk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;macOS 12.2 beta is now available, featuring smoother scrolling in Safari on the latest MacBook Pro with ProMotion, and a native Apple Music and TV experience backed by AppKit views instead of web views. &lt;a href="https://t.co/jjM9THIxFc"&gt;https://t.co/jjM9THIxFc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— wondrous hydra (@wondroushydra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wondroushydra/status/1471563658077503489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

While the iTunes-ish parts of the app remain the same, the word is that the Music and TV app now uses native AppKit views instead of web views, which should make everything run faster and be easier to use when you’re interacting with the streaming services. Searching for music or scrolling through content is where you may notice the most difference.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This cute EV off-road buggy concept arrived just in time for the weekend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NhrRFeRDcdWtGq3oOHzZDyVtiCo=/56x157:685x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70289405/fa187c25f5367570e88f750c09fb0417e8c1e9c7.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beep beep, I’m a buggy.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Citroën&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fjjY80"&gt;After pining after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783810/hyundai-grandeur-heritge-concept-ev-80s"&gt;Hyundai’s evil (in a good way) EV retro concept&lt;/a&gt;, a new concept vehicle has come to steal my heart from a company I can’t say I’ve heard of before. It’s the Citroën My Ami Buggy, a tiny battery-powered vehicle that looks like a smart car got really into backpacking, mountain-biking, or any number of fun weekend activities (shout out to &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/citroen-has-transformed-its-ami-ev-into-an-adorable-buggy-concept-123517763.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt; for bringing this into my life&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNWn24"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.media.stellantis.com/em-en/citroen/press/ready-for-adventure-citroen-my-ami-buggy-concept-embodies-ami-s-vision-of-leisure"&gt;Citroën says&lt;/a&gt; in its press release that the buggy is designed to be playful, something “that every child from the age of 14 to 77 would want to add to their Christmas list,” and says it took inspiration from “non-automotive worlds such as construction games, industrial design and fashion.” I can actually buy fashion — the roof-mounted spare tire is reminiscent of a jauntily tossed beret. Although I also can’t help but see it as a bulked-up version of one of those &lt;a href="https://www.deere.com/en/gator-utility-vehicles/full-size-crossover-gators/xuv835m-cab-utility-vehicle/"&gt;John Deere Gator utility trucks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iuvGIW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10936764"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qKs5n0"&gt;Citroën has many, many words to describe the car’s design, waxing lyrical about the removable and rollable zippered canvas doors, the “+” badge meant to signify the buggy’s EV-ness, and the black, yellow, and khaki color scheme meant to remind you of camping equipment. If I had any hope of this car becoming an actual thing you could buy (like a sort of chic version of the &lt;a href="https://www.subaru.com/vehicles/outback/wilderness.html"&gt;Subaru Outback Adventure&lt;/a&gt;), I might recommend reading all of it — but you’ll mostly get the vibe by watching the minute-long demo reel the company made for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DWHdGK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MuXIh2dTA8k?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3rGIfs"&gt;The My Ami Buggy is based on Citroën’s Ami, which is a city-focused EV that has an 8-horsepower motor, a top speed of 28 MPH, and just a touch over 40 miles of range, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/hands-on-citroen-ami-ev-133032057.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (That vehicle &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-19-citroen-ami-one-mini-ev.html"&gt;started out as a concept&lt;/a&gt; itself, so maybe there’s hope that I’ll get a buggy after all!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PbnN2"&gt;The Ami seems like it’s made to be rented out for short bursts of time like a Lime scooter, rather than something you’d want to go on road trips with or take on an off-road adventure. But if you make a concept and call it a buggy, I’m going to want to see someone try and send it up a sand dune, like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmBibFdMIRU"&gt;that one video every Subaru owner shows to their friends&lt;/a&gt; to prove they don’t need some lifted pickup (that probably couldn’t make it up the hill anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9EpH7"&gt;Who knows if it could actually do it, but it’s fun to think of all the tiny adventures you could go on with this sort of thing. How would you actually get it to the great outdoors without making a dozen charging stops? That’s the type of logical question better suited for Mondays. It’s the weekend — we’re dreaming of driving down to the river with some inflatable tubes in the back of the buggy or (perhaps more seasonably) strapping an apartment-sized Christmas tree that we cut down ourselves to the top. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7FVthy"&gt;Oh, and PS: as far as I can tell, the name My Ami isn’t a pun on Miami. If you have information to the contrary, though, please let me know (though I think I’d probably just be confused). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon driver was warned she’d be fired for returning with packages during a tornado</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ve4ra"&gt;An Amazon delivery driver in Illinois was told to keep delivering packages after she reported hearing tornado sirens, with the dispatcher saying that the sirens were “just a warning.” According to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-12-17/amazon-tornado-aftermath-workers-say-they-lacked-emergency-training"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which includes screenshots of the conversation, the driver was told that returning to the warehouse would be viewed as a route refusal, “which [would] ultimately end with you not having a job come tomorrow morning.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSAL3j"&gt;The conversation reportedly happened on Friday evening, around an hour and a half before a tornado &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829363/amazon-warehouse-tornado-collapse-edwardsville-illinois"&gt;hit an Amazon facility&lt;/a&gt; around 30 miles away from the driver. After being told twice to “just keep delivering,” the driver was eventually instructed to shelter in place “for 15-20 minutes, then continue as normal.” (The instructions to shelter in place were repeated several more times after.) The driver, expressing that a delivery van wouldn’t provide much safety, said she wanted to return to base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aBfy4g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you decide to come back, that choice is yours.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sxOUJa"&gt;The dispatcher’s response is harrowing: “If you decide to come back, that choice is yours. But I can tell you it won’t be viewed as for your own safety. The safest practice is to stay exactly where you are.” The dispatcher said drivers couldn’t be recalled unless Amazon directed it and that she would lose her job if she returned. The tornado ended up touching down near a highway, throwing cars in the air, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, though the driver involved in the text exchange is reported to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4sMjA"&gt;Amazon told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;that the dispatcher “should have immediately directed the driver to seek shelter” when they reported hearing the sirens and said that “under no circumstance should the dispatcher have threatened the driver’s employment.” The company says it’s investigating the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nnu7u"&gt;The Amazon facility wasn’t a safe haven either: a warehouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829363/amazon-warehouse-tornado-collapse-edwardsville-illinois"&gt;collapsed during the storm&lt;/a&gt;, leaving six workers dead. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports that the warehouse didn’t conduct drills to make sure people were prepared in case of an emergency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OASrW"&gt;The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has announced that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22833012/amazon-fatal-warehouse-collapse-osha-investigation-illinois-tornado"&gt;investigating the warehouse incident&lt;/a&gt;, and experts say that Amazon’s lack of action can be traced back to Amazon’s endless drive to please customers at all costs and a lack of policy that would legally obligate the company to send its workers home. The incident was cited by an Amazon shareholder that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22832447/amazon-shareholders-independent-audit-company-worker-treatment"&gt;filed a shareholder resolution&lt;/a&gt; calling for an independent audit of the company’s working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x6ufkM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Amazon warehouse policies put workers at risk","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22836393/amazon-warehouse-tornado-collapse-illinois-disaster"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5XPwie"&gt;Amazon drivers (who are often not direct employees of Amazon but instead work at companies contracted by the online commerce giant) have a history of being put in harm’s way to meet quotas. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423560/amazon-delivery-drivers-unsafe-reckless-driving-monitoring-app"&gt;there were reports&lt;/a&gt; of drivers being told to turn off the (often buggy, according to reviews) app used to make sure delivery workers were driving safely.&lt;/p&gt;
